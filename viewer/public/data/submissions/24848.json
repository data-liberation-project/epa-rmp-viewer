Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\n\nEnvironmental protection and enhancement are essential elements of DP&L's integrated resource management philosophy. DP&L exhibits progressive environmental leadership in managing its generating stations for the public benefit, including the production of reliable, competitively priced power. DP&L also assures that employees are aware of their environmental responsibilities, use effective environmental processes, and are held accountable for performance. \n\nDP&L management and employees will be responsible for maintaining compliance with environmental requirements and striving for environmental excellence in performing their respective duties. We will assure environmental protection and reduce risks to our employees and to the communities in which we operate through review of new developments, safe technologies, operating procedures, and emergency preparedness. All activities are conducted in accordance with current environmental and health and safety regulatory requirements.\n\nII. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe affected facility houses a selective catalytic reduction process to reduce the emissions of nitrogen oxides to the atmosphere.  The process contains an anhydrous ammonia storage facility, including four 67,000-gallon storage tanks with supporting unloading equipment, vapor compressors and liquid transfer pumps, piping to convey the liquid ammonia, vaporizers to convert ammonia from a liquid to a gas, and a gas dilution and injection system to inject ammonia into a selective catalytic reduction emission control system.\n\nThere is only one regulated substance at the facility - anhydrous ammonia. With four 67,000-gallon storage tanks, the maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia in the storage facility at any time is 1,200,000 pounds and the maximum amount contained in the largest single vessel is 300,000 pounds.\n\nIII."

      "SummaryText": "Summary of Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario were identified and analyzed to determine the distance to endpoint for each assumed release. To perform the required offsite consequence analysis for the facility, the conservative EPA RMP*Comp model was used. \n\nThe worst case release scenario involves the complete rupture of one 67,000-gallon storage tank. A maximum release of 300,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia over a 10-minute period was considered. The released quantity was not limited by a system of administrative controls. Under worst case meteorological conditions of Class F stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, ammonia could travel up to 6.1 miles before reaching the specified toxic endpoint level of 0.14 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative case release scenario involves the release of 700 pounds of ammonia from the rupture of the 2\u00bf ammonia feed line to the vaporizers. Under typical meteorological conditions of Class D stability and 3 m/s wind speed, ammonia could travel up to 0.2 miles before reaching the specified toxic end point level of 0.14 mg/L.\n\n \nIV. Description of Release Prevention Program\n\nProcess Safety Information - DP&L maintains documentation of safety information concerning chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs and specifications associated with the process.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis - DP&L conducted detailed analyses of the process to ensure that hazards associated with the process were identified and controlled effectively. The What-If analysis methodology was used to assess the potential hazards of the process. The study was conducted by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, control logic's, and process operations. Findings resulting from the analysis were addressed. The What-If analysis was conducted on March 27-29, 2001, a revalidation was conducted on September 6, 2001, and a pre-startup safety review was conducted on January 7, 2002"

If the release of chemical is substantial or clearly growing in size, the leak is no longer considered incidental and employees should not respond unless they are specifically trained in response procedures and the facility has an emergency response program that meets the requirements of 40 CFR 68.95. \n\nOSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.120(q)(1) states that \u00bfEmployers who will evacuate their employees from the danger area when an emergency occurs, and who do not permit any of their employees to assist in handling the emergency, are exempt from the requirements of this paragraph if they provide an emergency action plan in accordance with Section 1910.38(a) .  .  .\u00bf   This part of the standard describes the elements of an emergency action plan.  These are (1) emergency escape procedures and emergency escape route assignments; (2) procedures to be followed by employees who remain to operate critical plant operations before they evacuate; (3) procedures to account for all employees after emergency evacuation has been completed; (4) rescue and medical duties for those employees who are to perform them; (5) the preferred means of reporting fires and other emergencies; and (6) names or regular job titles of persons or departments who can be contacted for further information or explanation of duties under the plan.\n\nDP&L has an emergency action (not response) plan in place to address and react to accidental releases of hazardous materials.

The information is readily available to operators and maintenance personnel involved in the process and the information is periodically reviewed to assure it is current.\n\nTraining - DP&L's training program is implemented to ensure all levels of employees receive training on the process and are knowledgeable of the potential hazards involved. The employees are provided with refresher training at least every three years.\n\nMechanical Integrity - DP&L conducts maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure safe and reliable operations. Process equipment routinely checked includes: storage tanks and pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and venting systems, controls and pumps, emergency shutdown systems, and monitoring devices. Maintenance operations conducted on the covered process are performed by qualified employees. Equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are prioritized and corrected.\n\nManagement of Change - DP&L maintains written procedures that are updated to reflect equipment or process modifications. Employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification are apprised of it and provided training to address it.\n\nPre-Startup Review - A pre-startup safety review was conducted prior to the startup of the new process. Established pre-startup safety review procedures will assure that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for a safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits - DP&L will conduct audits of the risk management plan at least every three years.

Five Year Accident History \n\nThe ammonia facility is a new facility and thus does not have an accident history.\n\nVI. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Part 68 rule distinguishes between those facilities which will respond to accidental releases of regulated substances and those which will not.  The requirements for non-responding facilities are covered in Section 68.90 of the rule.  To determine whether a facility is a responding one, the EPA interpretation of response is commonly used.  It is the definition of response used in the OSHA HAZWOPER standard in 29 CFR 1910.120(a)(3).  \n\nThe standard defines \u00bfresponse\u00bf as \u00bfa response effort by employees from outside the immediate release area or by other designated responders \u00bf to an occurrence which results, or is likely to result, in an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance.\u00bf  This definition specifically excludes responses to incidental releases, which are those \u00bfwhere the substance can be absorbed, neutraliz"
