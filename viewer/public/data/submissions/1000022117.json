Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Coca-Cola Refreshments Auburndale, Florida facility is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated ammonia refrigeration.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of ammonia.  If such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with the Polk County Fire Services and the Polk County LEPC for emergency response support.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThis facility primarily produces juice and fruit drink products.  The only Risk Management Program (RMP) regulated substance present is ammonia, utilized as the primary cooling media in our two closed-loop refrigeration system.  Here is a summary of our RMP activity since year 2003:\n\nA?    Late 2003 - The original ammonia refrigeration system was installed at the facility, however, below the RMP reporting threshold.\nA?    January 2006 - The system was upgraded and additional ammonia introduced into the system at a total quantity above the RMP threshold, thus requiring the submittal of the original RMP (17,430 lbs).  \nA?    June 2007 - The RMP was updated due to increased inventory (21,000 lbs).\nA?    July 2009 - A third RMP was submitted due to increased inventory (35,500 lbs) and changes in plant personnel.\nA?    May 2011 - A forth RMP is being submitted due to the addition of a second anhydrous ammonia system (System II) that contains 18,100 lbs of ammonia, change in plant personnel, and a newly conducted PHA.  System II is not"

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68.  Our facility is also subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119, as well as the EPCRA Section 302 and 311/312 notification/reporting requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention program that are in place at our facility.\n\nProcess Safety Management\n\nThe Coca-Cola Refreshments facility maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our ammonia refrigeration system are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If Scenarios.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in refrigeration engineering and process operations, and are re-evaluated at a minimum of every five (5) years.  Any findings related to the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purpose of safely conducting activities related to our ammonia refrigeration system, Coca-Cola Refreshments maintains written operating procedures.
