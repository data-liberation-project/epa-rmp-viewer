As a result, accidental release prevention and emergency response policies have been instituted which include: operating and maintenance procedures; training and incident investigation programs for handling chlorine; notification of key plant personnel during an emergency; immediately available SCBA and protective equipment to be used only by trained personnel; an on-site emergency response plan and procedures for notification of local emergency planning individuals in the event local emergency response is needed.\n         The worst-case release scenario as described in this program is the release of the entire contents of a one-ton liquid chlorine container in ten minutes, or 200 lb/min. Since all the on-site chlorine containers are enclosed in a building, the release rate has been reduced to 110 lb/min. For the worst case scenario, a wind speed of 1.5 meters/sec. and an atmospheric stability class F was used. Using a combination of local data and an approved modeling program, the distance to the Toxic Endpoint Limit (TEL) for a worst-case chlorine release was determined to be 2.02 miles.\n         The Alternative Release Scenario as described in this program was based on a chlorine container isolation valve stem failure. A release rate of 0.29 lb/min., a windspeed of 4.2 meters/sec., and an atmospheric stability class D was used. This data, when modeled, produced no off-site impact.\n         The dispersion modeling for both scenarios was conducted using the SLABVIEW Program, Version 1.5 and site-specific information.\n         The chlorine-specific accidental release prevention program steps in place at the facility provide written procedures that incorporate operational and maintenance data and training procedures for dependable use of relief valves, leak detection systems, shut-off systems, and alarms. Mitigation systems in use include complete enclosure of"
