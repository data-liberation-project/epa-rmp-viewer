Plymouth Tube is committed to ensuring that HF is stored and handled in a safe manner.  We have conducted hazard reviews of the HF process to ensure that our installations are in  compliance with Federal, state, and local codes, standards, and generally accepted good engineering practice and reviewed maintenance and operating procedures to enhance safety.  Employees and contractors who are involved in storing and handling HF have been trained in safe storage and handling procedures.\r\n\r\nIn case of an accidental release of HF, it is Plymouth Tube?s policy to notify the LEPC of East Troy, and Onyx so that they can respond to the emergency.  Plymouth Tube has procedures in place to notify the appropriate emergency services in case of an accident release.\r\n\r\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of Plymouth Tube?s East Troy, Wisconsin facilities is to manufacture stainless steel tube of varying diameters and lengths.  Stainless steel sheet stock is formed, rolled and welding into tubing.  In order to pickle the finished tube, lengths of tubing are dipped into a solution of HF (2-5%), Nitric Acid and water.  After picking, the tubing is inspected, rinsed and bundled for shipping.  There is one HF (70% by weight) storage tank within the site.  The Plant 3 (Energy Drive) HG storage tank is 6,300 gallons in capacity and is located outside the south-west corner of the building.\r\n\r\nThe RMP regulated substance at the East Troy, Wisconsin facility is Hydrofluoric Acid (70% by weight).\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\r\n\r\nPlymouth Tube?s facilities are in compliance with the USEPA?s Accidental Release Prevention Rule (40 CFR 68).  The HF equipment was installed according to"
