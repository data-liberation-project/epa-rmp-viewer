Bi-annual inspections and maintenance are required on all storage facilities, loading and unloading facilities, application equipment and portable tanks.  All employees who handle anhydrous ammonia are required to attend bi-annual training which emphas the properties of anhydrous ammonia, the affects of anhydrous ammonia on the human body, operating procedures, emergency procedures, and emergency first aid.  PPE, including gloves, goggles, hard hats, emergency water, and sturdy work cloths & shoes are required whenever handling anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, this facility is prepared to work with local fire departments, LEPCA\u00bfs, law enforcement, or other authorities to mitigate the impact of the release to people and the environment.  \r\n\r\nFACILITY INFORMATION:\r\nThe primary activity at this facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmer customers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck and kept in (a) storage tank(s) until distributed to customers in mobile nurse tanks for use as a nitrogen fertilizer.  The storage tank(s), several anhydrous ammonia nurse tanks, risers for filling the nurse tanks, pumps and controls, lighting and safety equipment are all part of the facilities anhydrous ammonia operation.  The facility is staffed during seasonal operating hours, and is secured when not in operation.  Security includes area lighting, closing and locking the main valve (belly valve) from the storage tank(s), locking out power to pumps, closing fill hose end valves and locking them in a box that prevents unauthorized access to them, locking nurse tank unloading valves, and walk-thru inspections.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\r\nThis facility has implemented the provisions of A\u00bfSafety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61-1A\u00bf publish"

Annual inspections by Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship (IDALS) are made on facilities and portable nurse tanks.  Frequent site inspections are made by management and safety consultants.  Equipment  inspections, maintenance and employee training are conducted prior to every application season.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\r\nOn July 29, 2014 there was a release beleived to have been the result of vandalism or attempted theft.  Off site agencies responded to the event that resulted in minor damage approximately four acres of soybean in an adjacent field.  There were no injuries resulting from the release.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\r\nThis facility has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38.  The facility has also provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA), and has coordinated with local emergency responders.  \r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\r\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at this facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to asses the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implantation at this time."
