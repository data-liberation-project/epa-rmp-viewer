All applicable procedures of 40CFR68 are addressed in the plan. The Water Treatment Plant for the City of Rome is located at #1 Blossom Hill Drive, Rome, Georgia 30161.  The WTP uses chlorine (regulataed substance # 7782-50-5 in its water treatment disinfection process.  The City Water Dept serves customers for all of the City of Rome and certain areas of Floyd County.  The City withdraws water from the Oostanaula and Etowah Rivers.\n\n\n\nThe City`s Risk Management Program addresses specific actions the City will take to prevent accidental releases of chlorine into the atmosphere and reduce the potential impact on the public health and the environment.  The specific actions include the development and implementation of a program containing the following dey elements:\n\n\n\n*  Off-site consequence analysis\n\n*  5 -year accident history\n\n*  A management system to oversee and implement the program\n\n*  A prevention program that includes:\n\n   Chlorine safety information\n\n   Operating Procedures\n\n   Employee Training\n\n   Preventative Maintence\n\n   Incident Investigation\n\n   Compliance Audits\n\n   Hazard Reviews\n\n   An Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe City of Rome`s senoir management is strongly committed to safety.  The City of Rome`s existing Loss Prevention Program requires that all accidents be reported as to the cause, and the corrective action taken to prevent future accidents.  Accidents are reviewed by the supervisor ,safety officer, and department head to insure that accidents are addressed appropriately.  Unsafe conditions reports are also available to  all employees to ensure that all safety related matters, including chlorine, are given the highest priority.  Any accident involving chlorine requires a chlorine specific investigation in addition to the requirement of the loss pr"

      "SummaryText": "evention program.\n\n\n\nThe City of Rome maintains a Prevention Program that addresses basic, sound prevention practices.  Safety information includes general chlorine properties and hazards, a MSDS, and established maximum intended inventory, safe upper and lower parameters for piping, and equipment specifications including the Codes and standards used to design, build and operate the process.  Operational procedures for startup, shutdown, and temporary, emergency, and normal operations are in place and are revised as necessary to keep the program current.  Hazard Review and program audit processes are in place to verify compliance with the program.  A training program covering basic chlorine safety, responder notification, SCBA use, and operating procedures is in  place and ongoing.\n\n\n\nThere were no reportable accidents in the past five years.  Minor incidents have been investigated, documented, and corrective action taken to prevent future problems.\n\n\n\nThere were no major hazards noted during the hazard review.  \n\n\n\nThe Rome WTP is a non-responding facility.  A response to a chlorine release at the WTP is covered by the Rome-Floyd  County emergency Management Agency and the Rome-Floyd County Fire Department is designated as the first responder.  The Rome-Floyd County Fire Department once notified, shall coordinate all release mitigation procedures and public notification.  A written notification and evacuation plan has been developed at the WTP to expedite this process."
