This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility's processes. The Chesapeake policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\r\nChesapeake operates the Kermit Compressor Station located in Mingo County, West Virginia. This facility receives dehydrated feed gas where it is cooled by heat exchange with propane refrigerant.  Condensate, or heavier ends in the gas, are separated from the inlet stream.  It is then stabilized, treated and stored in a 30,000 gal storage tank and ultimately loaded into tank trucks for sales. The resultant gas is compressed and sent via pipeline to other end users. The Kermit Compressor Station does not use or store any regulated toxic substances above the EPA set threshold levels. This facility is classified as a Program Level 3 facility.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History:\r\nThe Kermit Compressor Station has not had any accidental releases during the past five years that meet the criteria for an accidental release as discussed in 40 CFR 68.42.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Kermit Compressor Station.
