In case a release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release on people and the environment.\n\nWe are located in the small town of Richwood, Ohio.  Our business is selling fertilizer, pesticides, seeds, and other related items to the farmers in our surrounding area.  We also provide custom application of fertilizer and pesticides to farms owned by our customers.  We have employees who are well versed in the safe handling of all our hazardous materials.  Any new employees are trained by management plus are are given on-the-job training by experienced employees.\n\nWe have two 18,000 gallon and one 12,000 gallon storage tanks for anhydrous ammonia and several mobile tanks (1000 gallon capacity) on wagons.  We do not mix or react the ammonia with any other chemical.  We receive all of our ammonia by truck; the incoming trucks are unloaded by the truck drivers with their equipment according the DOT and other regulations.  The truck drivers are well trained.\n\nWe have had no accidents in the last five years.  We have a safe history of handling anhydrous ammonia.  Our employees recognize the potential dangers of unsafe handling of ammonia and thus treat it very carefully.\n\nWe operate our anhydrous ammonia installation under the rules and regulations of the Ohio Department of Agriculture.  Their representative inspects our operation annually and lists any deficiencies in the operation.  Any defiencies are immediately corrected.  Normally, very few are found.  \nWe inspect our ammonia tanks and piping prior to each session of use.  Also as our employees are loading ammonia from the storage tanks to the mobile tanks, they are visually looking for any problems which might potentially occur.\n\nWe believe that a hands on training is the best training f"

Annually, the Ohio Agribusinnes Association puts on a one day training seminar on Safe Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.  We often send employees to attend this seminar.\nWe have an annual Right-To-Know trianing session and we cover anhydrous ammonia along with other hazardous materials.  We do emphasize the use personal protective equipment and the inspection of tanks, piping, hoses, and wagons.\n\nWe have an Emergency Action Plan and a Safety book with spell out actions to be taken in case of spills or release of any material, including anhydrous ammonia.  We will call the local Fire Department and the county emergency coordinator in the case of any spill which creates a danger to people or the environment.  In the case of an ammonia release, we will also call the state EPA and The National Response Center.\n\nWe do not have Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus respirators on hand and thus cannot approach leaks of ammonia unless the mist or vapor is very lowly concentrated.  We will call the Fire Department first thing is case of a release.  We will cooperate in any way possible with local and county personnel in any exercises which might help us be prepared for an emergency."
