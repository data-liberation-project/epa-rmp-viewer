(MarkWest) - Siloam facility located in South Shore, Kentucky is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers such areas as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is the policy of MarkWest to implement appropriate controls to prevent the possible release of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, MarkWest is completely coordinated with the Greenup County, Kentucky and Scioto County, Ohio Local Emergency Planning Committees (LEPCs) which provide emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substance Handled\n\nThe primary function of the MarkWest facility encompasses processing, storage, and wholesale distribution of various liquified petroleum gases (LPGs).  The following LPGs are present at the facility: propane, normal butane, isobutane, natural gasoline (pentanes and hexanes), and mixed feed natural gas liquids (a combination of all the previously mentioned LPGs commonly referred to as Y-grade).  All of these substances are regulated due to their flammable and explosive nature.  \n\nThe facility receives the mixed feed Y-grade from pipeline, tank truck, and rail car.  The Y-grade is stored in above ground vessels and then processed at the facility into propane, normal butane, isobutane, and natural gasoline.  These products are stored in both above ground vessels and also, in the case of propane and normal butane, in underground caverns.\n\nThese products are then distributed from the facility by tank truck, rail car, and, in the case of normal butane, isobutane, and natural ga"

The worst case and alternative case radii of effect were determined utilizing RMP*Comp software provided by the EPA.  The following describes details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case scenario for Program 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from the underground propane storage cavern.  The scenario involves the release of the entire quantity of the cavern, approximately 8.2 million gallons (34.44 million pounds) of propane.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions (wind speed of 3.4 miles per hour), the maximum distance of 2.63 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 pound per square inch (psi) overpressure. \n\nUtilizing Landview III and Marplot software, the worst case scenario radius of 2.63 miles is illustrated in the graphic file siloamwc.jpg (electronic version) and in the attached map (provided in non-electronic versions only).  Major industrial facilities located within this radius include North American Refractories, New Boston Coke, and OSCO Industries.  Residential areas located within the radius include South Shore, Kentucky, New Boston, Ohio, and portions of Portsmouth and Sciotoville, Ohio.  Based on Landview III 1990 census data utilizing the block group proration method, 2,544 households and 6,353 people are located within the 2.63 mile radius.  Finally, eight schools are located within the 2.63 mile radius: Mckinley Middle, Highland Elementary, Wilson Elementary, Oak Street Elementary, Glenwood High, Stanton Elementary, Mckell Middle, and Mckell Elementary.\n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances involves a release from one of the vessels in the propane storage process.

The scenario involves the release of the entire quantity of the vessel, approximately 51,936 gallons (218,132 lbs) of propane (this quantity is 90% of the entire available capacity of the vessel).  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in the vapor cloud explosion.

No major industrial or residential areas are located within this radius.  No schools are located in this area.  The radius of effect of this alternative release scenario would remain within the boundaries of MarkWest-owned property. \n\n4.\tThe General Accident Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention \n\tSteps\n\nMarkWest has taken all the necessary steps to comply with accidental release prevention requirements sets out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA regulations.

Any findings related to the hazard analyses are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purpose of safely conducting activities within covered processes, MarkWest maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial start up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and startup after turn around.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the process.\n\nTraining\n\nMarkWest has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that the employees operating processes are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with the processes.  New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe integrity of mechanical operations at MarkWest is ensured through documented maintenance checks on process equipment.  Process equipment examined by these checks include among others: pressurized storage vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at MarkWest to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nMarkWest conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the  provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out every three years as required by RMP regulations (40 CFR 68.58) and any corrections required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and timely manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nMarkWest investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident, as well as any corrective actions needed to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a period of five years.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nMarkWest believes that successful PSM and accident prevention programs require a team effort.  Company employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, MarkWest employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP program, in particular, information relating to and resulting from process hazard analyses. \n\nContractors\n\nPeriodically, MarkWest hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.

The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including medical treatment, evacuations, and notification of local emergency response agencies and the public.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nThe Scioto County, Ohio and the Greenup County, Kentucky LEPC's are the local emergency response agencies with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\n\n7.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety  \n\nOne major development has resulted from the implementation of the various elements of this accidental release program: modification of the tank car loading area.
