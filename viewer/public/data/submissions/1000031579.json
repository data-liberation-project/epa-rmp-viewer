For example, Hawkins supplies bleach used in disinfection at food processors and health facilities.  Among our disinfection chemicals is chlorine which is regulated by the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) and OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM).\r\n\r\nAccident prevention is achieved through handling procedures that properly protect chemicals during shipping, storage and use.  This starts with DOT approved cylinders that are robustly designed to contain chemicals through all conditions expected during processing as well as mishandling that could cause a cylinder to fall or shift during transport.  It continues through having employees trained in proper handling procedures, and they are provided with equipment to safely move chemicals during storage and transportation.  Adherence to OSHA workplace rules is just another part of our safety program.\r\n\r\nWe also follow industry standards, such as those of the Chlorine Institute, to ensure that our equipment and procedures are protective of the health and safety of our employees, neighbors, and the environment.\r\n\r\nAs a result of our diligence, there has not"

If a larger accident should occur, Hawkins employees are trained to call in the local fire department who is familiar with our operations.
