Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\n\n\nIt is the policy of Carpenter Co. to comply fully with all federal, state, and local rules and regulations regarding the proper handling, use, storage, and emergency response preparedness to prevent accidental release of chemicals toxic or otherwise.  Carpenter Co. is committed to protecting the health and welfare of both its employees and community residents.\n\n\n\nFogelsville Division makes all effort not to have an accidental release by having:\n\na.  Training and testing program\n\nb.  Safety check sheets\n\nc.  Equipment inspections\n\n\n\nFor emergency response the company has in place:\n\na.  Emergency Action Plan: integrates procedures for PPC, SPR, RMP, SPCC, EPCRA, CERCLA, RCRA, HAZWOPER.\n\nb.  Evacuation plan\n\nc.  Chemical spill procedures\n\nd.  Fire response procedures\n\ne.  First aid and CPR training\n\n\n\n2.  Stationary source and regulated substance handled\n\n\n\nCarpenter Co., Fogelsville Division contains two manufacturing facilities built on 34.65 acres and is accessed from Olin Way on the west side of the property.  Carpenter Co. is located in Fogelsville, PA, south of Route 78 and East of Route 100 and is surrounded by an industrial neighborhood.\n\n\n\nThe main building, located at 57A Olin Way, contains a prime foam line.  The prime foam line converts raw materials into polyurethane foam, primarily used in bedding and furniture applications.  The polyurethane process uses Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI).  TDI is stored in two steel storage tanks inside the building, containing up to 1,190,000 pounds (117,000 gallons) of TDI.  The tanks are located in a cement containment pit that can hold 157,000 gallons.  TDI is shipped primarily via railcar, which contains approximately 190,000 lbs.  The covered process is assigned a Program Level 1.\n\n\n\nThe second building, located at 57B Olin Way, manufactures expanded polystyrene (EPS).  The EPS building does not contain any chemicals above the thre"

      "SummaryText": "shold requirement for RMP.\n\n\n\n3.  Worst case scenario and alternative release scenario\n\n\n\nLosing the entire contents of a TDI railcar (190,000 lbs) would be the worst case release.  If this happens the contents would be contained in a 14' x 87' diked area surrounding the rail tracks.  The diked area is large enough to contain a full railcar.  The endpoint distance is equal to 91 feet.  The nearest fence line is 141 feet away.  A worst case spill would remain onsite.  No alternative release scenario is required for the Program Level 1 covered process.\n\n\n\n4.  General accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\n\n\n\nTo prevent an accidental release, the following are implemented:\n\na.  Procedural\n\n1.  Back-up chemical unloading\n\n2.  Check-off lists\n\n3.  Visual observation while unloading\n\nb.  Training\n\n1.  Hands on training and test\n\n2.  Video training\n\n3.  Unload training documentation\n\n\n\n5.  Five-year accident history\n\n\n\nDuring the last five years no TDI related incidents were recorded.\n\n\n\n6.  Emergency response program\n\n\n\nCarpenter Co. has an Emergency Action Plan.  Telephone numbers of all agencies we expect to respond are in the Emergency Action Plan.  The following have received a copy of our Emergency Action Plan:\n\na.  Lehigh County Emergency Services\n\nb.  Upper Macungie Township Fire Marshall\n\nc.  Station 56 Fire Department\n\nd.  Fogelsville Fire Department\n\ne.  Goodwill Fire Department\n\nf.  PA DEP Northeast Regional Office\n\ng.  Upper Macungie Police Department\n\nh.  PA State Police \n\nCarpenter Co. has a coordination agreement with the Clean Harbors (Nationwide Emergency Response) for environmental incidents we cannot handle.  Our in house Haz Mat Team members are First Responder Operational certified.  Safety meetings are held monthly.  Evacuation drills are conducted annually.  Managers and supervisors are trained in first aid and CPR.  The local Fire Department will be asked to handle public notification if it becomes necessary."
