Due to the quantity of toxic and flammable chemicals stored at the facility, the G2O Centreville Plant is subject to the USEPA's Risk Management Program.  The purpose of the Risk Management Program is to prevent or reduce the severity of an accidental release of a hazardous chemical.  Among the requirements of the Risk Management Program is the submission of a Risk Management Plan (RMP) summarizing the overall program.  The following information is an Executive Summary of the information contained in the Risk Management Program.  This Executive Summary includes a description of G2O Centreville Plant accidental release prevention and safety policies, a facility and process description, an explanation of the accidental release scenarios studied, a five-year accident history, and details of the G2O Centreville Plant accidental release prevention program.\n\n2.0 \tAccidental Release Prevention Policies\nThe G2O Centreville Plant  takes great care to ensure the safety of its employees and the surrounding community.  The G2O Centreville Plant  policies and safety programs are stressed in all aspects of the facility operations.  The safety program provides rules and guidance for safe working methods in the operation and maintenance of the facility.  It includes the required personnel protective equipment, safe work practices including lockout and tagout, hot work permitting, confined space entry, line entry, forklift operation, and safe handling of flammable and toxic chemicals.  Employees are trained in the safe operation of the facility.\n\n3.0 \tFacility and Process Description\nThe G2O Centreville Plant  in Centreville, MS, manufactures polymers for use in the water treatment industry.\n\n4.0 \tRegulated Substances Present\nFormaldehyde, epichlorohydrin, dimethylamine are the substances used at the G2O Centre"

The regulations define the worst case release as the loss of the entire maximum inventory of the largest tank or vessel.  The regulations require that the offsite impact of the worst case release scenario be calculated using very conservative, worst case weather conditions.  USEPA has published Risk Management Planning software to determine the offsite distance an accidental release would travel.  The G2O Centreville Plant  used the methods described in \"Risk Management Program Guidance For Offsite Consequence Analysis\", EPA April 1999, to calculate worst case release scenario offsite impact distances.  This included the use of RMP*Comp to determine worst and alternate case endpoints and MARPLOT to determine the number of potentially affected persons.\n\nThe G2O Centreville Plant  also used those procedures to calculate the offsite impact distances for alternate, more realistic accidental release scenarios for both toxic and flammable substances.  These alternate release scenarios took into consideration safety systems and controls in place to reduce the severity of an accidental release and to consider a more realistic release rate.  The alternate releases considered resulted from a hose rupture caused by a pull-away during tank filling.\n\n6.0\tAccidental Release Prevention Program\nThe G2O Centreville Plant's  accident prevention program includes each of the elements required by the Risk Program Management Program regulations.\n\n6.1\tProcess Safety Information\nThe G2O Centreville Plant  has gathered the necessary documentation of safety information on the covered processes including the maximum/minimum pressure, operating temperature, inventories in covered tanks, tank and piping m"

The results of the review were used to determine the appropriate safeguards needed to prevent failures or errors that could lead to an accidental release.\n\n6.3\tOperating Procedures\nWritten operating procedures have been developed for plant operations.  The purpose of the written operating procedures is to make sure that prior to operating a process, each employee is knowledgeable of the correct operating methods, is aware of the chemical hazards present,  and is qualified to respond correctly in an emergency situation.\n\n6.4\tTraining\nNew employees are trained in the safe operation of plant processes and their performance is periodically evaluated.  As needed, refresher training is provided.  Employees are given safety training and are trained in the emergency response procedures discussed in Section 8.0.\n\n6.5\tMaintenance\nWritten maintenance procedures and training guide the safe work practices of maintenance employees and ensure that they are made aware of the potential hazards of the plant processes.  A hot work permitting program, lockout-tagout procedures, line entry, and confined space entry procedures have been put in place to protect maintenance workers while servicing equipment.  Preventive maintenance inspections and testing are scheduled based on manufacturer recommendations so that aging equipment can be replaced before failing and possibly causing an accidental release.\n\n7.0\tFive-Year Accident History\nNo serious accidents with off site impa"

      "SummaryText": "ct have occurred at the G2O Centreville Plant in the last five years.  An employee did experience a minor chemical burn on his foot when a scrubber for a reactor was undergoing maintenance.  As the top of the scrubber was removed, a very small amount of liquid drained from the vent of the scrubber and splashed onto the operator's safety-toed leather boot.  Unfortunately the employee did not wash his foot off until several hours later not realizing that material had contacted his foot.  The employee later that evening decided on his own to go to the Emergency Room to be evaluated.  Despite the minor impact from this incident, the treating doctor at the Emergency Room prescribed a burn cream and an anti-inflammatory medication.\n\n8.0\tEmergency Response Coordination\nThis facility has satisfied the requirement that employees will respond to the release of regulated substances in a defensive manner to mitigate exposure to personnel and the surrounding community. The G2O Centreville Plant personnel will coordinate response actions with local emergency responders.\n\n9.0\tPlanned Future Safety Enhancements\nPlanned safety enhancements at the G2O Centreville Plant include the continued development of the facility's preventive maintenance program using a new Maintain X software program along with ongoing safety training of current employees and new employee orientation.  These programs will continue to ensure the safety of employees and the community."
