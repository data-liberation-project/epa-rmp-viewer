FACILITY RMP PLAN\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nLDEQ Facility # 22353\n\nCOMPANY OVERVIEW\n\nVan Waters & Rogers Inc. is a wholesale chemical distributor serving a number of U.S. industries.  Founded in 1924, VW&R supplies the food industry, chemical compounders, pharmaceuticals, mining, forest products, oil and gas producers, electronics, coatings and many other key industries with the chemical raw materials required to produce or refine products used in numerous end-use markets.\n\nVan Waters & Rogers Inc. is a member of the National Association of Chemical distributors (NACD) and complies with the Responsible Distribution Process (RDP), an environmental, health and safety improvement initiative.\n\nSome of the products stored and handled by VW&R are subject to EPA's Risk Management Program rule (40 CFR Part 68).  A key requirement of this rule is the preparation and submission of an RMP Plan, contained herein.  The contents of the RMP Plan are prescribed by EPA, including this Executive Summary.\n\nCORPORATE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE APPROACH\n\n1. Prevention Program\n\nProcesses that are subject to OSHA's Process Safety management (PSM) standard AND are regulated under EPA's RMP rule are subject to the Program 3 Prevention program.  Van Waters & Rogers Inc. has documented the Prevention Program in its Process Safety Management Manual.  Briefly, this program includes provisions and requirements for:\n\n* Process Safety Information\n* Process Hazard Analysis\n* Operating Procedures\n* Training\n* Mechanical Integrity\n* Management of Change\n* Pre-Startup Review\n* Compliance Audits\n* Incident Investigation\n* Employee Participation\n* Hot Work permits\n* Contractors\n\n2. Emergency Response Approach\n\nVan Waters & Rogers Inc. has an Emergency Contingency Plan in place.  This Plan is shared with local emergency responders who have access to VW&R facility personnel (and up-to-date phone numbers).  VW&R responds to minor incidents but will call in professional"

Joint emergency exercises are conducted when possible.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Chemical Repackaging, Storage & Distribution.  We have one regulated substance present at our facility.  The substance is Ammonia Aqueous 30%.\n \nListed below is the way the RMP regulated substance is stored/handled on site and the maximum inventory present at any one time.\n\n1. Ammonia Aqueous 30% is received in bulk by tank truck and off loaded into a 10,000 gal storage tank. The Ammonia Aqueous is then repackaged into 55 gal and 330 gal containers and moved into storage for distribution to our end use customers. In addition to the repackaging of smaller containers we also load tank trucks from our 10,000 gal storage tank for distribution to our end use customers. The estimated maximum inventory of Ammonia Aqueous 30% onsite at any one time will be 173,560 lbs for bulk storage tank and warehouse container storage combined. \n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO & ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n(including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.)\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenarios submitted for Program 2 and 3 substances as a class involves separate catastrophic releases from each of the RMP substances in inventory onsite. The RMP substance is assumed to be immediately released to form a pool of 1 cm height, from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated over 10 minutes. By us"

Worse Case Scenario release of 22,440 lbs Ammonia Aqueous 30%, the maximum distance of 0.3 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of .14 mg/L.\n\n2. Alternate Case Scenario release of 448 lbs Ammonia Aqueous 30%, the maximum distance of <0.1 miles is obtained under normal operating conditions using active mitigation of onsite Emergency Personnel and Equipment.  Atmospheric Class D stability and 3m/s wind speed was used  \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.  A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nVan Waters & Rogers Inc maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the What-If technique. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safe"

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\n\nVan Waters & Rogers Inc has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every year and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nVan Waters & Rogers Inc carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Van Waters & Rogers Inc to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.
