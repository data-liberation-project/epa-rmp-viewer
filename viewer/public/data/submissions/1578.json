      "SummaryText": "1. Facility Policy:  The management and employees of Danvers Farmers Elevator are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equiptment, routine inspections and maintenance and training of all persons that work with the material. Should an accidental release occur, the Danvers Farmers Elevator has orientated the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to the population of the surrounding area and to the enviroment. The primary function at this facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The maximum amount stored would be 390,000 pounds in the facility's three(3) storage tanks.  Each of the facility's 3 tanks are 30,000 gallons tanks with a capacity of 136,000 pounds at 85% full.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tanks, released as a gas over ten minutes.  The maximum amount released would be 390,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tanks at 85% capacity, as set by design standards and company procedures.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion based on the model used is 8.9 miles.  The alternative-case scenario is assumed to be a release from the rupture of a 1.25 inch transfer hose, with 26,700 pounds released over a two minute period.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion is 2.2 miles.  This facility complies with the rules and regulations relating to the handling of anhydrous ammonia and low pressure nitrogen solutions, equiptment, containers, and storage facilities.  These regulations administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture are consistent with ANSI K61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  Our five(5) year accidental release is"

This facility has a written emergency plan in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and does provide state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III of EPCRA.  Our emergency response action plan has been reviewed with the local fire department and provided to the local emergency planning committee for coordination in the community response planning.  Our safety improvements are on on-going process at the Danvers Farmers Elevator. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess  the maintenance of safe practices and operations.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
