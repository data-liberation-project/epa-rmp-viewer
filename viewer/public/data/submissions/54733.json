Should an accidental release occur, this facility has worked with the local fire department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) so they can plan for response to a release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nXL Four Star Beef Inc. is a beef slaughter and processing facility. The Plant is defined by the EPA as a ?Complex Slaughter? facility. Final products produced include: meat  products, inedible tallow, blood meal and meat and bone meal. The regulated substance used at this facility that meets threshold quantities is anhydrous ammonia. Ammonia is used as a manufacturing aid in the refrigeration process. Refrigeration is used in processing and storing of meat and meat products.\n\nAll refrigeration maintenance personnel go through training on all of the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP?s) from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) program. These procedures are to be reviewed yearly to help insure that they are accurate and correct. The Preventative Maintenance program is to be periodically reviewed and updated as the monitoring and repair on equipment is performed.\nThe facility has developed a worst-case and alternative scenario, however, it has been withheld from this  Executive Summary as security-sensitive information as requested by the EPA.\nThere have been no releases at this plant in the past 5 years that have resulted in death, injuries, or property damage onsite or in death, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage offsite. \nEmergency Planning and Community Right to Know (EPCRA) information is provided to the state emergency response commission,"
