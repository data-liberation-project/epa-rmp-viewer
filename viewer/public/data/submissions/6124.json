              "Description": "\nVWR has compiled information that is necessary for safe handling and storage of regulated chemical products.  This information includes:\n\n* Material safety data sheets (MSDSs) for each regulated chemical.  (This information is available electronically or as a hard copy.  Most MSDSs were last revised in 1998;\n* Maximum intended inventory of equipment in which regulated chemicals are stored.  (i.e., the maximum intended container size is 55 gallons.);\n* Acceptable storage temperatures and conditions. (Special conditions -- Ethyl ether to be stored in flammable storage room at room temperature.  Acids to be stored separately from ammonium hydroxide.);\n* Equipment use and maintenance specifications (Use and maintenance specifications for forklifts, storage rack, and other equipment are maintained on file at the facility.);\n* Codes and standards used to design and build the facility - NFPA 30-1993 (Flammable & Combustible Liquids), NFPA 231 (Standards for General Storage) and NFPA 231c (Standards for Rack Storage Materials).  The Flammable Storage Room (\"red room\") has been designed to the 1994 Uniform Fire Code.  Sprinkler and drain pipes have been installed with earthquake shock absorbers and buffers between pipes at building wall connections according to local building codes.\n\n\nHazard Review\n\nThe hazards associated with the regulated chemicals are:\n\n* Corrosivity\n* Flammability\n* Toxicity\n\nVWR periodically reviews and audits its operations to identify and control potential hazards.  The most recent hazard review was completed June 21, 1999.  The review was conducted using, as a guide, the Chemical Manufacturer Association's Warehouse Assessment Protocol.  This document is cited, in EPA's guidance document Risk Management Program for Warehouses (40 CFR Part 68, as providing a suitable framework for conducting a hazard review.  Additionally, facility personnel and other persons familiar with warehouse operations provided input to the hazard review process.\n\nMajor hazards identified during this review were:\n\n* Toxic release\n* Fire or explosion\n* Earthquake\n* Equipment failure\n\nThe possible effects of external events such as earthquake, tornado and flooding were considered.  Existing emergency shut-down procedures were deemed adequate for managing most external events.  However, VWR intends to conduct further investigation to determine whether current earthquake protections are in conformance with accepted guidelines in California.\n\nCurrent facility management practices were deemed appropriate to prevent a toxic release, fire or explosion.  For example, the existence of standard operating procedures and training programs help minimize the risk of human error associated with facility operations.  Similarly, daily inspection of forklifts and the use of a standard checklist, help ensure that forklifts do not fail while in use.  \n\nIf a chemical release were to occur, it would first be detected by an operator, either visually or by odor.  Once detected, the facility has direct-reading colorimetric detection equipment that can determine the concentration of the chemical in air (measured in parts per million, or percent).\n\nMitigation systems and equipment are available for use by trained VWR emergency response personnel, in the event of a release.  A corrosives spill can be controlled through a special neutralizing and absorbing material, which is applied to the spill.  Similarly, toxic substances can be absorbed and containerized for later disposal.  Mitigation systems for a fire or explosion include a system of sprinklers, dikes, fire walls, and blast walls.\n\nAlthough findings from the hazard review were favorable, several action items were identified, as follows:\n\n* Review previous seismic engineering work, and if necessary, update protection systems to meet current guidelines.\n* Label storage rack with maximum weight capacity to prevent overload and damage to the rack.\n\nThe anticipated completion date of the action items is June 21, 2000.\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nVWR maintains written procedures for most operations.  Appendix C of VWR's Risk Management Plan identifies procedures relating to normal start-up and routine operations; Section 2 for procedures relating to emergency shut-down, evacuation and emergency operations, and start-up following an emergency shut-down.  Section 2 includes procedures for temporary operations during an emergency. The issuance or revision date is shown on procedures to indicated the date of last review.\n\n\nTraining\n\nVWR provides employee training for routine operations and emergency situations.  The training process can include one or more instructional formats, such as: lecture; videotape; interactive computer-based training hands-on exercises, demonstrations and on the job training.  Training is conducted by a qualified instructor or other competent person.  Employee proficiency may be evaluated using one or more techniques, including classroom quiz, actual demonstration, or verbal assessment.\n\nVWR has reviewed the capabilities of existing employees as of June 21, 1999 and determined that the employees possess the knowledge, skill and ability to perform their duties in accordance with operating procedures.  A written certification to this effect has been prepared and is on file at VWR. \n\nNew employees and employees who are transferred to new responsibilities receive training prior to starting the job.  This ensures that all employees understand and can perform their duties in accordance with operating procedures.\n\nEmployees will be re-trained whenever operating procedures are revised, and at least once every three years, even if procedures have not changed.  \n\nFor administrative efficiency, training under this section may be combined with any other employee training provided by VWR.\n\n\nMaintenance\n\nVWR maintains a list of process equipment that requires routine inspection and maintenance.  There are written procedures relating to inspection and maintenance requirements.  Personnel responsible for inspection and maintenance are trained on these procedures.  The procedures are typically developed by VWR or are obtained from equipment manufacturers. \n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nVWR will conduct an audit at least once every three (3) years to evaluate compliance with Prevention Program requirements.  The first audit will be completed no later than June 21, 2003.  Findings and recommended corrective actions will be put in writing, and corrective actions will be implemented in a timely manner.  Upon completion of corrective actions VWR will provide a written certification that the compliance evaluations has been completed.  All written records relating to compliance audits will be retained for at least (5) five years.\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nVWR's emergency procedures include a provision for conducting an investigation and analysis of each incident in which the emergency plan is activated .  Because VWR investigates all incidents, this procedure satisfies the requirement that VWR investigate each incident that \"resulted in, or could have resulted in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.\"  \n\nEach incident report, and corrective actions, will be put in writing.  Corrective actions will be implemented promptly.  The results of the investigation will be reviewed with affected workers (VWR and vendors) whose job tasks are relevant to the incident.  The incident report will be retained for minimum of five (5) years.",

      "SummaryText": "\n\nVWR Scientific Products, Inc. (VWR) is a distributor of high-quality chemicals and laboratory supplies.  The chemical products sold by VWR are received from manufacturers in Department of Transportation (DOT)-approved containers (typically ranging from 1 gallon to 55 gallons in volume).  VWR does not manufacture, formulate or otherwise engage in direct handling of chemicals outside of the containers in which the chemicals are received.  VWR operations consist of warehousing and distribution activities, and the risk of a serious chemical-related emergency is low.  However, VWR is serious about safety.  The company has established a management system, consisting of policies, procedures, training, inspection, maintenance and other elements, that are designed to prevent incidents from occurring, and in the event a minor or major emergency does occur, to enable facility personnel to effectively manage the incident. \n\nAll warehousing operations involving regulated chemicals are considered a single \"covered process\" for regulatory purposes.  The following  regulated chemicals were identified to exceed the threshold quantity (TQ) for regulation under the federal Clean Air Act Accident Release Prevention rule (CAA ARP) or the associated California Regulation (CalARP). \n\nFederal -\nchloroform - 20,972 lbs\nethyl ether - 9,252 lbs\n\nCalARP -\nammonium hydroxide - 13,055 lbs\nchloroform - 20,972 lbs\nformaldehyde solution - 913 lbs\nhydrochloric acid (>37%) - 10,179 lbs\nhydrofluoric acid - 405 lbs\nnitric acid - 4,106 lbs\n\nThe worst case release scenario is based on a hypothetical incident in which the single largest container stored on site, a 55 gallon drum, is pierced by a forklift and the contents are spilled on the floor of the distribution center.  RMP Comp, a software program furnished by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), was used to determine the farthest distance from the facility that toxic or flammable effects may be anticipated, following the chemical releas"

For example, the distance to endpoints for nitric acid and hydrochloric acid is equal to 0.2 miles.  The distances to toxic or flammable endpoints for all other chemicals are less than 0.2 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is based on a more realistic hypothetical incident in which a single one-gallon container of chemical is dropped on the floor.  According to the analysis, the distances to endpoints for all regulated chemicals are equal to one-tenth of one mile (0.1 mile) or less.  For example, the analysis indicates that the distance to a toxic endpoint for hydrochloric acid, hydrofluoric acid, nitric acid and formaldehyde (formalin) are all equal to 0.1 mile.  The distances to toxic or flammable endpoints for all other chemicals are less than 0.1 miles.\n\nAdministrative controls and active mitigation measures were not included as a factor of consideration during the worst case or alternative release scenarios.  However, passive mitigation measures (i.e., enclosures and berms) were included.\n\nVWR's prevention program consists of several key elements, including:\n\n* Safety Information - includes detailed information about the hazards of regulated chemicals, maximum intended inventory, facility design features, applicable standards, equipment use and maintenance.\n\n* Hazard Review - a process of evaluating facility operations, using warehouse industry checklists, to identify and control potential hazards.\n\n* Operating Procedures - written procedures to guide employees in safely conducting normal, temporary and emergency operations.\n\n* Training - includes training commensurate with the types of activities employees are expected to perform during normal and emergency situations.\n\n* Maintenance - required maintenance activities are performed by trained employees or qualified vendors.\n\n* Compliance Audits"

      "SummaryText": " - conducted at least once every three years to verify compliance with regulatory requirements for Accidental Release Prevention.\n\n* Incident Investigation - conducted whenever an incident occurs that results in, or could have resulted in, a catastrophic release (i.e., a release that presents an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health and the environment).\n\nThe need for chemical specific prevention steps is very limited because chemicals are contained within sealed, DOT-approved containers, and the containers are not opened during handling.  However, flammable chemicals are stored and handled in specially designed rooms with electrical fixtures and equipment that are designed to prevent sparks.  In the event a container is damaged, there is special low-level ventilation to capture flammable vapors that may be heavier than air, and eliminate the vapors before an explosive concentration can accumulate.  In the unlikely event of an explosion there are special blow-out panels in the roof skylights of the flammable, corrosive, oxidizer and poison storage rooms that will direct the force of an explosion away from other chemicals.  Additionally, all chemicals are segregated and stored by hazard class, to ensure that incompatible chemicals are not stored together.\n\nThere have been no accidents in the previous five years that have resulted in any deaths or significant property damage on-site, or any off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or in-place sheltering.\n\nVWR has developed a detailed emergency response program that addresses small- and large-scale incidents, including coordination with outside agencies and responders."
