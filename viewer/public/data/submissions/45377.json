      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary - MEMC PASADENA, INCORPORATED\n\nAccidental Release and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe are committed to operating the plant and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of prevention and emergency response programs to help ensure the safety of our employees, our industrial neighbors, and the community to which we belong, and to ensure the protection of the environment as well.  This document provides a brief overview of the ongoing risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\u00b7 A description of our facility and the way we use materials regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n\u00b7 A summary of our assessment of potential offsite consequences should a release occur\n\u00b7 An overview of our release prevention programs\n\u00b7 A five-year accident history for releases of RMP regulated materials\n\u00b7 An overview of our emergency response program\n\nFacility and Regulated Substances\n\nThe facility is the world's only supplier of ultra-high purity granular polysilicon.  This material is used in the manufacture of silicon wafers for the semiconductor industry.  The facility also produces ultra-high purity silane gas, which is sold to the semiconductor industry as well as being used as the raw material for the manufacture of granular polysilicon.  \n\nThe only RMP regulated substance at the facility is the silane gas.   Silane is a flammable gas. \n\nThe largest storage vessel of silane is underground, and can contain a maximum of 75,000 pounds of the substance as a refrigerated liquid.   The gas is packaged for sale, or used in closed systems to produce granular polysilicon.  Silane is normally shipped as a gas, in cylinders or tube trailers.\n\nWe have no RMP regulated toxic materials.\n\nWorst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario for our facility.   The following are brief summaries of t"

      "SummaryText": "hese scenarios.\n\nThe worst case scenario was modeled using the OCA Guidance provided by the EPA.  Our scenario involves the release of all 75,000 pounds of the largest storage vessel of silane, the liquid contents flashing to gas, and the gas igniting, within ten minutes.  Although this scenario is highly unlikely due to the underground storage of silane, we modeled it according to EPA guidance.  We assumed no mitigating circumstances or operational controls to minimize the release per EPA guidance.   Our modeling suggests there would be little environmental impact and no impact or damage to the community.    The product of combustion for silane is silicon dioxide (sand) so there would be no toxic smoke from combustion.\n\nThe alternative release scenario we selected involves a tube trailer used for transporting bulk quantities of silane to our customers.  This is a more realistic scenario because this is the only time this material is handled outside of closed processing systems at the facility.  The release quantity for this scenario is 6,000 pounds, or the complete contents of one bulk-shipping container.  Based on the release model, there would be minimal environmental impact and no damage to the community.\n\nGeneral Release Prevention Program \n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous materials.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n\u00b7 Process Safety Information\n\u00b7 Process Hazard Analysis\n\u00b7 Operating Procedures\n\u00b7 Training\n\u00b7 Preventative Maintenance and Mechanical Integrity\n\u00b7 Management of Change\n\u00b7 Pre-startup Reviews\n\u00b7 Compliance Audits\n\u00b7 Incident Investigation\n\u00b7 Employee Participation\n\u00b7 Permit to Work Systems including Hot Work Permits\n\u00b7 Inspection Programs\n\u00b7 Critical Instrument Checks\n\u00b7 Contractor Qualification and Safety Programs\n\n \nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention factors:\n\n\u00b7 Silane is st"

For each incident we conduct formal investigations and identify and correct root causes of the events.\n\nSince construction in 1986, the plant has had no reportable accidents associated with the release of silane gas.\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program is coordinated with our industrial neighbors, the City of Pasadena, and the South East Regional LEPC.  It provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting our workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations, and for notifying the public in the unlikely case of an incident.  \n\nOur emergency response team undergoes continuous training and must maintain adequate skill levels to remain certified as emergency responders.
