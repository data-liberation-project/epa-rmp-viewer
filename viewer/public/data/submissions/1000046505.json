Heustess, Jr. Facility (WWTP), is committed to safety and the implementation of safe procedures through various training, safety, emergency and accidental release prevention programs, and through overall process safety management.  The City is responsible for the training of all employees at the wastewater treatment plant.  All new employees are provided training on the following topics, at a minimum:  the requirements of the Hazard Communication Standard 29 CFR 1910.1200, hazardous chemicals used in the plant, how to read and get information from Safety Data Sheets (SDSs), hazards associated with each treatment process, operation, testing and routine maintenance of safety systems used in processes involving highly hazardous chemicals, use of personal protective equipment, emergency procedures, understanding process safety management, and the location of SDSs, the Process Safety Management Plan (PSMP) for the facility, and other safety information.  Employee training for highly hazardous chemicals is provided for all employees at the time of their initial assignment to the facility or to a specific process and any time a new chemical or process is introduced in the plant.  In addition, once every three years and more often if necessary, the City must provide each employee with a refresher training course covering these topics.  Further training is also provided on various topics related to the facility and its processes once per week.  \r\n\r\nThe City of Cayce Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant - E. H. Heustess, Jr. Facility, is located in southeast Cayce, adjacent to the Congaree River.  The plant has a current average daily design treatment capacity of 25.0 Million Gallons per Day (MGD) and is capable of treating a peak flow of 58.25 MGD.  Treatment is provided at the facility through the following processes:  influent screening; grit removal; an activated sludge process for biological nutrient removal (B"

The following chemicals (with the maximum quantity stored onsite indicated in parentheses) are used in the treatment processes:  Chlorine (12,000 pounds), Sulfur Dioxide (8,000 pounds), Sodium Hydroxide (2,100 gallons 20% solution), Clarifloc C-6266 polymer (4,875 gallons), Aluminum Sulfate (45,000 gallons, 48.5% solution).  Of these chemicals, both chlorine and sulfur dioxide are stored in quantities that are above the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) threshold quantity for each as defined in 40 CFR Part 68.  EPA's threshold quantity for chlorine is 2,500 pounds while its threshold quantity for sulfur dioxide is 5,000 pounds.  \r\n\r\nThe City of Cayce Regional WWTP currently maintains a complete Process Safety Management Plan (PSMP) as required by 29 CFR \u00a7 1910.119 (OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard), which outlines various requirements involving training, maintenance, inspections, process safety, process chemical safety information, accident prevention and emergency response procedures.  In addition, an Operation and Maintenance (O & M) Manual and Standard Operating Procedures have been developed for the facility, which provides detailed operation, maintenance and safety procedures for the processes and equipment at the plant.  \r\n\r\nOver the past five years the Cayce Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant has had one minor incident involving the release of a trace amount chlorine gas from vacuum piping within the cylinder storage room.  Following this incident, additional training was provided and a memo was sent to plant personnel reminding them of the requirements for wearing PPE.  The City of Cayce maintains an Emergency Action Plan outlining procedures to follow in the event of a chemical release at the WW"
