      "SummaryText": "Platinum Ethanol, LLC, referred to as PLE herein, has been in operation since September 2008.  Since PLE is a relatively new facility, the reports and information relevant to this Plan are recently developed.  All included reports and information were reviewed and approved by PLE management prior to the start up of the facility.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICY:\n\nPlatinum Ethanol, LLC is committed to worker and public safety and has invested significant resources to prevent accidents.  These resources include personnel training as well as considering safety in design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility.\n\nIt is PLE's policy to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release and notify external emergency responders, as necessary.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE:\n\nPlatinum Ethanol, LLC ethanol plant is located near Arthur, Ida County, Iowa.\n\nPLE manufactures fuel grade ethanol from corn operating 24 hours per day, 7 days a week.  The substances regulated under the RMP program are Anhydrous Ammonia and Natural Gasoline, known as Denaturant at the facility.  With the amount of Anhydrous Ammonia stored on-site, PLE has determined that the radius of impact from a worst-case release would be about 5.6 miles.  The radius of impact from a worst-case release of Denaturant would be 0.7 miles.\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCES ANALYSIS RESULTS FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA:\n\nA release of 96,000 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia, which would create a toxic vapor cloud, is the worst-case scenario at the facility.  The worst-case scenario is based on a release of the entire Anhydrous Ammonia tank.  The worst-case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 5.6 miles from the center of the facility.  There are approximately 2,075 residential receptors within the 5.6 mile radius.  Other public receptors include schools and"

      "SummaryText": " hospitals.  Environmental receptors within the radius include Odebolt Creek, Maple River, Hoskins Creek, Elk Creek and agricultural lands.\n\nRelease prevention measures focus on preventing excessive tank pressure and leaks.  Excessive pressure is limited through allowing hotwork by permit only, minimizing combustible storage near the tank and both procedures and an internal standpipe to prevent filling the tank with more than 90% liquid.  Leaks are prevented through the use of break-away truck connection points, excess flow shutoff valves, air-operated emergency isolation valves and bollards to prevent collisions. \n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCES ANALYSIS RESULTS FOR DENATURANT:\n\nA release of 875,000 pounds of denaturant, which would create a vapor cloud explosion, is the worst-case scenario at PLE.  A release of the entire denturant tank would be worst-case scenario for the facility.  The vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 0.80 mile radius from the center of the facility, which would affect mostly residential receptors.  Environmental receptors within the radius include Odebolt Creek and agricultural land.\n\nRelease prevention measures fall into two categories: 1) Tank overfill prevention and 2) Ignition source prevention.  Tank overfilling is prevented by operation procedures that require tank level checks prior to off-loading a truck and by level sensor/DCS high level alarms.  Ignition sources are prevented by electrically grounding trucks prior to transfer, allowing hot work by permit only and by using intrinsically safe equipment.  \n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:  None\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION:\n\nPLE has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including an Emergency Response Action Plan.  \n\nThe facility also conducts employee training as part of the facility activities.  The importance of worker, public and environmental safety is reflected in Platinum Ethanol, LLC's plans and training activities.\n\n"
