The facility operates at the intersection of 131st Ave. SW and 38th St. SW and has a legal location indicated as the NW1/4 NW1/4 Section 17, Township 139N, Range 99W.\n\n\n\nProcess Description:\n\nThe plant processes natural gas delivered from production wells.  The inlet compressors gather the inlet field gas coming into the plant at between 10-50 psig and compress it to the inlet of the NGL plant of approximately 450 psig.  The compressed gas is then routed through an NGL skid with ethylene glycol injection which removes water and NGL from the stream.  The rich EG is routed to the dehydration still column, which is fired with heat from the facility hot oil heater, to assist in driving off the water and regenerating the lean EG.  The gas stream from the still column consists primarily of water vapor, which is vented to atmosphere.  All flash vapors off of the EG flash tank are captured by process and routed back to the facility inlet slug catcher.  At the NGL plant outlet, the gas is compressed to approximately 1200 psig and sold to WBI Pipeline Company.  Extensive natural gas liquids (NGL) are produced from the NGL plant and are routed to two (2) pressurized NGL storage tanks.  Whiting anticipates the potential for up to 240,000 gal/day of NGLs from the plant. \n\nWhiting also anticipates up to 40,000 gal/day of stabilized condensate (RVP 12 psia) associated with the fractionation process, which is comprised of C5+ liquids and stored in eight (8) storage tanks well removed from the NGL bullet tanks.

      "SummaryText": " recent expansion of the hot oil system included the installation of a 20.6 MMbtu/hr hot oil heater that is used to accommodate the increasing heat loads associated with greater throughput, NGL production, stabilized condensate production and liquids fractionation at the plant.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgram Level:\n\nIt has been determined that this is a Program 3 facility.  There are no public or environmental receptors within the range of the worst case release scenario.  This facility is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals regulation, 29 CFR 1910.119.  \n\n\n\nPrevention and Response Policies:\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies are provided in the facility's Process Safety Management Guidelines manual.  The plant's emergency response plan has been coordinated with the Stark County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and agency personnel will have a chance to tour the facility.  Whiting Oil and Gas Corporation takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at its facility by ensuring that employees are trained in the safe operation of the plant and evacuation procedures.  \n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances: \n\nThe facility contains a fractionated NGL product storage and shipping process.  Ethane, butane, propane and pentane are the primary components of the NGL inventory listed in the RMP rule.  Propane is used as refrigerant in the refrigeration process.\n\n All of the chemicals above the RMP threshold are classified as flammable and not toxic. As such, only a flammable release scenario has been analyzed for the Belfield Gas Plant.\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario:  \n\nThe worst case release scenario is that one of the seven 90,000 gallon NGL tanks and associated piping is ruptured and released over a ten (10) minute period, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  In the event of a catastrophic release and subsequent explosion, all of the tanks could be compromised given there close proximity"

However, per the RMP rules, it is assumed that the maximum volume that could potentially be involved in a vapor cloud explosion is the total volume associated with one of the NGL tank vessels. No active mitigation or passive mitigation was considered in limiting the NGL tank volume.  Worst case meteorological conditions are assumed and RMP*Comp was used to calculate the endpoint distance for overpressure of 1.0 pound per square inch (PSI) for a flammable mixture vapor cloud explosion.   A distance of 0.6 miles to the overpressure endpoint of 1 PSIG was determined for a release of 405,000 pounds in ten minutes for the entire NGL process.  There are no potential public receptors within this radial distance.  \n\n\n\nAlternate-Case Release Scenario:\n\nThe alternative release scenario is that one of the 90,000 gallon Butane tanks and associated piping is compromised and released over a ten (10) minute period, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  It is assumed that the tank is only 50% full, thus, it is limited to 45,000 gallons of Butane product that could potentially be involved in the vapor cloud explosion, in addition to any associated piping liquids.  The active mitigation considered is that a plant operator will ESD the plant and thereby shutdown the control valve to the NGL tanks which would isolate the tank away from the rest of the process and limit the product available for combustion. The default meteorological conditions associated with the ACRS was assumed and RMP*Comp was used to calculate the endpoint distance for overpressure of 1.0 pound per square inch (PSI) for a butane vapor cloud explosion.  A distance of 0.4 miles to the overpressure endpoint of 1 PSIG was determined for a release of 157,500 pounds in ten minutes for the potential explosion associated with one of the Butane tanks.\n\n\n\nAccident History:\n\nThis is a relatively new facility and, therefore, has not experienced an incident that resulted in injuries or environme"
