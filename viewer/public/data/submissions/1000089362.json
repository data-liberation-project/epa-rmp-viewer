The entirety of the warehouse is secondary containment to keep liquids inside the building.  We rely on regulatory and job specific trainings to keep our warehouse technicians aware of the risk associated with the two major processes at this location.  We have spill-kits set around the warehouse and a pallet containing the emergency response gear at the edge of the office space.  The warehouse has access to all the necessary PPE needed to respond to the chemical in this facility and HAZWOPER certification for its members.   The safety event tracker is used to record spills, safety concerns, and incidents at the site.  The operational documents layout the requirements of the processes and are updated to improve safety.  We are audited twice a year by ISO auditors for safety compliance.  The operation director and warehouse supervisor are members of the Safety Committee. \n\nThe regulated chemicals stored at the Lombard facility are Hydrochloric Acid 37%, Hydrofluoric Acid 60%, and Ammonium Hydroxide solution up to 28%.  These chemicals are stored in cases all the way to 300-gallon totes.  Our Lombard facility is composed of an office section and a warehouse section.  The warehouse has 6 rooms, the main receiving/loading/docks, the warm room, a cold room, a flammable room, and overflow flammable room, and a main corrosives room.  All of these rooms have racking except the overflow flammable room.  There is a few small office rooms in the warehouse and fire pump room.  In the main receiving/loading/docks there is a small clean room for the dip-tube exchange.  We store acids, bases, toxics, flammables, and oxidizers, and RCRA empty containers.

Our five-year accident history is blank so far because we have not had any accidents with the regulated chemicals in the last five years.  We are working to keep it that way.  \n\nOur emergency response plan is split into sections.  First section the Incident command structure and the various roles in that structure.  It covers fire incidents, evacuation procedures, external emergency response contacts, chemical injury response, injuries, minor spills, off-site spills, and major spills.  The external contacts section includes government agencies and guidance on when to reach out.  There is reportable quantities for a number of chemicals we store.  It has a decontamination guidance and PPE guide.  It also cover security threats and natural disasters.  There is a breakdown of the PPE needed for various levels of response, a list of training requirements, and record-keeping requirements. The plan also has an internal contacts list for the company, a list of medical facilities in the area, and a neighboring facilities contact list.  \n\nAs for safety improvements plans for the Lombard processes, we are working to better measure and track minor safety events and improve the general safety culture with the warehouse staff.  We are working to add emergency response plan competency quizzes to the training requirements to test knowledge.  Adding a third crossbeam to racks to avoid pallets falling through the existing crossbeams.  Updating operation documents for Dip-Tube Exchange and Warehousing and creating quizzes to accompany them.  \n\nHigh Purity Products is committed to ensuring safe operating practices to ensure the safety of its employees, the surrounding community, and the environment."
