This facility no longer stores or utilizes small portable tanks for distribution of anhydrous ammonia to growers for use as a fertilizer.  The anhydrous ammonia at this facility is used in the manufacture of fertilizers for distribution to growers.\n\nFor more information concerning this plan, contact: Dale Buxman, ERS Manager, UAP Pueblo, PO Box 1279, Garden City, Ks. 67846 (620) 275-6127, or Andy Bunger, Manager, UAP Ag Service, PO Box 773, McCook, Ne. 69001 (308) 345-2920.\n\nRisk Management Plan - Executive Summary\n\n1. The Facility Policy\n\na) The owners, management and employees of UAP Ag Service, Imperial, Nebraska, are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\na) The facility has been owned and operated by UAP Pueblo since March 18, 1998.  All details and information concerning the plan are based on activities since that date.\n\nb) The primary activity of this facility, as it relates to anhydrous ammonia, is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sales to growers as a fertilizer.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed to farmers for direct application as a crop nutrient.\n\nc) Currently, anhydrous ammonia is reacted with water and phosphoric acid to produce fertilizer.  This reaction, using a on-site t-reactor recently installed.  The installation of this reactor has resulted in revisions to this and other safety and emergency plans.\n\nd) The maximum quantity stored in the largest tank is approximately 78,000 pounds.  This represents filling the largest \n\n3. The Worst-Case and Alternate Release Scenarios.\n\na) The worst-case scenario is based on the entire contents of one o"

The quantity released would equal approximately 130,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, which represents the volume of a storage tank filled to 85% capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion at 200 ppm) is 1.12 miles.\n\nb) The alternate case scenario is based on a release caused by a break in a transfer hose.  The quantity released would equal approximately 26,000 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion at 200 ppm) is 0.56 miles.\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\na) This facility has implemented the provisions of ANSI publication K-61.1, \"Safety Requirements for the storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\nb) This facility is in compliance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\nc) This facility follows the anhydrous ammonia standards established by the Nebraska State Fire Marshal, and is inspected by them on an annual basis.\n\nd) This facility is inspected on at least a monthly basis by employees knowledgeable in the safe handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n5. The Five-Year Accident History\n\na) There have been no accidents in the previous five years involving the release of anhydrous ammonia at this facility, while under management of either UAP Pueblo or Koch Industries.\n\n6. The Emergency Response\n\na) This facility has a written Emergency Response Plan in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38.\n\nb) This facility has provided State and Local authorities the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\nc) This facility has a written emergency response plan in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.120, which includes pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7.
