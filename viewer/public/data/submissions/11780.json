If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Hutchinson County LEPC or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  FACILITY INFORMATION.\n\nThe primary acitivity of the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for wholesale purposes.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is not normally stored on-site.  It is received and stored on-site on a temporary basis for use only by a portable pipe reactor that visits the facility periodically.  The ammonia is stored in a tanker trailer that has been disconnected and set up a temporary feed tank and as a receiver for make-up ammonia as  needed.  The portable pipe reactor is covered under OSHA's PSM and it maintains its documentation.  This documentation is blended with the site RMP information to meet the overall regulatory requirements for this operation.  \n\nThe maximum quantity ever stored on-site is 42,000 pounds (approximately 9,000 gallons).  The tank is refilled using tanker trucks as needed.  During the downtime between operation of the portable reactor, the tanker trailer/feed tank is removed from the site\n\n3.  WORST-CASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\n\nThe worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of the tanker trailer/feed tank.  This could result in the release of up to 42,000 # of liquid ammonia over a 10 minute period.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 3.6 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario, based on the most likely potential incident, is the rupture of an ammonia feed hose that is being used to transfer liquid ammonia from the feed pump to the portable reactor.  This could result in an ammonia release of about 200 #/minute over a 5 miute period.  The distance to the end point is 0.2 mile"

ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by the American Health Standards Institute, Inc.\n\nEquipment inspection prior to use is emphasized.\n\n5.  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years at the facility; and to our knowledge no off-site concequences reported.   \n\n6.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe facility has a written emergency response plan and has provided the state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III.\n\n7.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic reviews are performed to assess the maintenance and operations to establish safe operating conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
