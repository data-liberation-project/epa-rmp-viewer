The Facility Policy:\r\n\r\nThe Facility owner, management, and employees of Gavilon Fertilizer LLC are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  Local responders are encouraged to visit the Facility to gain first hand knowledge of the site. Employees are required to hold periodic safety meeting and include sections of the management plan in those meetings.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with local fire departments, and other authorities to mitigate any release, and to minimize the impact of a release on the population and environment.\r\n\r\nII.   Facility Information:\r\n\r\nThe primary activity of the Facility is to distribute agricultural fertilizer for the farming industry in the area.  Part of the fertilizer comes in the form of Anhydrous Ammonia, here after referred to as ammonia.  Ammonia is received, stored, and used in the production of non-hazardous liquid fertilizer solutions.  The facility has one 12,000 gallon ammonia storage tank and has the ability to receive ammonia via railcar or truck transport.  Both the rail cars and truck transports are unloaded through a permanent piping system approved by the State of Indiana's Ag department.  The ammonia is combined with phosphoric acid in a batch process to produce agricultural fertilizer.  The process is operated intermittently throughout the year.  \r\n\r\nIII.  Accidental Release Prevention:\r\n   \r\nThe Facility uses guidance published the American National Standards Institute Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia K61.1, and Compressed Gas Association CGA G-2 for design, construction, and maintenance of the process equipment.  The Facility tries to minimize the amount of ammonia held or stored at the facility during periods of low fertilizer demand.  Employees involved with the handling and processing are trained in their duti"
