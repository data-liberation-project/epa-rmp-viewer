We shall, as a minimum: (1) consult with employees on the conduct and development of the process hazard review and other elements of the risk management plan, and (2) provide to our employees access to the process hazard review and all other information required to be developed under that standard.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe City of Greenville believes that preventative maintenance is the key to minimizing the potential for accidental releases.  Operations and Maintenance Guidelines (OMGs) have been reviewed and revised to enable the employees to perform their work in a safe and efficient manner.\n\nThe City of Greenville has taken steps to train the operators, supervisors, maintenance crews, and fire department to be first responders to a release.  The training included three days of classroom and hands on training on the proper use of emergency response equipment and procedures.  The course followed the guidelines stated in OSHA 1910.120.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Waste Reclamation Center utilizes chlorine for disinfection and sulfur dioxide for dechlorination of the treated wastewater.  The maximum inventory and threshold quantities for these chemicals are shown below.\n\nChemical    Maximum Inventory (lb)    Threshold Quantity (lb)\nChlorine    16,000    2,500\nSulfur Dioxide    8,000    5,000\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe City of Greenv"
