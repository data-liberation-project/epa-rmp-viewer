      "SummaryText": "The Ashtabula Complex, Plant 2 facility is a world class chemical manufacturing facility located in Ashtabula, Ohio.  It is one of several facilities throughout the world that are owned and operated by Millennium Inorganic Chemicals Inc. to produce titanium dioxide, a nonhazardous pigment used in a diverse range of coatings, plastics, papers, and elastomers and titanium tetrachloride for use in specialty alloys.   Millennium Inorganic Chemicals takes pride in ensuring that the Ashtabula Complex, Plant 2 is designed and operated to prevent hazards in our workplace and maintains well established contingency plans in place in the unlikely event of a mishap.\n\nControlling risks from hazardous substances is a major part of our \"Commitment to Safety and Environment\", which states:\n\n\"There is no activity or job at the Ashtabula Complex which is so important or urgent that it must be done by jeopardizing the safety or health of any employee, visitor, or contractor, or at the risk of damaging the environment. Any employee at the Ashtabula Complex has the authority and obligation to stop any activity or job which they feel may jeopardize the safety or health of any employee or contractor, or may risk damaging the environment.\"\n\nTo ensure that we operate according to this policy, we have programs in place that provide layers of protection for preventing releases and protecting the public and environment, including:\n\n- Operating programs that are consistent with the Chemical Manufacturers' Association Responsible Care? code of practices\n- A management system that is certified as conforming to ISO-9002 International Standards\n- Continuing compliance with all applicable federal and state regulations and permits, including OSHA \"process safety management\" and EPA \"risk management program\" standards\n- Coordination of our emergency contingency plans with local response agencies\n\nHazard Assessments\n\nThe Plant 2 facility includes two primary processes that handle substances that have b"

      "SummaryText": "een classified as \"hazardous\" by EPA.  These processes are called the Chlorination and Oxidation processes and each handles and stores chlorine and titanium tetrachloride as an important part of their operation.  We have assessed the risks that our handling and storage of these substances could present to public health and environment by performing offsite consequence analyses in \"worst case\" and \"alternative release\" scenarios.  \n\nOur analysis of the offsite consequences for both processes determined that the worst case release would be represented by a release of the contents of a railcar containing chlorine, which, although very unlikely to occur, could result in a release of 180,000 lbs. of chlorine.  Under winds of 3.4 mph the resulting plume could affect a portion of an area within 14 miles of the facility before being reduced below the toxic endpoint.  This area includes an estimated population of 102,000 persons, residences, schools, hospitals, recreation areas and major commercial, office and industrial areas.  It also includes parks, forests and federal wilderness areas.  \n\nOur continuing analysis of release scenarios also addresses more credible situations that reflect actual operating conditions for each process.  These include situations such as tank overflows, pipe ruptures and equipment failures.  This analysis has determined that the most serious of such releases could impact a portion of an area within 0.5 miles of our facility in the case of chlorine and 0.3 miles in the case of titanium tetrachloride.  \n\nAccident History\n\nThree releases, reportable under EPA regulations, have occurred at the facility in the past five years.  On 9/19/98 a spill of titanium tetrachloride resulted in a vapor cloud of nonhazardous material that impacted a neighboring facility, resulting in shelter in place.  On 12/18/2001 61 pounds of chlorine was released through the main stack at the Titanium Tetrachloride unit.  There were no other injuries or damage caused by any "

      "SummaryText": "of these accidental releases. On 11/2/04 a 110 pound Titanium Tetrachloride release occurred as a result of a pipe failure.  The majority of the spilled material was contained onsite, however, an unknown quantity of vapor was carried Northward by the wind. A Demaximis employee working at the Fields Brook landfill, to the North of the Millennium Plant, claimed inhalation of the Titanium Tetrachloride fumes. He and a co worker were taken to the hospital, given first aid and released to return to work the same day.\n\nEmergency Response\n\nContingency plans are in place at our facility for responding to accidental releases, treating any persons who have been affected by a hazardous substance and rapidly informing local response agencies.  Our emergency response plan has been coordinated with the Ashtabula County Emergency Management Agency and the Ashtabula Township Fire Department.\n\n\nOperations at all Millennium Inorganic Chemicals' facilities, including Ashtabula Complex, Plant 2, are continually reviewed by onsite and corporate management to ensure we use the most up to date release prevention and emergency response programs and meet all applicable regulations.  Whenever methods for safer operation are found in any of our facilities, these are immediately applied, to the extent applicable, at our other facilities throughout the world.  In this way we will continue to maintain a high standard for safety and environmental protection in all of our facilities."
