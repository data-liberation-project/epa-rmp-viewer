              "Description": "Management System - Nacelle Logistics, has a management program in place that assigns overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the RMP Program at S&S RNG Facility to a qualified individual or position of responsibility. It clearly delineates accountability and responsibilities for any elements where responsibilities are delegated.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information - Up-to-date process safety information is maintained for use by employees operating the covered process in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.65, including the following:\n\n\n\n- SDS for methane that contains toxicity information, permissible exposure limits, physical data, reactivity data, thermal and chemical stability data and synergistic effects from mixing process flows.\n\n- Process chemistry and maximum intended inventory data for the covered process.\n\n- Safe operating limits and evaluation of consequences of deviations from these limits for the covered process.\n\n- Covered process equipment information consisting of materials of construction; piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs); electric classification; relief system design and design basis; ventilation system design; design codes and standards employed; and safety systems.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) - A PHA has been performed for the Program 3 covered process at S&S RNG Facility in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.67. The PHA was performed using the Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) method. The PHA identified the hazards associated with methane and the covered process; causes of potential accidental release scenarios; safeguards used to prevent accidental releases; and methods used to detect, monitor or control accidental releases. Any critical issues identified during the PHA have been documented and resolved in a timely manner. The PHA will be revalidated and updated once every five years following completion of the initial PHA.\n\n\n\nOperating procedures - Detailed and up-to-date process operating procedures have been developed and are maintained for the methane storage in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.69. Operating procedures provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involving a covered process in a manner consistent with process safety information and are readily accessible to employees involved in a covered process. Operating procedures will be reviewed and certified annually to ensure that they remain current and accurate.\n\n\n\nOperating procedures cover each operating phase of the covered process including initial system startup, normal operation, temporary operations, emergency shutdown and conditions that require them, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup following a turnaround or emergency shutdown. Operating procedures also incorporate or reference relevant process safety information including the following:\n\n\n\n- Process operating limits (including consequences of deviations and steps to correct or avoid such deviations) - Safety and health considerations (including properties and hazards of covered chemical, precautions necessary to prevent exposure, control measures to be taken upon physical contact or airborne exposure, quality control for raw materials, and control of regulated substance inventories).\n\n- Safety systems and their functions.\n\n\n\nTraining - New employees working with a covered process will receive initial training in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.71. The training includes an overview of the process and emphasizes process operating procedures, safe work practices, health and safety hazards, and emergency operations including shutdown. \n\n\n\nRefresher training is provided at a minimum of once every three years to all employees working with the covered process. Documentation is maintained for each employee to ensure that he/she received and understood the required training.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity - A mechanical integrity program has been developed in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.73 for covered process equipment. Employees involved in the maintenance of the covered process receive additional training, which includes an overview of the process, its hazards, and applicable procedures to ensure that the employee can perform the job in a safe manner.\n\n\n\nWritten procedures have been developed to ensure that the covered process equipment is properly maintained, tested, and inspected at regular, scheduled intervals and that such activities are thoroughly documented. Maintenance, inspection and testing procedures and frequencies are consistent with applicable manufacturer's recommendations and follow accepted engineering practices. Any equipment deficiencies identified during maintenance, inspection or testing are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change (MOC) - A written MOC procedure has been implemented to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and operating procedures for the covered process in accordance with 40 CFR 68.75. The MOC procedure does not apply to \"replacement in kind\" which are defined as replacements that satisfy the original design specifications (e.g., replace a pressure reducing valve with a new identical valve supplied by the original equipment manufacturer).\n\n\n\nPrior to introducing a change, the MOC procedure is implemented to ensure the following:\n\n\n\n- The technical basis for the change and its impact on health and safety have been fully evaluated;\n\n- Affected operating procedures and applicable process safety information have been updated accordingly; and\n\n- The schedule for implementing the change has been developed and required authorizations have been obtained.\n\n\n\nThe MOC procedure requires that all employees involved in operating or maintaining the modified process be informed of the change and trained accordingly prior to startup of the modified process.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) - PSSRs are performed in accordance with 40 CFR 68.77 for new covered processes and for modified covered processes when the modification is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information. The PSSR confirms the following prior to introducing a regulated substance into a process:\n\n\n\n- Equipment and construction satisfy design specifications;\n\n- Safety, operation, maintenance and emergency procedure have been developed and are adequate;\n\n- A PHA has been performed for new covered processes, and all critical recommendations have been resolved or implemented prior to startup;\n\n- The MOC procedure has been completed for the process modifications; and \n\n- Training for all employees involved in operating or maintaining the new or modified process has been performed.\n\n\n\nCompliance Safety Audits - RMP Program compliance is confirmed through safety audits that are performed at least once every three years in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.79. The audits are completed by at least one person knowledgeable in the process. A report of the findings is to be generated following the audit, and all deficiencies and/or recommendations are promptly addressed and the resolution is documented. The two most recent safety audit reports are maintained at the facility.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation - Specific incident investigation, reporting, and documentation procedures have been implemented and are followed in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.81.  These procedures are enacted in response to any incident involving a covered process that did or could have reasonably resulted in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. Under EPA RMP, a catastrophic release is defined as a major uncontrolled emission, fire, or explosion, involving one or more regulated substances, that presents imminent and substantial endangerment to public health and the environment.\n\n\n\nThe incident investigation procedure is initiated as soon as possible and no later than 48 hours following an incident. A team is established to perform the incident investigation and always includes at least one person knowledgeable in the process, a contract employee if the incident involves work by a contractor, and other persons with appropriate qualifications to investigate an accident.\n\n\n\nFollowing the investigation, a written report is prepared that summarizes the following information at a minimum: date of the incident; date the investigation began; description of the incident and any contributing factors; and any recommendations resulting from the investigation. When completed, all affected personnel, including contract employees, review the report. Incident investigation reports are to be maintained at the facility for a minimum of five years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation - A written employee participation plan has been implemented that provides employees with access to PHA and all other information developed under the RMP regulation in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.83. The employee participation plan describes employee participation in conducting PHA and in implementing all other RMP elements.\n\n\n\nHot Work Permit - An authorization and permit program for hot-work operations has been prepared and implemented for hot work conducted on or near a covered process in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.85. The permit is used to document that fire prevention and protection standards in 29 CFR 1910.252(a) have been implemented prior to beginning the hot-work operations. Also, the permit lists the date(s) authorized for hot work and identifies the equipment to be worked on or near.\n\n\n\nContractors - A contractor safety program in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.87 covers all contractors performing maintenance or repair, turnaround, major renovation, or specialty work on or adjacent to a covered process. The safety performance of each contractor is evaluated prior to selection. Each contractor employee is informed of the known potential fire, explosion hazard related to work on a covered process as well as the relevant provisions of the emergency response program. Procedures are in place to control the entrance, presence, and exit of contract employees in covered process areas. Periodically, the performance of the contract owner or operator is evaluated while working in or adjacent to a covered process.\n\n",

Only through such a cooperative effort, can a safety and health program, in the best interest of all, be established and preserved. Our objective is a safety and health program that will reduce the number of injuries and illnesses to an absolute minimum, not merely in keeping with, but surpassing, the best experience of operations like ours. Our goal is zero accidents and injuries.\n\n\n\nThe S&S RNG Facility is located on a dairy farm in rural Sturgeon Bay, WI.  The facility is a Biogas Processing Facility that stores processed methane, in three high-pressure vessels with the capability of storing 2,916 lbs. of methane each, as well as a tube trailer that can store 5,175 lbs. of produced methane.  These products are transported via truck to a pipeline injection facility. The quantity of methane that is stored onsite exceeds the 10,000-pound threshold quantity, thus subjecting the facility to RMP requirements. The facility is typically unmanned, with one to two technicians making daily stops to check on operations, staying onsite for 1-2 hours.\n\n\n\nThe S&S RNG Facility's regulated methane process complies with National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 52 for Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) Storage and Handling, and it is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws/codes including, WI DSPS, OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM), and DOT's Hazardous Materials regulations.  If an emergency were to occur, it is the facility's policy to notify the Southern Door Fire Department by calling 911, which may trigger involvement by Door County Emergency Management as necessary.  \n\n\n\nNacelle Logistics has an outstanding safety record, and to date, has not had an accident involving methane that has resulted in death, injury, property/environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering-in-place.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an accidental release of"

The facility emergency response plans are coordinated with the Southern Door Fire Department and Door County Emergency Management.\n\n\n\nWhen an ESD is activated and the alarm is not acknowledged, CMD gas control operations will be notified and a representative will call the Nacelle Logistics on-call personnel in response to confirm whether there is an actual emergency.  If there is no answer from the on-call personnel to confirm whether help is needed, CMD will contact the Nacelle Logistics Operations Manager, and CMD gas control will continue calling personnel listed on the Emergency Action Plan until they are able to speak with somebody in person to communicate the situation.\n\n\n\nOur continuous improvement process, inclusive of historic analytics, risk assessments, and corrective/preventive actions, focuses on three primary objectives: 1) The safety of clients, servicers, and community, 2) Up time performance and user experience and, 3) Site cost drivers and reductions through root cause analysis and long-term corrective and preventive actions. While uptime and site costs goals are easily quantifiable, safety is paramount to U.S. Gain, U.S. Venture and Nacelle Logistics, as this establishes our credibility and reputation with employees, communities, and the industry.  Safety and environmental compliance are always of primary importance.  \n\n\n\nOther planned changes to improve safety include implementing a web based/text based notification system (SCADA) to enhance site visibility at a future date."
