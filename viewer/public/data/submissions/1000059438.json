We are very sensitive to any safety issues particularly in the case of chemical safety as our chlorine facility for the Wastewater Treatment Plant  is located close to town.  The City of Winnfield has a chlorination facility associated with the Wastewater Treatment Plant. It consists of a shed, which contains five (5) one-ton cylinders two of which are connected to the chlorinators at all times, one in standby mode and one in active mode. These chlorinators supply gaseous chlorine to the Wastewater Treatment Plant for purposes of disinfection.\n\nWe have compiled the safety information on the Wastewater Treatment Plant (as the law requires). This consists of all the specifications, codes, and standards used in the construction of the plant. We also compiled all the information on chlorine or any other chemicals used in the treatment plant.\n\nWe have done a safety review of the safety procedures at the plant (as the law requires). This consists of a review of all the procedures to be used in case of an accident or spill of hazardous materials. Also the policies and procedures to be employed in case of any type of emergency at the plant have been reviewed.\n\nWe have established operating procedures at the plant (as the law requires). This consists of a complete set of policies and procedures that will be employed in case of any type of emergency. \n\nWe have and continue to provide training at the plant (as the law requires). Louisiana Rural Water Association Schools, Hazardous Materials Awareness Schools, Chlorine Safe Handling Schools, Louisiana Conference on Water Supply, Sewerage, and Industrial Wastes Inc. schools for certification requirements (at least 40 hours per two years) are attended by all the certified employees. \n\nWe perform the necessary maintenance ( as the law requires) and as directed by the Operations and Maintenance Manuals addressed in the section on Operation "
