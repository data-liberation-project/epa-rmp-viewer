With plants located in Washington, Oregon, Idaho and California, the company serves western, national, and international markets, depending on product type.  As stated on their website, Founded by five Puget Sound cooperatives in 1918 as the United Dairymen's Association, the company eventually grew to include dairy associations throughout Washington, Oregon, Northern California and Idaho. Renamed WestFarm Foods in 1999, the company is one of the largest dairy products processors in the U.S. with annual sales of over $1.3 billion. The Seattle-based company currently operates eleven plants serving over 700 dairy farm families.\n\nWestFarm Food's senior management is not only committed to offer superior service, but to also maintain a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  The facility maintains a Safety Committee whose members are the designated incident commanders for the facility.  WestFarm Foods has an Emergency Response Plan (Plan) in effect, which is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM document maintained at the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe facility is located at 4058 Rainier Avenue South, Seattle, Washington 98118.

Subsequent modifications have included:\n\n1990  Accumulator 2 and the Gram Freezers added.\n1991  Accumulator 7 and the Gram Rice added.\n1992  Booster 5 added.\n1996  Additional Condenser and North Dock Evaporator added.\n1997  Old Condenser equipment removed.\n2000  Receiver and Blowmold chiller upgraded.\n2003  Pit Accumulator upgraded.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system was designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the following:  Uniform Building Code; ANSI 39.1, 1971, pg. 15 (Vessels); and ASME, Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section VIII.\n\nThe two ammonia refrigeration systems (Milk and Ice Cream) use a total of approximately 24,000 pounds of ammonia to provide cooling for process areas, milk/ice cream storage, and freezers.  The majority of the systems including vessels and compressors are located in two engine rooms.  The condensers are mounted on the roof of the building, and all of the evaporators are located in their respective cold/freezer storage rooms/areas.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nWestFarm Food's Milk and Ice Cream ammonia refrigeration systems have many safety features.  Much of the safety associated with the systems is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the systems.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.\n\nOther safety features of the ammonia refrigeration system include: an ammonia sensor that sounds a facility-wide alarm, an emergency shut down button that kills power to the engine room equipment, relief valves on all pressure vessels, continuous ventilation in the main engine room to prevent ammonia explosions.\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility has based its maintenance program on the industry standard: the International Institute of"

The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document, which is maintained at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes due to the renovation of the facility.  Facility personnel receive annual training regarding the emergency procedures and the Emergency Response Team holds regular drills.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nIn June 1999, the Milk and Ice Cream Plant refrigeration systems were thoroughly examined for safety hazards by way of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  The PHA generated mitigation measures (recommendations) to improve safety at the WestFarm Foods facility located at 4058 Rainier Avenue South, Seattle, Washington 98118.  In addition, a new Process Hazard Analysis was conducted in July 2"
