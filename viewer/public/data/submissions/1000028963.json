The Ormesa Geothermal Projects are near the Cities of El Centro and Holtville, California within the East Mesa Known Geothermal Resource Area (KGRA) and generate electricity from renewable geothermal resources in an environmentally friendly manner.  The North America Industrial Classification System code for the Ormesa facility is 221119.  Ormat operates the Ormesa Geothermal Projects in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local environmental and safety regulations and is committed to maintaining compliance with these regulations.  The Ormesa Geothermal Projects have emergency response procedures and protocols in place at the facility in coordination with local emergency response agencies.\r\nThe facility consists of five independent geothermal power plants, and associated geothermal wells, known as the Ormesa Geothermal Projects, comprising of four binary geothermal power plants designated as Ormesa Geothermal I (OGI), Ormesa Geothermal IE (OGIE), Ormesa Geothermal II (OGII), Ormesa Geothermal IH (OGIH), and a Dual Flash Geothermal Power plant designated as GEM 2&3 (GEM 2&3 power plants are operated as one combined power plant).  As a dual flash power plant, the GEM 2&3 facility does not use isopentane or chlorine or meet the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) or the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The Ormesa Geothermal Projects also include a GEM Bottoming Unit Project (a binary system), which has been added to the existing dual flash GEM 2&3 power plant.  The GEM Bottoming Unit uses isopentane in a binary system similar to that of the other Ormesa Projects, and therefore has been included in the in this program.  All five power plants use isopentane, which is listed by OSHA and EPA as a flammable material, as such, these facilities are subject to applicable regulations and requirements.  Since Orm"

The new 5th generation ITLU-OECs have replaced all of the 20 Level I and Level II Ormat Energy Converters at the Ormesa Geothermal II power plant and will increase the electrical power generation of Ormesa Geothermal II from a nominal 19.95 megawatts to 23.5 megawatts.  \r\n \r\nEach of the five separate facilities are covered by the PSM and RMP regulations, which requires proactive identification, evaluation and mitigation or prevention of chemical releases that could occur as a result of failures in processes, procedures, or equipment.  The PSM/RMP regulations also define the responsibilities of employers and contractors involved in work that affects or takes place near processes covered by the regulations to ensure the safety of both plant and contractor employees and the potential effects on public receptors.\r\nIsopentane is the primary chemical used at each facility and is covered by PSM/RMP regulations.  In the binary process of electrical generation, isopentane is used as the motive fluid in the generation of electricity from natural geothermal fluid in a series of interconnected Ormat Energy Converters at each facility.  Geothermal fluid is used to heat isopentane liquid to vapor in the Ormat Energy Converters, which in turn is used as the motive fluid to spin a turbine connected to a generator to produce electricity.  The isopentane vapor is then condensed and reused in a continuous, closed loop process within each Ormat Energy Converters that does not involve any chemical reactions or changes to the isopentane. At each facility, isopentane is also stored in one or more storage tanks.\r\n \r\nAn integral part of the PSM/RMP is the com"

The study was conducted by a Process Hazard Analysis/Hazards and Operability Study (PHA/HAZOP) team composed of Ormesa personnel with detailed knowledge of the process(es) and consulting members retained for the completion of this document.  The objective of the study was to identify potential hazards and their causes, consequences and appropriate responses or actions to mitigate the identified hazards.  A relative risk ranking was used to assign a hazard to each identified node of the process based on experience frequency and the consequence category of the hazard.  The performance of this study and relative risk ranking meets the requirement for a process hazard analysis.  A What If analysis was also performed to evaluate other circumstances or outside influences beyond the control of the system operators and maintenance workers.  These outside influences were evaluated by the PHA/HAZOP team and possible consequences were discussed.  For each of the consequences, a mitigating action was presented and/or developed to address such occurrences.\r\n\r\nOrmesa has complied with the PSM/RMP requirements and is committed to reviewing and updating the program periodically as appropriate and maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements.  This PSM/RMP has been updated to comply with all applicable regulations and is accessible to all interested persons at all times.  Ormat has been proactive in developing and implementing the PSM/RMP for the Ormesa Geothermal Projects, not only to comply with state and federal requirements but also as a commitment to a safe workplace as a top priority."
