(TSI), Dixon Facility (Facility) at 7235 Tremont Road, Dixon, California 95620 are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia or aqua ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the Facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed Consolidated Contingency Plan (CCP) has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n2.    FACILITY INFORMATION\nThe Facility is a retail agricultural facility whose primary activity is the storage and sale of fertilizers in addition to the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to agricultural operations in Northern California.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia (NH3) and aqua ammonia are received, converted, stored, and distributed for direct application as crop production nutrients.  Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck and stored in either an 18,000-gallon storage tank (bullet) or a 30,050-gallon storage tank.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled is 209,930 pounds.  Aqua ammonia is produced from anhydrous ammonia and stored in a 10,000-gallon storage tank or an 18,000-gallon storage tank at the site.  The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia handled is 204,820 pounds. \n   \n3.    THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\na. Anhydrous Ammonia Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios  \nThe worst-case release scenario is the failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount, which would release 131,288 pounds of anhydrous ammonia; this represents the volume of the largest storage tank limited at 85% of capacity.  The alternative release scenario based on the hazard review (or a more plausible potential incident) is a release from a broken 2-inch diame"

Aqua Ammonia Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios  \nThe worst-case scenario is failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount, which would release 131,670 pounds of aqua ammonia that forms a liquid pool.  The alternative release scenario based on the hazard review (or a more plausible potential incident) is a release from a pipe break modeled with an increased wind speed and \"D\" Stability modeling parameters. \n\n4.    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM    \nThe Facility has implemented the following prevention program elements.\n\nSafety Information:  TSI ensures that information concerning covered processes and regulated substances are up-to-date and available for review by employees.  The most recent review of safety information pertaining to the covered processes took place in January 2009.\n\nHazard Review:  A hazard review of the ammonia processes is conducted every five years or as needed by changes in the processes.  The most recent update of the hazard review was conducted on April 27, 2010.  Results indicate that no high risk hazards were identified through the hazard review update.\n\nOperating Procedures (OPs):  Written standard OPs have been developed for the covered processes and are reviewed and revised as needed.  The OPs were last revised in February 2010.\n\nTraining:  The TSI Facility staff, as well as The Tremont Group, Inc. (Tremont) corporate staff, understands that incidents involving the accidental release of regulated substances can be reduced by having trained operations and maintenance staff.  A training program, which incorporates specific operating procedures and safe work practices, is an essential element of an effective prevention program.  The training program was last reviewed in February 2010.  The current training program is comprised of the following:\nA?    Initial employee training;\nA?    Periodic refresher training;\nA?

Training records for each employee.\n\nMaintenance:  The maintenance program at the Facility is intended to preserve the mechanical integrity of the process equipment to minimize the potential for an accidental release.  The maintenance program includes equipment inspection, preventative maintenance, recordkeeping, and training.  The latest equipment inspections were conducted in December 2009 and the latest review of maintenance procedures was conducted in January 2010.\n\nCompliance Audits:  Periodic compliance audits to assess the effectiveness of the written plan must be conducted every three years.  Records of the audits and follow-up documentation are maintained to indicate findings and resolution of findings.  The most recent compliance audit was conducted on April 27, 2010.\n\nIncident Investigation:  Although no incidents involving regulated substances have occurred at the Facility in the last five years, an incident investigation program is in place.  The program includes investigation requirements and reporting and would be implemented in the event of an incident.\n\nIn addition to the prevention program elements described above, the following chemical-specific prevention steps have been implemented.\nAnhydrous Ammonia and Aqua Ammonia:  The Facility implements the provisions of the A?Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI); California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 8, Subchapter 1, A?Unfired Pressure Vessel Safety OrdersA?; and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.111, A?Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.A?\n\n5.

The CCP was most recently updated on March 30, 2010 and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release of a regulated substance.\n\n7.    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the Facility.  Periodic evaluations will be performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  Specific changes to the anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia processes at the Facility will be implemented as needed.\n"
