This commitment is demonstrated by Sysco's comprehensive accidental release prevention program.  It is Sysco's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if such releases to occur, our highly trained employees are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also coordinated with the Jackson Fire Department, who provides our emergency response services.\r\n\r\n1.2\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled (\u00a768.155(b))\r\nWe have one (1) regulated substance present at our facility. This substance is ammonia (anhydrous). The maximum inventory of ammonia (anhydrous) that is expected to be present in this facility, based on process and operational requirements, is 26,603 pounds (reported as 27,000 to EPA as required to be reported up to two significant digits). \r\n\r\n1.3\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps (\u00a768.155(c))\r\nOur facility has taken the following steps as required by 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA regulations. Our ammonia (anhydrous) process is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. Our facility is also subject to the EPCRA Section 302 reporting requirements. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility. \r\nProcess Safety Information: \r\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our process are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the what-if checklist. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of every five (5) years. Any findings"

These procedures address the various modes of operation such as initial start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and start-up after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process. \r\n\r\nTraining: \r\nOur facility has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with those processes. New employees receive basic classroom training in process operations, followed by on-the job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently. Refresher training on operating procedures is provided at least every three (3) years, and more frequently as needed. \r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity: \r\nSysco Eastern Wisconsin carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operation. Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are given specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner. \r\n\r\nManagement of Change: \r\nWritten procedures are in place at Sysco Eastern Wisconsin to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and processes.

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe start-up prior to placing equipment into operation. \r\n\r\nCompliance Audits: \r\nSysco Eastern Wisconsin conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP regulation are being implemented. These audits are carried out at least every three (3) years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner. \r\n\r\nIncident Investigation: \r\nSysco Eastern Wisconsin promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from recurring. All incident reports are retained for a minimum of five (5) years. \r\n\r\nEmployee Participation: \r\nSysco Eastern Wisconsin believes that process safety management and accident prevention are a team effort.
