PCS employees will mitigate, contain the release, and provide emergency medical treatment for any injured onsite personnel.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Description of the Facility\n\n\n\nThe PCS facility in Aurora, NC covers 12,000 acres and sits along the Pamlico River. The Pamlico River empties into the Pamlico Sound, ten miles downstream of the facility. The Aurora facility is the world's largest vertically integrated fertilizer enterprise. Operations include a phosphate mine, ore refining facilities, sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid plants, fertilizer materials plants, purified phosphoric acid plants and hydrogen fluoride production.\n\n\n\nThe principal raw materials used at the Aurora site are phosphate rock, sulfur and ammonia. Phosphate ore is mined in adjacent open pit mines and transported via water slurry in enclosed pipes to the mineral processing area. Elemental sulfur is transported in railcars and barges to the facility where it is used to produce sulfuric acid, which in turn is used to produce phosphoric acid. The phosphoric acid is used as the feedstock to produce solid or liquid fertilizers. Ammonia, in anhydrous form, is transported to the plant in railcars or trucks where it is used to make solid and liquid fertilizers by reacting with phosphoric acid.  The anhydrous ammonia is transferred from the railcars and trucks to storage containers in a specially designed and built facility that incorporates essential safety features.\n\n\n\n The AHF production produces liquid AHF that will be stored in two of three storage tanks.   Each tank has a maximum capacity of 71,300 gal and an operating capacity of 57,040 gal.  One tank is kept empty and available in the event one of the primary tanks develops a leak and the inventory needs to be transferred to the empty tank.  The three storage tanks are located within a larger containment tank.  The temperature of the AHF in the storage tanks i"

The storage tanks and containment tank are vented to a scrubber to minimize potential releases of HF to the atmosphere.\n\n\n\nThe AHF in the storage tanks is pumped into railcars for subsequent staging onsite prior to being shipped offsite.  The railcars are loaded in an enclosure that is adjacent to the containment tank.  Each railcar has a maximum capacity of 21,850 gal and a maximum loaded capacity of 161,690 lb of AHF.  The loaded railcars are moved to an onsite staging area prior to being shipped offsite. \n\n\n\nPCS Phosphate Aurora facility employs approximately 885 people and because of its isolated location, the facility has its own medical facilities, fire response team, hazardous materials response team, rescue team and medical response team.\n\n\n\n\n\n  General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe PCS Aurora facility is in full compliance with the OSHA PSM rule. Additionally, the use of Safety and Operating Procedures provide a system to avert accidental releases by focusing on specific components of each RMP/PSM regulated substance. Safety and operating procedure manuals consist of safety and operating procedures, uniquely designed for specific job tasks associated with RMP/PSM regulated substances.  These manuals are reviewed annually and revised as necessary to address any changes.  \n\n\n\nAmmonia: Every inbound anhydrous ammonia shipment receives detailed inspections.  Employees and contractors are trained regularly to ensure proficiency in phases of the operation. The ammonia handling system is constructed of stainless steel in many areas. Operating control systems, video surveillance, and ammonia detection systems provide opportunity for quick response to changes in operating conditions in the railcar and truck unloading areas and ammonia storage area. Emergency shut off valves and a water deluge system aid in mitigation if a release occurs.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous"

Operating control systems, video surveillance, and HF detection systems provide the opportunity for quick response to any changes in operating conditions in the plants and at the railcar loading area. The railcars are loaded within an enclosed building equipped with HF detection and deluge showers.  The plant storage tanks for AHF are located inside of a secondary containment tank.  HF containing vessels within the plants are equipped with chilled water-cooling jackets to keep stored HF at a stable temperature.  Emergency shut off valves and a water deluge system aid in mitigation if a release occurs.\n\n\n\nPreventive maintenance programs, testing, calibrations, routine maintenance, inspections, replacement of equipment as necessary, and training of personnel all contribute to the prevention of a release.  A work order system is in place to formally report deficiencies and track them until rectified.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe PCS Aurora facility has had no accidents in the past 5 years that is required to be reported in the RMP.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe PCS Aurora facility has developed a Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan (CEMP) designed to address prevention, preparation, response, and recovery from a wide variety of potential emergencies to include an accidental release of a regulated substance at the facility. The facility, its employees, and business operations are susceptible to emergencies, such as natural disasters, severe weather and man-made hazards.  The CEMP, in conjunction with the Risk Management Program and OSHAs Process Safety Management for Highly Hazardous Chemicals Program (PSM), aid in managing potential emergency situations.\n\n\n\nThe facility maintains an aggressive training program for all members of its four emergency response teams (medical, hazardous materials, technical rescue and fire), its emergency managem"
