Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\n\n\n\nThe management and employees of AGRILAND FS INC. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Avoca fire department, Pottawattamie LEPC, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2. The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient. The storage and handling system consists of storage tanks, loading risers, associated plumbing and nurse tanks.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\n\n\n3. The accidental release prevention program.\n\n\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n\n\n5. Five year accident history.   \n\n\n\nThere has been one accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n- have caused injury\n\n- to our knowledge, have not resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nNovember 13, 2013 - An employee was injured while putting the liquid transfer hose on nurse tank.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.
