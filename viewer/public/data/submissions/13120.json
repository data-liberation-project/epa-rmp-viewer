The same properties that make chlorine valuable as a commodity also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our personal health as well as that of our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle procudures that we use, and the training of our personnel.\n\nThe emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to manufacture secondary alluminum alloy ingot.  Chlorine is recived in one ton containers.  Access to the site is restriced to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.  the regulated substance handled at this facility is chlorine.  The total inventory of chlorine at this plant is 12,000 pounds.\n\n3.  The Worst-Case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario\n\nWorst-Case Scenario - Falure of a (1) one ton container of chlorine would release 2,000 lbs of chlorine.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released as vapor, which is heavier than air.  The destance to the endpoint of 0.0087 mg/l (3 ppm) will be determined by the model you use.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - The valve of a one ton cylinder is sheared off accidentally.  The distance to the endpoint of .0087 mg/l (3 ppm) is determined by the conditions and the model you use.  This has the potential to extend past the facility's boun"

Our goal is to have as safe of a work place as possible.\n\n7.
