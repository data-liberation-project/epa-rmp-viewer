      "SummaryText": "ES.1     INTRODUCTION\n\nThe Lawton Water Treatment Plant (WTP) located  in Medicine Park, Oklahoma, uses chlorine gas as a disinfectant. The concentrated form of this disinfection agent, before it is mixed with water, can be extremely hazardous if a sudden release of the vessel contents occurs. Chlorine gas is carefully stored and handled to prevent its accidental release. This Risk Management Plan (RMP) describes the chemical hazards of chlorine gas and explains what the Lawton WTP is doing to prevent an accidental release. This plan has been developed and implemented in accordance with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency EPA) Accidental Release Prevention Provisions regulations (40 CFR 68) and guidelines.\n\nThe Lawton WTP currently has a stationary source subject to EPA RMP regulations. The WTP chlorine  feeder room  consists of chlorinators that introduces chlorine gas into process water for disinfection. The chlorine feeder room is equipped with a ventilation system that, under normal operations, is on standby. A chlorine detector monitors the air within the room for chlorine gas. In the event that the concentration of chlorine gas exceeds 1 part per million (ppm) the leak detector alarm is sounded.\n\nThe Chlorine Cylinder Storage Building  is used to store up to thirteen 1-ton chlorine cylinders. This storage building is for cylinders, which are used for disinfection on an as-needed basis. The cylinders are stored under a sheet-metal roof to protect the cylinders from the elements. They are placed on trunnions in a horizontal position on a concrete pad.\n\nThe following regulated substance  at the Lawton WTP is stored in quantities above the applicable EPA RMP threshold quantity:\n\nLawton Water Treatment Plant                    Chlorine             7782-50-5                        26,000\n \n\nThe following is a brief description of the contents of the Executive Summary:\n\n* Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n* Worst-case and alternative"

Safety, environmental protection, and risk management programs are fully implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response efforts.\n\nES.3     WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nDispersion modeling was performed to estimate areas that could be affected by a worst-case release scenario under the least favorable weather conditions. Prevention and control measures were not considered in evaluating the worst-case release scenario.\n\nEPA established the release rate for the worst-case release scenario as the greatest quantity held in a single vessel or pipe divided by a 10-minute release duration. At the Lawton WTP, the worst-case scenario would consist of an accidental release of the contents of a 1-ton cylinder of chlorine gas at the WTP. The entire contents were assumed to be released at a rate of 200 pounds per minute. A major release of this magnitude is extremely rare because of the robust design of 1-ton containers and the rigorous maintenance and prevention programs. Potential causes could include faulty container construction, fall from a crane, severe corrosion. In a severe accident, it was assumed that the enclosure (Chlorine Storage Building) could potentially fail as a result of pressure buildup. Using RMP Comp software, the worst-case downwind distance to the EPA endpoint"

      "SummaryText": "concentration was 3.5 miles.\n\nThis worst-case scenario represents the maximum conceivable impact for a release.  Release reporting databases, and industry experience suggest that the worst-case release scenario is so unlikely that it should not be the basis for emergency planning.\n\n\nES.4     ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nDispersion modeling was also performed to estimate the affected areas for at least one alternative release scenario for each regulated substance in a regulated process. Alternative release scenarios for the WTP were evaluated.  The alternative release scenario for the WTP plant is based on a split or the decoupling of a 0.375-inch connector between the cylinder and header, resulting in the release of 317 pounds of chlorine gas over a 60-minute period. If the building is assumed to fail (as a result of buildup of internal pressure), the distance to the toxic endpoint (plume distance) was estimated to be approximately 0.6 miles (988 yards) downwind of the WTP. If the plume dispersion is mitigated by the building, the plume distance is estimated to be approximately 725 yards. Based on the lower release rate for this alternative release scenario, the building is likely to successflilly mitigate the release.\n\nThe most effective reduction in any risk to the community is achieved by focusing emergency planning on responding to the alternative release scenarios.\n\nES.5     FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nUnder the RMP regulations, an accidental release is defined as a release of a regulated substance that \"resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\" Within the past 5 years, the Lawton WTP has had an accidental release that met the EPA RMP Rules definition of an accidental release.\n\nES.6     PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nUnder the EPA RMP regulations, three levels of prevention program requirements have been established to match the l"
