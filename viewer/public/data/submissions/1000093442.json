The basic aspects of this program include (1) training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting equipment deficiencies, when identified and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\r\n\r\nEnterprise incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps insure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices\r\n\r\nThe Apex Propane terminal has long standing safe work practices in place to help insure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include: (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to insure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping and equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work) and (5) a permit and procedure to insure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.

The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\r\n\r\nRelease Containment and Control\r\n\r\n* Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\r\n* Automatic shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high flow).\r\n*Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., excess flow shutdown, backed up by a technician activated ESD system.). \r\n* Automatic relief devices.\r\n\r\nRelease Mitigation\r\n\r\n* Hand-held fire extinguishers \r\n* Personnel trained in emergency response and procedures.\r\n* Personnel protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing, hard hat, flame retardant clothing, safety glasses, etc.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nA release occurred at the Apex Propane terminal that meet the criteria set forth in 40 CFR 68.10 as an RMP incident on December 9, 2013.  It is detailed in Section 6 of the RMP registrations.\r\n\r\nEmergency Procedures Information\r\n\r\nThe Apex Propane Terminal currently utilizes an emergency procedure which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The procedures are for the possibility of a fire or explosio"

      "SummaryText": "e refresher training on the operating procedures to insure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at lease every three years.  All of this training is documented for each operator including the means to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe Apex Propane terminal uses contractors during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the propane terminal facility has procedures in place to insure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules and (6) inform Propane terminal facility personnel of any hazards that they find while performing their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with an orientation session that covers (1) a process overview, (2) information about the safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements and (4) safe work practices prior to beginning their work.  In addition, the Apex Propane Terminal facility evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the contractor selection process.  Enterprise personnel will periodically monitor contractor performance to insure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.  \r\n\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\r\n\r\nThe Apex Propane terminal facility conducts a PSSR on any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to insure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all"

      "SummaryText": "n if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in the emergency procedures, and they are updated when necessary based on modifications made to the Propane Terminal facility.   \r\n\r\nThe overall emergency procedure program is coordinated with the Wake County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings with the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives.  The Apex Propane Terminal has instituted necessary around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and local emergency responders (e.g. fire department).  This will provide a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to the planned periodic LEPC meetings, the Apex Propane Terminal conducts periodic reviews of emergency procedures with the fire department emergency response organization.  The Apex Propane Terminal facility also currently provides periodic refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of the regulated substances handled by the propane terminal.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nThe Apex Propane Terminal facility resolves all findings from PHA's, some of which result in modifications to the process.  Changes are usually planned in response to PHA's, safety audits and incident investigation findings.  Changes may also be installed as a result of employee operations or safety improvement suggestions.   At the current time, the following changes planned for the Apex Propane Terminal are being installed to improve facility safety.\r\n\r\n* No changes are planned at the facility."

      "SummaryText": "icantly from the original design safety features, the propane terminal facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the responses to the team findings are also documented and retained.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe Apex Propane terminal maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations such as; (1) start-up, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.  Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.\r\n\r\nThe intent of the operating procedures is to provide workable, useful and clearly written instructions for conducting operating activities.  To have effective operating procedures, the task and procedures directly and indirectly related to the covered process must be appropriate, clear, consistent and most importantly communicated to employees.  Operating procedures are specific instructions or details on what steps are taken or followed in carrying out the stated procedures.  The specific instructions include the applicable safety precautions and appropriate information on safety implications.  \r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nIn addition to training on operating procedures, the Apex Propane Terminal has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the facility.  New employees receive basic training in equipment and process flows,refrigeration sytem operation and LPG truck loading procedures.  In addition, all operators periodically receiv"
