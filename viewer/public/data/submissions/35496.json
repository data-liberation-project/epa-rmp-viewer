The TOHO Water Authority takes the community's safety seriously and protects this community by disinfecting drinking water before it enters your home and disinfecting wastewater prior to re-entry into the environment.\n\nChemicals are an important part of this industry.  The TOHO Water Authority is committed to using chlorine safely for the disinfection of your water and wastewater and, along with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) would like the public to know about the chemicals that may be stored in the community.\n\nThe Parkway WTP operates a chlorination process to disinfect raw water to drinking water standards.  This process requires a total of 8,000 lbs of chlorine in storage and in use.  As a result of the quantity of chlorine at this facility and to ensure a safe environment for its employees and the public, the TOHO Water Authority complies with hundreds of regulatory standards at its treatment facilities.  Providing an RMP for its treatment facilities is one way in which the TOHO Water Authority complies.\n\nThe staff monitors the site daily and routinely checks and maintains the chlorination equipment to prevent accidents.  Plant operators are trained to respond to leaks, receive 24-hour training to \"Technician\" level per OSHA Standard.  Operators receive an 8-hour refresher course annually.  All other employees that may come in contact with chlorine receive instruction to identify chlorine leaks and initiate response procedures.\n\nThe TOHO Water Authority and EPA would like to inform the public of the measures taken to assure public safety.  In the rare event of a chemical release, the staff is knowledgeable of the potential affected area so that they may implement a response system that will minimize the affects of the leak.  Part of being prepared is determining the possible limits of influence for a hy"

      "SummaryText": "pothetical release scenario.  Two models were obtained-one using a \"worst case\" scenario as stipulated by EPA and another \"alternate case\" scenario which predicts a possible outcome for a more reasonable, yet conservative, release scenario.  For the worst case scenario, it is assumed that all equipment fails and that an entire one-ton cylinder would release in ten (10) minutes under very stable atmospheric conditions and a low 3 mph wind speed.  The distance to endpoint for this model is 1.3 miles.  For the alternate release scenario, it is assumed that all safety equipment fails and that an entire one-ton cylinder would release in ten (10) minutes under moderately stable atmospheric conditions and a six mph wind speed.  The distance to endpoint for this model is 0.6 miles.  This facility is equipped with a chlorine leak detector which, in the event of a release, will send an alarm in which operators will respond to.  \n\nThe TOHO Water Authority has established a Safety Management Plan which complies with OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.119.  The plan includes information and instruction on handling chemicals at the treatment facilities along with a Hazard Communication Program, Chlorine Handling Policy and Procedures, and Chlorine Information and Instructional Guides.  \n\nThis facility has has no reportable accidents within the last five years.  The TOHO Water Authority is committed to keeping its staff trained and its emergency response procedures current.  Procedures have been updated to ensure rapid response to any potential accident.  The facility staff are trained in safe handling of chlorine equipment and cylinders and responding to leaking chlorine equipment.  Public outreach seminars have also been held to make the public aware of this and other similar facilities within the area.\n\nThe TOHO Water Authority continuously strives for quality water and wastewater treatment and the safest conditions possible to protect its community."
