THE FACILITY POLICY\nThe owner ,management and employees of Consumers Co-op Assn. Are commited to the prevention of any accidental release\nof anhydrous and propane . If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any minimize the impact of the release to people and the enviroment.\n\n2 FACILITY INFORMATION\n The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizer for the sale to farmers, and propane sales and delivery.Anhydrous ammoina is received , store and distributes for direct application . Anhydrous ammoina is used for the crop production nutrients . Propane gas is received, stored and distributed for delivery forhome heating, farm and commerical business uses.\nThe maximum quanity of ammonia stored would be 400,000 pounds in our 26,000 storage tanks.The maxium quantity handled would be the unloading of a tank truck holdin 40,000 pounds.\nThe maxium quantity of propane gas stored would be 220,000 pounds in our two 30,000 gallon storage tanks. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a tank truck of holding 40,000 pounds.\n\n3 The worest-case release scenario and the alternative releasescenario .\n A. The worest-case release scenario for anhydrous ammiona would be the release of the contnts of a storage tank released as a gas over ten minutes . The maxium quanitity released would br 120,000 pounds , which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards . Th edistance the end point (point of dispersion to 200ppm) is 1.09 miles.\nHe worset case release scenario for propanewould be the failure of one 30,000 gallon storage tank when filled to 85 percent capacity (150,000 pounds) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion causing a 1 "
