Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe management of Fresh Express is committed to maintaining a safe work environment. The EHS Manager has been assigned to ensure that safe practices are followed in the specification and operation of systems involving hazardous chemicals. This site coordinates with the Grand Prairie Fire Department to ensure rapid and appropriate response to ammonia emergencies. The site has specific and written evacuation and reporting procedures in place to protect Fresh Express employees, the public, and the environment in the event of an ammonia release.\n\n\n\n1.2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe Fresh Express plant covered by this RMP is located at 2370 W. Warrior Trail, Grand Prairie, Texas.\n\nThe facility receives lettuce and other produce to be processed, packaged for consumer use in various salad mixes, set for short-term storage, and transported and distributed from this site. \n\n\n\nThe regulated substance is anhydrous ammonia. One fixed ammonia refrigeration system is used for refrigerating produce at various temperatures. Fresh Express has developed a Risk Management Program in compliance with the Environmental Protection Agency's final Rule 40 CFR Part 68.  The regulated substance is anhydrous ammonia with a total inventory charge over the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.  Since the facility is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's PSM Standard 29 CFR 1910.119, Program 3 is required.\n\n\n\n1.3. Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nPrevention of accidental ammonia release at Fresh Express is accomplished through sound industry practice in the original ammonia refrigeration system design and construction, the specification and review of system modifications, and the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the system.\n\nThis includes:\n\n* Compliance with industry standards and codes in effect at the time of "

Five Year Accident History\n\nBetween August 2015 (the previous re-validation of the site program) and the present, no ammonia releases resulted in onsite or off-site injuries, deaths, or property damage, or off-site environmental damage.\n\n\n\n1.5. Emergency Response Program\n\nFresh Express is included in the written community emergency response plan.  The facility has its own emergency action plan.  The emergency action plan includes procedures for informing the public and local response agencies of a chemical release.  The emergency action plan also includes information on emergency health care.\n\n\n\nFresh Express does not respond to emergencies.  Fresh Express coordinates its Emergency Action Plan with the Grand Prairie Fire Department. \n\n\n\n1.6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nFresh Express has performed a hazard analysis, compliance audits, and a mechanical integrity audits per their Process Safety Management and Risk Management programs.  Areas for improvement were identified and corrective actions recommended.  All recommendations are promptly addressed.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"
