The NGL plant, located in the Rangely Weber Sand Unit field, is approximately three miles west of the naturally occurring hydrocarbon gas.  Chevron has five (5) employees assigned to the NGL Plant.\n\nThe primary activities of the NGL Plant involving RMP regulated substances are recovering a natural gas liquid (NGL) product by chilling a gas stream containing liquefiable hydrocarbons.  A distillation process is used to purify the hydrocarbons that condense as a result of chilling the gas stream.  The NGL product contains propane, butane, isobutene, pentane, isopentane, and heavier hydrocarbon liquids.\n\nThe chilling effect required to recover NGL is provided by a refrigeration system.  The refrigeration system re-circulates a refrigerant to remove heat from the gas stream being processed.  The refrigerant used in the chilling process is 98% propane and 2% ethane.  The NGL extraction process and the propane refrigeration process are Program Level 1.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIt is the policy of Chevron USA Production Company to conduct its business in a socially responsible and ethical manner that protects safety, health and the environment.  The RWSU Emergency Preparedness and Response Policy involves assessing the hazards and risks of an unplanned incident; developing a plan for managing those hazards and risks; communicating relevant information to employees, contractors and appropriate agencies; and conducting emergency exercises. \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nChevron encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participate as"

Employees have access to all information created as part of the RWSU accident prevention program element. \n\nThe RWSU NGL plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operations of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemicals inventories and equipment designs basis/configuration information.  Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). \n\nFor The NGL extraction process and the propane refrigeration process, Chevron has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g. temperature, pressure, level, flow,) in the plant instrumentation systemA?s, A?point detailA? directory.  Chevron ensures that the processes are maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel and protective instrument systems (e.g. automated shutdown systems)\n\nThe RWSU NGL plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \n\nThe RWSU NGL plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal shutdown, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, and (5) normal shutdown.  To implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operation the NGL plant. \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe RWSU NGL plant has an excellent record of accident prevention.  There have been no releases from the RMP Covered processes in the last five years. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe RWSU NGL plant maintains a written "

The Emergency Action Plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including: proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency duties.  The Emergency Action Plan is updated when necessary, based on modifications made to processes or other RWSU plant facilities.  The Emergency Action Plan changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes."
