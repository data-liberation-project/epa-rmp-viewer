The following areas are addressed in this summary:\n\u00b7Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\u00b7Stationary Source Activities and Regulated Substances Handled\n\u00b7Worst-Case and Alternative-Case Release Scenarios\n\u00b7Prevention Program\n\u00b7Five-Year Accident History\n\u00b7Emergency Response Program\n\u00b7Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nRiver Ranch Fresh Foods (RRFF) committed to complying with all of the regulatory requirements of the EPA Risk Management Program. RRFF has developed their Risk Management Plan / Process Safety Management (RMP/PSM) Manual to document RRFF policies addressing the implementation of these regulations. The PSM sections pertain to the prevention of accidental releases and include the Process Hazard Analysis study and procedures for operating, training, maintenance, emergency response, and others. The RMP sections pertain to management systems and include the Hazard Assessment (Offsite Consequence Analysis) Report.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE ACTIVITIES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nThe RRFF Salinas facility is provide product cooling, processing, and short-term storage for fresh vegetables.\n \nThe facility is located in an industrial area of Salinas. Ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the Main Plant Refrigeration System (\"System\"). This is a direct, mechanical refrigeration system. The original facility was built about 1975 and has been expanded and modified since then. The majority of the ammonia equipment is located in the Engine Room or Cold Room. The recirculator packages, evaporative condensers and most chillers plus  their associated valves and piping are  located outside.\n\nA portion of the ammonia equipment is portable and is moved on and off site annually. The local produce season typically runs  April through November . The interconnecting piping b"

Other than this paragraph, these systems are not addressed in the EPA RMP submission; however, they are addressed in the RMP as required by the California Accidental Release and Prevention Program (CalARP). These systems are:\n\tRoom 5/HS02 Ammonia Refrigeration System\n\tVacuum Tube Ammonia Refrigeration System (R57/T57)\n\tVacuum Tube Ammonia Refrigeration System (PT/High Side)\n\nAccess to the facility is limited by a continous fence and gates on the property perimeter. Security guard monitor and control site entrance and exit at the main gate.\n\nWORST-CASE SCENARIO ANALYSIS\nThe regulation requires that the Worst-Case Release Scenario use the ammonia quantity in the largest vessel or pipe. Administrative controls were considered in determining the largest quantity. The RP1 vessel is the largest outdoor vessel. The Worst Case Scenario is therefore based on the RP1 vessel at its High Level ammonia charge, which is less than the full ammonia inventory. . (Note: While the indoor High Pressure Receiver (HPR) is the largest vessel, the Engine Room limits the endpoint distance. As such the RP1 vessel provided the larger endpoint distance.)\n\nThe modeling program provided by the EPA, RMP*Comp, was used to model the scenario. A release of 4,440 lbs was modeled and resulted in a 0.4 mile endpoint (radius) at 200 PPM. For more details, see the \"Toxics: Worst Case\" section of this RMP report. \n\nNOTE: It is important to consider that the Worst-Case Scenario is extremely unlikely to occur since this scenario does not consider any safety features of the system  - in either design or operation. The scenario parameters are established by the regulation to provide uniformity for dialog between the industry, community, and regulatory agencies.\n\n\nALTERNATE-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO ANALYSIS\nThe Alternate-Case Scenario select"

In selecting the scenario, the Process Hazard Analysis was considered. Of the potential \"causes of deviation\", this scenario was selected because it would require human error by way of lack of maintenance.\n\nALOHA, a modeling program approved by the EPA, was used to model the scenario. A release of 3,237 lbs was modeled and resulted in a 0.24 mile endpoint (radius) at 200 PPM. For more details, see the \"Toxics: Alternate Case\" section of this RMP report.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\nRRFF's Prevention Program is described in the RMP/PSM Manual. The RMP Prevention Program is equivalent to OSHA's Process Safety Management Program (PSM). The Prevention Program implemented by RRFF is essential to help prevent releases and to minimize the effects if a release does occur.\nKey objectives of RRFF's Prevention Program are briefly described below:\n\n1.Maintain current and complete refrigeration system technical information. (Addressed under the Process Safety Information chapter)\n2.Provde thorough team evaluation of the refrigeration system. The evaluation considers a number of potential problems including: mechanical problems, human errors, and external events (e.g., earthquakes). All safety recommendations developed by the team are reviewed and addressed by RRFF. (Addressed under Process Hazard Analysis chapter.)\n3.Written procedures and policies that establish how the refrigeration system should be operated and maintained and how to investigate accidental releases. (Addressed under Operating Procedures, Mechanical Integrity, and Incident Investigation chapters.)\n4.Certification of refrigeration operators to safely operate the refrigeration system. RRFF certifies operators following completion of operator training and RRFF's confirmation of the operator's ability apply what they have learned.

      "SummaryText": "ram. This is addressed on two levels. First, refrigeration equipment operators participate in the planning and evaluation of the Prevention Programs (e.g., Process Hazard Analysis study team, writing and/or reviewing operating procedures, Incident Investigation team, etc.). This involvement encourages ownership of the Prevention Program and positively affects the operators' day-to-day activities.  \nSecond, all RRFF employees (direct hires and contract) at this facility receive ammonia awareness training. Additionally, they have access to the RMP/PSM information. These activities improve the overall safety of the employees. (Both levels are addressed under Employee Participation chapter)\n6.Implementation of additional measures when changes are planned  (procedural or mechanical). These measures begin before any changes are made and may include a Process Hazard Analysis, operator training, and Process Safety Information updates plus other measures required by RRFF's Management of Change Procedure.  \nIf a mechanical change is required and for maintenance contracts, RRFF has a procedure for selecting a contractor based on the company's experience and safety history. Additionally, if welding, grinding, or other \"Hot Work\" occurs inside the building and close to the refrigeration system, a RRFF Hot Work permit is required. The purpose of the permit and the associated Hot Work procedure is to minimize the possibility of a fire. \nFollowing completion of a mechanical change, a pre-startup safety review is required before the system can be started. (These areas are addressed under Management of Change, Contractor Qualifications, Hot Work Permit, and Pre-Start-up Safety Review chapters.)\n7.Verification of RRFF's compliance with the RMP/PSM program. This self-audit process is an important tool to confirm whether each of the elements in the Prevention Program  (and the Risk Management Program) has been implemented and properly documented by RRFF personnel.

(Addressed under RRFF's Illness and Injury Prevention Program.)\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe RRFF facility  had  no reportable accidental ammonia releases in the last five years.\n\n  \nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nRRFF's Emergency Response Program is described in their Emergency Response Plan for the Salinas facility.\n\nThis plan includes planned responses and procedures for evacuations, notifying responders and governmental agencies. The plan also includes first aid procedures for immediate care and instructions for follow-up medical care when necessary. The plan addresses training requirements for employees including production employees, supervisors, managers, and operators. Evacuation drills are an important part of the training. \n\nUnder RRFF's Emergency Response policy, RRFF employees who have been trained as \"First Responders\" may initially respond to releases that can be addressed without entering the danger area (i.e. de-energizing equipment). RRFF will evacuate affected area, begin notification process, and rely on off-site responders (e.g., the fire department, portable ammonia equipment supplier and/or refrigeration contractor).\n\n \nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) study team developed recommendations to improve safety and to reduce the possibility of a release.\nKey recommendations identified during study included;\n\n\u00b7 Develop more written policies and procedures \n\u00b7 Pipe PRVs, which currently vent to atmosphere, to the ammonia diffusion tank\n\nRRFF has reviewed recommendations and decided to implement the recommended measures.
