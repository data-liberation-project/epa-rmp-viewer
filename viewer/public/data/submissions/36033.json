In compliance with applicable Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requirements, the ACH Food Companies, Inc. Risk Management Program document, which is sumarized by this plan, describes the following components of a RMP:\n\n   -  A hazard assesment program that identifies and analyzes the potential on-siteand off-site impact of a worst-case alternate release scenarios of regulated substances, and includes documentation of five year accident histories involving regulated substances.\n\n   -  An accidential release prevention program that covers operating procedures, maintenance, mechanical intergity, training, management of change, process safety information, and other similar information involving ammonia.\n\n   -  An emergency action plan to mitigate any accidential releases that occur.\n\n   -  An overall system to manage the development and implementation of a risk management system.\n\nThe plan is submitted in accordance with applicable regulations for the on-site refrigeration process covered by RMP regulations.\n\nThe subject ACH facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia (CAS No. 7664-41-7) as a refrigerant to maintain the proper temperature in food manfacturing operations.\n\nThe refrigeration process uses anhydrous ammonia at a stationary source in amounts greater than the RMP threshold of 10,000 pounds and a catastropic release of this substance could impact public receptors.  Therefore, the subject facility is regulated by Program 3 requirements.\n\nThere have been no reportable accidents involving ammonia within the past 5 years.\n\nThe facility has performed a worst case release scenario which estimates a potential loss of eight thousand pounds of ammonia which could potentially travel up to one-half mile.  In the alternative, the facility has evaluated a five hundred pound release which could travel up"

Emergency actions for the subject ACH facility have been coordinated with the local fire department and the local emergency planning commision.\n\nThe ACH Risk Management Program will be revised as necessary to ensure compliance with applicable RMP regulations and to improve safety."
