Should an accidental release occur, the facility has oriented the local fire deparment and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\nFacility information: The primary acitivity at the facility is the storage for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient. The maximum quantity stored would be 370,000# in the facility's two storage tanks and nurse tanks.\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as a gas over ten minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 75,000#, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards and company procedures. The distance to the endpoint of dispersion based on the model used is 2 miles.\nThe alternative-case release scenario is assumed to be a release from the rupture of a 180 inch transfer hose, with 40# released over 2 minutes. The distance to the endpoint of dispersion is .25 miles.\nThe accidental release program: The facility complies with the rules and regulations relating to the handling of anhydrous ammonia and low pressure nitrogen solutions, equipment, containers, and storage facilities. These regulations administered by the Illinois Department of Ag are consistent with ANSI K61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\nThe five-year accident history: There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant "

Our emergency plan has been reviewed with the local fire department and provided to the local emergency planning committee for coordination in the community response planning.\nPlanned changes to improve safety: Safety improvements is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations. In accordance with the Illinois Department of Ag regulations, running board platforms and breakaways are being addressed and will be completed by Fall 2004."
