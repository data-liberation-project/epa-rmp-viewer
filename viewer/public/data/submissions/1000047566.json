The Worst Case Release and the Alternate Case Scenario was not changed in the RMP.\n\n\n\nHarvest Midstream's Kaplan Gas Plant is located in Abbeville, Louisiana.  K-2 is designed to process approximately 200 million standard cubic feet (MMscf) per day of natural gas.  This facility has two vessels along with associated piping and equipment covered under the EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Provision, 40 CFR Part 68.  The vessels have volumes of 12,000 gallons and 30,000 gallons and are used for the temporary storage of natural gas liquids (NGL).  The NGL is temporarily stored until it is sent off site via a natural gas liquids pipeline.  The process meets the Program 3 criteria due to NAICS code and distance to the nearest receptor identified during the evaluation of the worst-case scenario.\n\n\n\nThe site is covered by Program 3. Program 3 requirements include:  1) development of a management system to oversee the implementation of the risk management program elements, 2) completion of a process hazard analysis, 3) development of a prevention program to establish procedures and document information that will help to prevent an accidental release, 4) development of an emergency response program that outlines the necessary procedures and contacts in the event of an accidental release, and 5) the evaluation of a worst case and an alternate scenario of a potential release from the process.\n\n\n\nHarvest Midstream has prepared specific accidental release prevention and emergency response policies to ensure the safety of employees and receptors which fall within the distance of the worst-case scenario endpoint. These policies are documented in written operating and maintenance procedures.\n\n\n\nIn the past 5 years, there have been no accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or si"
