The address is 5300 Cureton Ferry Road, Catawba, South Carolina, 29704-0007. The mill is located in York County, South Carolina. This plant has approximately 940 full time employees. Abitibibowater, Inc. located at 1155 Metcalfe Street, Suite 800, Montreal Quebec, H3B 5S2 is the owner/operator of this plant.\n\nBowater submitted the original Risk Management Plan (RMP) in June of 1999. The original RMP included three regulated chemicals in four covered processes. Since 1999, Bowater has successfully eliminated two RMP covered chemicals and three covered processes. Sulfur dioxide was eliminated from use in the thermo-mechanical pulping system in 1999, and elemaental chlorine was discontinued as a water treatment chemical during 2003. In September 2003, Bowater began operating a new state-of-the-art kraft pulping system , which reduces overall chemical usage, and eliminated elemental chlorine from the paper manufacturing process. \n\nThe remaining RMP covered chemical at the Bowater mill is chlorine dioxide, which is used to brighten pulp from the kraft manufacturing process. Clorine dioxide is also subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations under 29 CFR 1910.119 for Process Safety Management (PSM).  The PSM regulations are applicable based on Bowater's storage of greater than 1000 pounds of chlorine dioxide. The OSHA regulations require the regulated processes to undergo a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) and it must meet all of the other management requirements of the regulations. Bowater has completed and implemented the PSM program for chloring dioxide.\n\nA facility is covered by the RMP rule if it has in inventory a regulated chemical in greater than threshold quantity. For chlorine dioxide the threshhold is 1000 pounds. Therefore, Bowater is also regulated by the RMP regulations.  Since the OSHA PSM program is"

      "SummaryText": " incorporated into the RMP regulations, the discussion below includes PSM concerns. \n\nThe U.S EPA has established three levels of compliance to assure that individual processes are subject to the requirements that match their location, complexity and the risk they pose. \n\n- Program 1 - requirements apply to processes for which a worst case release would not affect the public.\n\n- Program 2 - applies to operators with only moderate complexity, such a retailers, propane distributers and users, and others not subject to OSHA PSM 29 CFR 1910.119.   \n\n- Program 3 - requirements apply to higher risk, complex chemical processing operations identified by certain Standard Industrial Codes (SIC), and to processes already subject to OSHA PSM.\n\nThe Bowater facility, being subject to the OSHA PSM standard for chlorine dioxide falls into the RMP Program 3 category.  An outline of Program 3 has the following major elements:\n\nA) Hazard Review\n     1) Worst Case Analysis\n     2) Alternative Release Analysis\n     3) 5 Year Accident History\n     4) Develop and Implement a Management System\n\nB) Prevention Program\n     1) OSHA PSM Program\n\nC) Develop and Implement and Emergency response Program\n\nD) Risk Management Plan Submittal\n     1) Executive Summary\n     2) Registration\n     3) Worst Case Analysis\n     4) Alternative Realease Scenarios\n     5) 5 Year Accident History\n     6) Prevention/Response Program Data\n     7) Certification\n\nThe RMP regulations require Bowater to provide information to the community on these chemicals, and conduct analyses of the effects these chemicals could potentially have on the surrounding environment, in the event of an accidental release. Bowater has performed this required analysis, however, due to potential security concerns, the reporting requirements are being changed and are not included in this executive summary.\n\nBowater is also subject to EPCRA 302 requirements and the Clean Air Act Title V permit requirements.

The fire department last inspected in December of 2007. \n\nThe RMP regulations require the RMP to be updated within 6 months of a process change requiring a PHA or hazard review or a period of every 5 years. The next 5 year update and resubmission will be due in March 2013. \n\nThe U.S. EPA has proposed several revisions to the RMP regulations that have not been finalized as of this submittal. These requirments will be added as revisions when the changes are finalized."
