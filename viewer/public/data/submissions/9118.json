Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nFarmers Union Oil Co. of Great Falls, as a local farmer owned cooperative, is committed to providing a safe environment to our employees, neighbors, customers, and the protection of natural resources.  This commitment is shown in our steps taken to prevent accidental releases through facility design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and training of employees.  Control measures are implemented to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If a release does occur, we have communicated with the Great Falls Fire Department to provide emergency response expertise.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled \n\nThe Farmers Union Oil Co. facility is an anhydrous ammonia storage tank, providing fertilizer for crop production.  The tank, at Bootlegger  (Figure 1), has a capacity of 30,000 gallons.  The maximum amount stored is 25,500 gallons (132,600 pounds) at the maximum filling capacity of 85%.  \n\n3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe Degadis modeling system was used for the worst case scenario of the offsite consequence analysis for this facility.  The following comments provide the details for this scenario.  \n\nThe worst case release scenario accounts for a catastrophic release of ammonia.  In this case the entire contents of the anhydrous ammonia tank (132,600 pounds) are assumed to be released in a gaseous form in a period of 10 minutes.  The conditions of the release consider a stability Class F, wind speed of 1.5 m/sec., a rural topography, and the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 PPM is 2.41 miles.
