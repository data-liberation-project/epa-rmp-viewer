      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary for Cooperative Elevator Company's :  Ruth ,  Michigan Anhydrous Ammonia Facility:\n\nThis RMP represents an update of the information originally filed. Information has been updated to reflect the fact that this facility has recently had an additional storage tank installed, along with much of the piping and valving being replaced with new.\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\nWe at Cooperative Elevator Co. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our  trained personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We also coordinate with the Sherman Twp. Fire Dept. which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Storage and transfer of agricultural anhydrous ammonia..  \nThe product is stored in four separate storage tanks, three of which are 18,000 gallon capacity, and the one that has a capacity of 30,000 gallons,which,  for safety purposes, are never filled beyond 85% full. There would be 84,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in each  of the 18,000 gallon tanks  when 85% filled, and the 30,000 gallon tank would contain 135,000 pounds of ammonia when 85% filled.  Each tank is valved separately, so that the largest loss of product would be that from the largest tank, in this case that would mean a release of 135,000 pounds of ammonia.\n\n              \n                                                                                                                            "

      "SummaryText": "                  \n\n\n\n\n\n3.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility complies with the requirements of several regulations, including requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. Is also complies with other Federal, and State regulations.\nAdditionally, our facility is inspected regularly by government agencies. Any recommendations made are promptly followed.\n\n4.    Five-year Accident History\nThere have been no accidental releases in the past five years.\n\n\n5.    Emergency Response Plan\nCooperative Elevator Co. has a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes various aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nHuron County is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified. The plan is reviewed at least annually, and promptly updated when necessary.\n\n6.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nAdditional barricades have been installed to prevent facility traffic from entering the area of the piping and storage area."
