Appropriate emergency responses are in effect for dealing with the release of toxic and/or flammable chemicals. \r\nThe Equistar Chemicals Clinton Complex is committed to operating the plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public, and the environment.  The Risk Management Program at the Clinton Complex helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner.  This program is only one component of the safety program at the plant. It is the policy of Equistar to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations, and to act responsibly in the prevention of accidental releases of highly hazardous chemicals.  The plant has a comprehensive safety program in place, establishing many levels of safeguards against a release of a hazardous substance as well as injuries and damage from a release of a hazardous substance.  \r\n \r\n\r\nThe TheEquistar Clinton Complex has consists of the following facilities processes that are covered by this Rule:  High Density and Low Density Polyethylene production, and Ethylene production areas.  The Clinton plant?s key products are ethylene, low density polyethylene, and high density polyethylene.  The Clinton plant uses feedstocks of ethane and propane.  \r\n\r\nAn Equistar Chemical Corporation RMP Policy has been created to provide a management system for implementing the Rule at covered Corporate sites. \r\n\r\nThe toxic substances handled in those covered areas area may be as follows: Ammonia (conc. 20% or greater), chlorine, and Vinyl acetate monomer.   \r\n\r\nThe flammable substances handled in those covered areas may beare as follows:  Acetylene, 1,3-Butadiene, Butane, Ethane, Ethylene, Hydrogen, Isobutane, Isopentane, Methane, 3-Methyl-1-butane, 2-Methyl-1-butane, Pentane, Propane, and Propylene."

      "SummaryText": "An Equistar Chemical Corporation RMP Policy has been created to provide a management system for implementing the Rule at covered corporate sites. \r\n\r\nThe general accidental release prevention program for this site is the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, which has been implemented and is in effect. Auxiliary programs such as Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures and Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan are in place and effective.  The Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures procedure establishes the proper course of action in the event of the discharge of a hazardous substance or oil.  Additionally, preventive measures and precautions pertaining to specific hazardous substances handled and stored at Equistar are described.\r\n \r\n\r\nThe chemical-specific precaution steps for this facility primarily concentrates on the class of chemicals known as flammables.  These steps are as follows:\r\n\r\n General\r\n\r\n Measures to prevent the release of propylene flammables are centered around complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements.  Using the standards of OSHA PSM and American Petroleum Institute (API), Propylene flammables handlers have designed their equipment and procedures to minimize the risk of a propylene release.  Preventive measures that can be used to minimize risks are described below.\r\n\r\nFirst, there are some General preventive measures dictated by OSHA's PSM standards that are strictly followed to minimize the risk of propylene releases are described below..\r\n\r\n1.  A complete, in-depth process hazard analysis is completed every five years by qualified personnel as specified by OSHA's PSM standard.\r\n\r\n2.  Operating procedures are used for directing and training the operators who are requalified every three years.\r\n\r\n3.  Operators, maintenance, and contractor personnel working with or close to propylene related equipment are trained and qualified to handle it safely.\r\n\r\n4.

All critical equipment is set up on a periodic inspection plan to assure proper operating condition.\r\n\r\n6.  Pre-startup reviews are held prior to starting new or modified equipment to insure that all conditions are satisfied for a safe operation\r\n\r\n7.  Engineers, operators and maintenance complete a safety checklist prior to making a change in equipment or significant operating condition.\r\n\r\n8.  Routine audits are conducted to assure safe practices are followed.\r\n\r\n9.  All incidents are investigated and actions are taken to prevent recurrence. \r\n\r\nSecond, there are preventive measures specific to propylene that have been identified by handlers to minimize the risk of propylene releases for certain situations.\r\n\r\n10.  Propylene Flammable tank car unloading is closely monitored.  In some cases, propylenegas detection alarms are used and will quickly identify a leak.\r\n\r\n11.  Automatic shut-off valves for shutting down the propylene unloading process can be activated by low unloading pressure, leak detection, and manually from different plant locations.\r\n\r\n12.  Propylene Flammable unloading station can be isolated from other operations to reduce exposure to any fires or other accidents.\r\n\r\n13.  Water deluge systems can be used to displace propylene flammable gas vapors if a leak should occur.  Also water deluge systems are used to cool vessels and pipelines during a fire situation.\r\n\r\n14.  Critical processes can be computer controlled to ensure continuous monitoring of all operating parameters and immediate shutdown of the production units.\r\n\r\n15.  Propylene is flammable gases are stored under two types of conditions.  One is under high pressure at ambient temperature and the other is low pressurelow-pressure low temperature.  High-pressure tanks use refrigeration constructed with over one inch thick steel walls.  The low pressurelow-pressure tanks use refrigeration to store the product.  Both tanks"

The Clinton Plant has an emergency response team on each shift, available 24 hours per day, to respond and initiate response actions to contain, control, and if possible mitigate the release.  This team has access to on-site emergency equipment, which are appropriate for the anticipated emergency situations and capabilities of Equistar personnel.  Quarterly drills are conducted within the plant to assess and evaluate the emergency response effort at the Clinton Plant.  This could include accountability drills with personnel, evacuation drills, tabletop drills, or drills for the emergency crew only.  Annual drills are done in which  outside agencies such as the Clinton Fire Dept. participate as well.  If assistance is required during an emergency response, Mutual Aid could be activated and requested to provide additional resources as necessary.  The Clinton Plant emergency response procedure has been communicated to the Local Emergency Planning Commission, Fire Department and Law Enforcement.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following are some of the process changes changes that are planned to improve safety at the Equistar Chemicals Clinton site:\r\n\r\n-Install concrete curbing and properly designed sump in py gas loading area to prevent spills.      \r\n-Tie routinely used atmospheric vents in the tank farm into the flare header.\r\n-Re-direct a vent valve outlet to prevent impingement of exhausted gas or steam on any equipment or manifold in the area.\r\n\r\n      \r\n\r\nPROCESSES COVERED BY THE RULE AT PROGRAM 3\r\n\r\nThe Equistar Chemical Corporation Clinton Complex has determined that the following processes are subject to Program 3:  Low Density and High Density Polyethylene production, and Ethylene production.\r\n\r\n\r\nCERTIFICATION\r\n\r\nProgram 3 Process Certification\r\n\r\nBased on the criteria in 40 CFR 68.10, to the best of the signer's knowledge, information, and belief formed after reas"
