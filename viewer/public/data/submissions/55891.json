Safety policies and procedures are also reviewed on an annual basis.  \n\nLocal LEPC and Mt Sterling Fire Department personnel are furnished a copy of the Emergency Action Plan and invited to tour the facility on a regular basis.\n\nThe facility Emergency Action Plan covers such things as accidental releases of plant chemicals, natural disasters, emergency response practices and procedures, and process safety topics.  The plan is reviewed each year with all employees and reviewed with the local fire department on a regular basis.  \n\nD.  Five Year Accident History:\n\nCrop Production Services, Inc., Mt Sterling has an excellent safety record with no deaths or serious injuries to any of its personnel or contractors as a result of the RMP covered process.  In addition, there have been no accidents resulting in releases of ammonia with off site consequences during the entire operations period.  The Mt Sterling plant was presented with a Safety Award for 1998 for No OSHA Recordable Incidents.  Extensive programs and procedures are in place to maintain that record. \n\nE.  In years past, the Mt Sterling plan has received nuisance odor complaints.  In 1996, the plant was voluntarily redesigned to eliminate this problem.  A totally new design was adopted; new equipment was installed; and subsequent environmental control was assured with the performance of a stack test.  As of this date, no more nuisance odor complaints have been made.  As a result, our relationship with the neighbors and community has greatly improved.  \n\nF.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Mt Sterling plant continuously looks for ways to enhance the safety of the plant.  Monthly safety inspections are conducted which result in corrective actions; Process Safety Management audits are conducted every three years; and corporate-sponsored comprehensive En"
