The facility unloads ammonia railcars and trucks into storage tanks.  The ammonia is then used in the production of ammonium polyphosphate liquid fertilizer.  The facility has been in operation since 1976.\n\nCrop Production Services, Inc., Mt Sterling plant has an excellent safety record with no deaths or serious injuries to plant personnel or contractors due to RMP covered process.\n\nThe facility's safety record is a direct result of much emphasis on safety in the plant on the part of management and employees.  \n\nB.  Accidental Release Prevention Policies and Program:   \n\nThe facility is in compliance with OSHA PSM Standards.  Information including piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&ID's); operating procedures, management of change (MOC) documentation, and other pertinent documents are on file in the plant office.  The Crop Production Services, Inc., Environmental, Health & Safety staff furnishes assistance and performs safety and environmental audits.  Additionally, the Crop Production Services, Inc., Safety Coordinator performs safety training on a regular basis.  \n\nThe ammonia tanks and associated equipment is covered by a mechanical integrity inspection and testing schedule and is constantly monitored.  \n\nSafety meetings for all employees are held at this facility.  In addition to safety training classes, each employee has taken numerous computer based training courses.  The Ohio Department of Agriculture annually inspects the ammonia tanks, safety devices and safety equipment.    \n\nCrop Production Services, Inc. believes safety and concerns for the environment must be second nature to all employees and contractor personnel. \n\nC.

Safety policies and procedures are also reviewed on an annual basis.  \n\nLocal LEPC and Mt Sterling Fire Department personnel are furnished a copy of the Emergency Action Plan and invited to tour the facility on a regular basis.\n\nThe facility Emergency Action Plan covers such things as accidental releases of plant chemicals, natural disasters, emergency response practices and procedures, and process safety topics.  The plan is reviewed each year with all employees and reviewed with the local fire department on a regular basis.  \n\nD.  Five Year Accident History:\n\nCrop Production Services, Inc., Mt Sterling has an excellent safety record with no deaths or serious injuries to any of its personnel or contractors as a result of the RMP covered process.  In addition, there have been no accidents resulting in releases of ammonia with off site consequences during the entire operations period.  The Mt Sterling plant was presented with a Safety Award for 1998 for No OSHA Recordable Incidents.  Extensive programs and procedures are in place to maintain that record. \n\nE.  In years past, the Mt Sterling plan has received nuisance odor complaints.  In 1996, the plant was voluntarily redesigned to eliminate this problem.  A totally new design was adopted; new equipment was installed; and subsequent environmental control was assured with the performance of a stack test.  As of this date, no more nuisance odor complaints have been made.  As a result, our relationship with the neighbors and community has greatly improved.  \n\nF.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Mt Sterling plant continuously looks for ways to enhance the safety of the plant.  Monthly safety inspections are conducted which result in corrective actions; Process Safety Management audits are conducted every three years; and corporate-sponsored comprehensive En"
