      "SummaryText": "The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at your facility:\n\nCalgon relies on numerous programs to ensure early identification of and proper response to potential emergencies, including: \n7 training and drills in emergency preparedness, disaster response and control, first-aid, and fire-and-rescue techniques; \n7 frequent auditing of all preparedness programs; safety training and education, and;\n7 regular review, follow-up, and maintenance of all company operations and equipment.  \n\nWe regularly invite local fire departments and emergency responders to tour and inspect our plants, participate in joint emergency drills, and gain familiarity with our operations.  The leader of our plant's emergency response brigade is a Fire Chief for a local Fire Department.    \n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:  \n\nThis facility produces chemicals used primarily for water treatment.  The single regulated substance, cyclohexylamine, is used as a raw material.  Cyclohexylamine is received by tanker truck, stored in a bulk storage tank, and blended with other chemicals to produce water treatment products.  \n\nThe worst-case release scenario:\n\nThe USEPA RMP regulations require the worst-case release scenario to assume that the entire contents of the largest vessel is released.  This event is highly unlikely and has never occurred at our facility.  Based on our analysis using USEPA-approved methods, the worst-case release scenario could potentially affect offsite receptors.  There are no residences within our potential worst-case release scenario impact zone.     \n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThis facility is operated in strict accordance with written operating and maintenance procedures and the operations are ISO 9002 certified.  The ISO program ensures rigorous training for operations employees, numerous management checks and balances, and strict attention to changes"

      "SummaryText": "in the operations.   \n \nFive-year accident history: \n\nWe have never had an accident involving cyclohexylamine that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuation, or sheltering in place.  We have never had any significant spill of cyclohexylamine at our facility.\n  \nThe emergency response program:\n\nOur employees are trained and equipped to offensively respond to accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Our facility is a member of the local industrial Mutual Aid Association who would assist, if necessary, with the response of a catastrophic accidental release.  Our employees regularly undergo training in emergency response activities.  Our facility has a written emergency response plan that is regularly updated.    \n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nWe continually evaluate and implement employee suggestions, implements recommendations resulting from routine hazard reviews, and makes changes to improve safety based on comments and information developed within our organization and the industry.  Toward continuous improvement we are looking at ways to minimize risk through process improvement and re-design.  Our Plant is committed to the Chemical Manufacturers Association's Responsible CareSM Initiative Management Code on Process Safety."
