In 1997, Lloyd's Register Quality Assurance reviewed OIMS and evaluated it against the international standard for Environmental Management Systems (ISO 14001) to determine if OIMS meets the requirements of ISO 14001.  After an extensive review which included a number of facility audits, they concluded that the \"environmental components of OIMS are consistent with the intent and meet the requirements of the ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems Standard.\"  They went on to say, \"We further believe heritage Exxon to be among the industry leaders in the extent to which environmental management considerations have been integrated into its ongoing business processes.\"\n\n\n\nThe ExxonMobil Mont Belvieu Plastics Plant (MBPP) has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety and protecting the environment.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  MBPP has participated in the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) since 1996 when MBPP was awarded \"STAR\" certification.  MBPP has re-certified as a \"STAR\" site in 1999, 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2016.  Our objective is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control, contain, and mitigate the release.\n\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe ExxonMobil Mont Belvieu Plastics Plant, located in Mont Belvieu, Texas, U.S.A., operates two Low Density po"

The LDPE unit scheduled to start operations in July 2017 has several subunits, three of which have more than the Risk Management Program (RMP) regulatory applicability threshold amounts of flammable substances and mixtures and classify as RMP Program 1.  The HDPE unit does not meet the minimum inventories for RMP covered flammables and is not part of this submission.  Thus, MBPP has five RMP-regulated processes within the stationary source boundaries for the purposes of this plan.  The only Program 3 process is Raw Materials and Storage Unit.\n\n\n\nMBPP has several RMP-regulated flammable substances such as ethylene, isobutane, butene-1, and isopentane, plus flammable mixtures containing these and other substances.  Such substances also present in certain subunits in quantities of less than the RMP applicability threshold.  MBPP does not have any RMP-regulated toxics on site except for aqueous ammonia, which is used to control nitrogen oxides emissions from the boilers.  However, the amount of ammonia is much less than the RMP applicability threshold.  \n\n\n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\n\n\nThe hazard assessments were conducted using the equations from the \"Offsite Consequence Analyses (OCA) Guidance\" developed by the EPA.  The endpoint distance calculations were completed in full conformance with the OCA guidelines for both worst case (WCS) and alternate case (ACS) scenarios.  The offsite public receptor locations to determine the program level were completed using the information current as of May 2017.\n\n\n\n\n\nEXTERNAL EVENTS ANALYSIS (Texas Gulf Coast) \n\n\n\nMBPP is subject to external events, which may cause the release of hazardous materials.  MBPP is designed and operated to minimize the probability and the impact of such events.  External events considered in the design and operation of the plant i"

MBPP units were designed to the best wind resistance technology.  MBPP uses an Emergency Preparedness Plan with the latest weather tracking services to identify potential weather threats and take action to secure the plant days in advance of approaching storms.\n\n\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at MBPP.  EPA's Program 3 prevention requirements were implemented because the raw materials and Storage process at MBPP meets Program 3 criteria.  This process and the other four RMP Program 1 processes are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  In addition, Exxon Mobil Corporation has implemented OIMS at each of its operations worldwide.  OIMS includes the aspects of EPA's prevention program.  As previously mentioned, OIMS has been deemed equivalent to ISO 14001 as a valid management system to oversee the implementation of the risk management activities.\n\n\n\nAdditional details are included in the Data Element section of this Risk Management Plan.  Due to the ongoing nature of our safety programs, the dates associated with the various activities in our accident prevention program are constantly changing.  We selected May 15, 2017 as the cutoff date for this information.  Consequently, any reviews/updates conducted after that date are not reflected in the Data Element information (Section 7 of the Plan).\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nMBPP encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling operating and maintenance procedures to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.

Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at MBPP and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, MBPP has a number of initiatives under way addressing process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nMBPP keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis and configuration information.  Specific work groups at MBPP are responsible for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  Reference documents and locations are readily available as part of the OIMS documentation to help employees locate necessary process safety information.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Safety Data Sheets (SDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, MBPP has identified Operating Envelopes; i.e. documented limits for specific process parameters such as temperature, level, and compositions.  MBPP ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using computerized process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems, alarm systems).\n\n\n\nMBPP also maintains numerous technical documents tha"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nMBPP primarily uses the Knowledge Based Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study that is an adaptation by ExxonMobil of widely used industry methodologies to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  ExxonMobil has enhanced these techniques periodically, for example, expanding the scenarios for which hazards are assessed.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating experience and engineering expertise on the process to be evaluated.  This PHA team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team learnings are forwarded to local management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk evaluation done by the PHA team.  These evaluations help ensure that potential accident scenarios that are assigned greater risk receive attention first.  Approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA tea"

The resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not deviate significantly from the original design safety features, MBPP periodically updates and re-validates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years for the life of the process.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  The team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures and Safe Work Practices\n\n\n\nMBPP maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) startup, (2) shutdown, (3), normal and (4) emergency operations.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a consistent basis for training of new operators.  The procedures are kept current and accurate via periodic reviews and revisions to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and certified annually as current and accurate.  \n\n\n\nMBPP has identified Operating Envelopes; i.e. documented limits for specific process parameters such as temperature, level, and compositions.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nMBPP has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work)"

These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, MBPP has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with an experienced operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After employees demonstrate (e.g., through tests and skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, operations technicians periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understands the concepts.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nMBPP uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, MBPP has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform MBPP personnel of any hazards they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) e"

Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\n\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  MBPP incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\n\n\nHot Work & Other Safe Work Practices\n\n\n\nMBPP has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  These include orientations for visitors/contractors, control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, energy isolation for equipment being worked on, procedures for the safe removal of hazardous materials before opening of process piping/equipment, hot work permit/procedure to safely manage spark-producing activities, vehicle entry into process area, confined space entry permit/procedure to help ensure precautions are taken before entering confined spaces, and job safety analyses to identify and mitigate hazards associated with maintenance tasks.

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure safety features; procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides an additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify readiness before use.

In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training before the change is implemented.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nMBPP promptly investigates incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a personal injury, gas release, fire/explosion, major property damage, or environmental loss.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to MBPP management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.

The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, MBPP has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to plant processes or other plant facilities.  The emergency response program changes are administered by the Safety, Security, Health, Environmental, and Emergency Response Section and include informing and/or training of affected personnel.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for MBPP is coordinated with the Mutual Aid Mont Belvieu (MAMB) and Chambers County Local Emergency Planning Committee.  The committee meets periodically, including local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.
