Pursuant to this commitment, the City makes every effort to operate the wastewater treatment facilities in a safe manner, in accordance with all applicable rules and regulations and according to established good engineering and management principles.  \r\n\r\nThe Baton Rouge Central Wastewater Treatment Plant (CWWTP) was designed by qualified and experienced engineers and all operating personnel received the necessary training for the safe operation of the plant.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES.\r\n\r\nThe CWWTP receives domestic wastewater from the central area of the City\u00bfs urban perimeter including the Louisiana State University campus, and provides secondary treatment to this wastewater.  Before being discharged into the Mississippi River, the treated effluent is disinfected with chlorine and further treated with sulfur dioxide for removal of the residual chlorine.  The use of these two chemicals makes the CWWTP subject to the provisions and requirements of Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act and the related accident prevention (Risk Management Program) regulations, as enacted by the USEPA at 40 CFR Part 68.\r\n\r\nChlorine.  The CWWTP has two 5,000-gallon storage tanks (nominal size) to satisfy the chlorine needs of the wastewater disinfection process.  Each tank\u00bfs working capacity is limited, by means of administrative controls, to a maximum of approximately 4,000 gallons, or no more than 50,000 lb. of  liquid chlorine.  This chemical is delivered on the plant site by dedicated tanker trucks operated by the chlorine supplier.  All of the chlorine storage and handling facilities are e"

The cylinders are stored inside the sulfur dioxide building, a steel-frame and concrete structure that also houses all of the major components of the dechlorination system.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\r\n\r\nThe requirements of 40 CFR Part 68 includes, among other items, the development of a Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) and an Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) for the possible release of significant quantities of the regulated toxic substances (chlorine and sulfur dioxide).  Originally, these requirements also called for the Executive Summary (ES) to include a discussion of the WSC and ARS for each toxic chemical.\r\n\r\nPer the above, the ES of the original RMP submitted to the USEPA in 1999 presented and discussed these scenarios and the hypothetical offsite consequences in some detail.  Considering that the operation of these systems have not undergone any changes that would affect the scenarios or their underlying assumptions, these scenarios are still valid. However, they will not be discussed further here.  In accordance with the 2004 revisions to 40 CFR Part 68 (69 FR 18819-18837, April 9, 2004), a discussion of the WCS\u00bfs and ARS\u00bfs is no longer required for inclusion in the ES.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\n1.0\tSafety Information\r\n\r\nThe Central Wastewater Treatment plant of the city of Baton Rouge keeps on site the necessary documents related to the operation and maintenance of the plant in a safe manner.  Documentation kept on site provides information regarding the chemical properties and chemical hazards associated with the regulated chemicals (not only chlorine and sulfur dioxide but sodium hydroxide solution - caustic - as well); operating limits for all key process parameters; record of the current inventory of these chemicals; and data on equipment design and specifications.\r\n\r\nThese documents include, but"

The Process Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) review technique was used to identify any hazards and ensure that the necessary controls are in place to manage such hazards.\r\n\r\nA team of individuals representing the operations, maintenance, safety, engineering and management departments conducted the HAZOP review and issued a report that presented and discussed the \u00bfAction Items\u00bf identified.  This report was submitted to management for resolution.  The corrective action(s) identified for each action item were  documented and most were addressed and resolved, although a few outstanding items remain.  \r\n\r\nFurther, since there have not been any significant changes to the chlorination and sulfur dioxide systems in the last 5 years, it was only necessary to perform a revalidation of the original HAZOP study, with the major focus being aimed at a detailed evaluation of the changes that were made to the Cl2 and SO2 systems within this time frame.\r\n\r\n3.0 \tOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe CWWTP keeps on site copies of all operating and maintenance procedures that were prepared and submitted to the city by the plant design firm.

This plan was revised and updated in March, 2,001.\r\n\r\nAt the State of Louisiana\u00bfs (LDEQ\u00bfs) request, the full text of the emergency response plan was submitted in 2001 as part of a few minor corrections made to the RMP at that time. There have not been any significant changes made to this plan since.  The emergency response plan is periodically reviewed and verified for completeness and correctness.\r\n\r\nEmergency preparedness and response drills are held periodically with participation of personnel from all three of Baton Rouge\u00bfs wastewater treatment plants.  These drills also involve the participation of and are executed under the guidance of the Baton Rouge HazMat team and the Baton Rouge Fire Department.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThere were some action items identified during the original HAZOP analysis that were directly or indirectly related to safety.  As a result of one such item, the CWWTP has already switched both the chlorination and dechlorination (sulfur dioxide) systems from liquid to vapor feed.  This change has virtually eliminated all pressurized liquid chemical lines from these two systems, with the sole exception of the liquid chlorine unloading line, which is full of liquid chlorine only while a chlorine truckload is being unloaded into the storage tank..\r\n \r\nThe new vapor feed lines are temporary at present to allow these systems to continue to operate, but the preparatory activities are already under way for the replacement of these lines with permanent ones.  These final changes will be completed within the near future.\r\n\r\nVjs - H:\\My Documents\\BTNROUGE\\5-yr RMP\\CWWTP\\rmp04exec-CWWTP.doc\tPage 1 of 6"
