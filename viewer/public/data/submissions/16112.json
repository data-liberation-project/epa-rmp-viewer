The safety and health of all personnel are very important. The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the facility.\n\nTo accomplish Preferred Foods, Inc.'s goal in controlling accidental losses, the facility has established a comprehensive Safety Program that not only includes governmental mandated safety programs, but also includes safety programs and activities that have been identified industry wide for the prevention of accidents. The objectives of Preferred Foods, Inc.'s Safety Program is to achieve maximum productivity, efficiency and safety performance.\n\nOne of the activities associated with Preferred Foods Inc.'s Safety Program is the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response program.  These programs are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations 1910.119) and the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) Regulation (Risk Management Programs for Accidental Release Prevention, Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 68). Preferred Foods Inc.'s General Manager and Maintenance Manager is responsible for the management of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs.\n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response program is to prevent the release of ammonia and to minimize the consequences of ammonia releases.  The accidental release prevention and emergency response program is also established for the prevention and response to fires, explosions, terrorist acts, and other types of incidents that may result in catastrophic accidents.

      "SummaryText": "these programs are designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injures and illnesses, and any physical property damage.\n\nB: Stationary Sources and Regulated Substances Handled\nThe facility operates a [NAICS #311991 (Perishable Prepared Food Manufacturer)] perishable meat manufacturing plant and freezer warehouse at 4100 Port Union Road, Fairfield, OH 45014.  A two-stage ammonia refrigeration plant is employed to maintain the storage, shipping, and holding freezer's temperatures.\n\nThe facility operates a two stage (compound) ammonia refrigeration system, which provides cooling throughout the facility. The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS#7664-41-7) contained in this refrigeration system is in excess of the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds to initiate OSHA's Process Safety Management Program and EPA's Risk Management Plan.  Preferred Foods Inc.'s maximum inventory in the refrigeration system is 13,000 pounds.  Due to the volume of ammonia and with the remote possibility of a release of ammonia from the refrigeration system, which could pose a risk to offsite public receptors and have offsite impacts, our refrigeration system is subject to the Program Level 3 requirements of EPA's RMP.\n\nC: Summary of Worst-case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n1. Worst-Case\nThe worst-case release scenario at the facility involves the release of 8,220 pounds of ammonia over a 10-minute period due to a failure of the Actuating High Level Cut-Out (AHLCO) in vessel IC-1. The maximum level of vessel IC-1 is limited to 72% of the vessel.  Under worst-case weather conditions, the ammonia could travel 1.30 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public (as outlined in the Risk Management Plan Guidance at the EPRG-2 of 0.14mg/L). The population impacted by the worst case scenario is 11,800 residents and one school (historic), offices, and industrial facilities.\n\nThe worst-case scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n7 Industry standards and quality controls w"

Alternate Release Scenario\nA. First Alternate Release Scenario \nThe release of 624 pounds per minute of anhydrous ammonia over a 60-minute period due to a puncture of a 1/2-inch {hi-pressure} schedule 80 pipe feeding an evaporator valve station on the roof with pumped liquid.  This scenario could occur during a maintenance procedure or unsecured equipment striking this line.  The modeled OCA (Off-site Consequence Analysis) for this scenario has a radius of less than 0.6 miles. The population impacted by this scenario is 464 residents and surrounding businesses.\n\nB. Second Alternate Release Scenario\nIncludes the release of 624 pounds per minute of anhydrous ammonia over a 60-minute period in the building and the release of 13.1 pounds of anhydrous ammonia over a 60-minute period outside the building. This scenario is based on a clean break of a =\" schedule 80 pipe feeding liquid ammonia to an evaporator inside the plant.  This scenario could occur by equipment, such as a forklift truck hitting, the evaporator.  The building acts as a mitigating circumstance and reduces the release to the outside environment.  The modeled OCA (Off-site Consequence Analysis) for this scenario has a radius of less than 0.1 miles.\n\nC.

This scenario could occur if the condensing tower lost power or communication from the condenser controller.  The modeled OCA (Off-site Consequence Analysis) for this scenario has a radius of less than 0.3 miles. The population impacted by this scenario is 116 residents and surrounding businesses.\n\nD. Fourth Alternate Release Scenario\nIncludes the release of 1720 pounds per minute of anhydrous ammonia over a 60-minute period in the building and the release of 13.1 pounds of anhydrous ammonia over a 60-minute period outside the building. This scenario is based on the breaking of a sight column on the inter-cooler in the engine room with all the doors closed.  The limit of 5-minutes is not based on response time but is instead dependant upon the quantity of liquid volume in the vessel, the drop in vapor pressure caused by the release and the ammonia vapor leak detectors shutting down the equipment.  The building acts as a mitigating circumstance and reduces the release to the outside environment.  The modeled OCA (Off-site Consequence Analysis) for this scenario has a radius of less than 0.1 miles.\n\nE. Fifth Alternate Release Scenario\nIncludes the release of 33.6 pounds per minute of anhydrous ammonia over a 60-minute period in the building. This scenario is based on the breaking of the one-inch pipe on top of the inter-cooler during maintenance to change the relief valves. The building acts as a mitigating circumstance and reduces the release to the outside environment.
