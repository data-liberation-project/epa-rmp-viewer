Our commitment is demonstrated by the capital and human resources invested in our accident protection and accidental release prevention/mitigation programs. Enable Midstream's mitigation efforts include:  personnel training; safety engineered design; thorough process hazard analyses; compliance audits; management of change; contractor oversight; and planned equipment installation/operation/maintenance of our processes.  Enable Midstream's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, gas plant and loading facility personnel are trained to follow Enable Midstream's emergency response procedures in an effort to safely avert further release and minimize the impact to public and environmental receptors.\n\n    \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE WETUMKA LIQUID LOADING FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n    \n\nThe Wetumka Liquid Loading Facility (Wetumka LLF), located approximately six (6) miles south of Wetumka in Hughes County, Oklahoma, operates a highway loading facility. This loading facility receives propane by pipeline from the Enable Midstream Wetumka Gas Plant approximately 4 ? miles away. This propane is a natural gas liquid (NGL) product comprised primarily of propane, but can contain small amounts of ethane and butane, all of which are regulated flammable substances.  The part of the process that was selected to represent all regulated flammable substances at the Wetumka LLF which could contain a regulated flammable substance above the threshold quantity is as follows:\n\n    \n\n?     Propane Storage Tank comprised of a primarily propane (NGL) mixture.\n\n    \n\nThis storage vessel was selected due to having the greatest inventory and endpoint potential of a regula"

In addition to following the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP),  the Wetumka LLF follows applicable laws set forth in OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\n    \n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\n    \n\nUnder the RMP regulations, the Wetumka LLF is classified as a Program Level 3 facility.  Under Program Level 3 guidelines, the Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release a regulated flammable mixture is a Vapor Cloud Explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank containing the propane NGL mixture.  A written procedure is in place to limit the storage inventory to 219,406 pounds (80% of the maximum tank capacity).  However, for Worst Case Scenario calculations, the full inventory (100% maximum tank capacity of 274,258 pounds) of this tank are assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a VCE.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi over pressure endpoint for this WCS is 0.52 miles or 2,771 feet.  Additionally, although there are numerous controls in place to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS for the Wetumka LLF.\n\n    \n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the Wetumka LFF is a VCE resulting from a 60 minute release of propane NGL from a propane loading pump seal leak totaling 59,313 pounds.  The release is expected to be isolated by an operator within sixty minutes (active mitigation).  The maximum distance to the 1-psi overpressure endpoint for this event is 0.32 miles or 1,663 feet.\n\n    \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n    \n\nThe following is a summary of the acci"

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the loading facility accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the loading facility and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the loading facility has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety. The teams typically have members from various areas of the loading facility and plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and loading facility management. Operations personnel also participate in the development and review of operating procedures, process safety information (PSI) and training and mentoring of other personnel.\n\n    \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n    \n\nThe Wetumka LLF develops and maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the loading facility.

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the loading facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in our Operating Procedures and/or Process Safety Information. The loading facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n    \n\nThe loading facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.

The analyses are conducted using a team of Enable Midstream personnel and/or contractors who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This PHA (Process Hazards Analysis) Team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\n    \n\nThe PHA team's recommendations are reviewed with corporate management to approve or revise recommended mitigation actions.

These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process. \n\n    \n\nIn addition, the Wetumka LLF maintains Operating Procedures and/or process safety information that provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the loading facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform loading facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Wetumka LLF evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Loading facility/plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n    \n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\n    \n\nThe Wetumka LLF conducts a Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that "

A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n    \n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n    \n\nThe Wetumka LLF has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\n    \n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they perform their jobs in a safe manner. Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment. \n\n    \n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The Wetumka LLF incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its"

Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n    \n\nManagement of Change (MOC)\n\n    \n\nThe Wetumka LLF has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\n    \n\nIncident Investigation\n\n    \n\nThe Wetumka LLF promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.

The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to loading facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations. \n\n    \n\nCompliance Audits\n\n    \n\nTo help ensure that the accidental release prevention program is functioning properly, the Wetumka LLF periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are required at least every 3 years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to loading facility management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained. \n\n    \n\n    \n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n    \n\nThe processes at the Wetumka LLF have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.
