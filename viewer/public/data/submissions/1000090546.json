The RMPr describes the Accident Prevention Program that includes Safety Information, Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigation, and Emergency Response.  \n\n\n\nThis Facility stores and handles anhydrous ammonia in three stationary pressure vessels (PV) and nurse tanks.  The covered process equipment includes: three 30,000-gallon stationary PVs and ancillary process piping, valves, liquid pump, gas compressor, gauges (volume, pressure, and temperature), safety systems (excess flow valves, pneumatic actuated emergency shutoff valves, backflow check valve, bulkhead, and breakaway equipment).  \n\n\n\nThe Facility receives anhydrous ammonia by a Contractor that transports the anhydrous ammonia with a commercial tanker truck.  The commercial tanker truck is temporarily parked on the Facility property while the anhydrous ammonia is transferred to the stationary PVs.  The Contractor performs the transfer of anhydrous ammonia from the commercial tanker truck to the stationary PVs.  The Facility does not own or operate the commercial tanker truck.  The Contractor is responsible for training their operators and maintaining their equipment.  At a minimum, the Contractor must (1) have in place and certify compliance with applicable and relevant DOT, OSHA, state and local regulatory requirements, (2) make available to the Facility and EPA upon request any contractor-related documentation necessary to demonstrate compliance, and (3) certify that it has in place emergency shut-down procedures for anhydrous ammonia transfer operations.  The Facility coordinates with the Contractor on Emergency Contingency procedures and will provide access to the Facility RMPr upon request by the Contractor.\n\n\n\nTrained Process Operators operate the covered process which includes the: (1) monitoring of temperature, volume, and pressures during storage; and (2) transfer of anhydrous ammonia from the stationary PVs to nurse tanks.  These operations are conducted in accordance with the RMPr Operating Procedures.  Trained personnel perform maintenance on this covered process in accordance with the RMPr Maintenance Procedures.\n\n",

Standards codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration at 29 CFR 1910.119 are not applicable to the operations at this facility because the facility is operated as a retail operation and is exempt from the OSHA standards.  However, the OSHA standards at 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, are applicable and are included in the Risk Management Program (RMPr) document that is implemented by this Facility.  This electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident, and to ensure that a response to a release will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\n\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\n\n\nThe Facility acquired a third 30,000-gallon Stationary PV.  Due to the change, the Facility is submitting this update as a Resubmission.  \n\n\n\nFACILITY\n\n\n\nThe operations at this Facility consist of agricultural fertilizer retail.  The Facility operates one (1) covered process that includes Storage and Handling of anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is transported to this Facility by a Contractor owned and operated commercial tanker truck.  The Contractor transfers anhydrous ammonia from the commercial tanker truck to three 30,000-gallon stationary pressure vessels (PV).  \n\n\n\nThe Facility stores the anhydrous ammonia in three stationary PVs and then transfers the anhydrous ammonia from the PV to nurse tanks at the point of retail sale to the end user (i.e. Grower/Farmer).  Trained Process Operators perform the transfer of anhydrous ammonia in accordance with its RMPr accident prevention program.    \n\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nWorst case and alternative case consequence analyses were completed for the single covere"

      "SummaryText": "d process that is operated at this Facility.  The worst case release scenario assumes that all the contents in the largest single PV (i.e. 30,000 gallons) are released.   The release scenario consists of the PV being punctured on the side at the ground level and the release is modeled as a ground level horizontal jet.\n\n\n\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario assumes a 30-second release from a violent rupture of a 2-inch transfer hose caused by an impact or pull-away during a transfer operation.  This alternative scenario considers active mitigation of the safety equipment (i.e. emergency shutoff and excess flow valves on the commercial tanker truck; and pneumatic operated emergency shutoff valves, backpressure check and excess flow valves on the PV side of the bulkhead), and operating procedures that the Facility uses to safeguard against releases from ammonia transfer operations.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Operations Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Facility.  The Operations Manager is assisted by other Facility staff, as directed.  The Operations Manager is responsible for ensuring that Facility Staff are properly trained in the implementation of the Prevention Program which includes Safety Information, Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigations, and Emergency Contingency Plans.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThis is a non-responding Facility.   The Facility has coordinated emergency response activities with its LEPC and local fire department.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place, in the past five (5) years because of the ammonia operations at this Facility.\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\n\nThe Risk Management Plan implemented by the Facility complies with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r)."
