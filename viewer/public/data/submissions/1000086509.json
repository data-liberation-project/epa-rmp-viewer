This is a new RMP plan for this site as this is the first time that the facility has stored any RMP listed chemicals above the threshold quantities. \n\n\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response policies\n\nThe facility's emergency response follows the policies outlined in the RMP program guidelines and OSHA PSM. The plan includes notification of the local fire department. \n\n2.    Stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\n\n\nThis facility will be handling one chemical above the RMP threshold limits: Peracetic Acid. This product is  stored in 330 gallon sized intermediate bulk containers. This chemical is neither packaged nor used at this facility. \n\n\n\n3.    Accidental release prevention program\n\nPetacetic acid is the first RMP regulated material to be stored at the facility. Prior to bringing the material onsite, even below the program threshold limit, a Process Hazard Analysis was conducted and the resulting corrective actions are currently in the process of being closed.  The facility will check all containers that cross their docks for tampering and damage as per the site specific standard operating procedure for loading and unloading containerized materials. This product will be stored in double stacked rows that will be easy to inspect from all sides. The materials will also be stored within secondary containment to prevent the release of the liquid material into the environment. . \n\nAccess to the storage area is limited to Harcros employees and contractors/visitors that both have a need to be in the area and have had a background check meeting the requirements set forth by DHS. \n\n\n\n4.    5-year accident history\n\nNo RMP process related accidents have occurred at this facility within the last five years\n\n\n\n5.    Emergency Response"

      "SummaryText": " Program\n\nThe facility's emergency response is outlined in their Emergency Action plan which includes responding to minor leaks only.  The Harcros team members that handle the RMP chemicals are HAZCOM trained.  The facility's RMP chemical storage area is protected by an intrusion detection system. Harcros works closely with our suppliers, customers, and public responders to continuously improve our emergency response capabilities.   \n\n\n\n\n\n6.    Planned changes to improve safety\n\nThe facility will be installing secondary containment in the proposed storage area. Harcros is also considering increasing the training for the front line team at this facility to include a 40 hour or 24 hour HAZWOPPER training beyond the basic HAZCOM that all employees are given.  \n\n\n\nPlease direct any questions to myself at LScott@Harcros.com, or via phone at 979.571.5796. \n\n"
