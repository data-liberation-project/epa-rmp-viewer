      "SummaryText": "\nD.D. Williamson has established its manufacturing and corporate offices at 1901 Payne Street, Louisville, KY.  We have been operating at this location since 1948.  We manufucture Caramel Coloring, which is used in many foods such as:  soft drinks, gravies, soups, cake mixes, sauces, spices, etc.   We are located in a highly residential area, therefore it is one of our \"Value and Beliefs\" to be a good neighbor in our area.  In an effort to establish D.D. Williamson as a \"good neighbor\", we have taken many precautions to ensure the safety of our neighbors.  The following information are a reflection of our efforts to maintain a safe and enjoyable work environment.     \n\nEach bulk,chemical liquid, raw material that we recieve is stored in a diked area, eliminating the possiblitiy of run off or sewer contamination.  This area is maintained in a neat and orderly fashion.  Each containment area is inspected weekly, through our preventive manintenance program, for tank and pump integrity.  Our property is surrounding by a eight foot high barbed fence.   Each inlet and outlet from our storage tanks is locked at all times when not in use.  Our front gate is monitored by servalance camera 24-hours a day.\n\n\nWe have identified off-loading of Ammonia Solution from trucks into our holding tanks,  as our largest potential for an incident to occur.  This is the scenario we have identified as an Alternative opposed to our Worst Case Scenerio of a rupture in our holding tank.  Both incidents would effect public receptors.  In order to prevent an off-loading  incident, we require the following procedure to be in place:\n\n                1)The incoming truck is inspected for any breech of seals.\n                2)All seals are double check with the Bill of Ladding to make sure all numbers match.\n                3)A sample is taken from the load and approved by testing procedures before\n                    the material is received.\n                4)The volume in the holding tank is che"

Each inlet to our chemical tanks is clearly \n                    identified to avoid cross contamination.\n                 6)During the unloading, an associate and/or truck driver will monitor the entire off-\n                    loading process.\n                 7)Once the unloading is complete, we double check the volume in the tank to ensure that all\n                    raw material is unloaded and compare this to the original weight ticket of the truck.\n                 8)We then seal the tank by placing the locks back on to the correct inlet.\n\nThe associate responsible for unloading Ammonia is equipped with breathing apparatus at all times in case of emergency.  Located in the off-loading area is an emergency shower and eyewash. \n\nOur Ammonia holding tank is constructed of 1/4\" carbon steal plate with a maximum capacity of 12,000\ngallons (89,440 lbs of 29.9% Ammonia).  We have established a maximum capacity of 88,000 lbs internally\nto avoid overfilling.  The tank is equiped with a pressure relief valvle in case of overpressurization.  Vents from the tank are directed to our main scrubber to catch the fumes from air displacement during unloading.\nThe tank is not heated or cooled, but remains at ambient temperature at all times.  This eliminates any type of heating/cooling equipment failure.  Our Ammonia is received at or below 600F, this keeps the tank cool at all times.  We average one truck a week of Ammonia, the product turnover is quick.\n\n29.9% Ammonia is a stable chemical, although it has a strong pentrating odor.  When a leak does occur, it is virtually impossible to approach the product without any type of breathing apparatus.  Therefore we have taken every pre"

      "SummaryText": "caution to ensure that each one of our Associates involved in the process is fully aware of all emergency procedures related to Ammonia.  \n\nIt is our policy to adhere to all Federal, State, and Local laws regarding storage and usage of any type of chemical.  In case of an emergency, we immediately contact the Local Fire Department by dailing 911.  We have submitted an Community Awareness & Emergency Action Plan to the Louisville/Jefferson County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This plan aids the Emergency Response to happen quickly if needed.  In the past five years we have not had an accident involving  Ammonia.  We plan to maintain this good working record.  \n\nIn regards to our chemical storage we believe we have implemented the necessary procedure and practices to maintain a safe enviroment.  There are no existing plans to improve these procedures.  If we should modify our process or regulations should change,  we will modify our safety procedures to meet any changes."
