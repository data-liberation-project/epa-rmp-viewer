EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe Marathon Ashland Petroleum LLC's Illinois Refining Division (hereafter referred to as IRD) is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for IRD workers, the public and the environment.  As part of this commitment, IRD has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One part of these systems is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at IRD and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) rule 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan describing the Risk Management Program at IRD.  This document is intended to satisfy the Risk Management Plan executive summary requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the Risk Management Program at IRD.\n\n\n1.1  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIRD is committed to the safety of its workers and the public and to the preservation of the environment through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  IRD implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  In the event of a significant accidental release, trained personnel will respond to control and contain such releases.  IRD evaluates each situation, evacuates workers as necessary and responds based on our capabilities and training.  If necessary, outside emergency responders, including the local fire department, would be contacted to assist in controlling and containing the release and to prevent and/or reduce the consequences of the release.  IRD, the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the fire department have also established a warning system if an accident occurs that could threaten the community."

The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering and plant management.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nIRD keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within IRD are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, IRD has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in a Critical Process Variables Document.  IRD ensures that the process is maintained within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nIRD also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.   This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical ratings of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and"

      "SummaryText": "The IRD Division Manager has overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the Risk Management Program for EPA-regulated processes at the IRD.  However, the specific responsibilities for certain aspects of that program have been delegated by the Division Manager to other personnel who report either directly or through other management personnel to the Division Manager.  Those relationships are depicted on the Division organization chart maintained by the Division Manager's staff.  Specific responsibility for the implementation of the Division Process Safety Management (PSM) and accident prevention program has been delegated to the Division Environmental and Safety Manager.  A Division PSM Coordinator is responsible for the RMP hazard assessment, while the Environmental department is responsible for the Risk Management Plan.  The Division emergency response program, including compliance with the RMP aspects of that effort, is the responsibility of the Division Safety Supervisor.  In keeping with the policy that safe operation is part of everyone's job, many other Division personnel are also involved in RMP activities on an ongoing basis.\n\n\n1.2  IRD Regulated Substances\n\nIRD is a full range refinery and petroleum products facility located in Robinson, Illinois.  Petroleum crude oil is the primary feedstock from which a variety of petroleum-based products, including gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, petroleum coke and liquefied petroleum gases such as propane and butane, are produced.  Many of these products are flammable substances that EPA has specifically listed in the RMP rule and are present in the process units above the EPA threshold quantity (typically 10,000 pounds).  In total, IRD has seventeen processes that are covered by the RMP rule because of the presence of flammable process materials.  These processes are listed in the RMP data included with this summary (Section 1.17 of the RMP Data Elements).\n\nIn addition to coverage because of fl"

Hydrofluoric (HF) acid is used as a catalyst in the HF Alkylation unit that produces a gasoline blend component.  Anhydrous ammonia is used in the Nitrogen Oxides (Nox) reduction section of the Crude unit to help minimize Nox emissions to the atmosphere.  These units are covered because they contain more than the EPA RMP threshold quantities of hydrofluoric acid (1,000 pounds) and anhydrous ammonia (10,000 pounds).\n\n\n1.3  Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nThis information is no longer required in the Executive Summary and is therefore not being provided.\n\n\n1.4  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the IRD.  Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, and because the OSHA PSM requirements are very similar to the EPA RMP requirements for refineries, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements.  The PSM program at this facility has been extended by IRD, where necessary, to satisfy EPA's Program Level 3 accident prevention program requirements.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nIRD encourages employees to participate in all facets of Process Safety Management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), incident investigation, and compliance audit teams.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the IRD accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at IRD and addresses each accident prevention program element.

The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform the job in a safe manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible) or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  IRD incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for the intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nIRD has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.

These and other procedures, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nIRD has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided with any necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nIRD promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.

Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, IRD periodically conducts audits to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  Both hourly and management personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to IRD management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\n\n1.5  Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe processes at IRD have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all EPA RMP-covered processes at IRD.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios of hydrofluoric acid, anhydrous ammonia and flammable substances caused by equipment failures or human errors.\n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, IRD has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release and (3) reduce the consequences of a release. The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\n\nRelease Detection\n\n* Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms in the LPG storage facilities area.\n\n* Hydrocarbon and HF acid detectors with alarms in the HF Alkylation unit area.\n\nRe"

      "SummaryText": "ency Response Program\n\nIRD maintains a written emergency response program that is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, refinery evacuation plans and accounting for refinery personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, IRD has procedures that address maintenance, inspection and testing of emergency response equipment as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to refinery processes or facilities.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for IRD is coordinated with the Crawford County Local Emergency Planning Committee and with offsite responders who would be called to support emergency response efforts if required.  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the LEPC, where attendees include local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives.  IRD has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department) as well as direct access to the city's community warning system.  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to participating in LEPC meetings, IRD conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations,"

These findings are also forwarded to management for consideration and the final resolution of the recommendations is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nIRD maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  Procedures are periodically reviewed and certified as current and accurate.  Procedures are maintained current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made to the process.  In addition, IRD operating procedures provide guidance on how to respond to events that result in exceeding safe operating limits for specific process or equipment parameters.  The written operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, IRD has implemented a company training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in IRD operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests and/or skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted a"

All of the training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nIRD uses contractors to supplement the work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, IRD has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform the work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in the workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules and (6) inform IRD personnel of any hazards that they find during the work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, (4) safe work practices prior to the work beginning and (5) work permit process (i.e. hot work, confined space, etc.).  In addition, contractors performing non-incidental type work are reviewed by National Compliance Management Service for compliance with the applicable regulatory requirements.  IRD personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling the safety obligations.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews\n\nIRD conducts a pre-startup safety review for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the review is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to ensure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A review involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance"

      "SummaryText": "trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nIRD has a comprehensive PHA program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage those hazards.\n\nIRD primarily uses the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques available.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team recommendations are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of safety improvements in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ensures that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive prioritized attention.  All approved safety improvements being implemented in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, IRD periodically updates and revalidates the PHA results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer"
