A PHA was conducted for the main HF and aqueous HF processes in 1989 and was recertified in 1995 and 2000.  A PHA was conducted for the ultra-high purity HF process in 1994 and again in 1999.  Management of change evaluations and prestartup safety reviews are conducted for all modifications.",

Introduction \n\n\n\nThe Honeywell International Inc. (Honeywell) Geismar Site is a manufacturing facility located in Geismar, Louisiana.  It is part of the Specialty Chemicals Business Unit of Honeywell International Inc.  Headquartered in Morris Township, New Jersey, Honeywell is an advanced technology and manufacturing company serving customers worldwide with aerospace and automotive products, chemicals, fibers, plastics and advanced materials.  With 1999 sales of approximately $24 billion, the company ranks among the top 100 of the Fortune 500.  Honeywell has approximately 125,000 employees in 95 countries.  Honeywell is a diversified technology and manufacturing leader, serving customers worldwide with aerospace products and services; control technologies for buildings, homes and industry; automotive products; power generation systems; specialty chemicals; fibers; plastics; and electronic and advanced materials.  More information about Honeywell may be found at its Web Page: www.honeywell.com.\n\n\n\nIt is the world wide policy of Honeywell to design, manufacture and distribute its products and to handle and dispose of materials throughout their life cycle in a manner that protects the environment and safeguards employees, customers, and the public from unacceptable risk.  Honeywell's complete Health, Safety and Environmental Policy may be found at the Honeywell Web Page.\n\n\n\nThe Honeywell Geismar Site participates in the Responsible Care program of the Chemical Manufacturers Association.

Facilities are encouraged to listen to the concerns of the community and to consider these concerns when designing and implementing process safety systems.  The Honeywell Geismar Site endeavors to accomplish this by sponsoring and regularly meeting with established local Community Advisory Panels. Honeywell's Geismar site participates in community advisory panels for both Ascension and Iberville Parishes.\n\n\n\n2. Plant Description\n\n\n\nThe Honeywell Geismar Site is located primarily in Ascension Parish on the Mississippi River at Mile 187.0 and is bounded by highways 75, 3115 and 30. Honeywell shares the site with three other chemical manufacturing facilities.  The area is predominately rural with adjacent and nearby chemical manufacturing facilities. There are no immediate residential neighbors.  The plant employs approximately 180 company and about 90 contract workers.\n\n\n\nThe Honeywell Geismar Site's five covered processes manufacture new generation ozone friendly refrigerants, inorganic acids and fluoropolymer resin. The Hydrogen Fluoride Plant manufactures hydrogen fluoride.  The Multiproducts Plant manufactures 1,1,1,2 tetrafluoroethane (HFC 134a), pentafluoroethane (HFC 125) and 1-chloro-1,2,2-tetrafluoroethane (HCFC 124).  The Aclon Resin Plant manufactures fluoropolymer resin.  The 125 Plant manufactures pentafluroethane (HFC 125).  The 245fa Plant manufactures 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane (HFC 245fa).\n\n\n\nAnhydrous hydrogen fluoride is used as a raw material in the manufacture of refrigerants, fluorocarbons, gasoline, as well as other chemical derivatives.  Aqueous solutions of hydrogen fluoride are used in the manufacture of electronic components, circuit boards, steel, high-purity quartz, light bulbs televisions, and computer monitors.\n\n\n\nHFC 134a is used as a refrigerant in automotive applications.  HFC 125 is us"

Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:  \n\n\n\nIt is the policy of the Honeywell Geismar Site to operate a safe and environmentally sound facility by\n\n\n\n* identifying and controlling health, safety, or environmental risks related to its operations; \n\n* designing its processes to protect people, property and the environment; \n\n* conducting and continually reviewing and improving programs for safety, health and environmental excellence; and \n\n* establishing processes to assure that all laws and regulations applicable to its operations and products are known and observed.  \n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policy associated specifically with the plant's use of hydrogen fluoride, oleum, chlorine, trifluorochloroethylene and 1,1 - difluoroethylene involves \n\n\n\n* the integration of safety programs, devices and technologies inherent in the design of the process, \n\n* safe operational procedures and management practices, \n\n* operator training, \n\n* the preparation and testing of site emergency response plans, \n\n* the maintenance of onsite emergency response equipment, and \n\n* a professionally trained Emergency Response Team, coordinating our efforts and resources with local emergency response services, and"

For a number of reasons discussed in this submittal, it is extremely unlikely that this event would ever occur.  In addition, the Honeywell Geismar site is required to analyze the impact of an alternative accidental release scenario for the chemicals covered by the RMP regulations.\n\n\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis for a \"worst-case release scenario\" at the Geismar Site was performed for the largest single storage vessel for each RMP toxic and flammable chemical.  The offsite consequences for each identified scenario were modeled pursuant to EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  \n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario for toxic chemicals was identified as a release of anhydrous hydrogen fluoride. The largest anhydrous hydrogen fluoride storage vessel is a horizontal, cylindrical steel tank located in an outdoor tank park in the hydrogen fluoride plant.  The elevated tank is located within the designated process containment for the process area.  The tank's actual maximum operational storage content is 720,000 pounds.  This is intentionally below the tank's maximum design capacity.  The release and meteorological parameters used for the worst-case release scenario for the hydrogen fluoride source were those defined and pre-set by EPA in the RMP Rule for toxic gases.  The occurrence of the specified release and meteorological conditions, either individually or concurrently, is considered extremely unlikely.\n\n \n\nIn accordance with the Rule, the maximum 720,000 lb. full capacity contents of the vessel were assumed to be released as a vapor at a constant rate over a 10-minute period.  The methodology recommended in EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance document was used to determine the distance traveled by the hydrogen fluoride vapors before the concentration of the vapors decreased to an endpoint concentration of 0.016 m"

Under these unlikely release assumptions, this hypothetical release would have an impact beyond the boundaries of the Geismar site and would reach public receptors during meteorological conditions specified by EPA for RMP worst case scenarios.  The Geismar site has numerous programs, systems and controls in place which make the occurrence of the described worst case scenario extremely unlikely.
