Facilities are encouraged to listen to the concerns of the community and to consider these concerns when designing and implementing process safety systems.  The Honeywell Geismar Site endeavors to accomplish this by sponsoring and regularly meeting with established local Community Advisory Panels. Honeywell's Geismar site participates in community advisory panels for both Ascension and Iberville Parishes.\r\n\r\n2. Plant Description\r\n\r\nThe Honeywell Geismar Site is located primarily in Ascension Parish on the Mississippi River at Mile 187.0 and is bounded by highways 75, 3115 and 30. Honeywell shares the site with three other chemical manufacturing facilities.  The area is predominately rural with adjacent and nearby chemical manufacturing facilities. There are no immediate residential neighbors.  The plant employs approximately 180 company and about 90 contract workers.\r\n\r\nThe Honeywell Geismar Site's five covered processes manufacture new generation ozone friendly refrigerants, inorganic acids and fluoropolymer resin. The Hydrogen Fluoride Plant manufactures hydrogen fluoride.  The Multiproducts Plant manufactures 1,1,1,2 tetrafluoroethane (HFC 134a), pentafluoroethane (HFC 125) and 1-chloro-1,2,2-tetrafluoroethane (HCFC 124).  The Aclon Resin Plant manufactures fluoropolymer resin.  The 125 Plant manufactures pentafluroethane (HFC 125).  The 245fa Plant manufactures 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane (HFC 245fa).\r\n\r\nAnhydrous hydrogen fluoride is used as a raw material in the manufacture of refrigerants, fluorocarbons, gasoline, as well as other chemical derivatives.  Aqueous solutions of hydrogen fluoride are used in the manufacture of electronic components, circuit boards, steel, high-purity quartz, light bulbs televisions, and computer monitors.\r\n\r\nHFC 134a is used as a refrigerant in automotive applications.  HFC 125 is us"

HCFC 124 is used in medical sterilants, rigid foam insulation manufacturing and in medium temperature refrigeration blends.\r\n\r\nAclon Resin is used in the manufacture of film used in medicinal and food bubble packaging. \r\n\r\nHFC 245fa is used as a foam blowing agent in the manufacture of rigid foam insulation.\r\n\r\nBecause the Geismar site stores and uses hydrogen fluoride, oleum, chlorine, trifluorochloroethylene and 1,1 - difluoroethylene in more than the threshold quantities specified in the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation the site is covered by the regulation.\r\n\r\n3.  Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:  \r\n\r\nIt is the policy of the Honeywell Geismar Site to operate a safe and environmentally sound facility by\r\n\r\n* identifying and controlling health, safety, or environmental risks related to its operations; \r\n* designing its processes to protect people, property and the environment; \r\n* conducting and continually reviewing and improving programs for safety, health and environmental excellence; and \r\n* establishing processes to assure that all laws and regulations applicable to its operations and products are known and observed.  \r\n\r\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policy associated specifically with the plant's use of hydrogen fluoride, oleum, chlorine, trifluorochloroethylene and 1,1 - difluoroethylene involves \r\n\r\n* the integration of safety programs, devices and technologies inherent in the design of the process, \r\n* safe operational procedures and management practices, \r\n* operator training, \r\n* the preparation and testing of site emergency response plans, \r\n* the maintenance of onsite emergency response equipment, and \r\n* a professionally trained Emergency Response Team, coordinating our efforts and resources with local emergency response services, and"

The Honeywell Geismar site maintains its own professionally trained Emergency Response Team (ERT) which is knowledgeable and prepared to respond to incidents involving accidental releases.  The ERT holds annual site emergency response drills and other exercises that have been conducted jointly with the local public safety response groups. \r\n\r\nThe Geismar site utilizes audible warning systems for both onsite and offsite notification.  The onsite notification system can be activated at several locations including control rooms and the plant security gate.  This system has siren and voice capability that can use prerecorded or live announcements.  The system is tested weekly and during routine drills by Honeywell and other companies which share the site.\r\n\r\nNotification of persons off the site property is accomplished in conjunction with the local public safety agencies by activation of a regional audible warning system.  This system also has siren and voice capabilities. Annually, calendars are hand delivered to residents in the audible warning region.  These calendars provide residents instructions and recommendations in response to audible warnings. The system is tested weekly.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the audible warning system, community alert networks exist to alert near neighbors.  These computer-assisted systems are capable of automatically alerting residents, industries, businesses, and others in the covered area by telephone.\r\n\r\n8.  Planned changes to improve safety:\r\n\r\nHoneywell International, Inc. pursues a philosophy of continuous improvement in all aspects of its operations.

For a number of reasons discussed in this submittal, it is extremely unlikely that this event would ever occur.  In addition, the Honeywell Geismar site is required to analyze the impact of an alternative accidental release scenario for the chemicals covered by the RMP regulations.\r\n\r\nThe offsite consequence analysis for a worst-case release scenario at the Geismar Site was performed for the largest single storage vessel for each RMP toxic and flammable chemical.  The offsite consequences for each identified scenario were modeled pursuant to EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  \r\n\r\nThe worst case scenario for toxic chemicals was identified as a release of anhydrous hydrogen fluoride. The largest anhydrous hydrogen fluoride storage vessel is a horizontal, cylindrical steel tank located in an outdoor tank park in the hydrogen fluoride plant.  The elevated tank is located within the designated process containment for the process area.  The tank's actual maximum operational storage content is 720,000 pounds.  This is intentionally below the tank's maximum design capacity.  The release and meteorological parameters used for the worst-case release scenario for the hydrogen fluoride source were those defined and pre-set by EPA in the RMP Rule for toxic gases.  The occurrence of the specified release and meteorological conditions, either individually or concurrently, is considered extremely unlikely.\r\n \r\nIn accordance with the Rule, the maximum 720,000 lb. full capacity contents of the vessel were assumed to be released as a vapor at a constant rate over a 10-minute period.  The methodology recommended in EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance document was used to determine the distance traveled by the hydrogen fluoride vapors before the concentration of the vapors decreased to an endpoint concentration of 0.016 m"

This endpoint concentration was selected by EPA and listed in the RMP Rule specifically for hydrogen fluoride.  \r\n \r\nThe HGSystem dispersion model and PAVE pool evaporation model were used to determine the offsite impact of the Geismar Site's worst-case hydrogen fluoride release. Under these unlikely release assumptions, this hypothetical release would have an impact beyond the boundaries of the Geismar site and would reach public receptors during meteorological conditions specified by EPA for RMP worst case scenarios.  The Geismar site has numerous programs, systems and controls in place which make the occurrence of the described worst case scenario extremely unlikely.  These systems and controls are described elsewhere in this document. \r\n\r\nThe worst case scenario for flammable chemicals was identified as a release of trifluorochloroethylene in the Aclon Resin Plant.  The contents of the tank were assumed to be released instantaneously to the atmosphere followed by a vapor explosion.  There would be no offsite impact from this release.\r\n\r\nBecause of the safety systems and prevention programs in place, the site focussed emergency planning resources on release scenarios which, although unlikely, represent some potential for occurrence.
