It is the intent of the North Augusta #2 Terminal to incorporate the most recent construction and procedural guidance (NFPA # 58-2008 Edition) into this process.  If an emergency were to occur, it is the facility's policy to notify the Belvedere Fire Department as well as the Aiken County Emergency Management Division.  Medical emergencies will require notification of the local Emergency Medical Services (Aiken County Ambulance Service) and University Hospital - Augusta.\n\nKinder Morgan Southeast Terminals LLC - North Augusta #2 Terminal is a bulk petroleum storage and distribution facility that includes butane blending operations.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the butane blending system, including the associated piping and two 90,000 gallon butane storage vessels. \n\nThe facility's worst case scenario is the failure of one of the system's two 90,000 gallon butane storage vessels when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% fill shut-off with alarm at 80%) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The facility's alternate (potential for off-site impacts) release scenario is a \"BLEVE\" accident and associated fireball.\n\nKinder Morgan Southeast Terminals LLC - North Augusta #2 Terminal complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Accident Prevention Rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR Part 1910.119) along with its fourteen (14) compliance elements, and all applicable state and local laws and regulations.

The facility emergency response plans are coordinated with fire department and the Aiken County Emergency Management.  The Belvedere Fire Department has participated in the initial RMP/PSM training session for this system.\n\nProcess safety controls include excess flow valves, low-melting point pneumatic valve feeds to pneumatic valves (fail closed), 85% fill shut-off (80% alarm and 90% ESD actuation) on the vessels, emergency shut-off devices on the system and video display terminal, line thermal/hydrostatic reliefs, and grounding interlock devices.  \n\nIn an effort to improve and promote system safety, Kinder Morgan Southeast Terminals LLC looks for, and seeks employee input, on process safety improvements.  Additionally, the Belvedere Fire Department is contacted regarding participation in site emergency response drills.  Additional actions include consolidating separate system inspection checklists for ease of completion.\n"
