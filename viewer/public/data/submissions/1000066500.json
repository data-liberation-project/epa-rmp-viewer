Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR ?5189\n\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR ?1910.119\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Aslan Cold Storage Reedley has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1 Aslan Cold Storage Reedley, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Aslan Cold Storage Reedley has updated their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\n\n\nProcess Name               | Process Chemical              | Process Quantity(lbs.)\n\nProcess 1                    Anhydrous Ammonia               22,000\n\nProcess 2                    Anhydrous Ammonia                7,000\n\n\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses and physical property damage.\n\n1.

The only exception is Room 5 which is equipped with air-cooling evaporators and liquid recirculator as required for a pumped overfeed operation.\n\n\n\nMost control valve groups are located on the roof to provide easy access. The refrigeration machinery is contained within or directly adjacent to each machinery room.

From the accumulators, low pressure liquid is circulated through evaporator coils. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature and pressure gas which is returned to the accumulator vessels. The suction gas is returned from the accumulators through a suction return line to the main suction accumulator.  From the main suction accumulator, ammonia is piped to the suction inlet on the compressors. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water-cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquefied and returned to the thermosyphon vessel and then to the high pressure receiver.\n\n\n\nThe pumped overfeed system (Room 5 only) operates as follows:  high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped through a series of liquid feed s"

The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to a water cooled evaporative condenser where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquefied and returned to the high pressure receiver.\n\n\n\nThe system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and pressure relief valves which vent to the atmosphere if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point. \n\n\n\nThere is an ammonia detector installed inside P1 and P2 machinery room, Room 5, Room 6, Room 7, and Precool 3. Each sensor is set at the California OSHA permissible exposure limit of 25 ppm, which will activate an audible alarm and notify plant personnel. Also, a sampling system is installed in each refrigerated area (P1 only) that provides at least every 15-minute interval monitoring.

During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nAslan Cold Storage Reedley has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n\n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Aslan Cold Storage Reedley facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. The ammonia processes contain a total charge of approximately 29,000 lbs. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n\n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nAslan Cold Storage Reedley has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\n\n\n\nAslan Cold Storage Reedley's emergency action and response pr"
