      "SummaryText": "The Airgas facility in Tampa, Florida is owned and operated by Airgas South. The Facility is a chemical distribution plant, which stores, sells, and repackages industrial gases.\n\nThe Facility operates from 0500 hours to 1700 hours, Monday through Friday and is staffed with approximately 15 full time employees.  The Facility is secured with chain link fencing, locking gate, and yard lights.\n\nIn accordance with the EPA's RMP regulations (40 CFR Part 68), the facility's inventory of chemicals was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances were found to be stored in quantities above the EPA threshold quantities .  Based on the facility inventory, the following listed flammable substances are stored by the Facility in quantities above the substance's EPA threshold quantity: \n\nAcetylene gas (CAS # 74-86-2)\nPropylene gas (CAS # 115-07-1)\nPropane gas (CAS # 74-98-6)\n\nAcetylene is packaged in a variety of cylinders, including 24 pound, 12 pound, 5 pound, 1 pound and smaller.  Airgas only stores these cylinders prior to shipment to customers. On-site bulk storage tanks of propylene gas are filled by a 3rd party supplier.  Propane and propylene are packaged in pressure vessels (cylinders) to a maximum of 420 pounds.  Both are transferred as a liquid.  Both liquid and gas exist simultaneously within the cylinder, with liquid below the gas.  Gas can be released through a valve on top of the cylinder.  The valve itself is protected on small cylinders (100 pounds or less) by a guard rail and/or valve cap and on larger cylinders by a valve cap or collars.\n\nThe maximum amount of acetylene stored at the facility is 40,000 pounds.  The maximum amount of propylene is 60,000 pounds; propane is 20,000 pounds.\n\nIn the last five years, there have been no major accidents associated with either process.  Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies for the stationary sources include safe operating procedures and a well trained workforce, along with"

      "SummaryText": " an emergency response plan and hazardous materials response team.\n\nWith respect to planned changes for safety, the hydrogen fill system, including the manifold has been completely replaced with updated equipment. Should additional opportunities to improve safety become available, the facility will thoroughly review the feasibility of such a change.\n\nThe EPA requires that the facility identify, analyze and report one-worst case scenario and one alternative-case scenario representing all flammable substances held above the applicable threshold quantities.  The worst-case scenario is defined as the release of a substance which results in the greatest release to endpoint (i.e. the release of the entire contents of the largest vessel in the process, followed by a vapor cloud explosion).  For the alternative case scenario, a more realistic and generally lower amount of the substance can be assumed to be released than that considered for the worst-case scenario.  EPA-approved dispersion model, RMP*Comp, was used to estimate the end point distances for both scenarios.\n\nA worst-case release, as defined in the RMP regulations, is a release of the entire contents of the largest vessel in the process, followed by a vapor cloud explosion.  The single largest vessel of propylene contains a maximum of 3,480 pounds in a horizontal tank.  There are six such tanks manifolded into a filling line, and all tanks are located immediately adjacent to each other.  Because of this, the worst-case release amount for the Tampa-East plant is therefore 20,880 lbs of propylene.  EPA's RMP*Comp was used to calculate the distance to 1 psi overpressure for a vapor cloud explosion involving 20,880 lbs of propylene.\n\nIn consultation with Tampa - East plant personnel and Airgas Safety Director, a leak in a 100-pound propylene cylinder resulting from the age and fatigue of the valve apparatus was chosen as the most likely alternative-case scenario.  For determination of the endpoint distance, it was as"

      "SummaryText": "sumed that the released proppylene would detonate in a vapor cloud explosion.  Similar to the worst-case scenario, EPA's RMP*Comp was used to determine the release rate based on vessel parameters, and the release duration was assumed to be approximately one (1) minute.\n\nThe results of the worst-case and alternative case scenarios are as follows:\n\nAA?    Worst-case Scenario: RMP*Comp calculated endpoint distance 0.2 mile;\nAA?    Alternative-case Scenario: RMP*Comp calculated endpoint distance 0.02 miles.\n\nThe RMP rule requires that an RMP include an estimate of the residential populations within the geographical areas that could be affected by the hypothetical worst-case or alternative releases analyzed.  The geographical area is the area within the circle defined by the endpoint for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios (i.e., the center of the circle is the point of release and the radius is the distance to the endpoint).  In addition, certain types of public receptors and environmental receptors within the radius must be reported in the RMP.\n\nLandview 6 software was used to estimate the population and other environmental receptors potentially affected by the worst-case and alternative-case release scenarios.  A total of 89 housing units (containing 214 residents) were identified to be within the 0.2 mile worst case radius.  The radius also included multiple commercial and industrial facilities.  No residences were identified within the alternative case scenario.\n\nAirgas South has developed and implemented a Program 3 Risk management Plan for the above identified processes as described in this submittal.  All documents pertaining to the RMP are kept on-site and updated as required.\n"
