This\r\ncommitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training of\r\npersonnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our\r\nprocesses.  Our standing practice is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable\r\nreleases of regulated flammable substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained gas plant\r\npersonnel will take appropriate action to control/mitigate the release.\r\n\r\nA DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe East Texas (Avinger) plant, located in rural Marion County, Texas, operates a variety of processes\r\nto recover petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane, condensate) from field gas. \r\nWellhead gas is received at the facility via pipelines.  The liquid hydrocarbons are separated out by employing the cryogenic/turbo-expander/demethanizer process.  The demethanized residue gas is either sold to customers as low pressure gas or recompressed employing five reciprocating compressors for sale to customers as high pressure gas.  The liquid hydrocarbons separated in this process are fed into a fractionation process.  In the fractionation process, propane, butane, and natural gasoline are separated off from the De-ethanizer tower bottom and are sold to third party customers.  The following flammable substances regulated under the Risk Management Program are stored at the facility:  propane, butane, and a flammable mixture (Natural Gas Liquids).  There are no threshold quantities of toxic substances present.  The facility is classified as a Program Level 3 under the regulations.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the East Texas (Avinger) plant. \r\nBecause processes at the gas plant that are regulated"

Examples of employee participation range from updating\r\nand compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a\r\nprocess hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of\r\nthe gas plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the\r\naccident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is\r\nmaintained at the gas plant and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In\r\naddition, the gas plant has a number of initiatives in place that address process safety and\r\nemployee safety issues.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe East Texas (Avinger) plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe\r\noperation of the processes.

For specific process areas, the gas\r\nplant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature,\r\nlevel, composition).  The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits\r\nusing process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective\r\ninstrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\n\r\nThe gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the\r\ndesign and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of\r\nconstruction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This\r\ninformation provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as\r\nevaluating proposed changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\r\nThe East Texas (Avinger) plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with\r\nthe various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is\r\nsystematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to\r\nmanage these hazards.\r\n\r\nThe gas plant primarily uses the HAZOP analysis technique to perform these evaluations.

The East Texas (Avinger)\r\nplant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps\r\nensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare\r\nparts are used when repairs are made.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices\r\n\r\nThe East Texas (Avinger) plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and\r\nprocess safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support\r\npersonnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment\r\nundergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before\r\nprocess piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing\r\nactivities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are\r\nin place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of\r\naffected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are\r\nperformed safely.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\r\nThe East Texas (Avinger) plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes. \r\nThis system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology\r\n(including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly\r\nreviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that\r\nadequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls\r\nhave not been compromised by the change.  Chemical hazard information, process operating\r\nlimits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these\r\nchanges.  In addition, operating and maintenanc"

The investigation team documents its findings,\r\ndevelops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to plant\r\nmanagement for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's\r\nfindings and recommendations are tracked until completed.  The final resolution of each finding\r\nor recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees\r\n(including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are\r\nretained for at least five years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA\r\nrevalidations.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the East Texas (Avinger)\r\nplant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required\r\nby the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at\r\nleast every three years.  Both hourly and staff personnel may participate as audit team members. \r\nThe audit team findings are forwarded to plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions\r\ntaken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until completion.  The final resolution\r\nof each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe processes at the East Texas (Avinger) plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued\r\nsafe operation.

Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential\r\naccidents that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\r\n\r\nSpecialized Safety Features\r\n\r\nThe East Texas (Avinger) plant has safety features to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a\r\nrelease, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety\r\nfeatures are used in the covered processes:\r\n\r\nRelease Detection\r\n\r\nA\u00b7 Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms\r\n\r\nRelease Containment/Control\r\n\r\nA\u00b7 Process relief valves that discharge to a vent stack\r\nA\u00b7 Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\r\nA\u00b7 Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature)\r\nA\u00b7 Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\r\nA\u00b7 Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process\r\ncontrol system, backup pumps)\r\nA\u00b7 Atmospheric relief devices\r\n\r\nRelease Mitigation\r\n\r\nA\u00b7 Fire extinguishers\r\nA\u00b7 Trained personnel\r\nA\u00b7 Personal protective equipment\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe East Texas (Avinger) plant has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past five years. \r\nThere have been no releases of regulated substances that resulted in deaths, injuries, evacuations, or \r\nsheltering in place.  However, on January 18, 2013 during pigging operations, a condensate overfilled causing\r\nliquids to be pushed to the flare.  These liquids overflowed the flare and caught fire causing damage to the flare. \r\nNo offsite impact occurred.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY ACTION PLAN INFORMATION\r\n\r\nThe East Texas (Avinger) plant maintains a written emergency action plan, which is in place to protect the\r\nsafety of workers and the public, as well as the"
