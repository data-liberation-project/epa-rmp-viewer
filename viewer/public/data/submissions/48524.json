Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\r\n\r\nSpecialized Safety Features\r\n\r\nThe North Lansing Liquid Plant has safety features on many units to help contain/control a release and to reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\r\n\r\n       Release Containment Control\r\n\r\n       1) Valves to permit isolation of the process\r\n       2)  Automated bypasses and manual shutoffs for specific process parameters\r\n       3)  Pressure relief valves will be properly d and testes every 3 years.  Any such valve that fails a test will be replaced or   \r\n       repaired and tested annually until engineering is satisfied that it's reliable.\r\n       4)  Baseline ultrasonic testing thickness testing (for pipe corrosion) will be performed prior to startup and every 3 years\r\n       there after.\r\n\r\n       Release Mitigation\r\n\r\n       1)  Local fire department has been notified about the potential hazards of the new facility and has been given the emergency \r\n       response plan.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe North Lansing Liquid Plant is a new facility so therefore, has not had any accidents within the past 5 years.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\n\r\nThe North Lansing Liquid Plant maintains a written emergency response program that is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.

Implementation of mitigation options in response to findings is based on relative risk ranking by the engineer.  The ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to the engineer's hazard analysis findings are tracked until they're completed.  The final solution of each finding is documented and retained.  Hazard analysis findings will be reviewed anytime equipment or operating procedures are changed.  The results and findings from these updates will be documented and retained.  Once the engineer's findings are forwarded to management for consideration, the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe North Lansing Liquid Plant maintains written procedures that address process operations such as (1) startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new employees.  The procedures are periodically reviewed to ensure accuracy.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the North Lansing Liquid Plant maintains written operating procedures, which are readily available to operators in the process unit and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their tasks.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo compliment the written procedures for process operations, the facility has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.

The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) performing tests, (3) correcting identified deficiencies, and (4) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.  Certified contractors will be used for vessel inspection and pressure relief valve testing.\r\n\r\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, and (4) emergency response plans to help ensure that work is performed in a safe manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help to ensure that equipment function as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).

XTO Energy demonstrates this commitment by investing our resources in accident prevention, by continuous safety training, and by placing a high value on safety during design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our goal is to implement reasonable goals to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  In the event of a release, trained company personnel will respond accordingly to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\nPRCESS DESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe North Lansing Liquid Plant, located near Harleton, Texas, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (natural gas, propane, butane, and condensate) from natural gas.  Regulated flammables such as propane and butane are present but no regulated toxic substances are present at North Lansing Liquid.  The facility is a refrigeration unit using compressed propane to cool the incoming gas stream.  This liberates natural gas liquids which are separated in the three phase separator then stabilized in a tower using the glycol still as a heat source.  The stabilized liquids are stored and trucked to delivery.  The glycol is also used to inhibit freezing by injecting it into the inlet stream. The glycol is recovered in the three-phase separator and sent to the still to regenerate.  The gas off the three phase separator is cross exchanged with the inlet then sent to sales.\r\n\r\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\r\n\r\nThe Worst Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances in Program Level 2 processes at the North Lansing Liquid Plant is a Vapor Cloud Explosion (VCE) involving the inventory of the largest storage tank containing 30,000 gallons (159,000 lbs.).  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.45 miles.  Although numero"

The program addresses the responsibilities of each member of the emergency response team and outlines the network of communication to ensure success.  When necessary, the emergency response program is updated based on modifications made to gas plant processes.  The overall emergency response program for the North Lansing Liquid Plant is coordinated with the Harrison County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  The facility has around-the-clock communications capability with the LEPC officials.  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe North Lansing Liquid Plant resolves all findings from hazard analyses, some of which may result in modification to the process.  At the current time, any possible recommendations from hazard analyses will be completed prior to startup of the plant."

This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \r\n\r\nSecurity\r\n\r\nThe North Lansing Liquid Plant uses a locked gate to control the entry and exit of XTO and contractor personnel.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation  \r\n\r\nThe North Lansing Liquid Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and to develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence and forward these results to facility management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during hazard analyses.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the North Lansing   Liquid Plant conducts an audit every 3 years to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit staff members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to North Lansing Liquid management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe processes at the North Lansing Liquid Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.
