It complies with the provisions of OR-OSHA Emergency Response regulations, OAR 437 Division 1910.120.  The Emergency Response Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties. This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events.  This plan has been coordinated with the WyEast Fire Department.\n\nThe approach in the development of this plan has been to identify the ammonia emergencies most likely to occur at Duckwall Fruit and establish precautions and procedures to protect life safety and health during an emergency.  The refrigeration process has back-up prevention systems to keep processing malfunctions from becoming ammonia release emergencies.  If an emergency does occur, the following response personnel, facilities, and equipment are in place:\n\n\u00bf Incident Command Center\n\u00bf Emergency Alarm and Communication System\n\u00bf Emergency Response Team\n\u00bf Safe Rooms, Evacuation Plans, and Assembly Points\n\u00bf Personal Protective Equipment\n\nThe role and procedures for obtaining external emergency assistance have been coordinated with the WyEast Fire District, including the Local Emergency Planning Committee stationed Hood River.  The Emergency Response Plan also includes procedures for notification of any potentially affected neighbors.  \n\nAll Duckwall Fruit personnel will be trained to fulfill their designated responsibilities in an emergency.  Mock emergency drills will be held"

Plan elements essential to safe operation of the refrigeration system include employee participation, process hazard information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, contractor safety, pre-startup safety review, mechanical integrity, management of change, hot-work permits, incident investigation, emergency response and planning, and compliance audits.  This plan will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary by the Duckwall Fruit RMP Team.\n\nTraining is provided to ensure that each employee involved in operating a process has been trained in an overview of the process, the operating procedures, and safety considerations.

      "SummaryText": "1.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1.10 Accidental Release Prevention And Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Duckwall Fruit refrigeration system uses pure anhydrous ammonia (a commonly used refrigerant for industrial systems) as the refrigerant.  Given the quantity handled, anhydrous ammonia is considered a hazardous substance by EPA.  Many of the properties that make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also requires that precautions and procedures be in place to protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical emergency.  It is the policy of Duckwall Fruit to be in compliance with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.    \n\nSafety at Duckwall Fruit is inherent on the manner in which anhydrous ammonia is handled.  While the design of the facility incorporates a multitude of safety devices, safe handling procedures combined with appropriate training of our personnel are key aspects to maintaining safety at our facility.\n\nWe have a written Process Safety Management (PSM) plan that complies with the regulations stipulated by OAR 437 Division 1910.119.  A crucial component of this plan is the Emergency Response Plan, developed in compliance with the Emergency Response provisions of OAR 437 Division 1910.120.  The Emergency Response Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties.  This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events.\n\n1.20 Facility Description And Substances Handled \n\n\u00bf Duckwall Fruit packages, stores, and distributes fruit.  Storage requires the use of a refrigeration system to preserve the fruits.  This refrigeration process uses ammonia as a refrigerant.  Access to the facility is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, and contractors.\n\u00bf The regulated substance handled at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.\n\n1.30 The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and miti"
