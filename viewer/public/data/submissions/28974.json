The RMP summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to the community of hazardous chemical releases. The Risk Management Plan is organized to correspond with specific U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP definitions and requirements, including:\n? Introduction;\n? Facility and regulated substances identification;\n? Hazard Assessment;\n? Prevention Program;\n? Five-Year Accident History;\n? Emergency Response Plan; and\n? Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nIntroduction\nThis RMP documents the safety equipment and procedures used to ensure the safety of Saranac employees and its surrounding neighbors. Saranac is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and to the environment.\n\nFacility  and Regulated  Substance Identification\nThe Falcon Power Operating Company operates the Saranac Cogeneration Project in Plattsbugh, New York.  Two processes on-site use substances regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP); 1) the selective catalytic NOx removal (SCR) systems and 2) the back-up fuel system .  Aqueous ammonia (30%), a regulated toxic RMP substance with a threshold quantity for accidental release prevention of 20,000 pounds, is used in the SCR system to remove NOx emissions. The amount of ammonia present in the system is approximately 31,000 pounds.   Propane, a RMP listed flammable with a threshold quantity for accidental release prevention of 10,000 pounds, is used at the facility as a back-up fuel source during curtailment of, or maintenance on, the natural gas system. . The amount of propane present in the system is approximately 890,000 pounds.   Because a temporary stay has been given to propane reporting, this RMP will only address the ammonia.\n \nHazard Assess"

      "SummaryText": "ment - Worst Case Scenarios (WCS)\nThe worst-case toxic accidental release scenario assumes the entire contents of the single 15,000-gallon ammonia storage tank are spilled instantaneously to form a liquid pool inside the secondary containment area. EPA's RMP Guidance for Wasterwater Treatment Plants show that, under the worst-case weather conditions and an evaporation rate of 30.2 lbs/min., the worst-case release would fall 0.1 miles from the storage tank with a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/m3 (200 ppm). \n\nHazard Assessment - Alternative Release ScenarioS (ARS)\nThe ARS for ammonia assumes that a 2\" pipe is severed and a flow of 1960 lbs per minute is released outside of the diked containment area for five minutes.  Based on an evaporation rate of 28.4 lbs/min, the release is estimated to go 0.1 miles from the tank.\n\nPrevention Program\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the Risk Management Program. This prevention program covers the aqueous ammonia component of the SCR process in which ammonia is present above the threshold quantity for the RMP rules. \nThe prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents. Some of the specific activities in the prevention program include:\n? Process safety information is provided to all affected employees upon hire and is accessible at all times.\n? Hazard Review has been conducted and will be performed every five years.\n? Written operating procedures (kept up-to-date) are used for training and guiding the work of operators.\n? Training is provided to all affected employees upon hire, and refresher training is given annually.\n? A maintenance program is in place to maintain the mechanical integrity of the process, which includes\n  written procedures, training requirements, scheduled and corrective maintenance.\n? Incidents are investigated and actions are taken as part of a continuous improvement effort.\n? Routine audits are conducted to assure that "

      "SummaryText": "safe practices are being followed.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nThere have been no accidents/release of aqueous ammonia at Saranac which led to on-site deaths, injuries or significant damage in the past five years.  There are also no reported incidents of off-site consequences from an accidental release of aqueous ammonia.\n\nEmergency Response Plan\nSaranac has an emergency response plan to ensure that in the event of an emergency the personnel are aware of the appropriate actions to take and authorities to contact in order to mitigate the effects of a release.  Response activities are coordinated with the Plattsburgh Fire Department."
