      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY for AVON:\n\n1.0 Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Kraft Foods facility in Avon, New York has an excellent record in preventing and minimizing releases of anhydrous ammonia (hereafter, anhydrous ammonia will be referred to as ammonia).  This facility has implemented an electronic preventive maintenance system.  This system uses a real time data base to track preventive maintenance, training and inspection dates and issues reminders to responsible groups\n\nThe emergency response procedures at this facility ensure emergency response coverage 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  There are also adequate provisions for coordination with outside agencies, such as the Avon, New York Fire Department and the Livingston County, New York Emergency Planning Committee, in the event of an emergency.\n\n\n2.0  Process Description and Regulated Substances\n\nKraft manufactures frozen whipped toppings and lunch combination products at the Avon, NY plant.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for the primary process at this facility is 311991.  Kraft has one regulated substance under 40 CFR 68 at Avon, NY plant - ammonia.  The storage and process areas of the plant are refrigerated by ammonia to keep the products fresh and wholesome.  Ammonia has been widely used as a refrigerant in the food industry for decades.\n\nThe ammonia threshold for triggering applicability to 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds.  The quantity of ammonia stored on site is approximately 95,000 pounds.\n\nAmmonia is classified as a group 2 Refrigerant per ASHRAE Standard 34-1989.  Its distinctive, pungent odor is very noticable to most people, even in small quantities.  Ammonia is flammable in a very narrow and high range of concentration with a high ignition tempurature.  It is not poisonous, but can be corrosive to human tissue.  Ammonia is readily absorbed into the moisture of the skin and, at high concentrations, can cause burns.  The potential risks to people expo"

      "SummaryText": "sed to an accidental ammonia release include irritation of respiratory tract, burning of skin and other tissue when contacted by ammonia vapor, and freezing of skin and other body tissue when contacted by liquid ammonia.\n\n3.0  Release Scenarios\n\nAlthough there are quality and safety systems in place at Kraft's Avon, New York plant, a release from the ammonia refrigeration system could potentiallt affect employees on-site and the general public offsite.  USEPA requires companies to use models for worst-case and alternate release scenarios for each regulated chemical.  Given the safety precautions at the plant, both of the scenarios are unlikely to occur.  If a release occurred, the alternative scenario would be more likely.\n\nThe ammonia release scenario was modeled using SLAB (June 1990 version) to obtain the distance to the ERPG-2 endpoint.  The Emergency Response Planning Guideline, Level 2, ERPG-2, was developed by the American Industrial Hygiene Association.  It refers to the level of ammonia that individuals could be exposed to for up to one hour without being subjected to irreversible or other serious health effects that could make it difficult for them to leave the affected area.\n\n\n4.0  General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThis facility has developed an OSHA PSM program for its ammonia refrigeration program.  There are several key aspects of the prevention program:\n\n1. Utility personnel are present on site and assigned to the ammonia system, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, all year round.\n\n2. There is a plant-wide ammonia detection system which alerts the utility personnel and security area personnel and both of these areas are staffed continuously.\n\n3. Most of the ammonia pipework is located away from employee traffic patterns and machinery to minimize the chance of an ammonia release.\n\n4. The plant maintains good training, certification and employee awareness of operating procedures (monthly drills with the"

It also deals with training plant personnel who respond to spills and leaks anywhere on site.\n\nThe purpose of the SPCC document is to also establish procedures to notify appropriate agencies (like the LEPC and the fire department) and company personnel in the event of an emergency.  It includes planning for potential spills and the appropriate responses and countermeasures.\n\nOur comprehensive emergency response plan is designed to protect our employees and the community and, among other things, requires that:\n     - All non-essential personnel immediately exit the area affected by the spill;\n     - Kraft immediately notify local officials, requesting their assistance, if necessary;\n\nFor a release that leaves the site, the company would work with the local fire and police officials to notify neighbors so that appropriate safety precautions could be taken.  If ammonia is in the outside atmosphere, the safest"
