Our plant consists of one 9,000 gallon and 11 nurse tanks for a total capacity of 88,000#.\n\nThe worst case and the alternate release scenarios have been evaluated and ahared with our local first responders as part of an on-going trainig program. Our employees have been trained in their reapective emergency actions, including the emergency meeting place and each of their individual responsibilities regarding an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. We comply with the standards of the U. S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and the regulations of the Kansas Department of Agriculture. \n\n\tThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. \n\n\tThe facility has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38.
