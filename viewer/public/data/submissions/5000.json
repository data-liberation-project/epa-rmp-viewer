The facility was expanded in 1998 to treat 11.5 million gallons \nper day of groundwater to help meet the City\u0012s domestic water service demands.  A gaseous chlorine system is used \nat the Bailey WCF to oxidize the iron and manganese in the influent well water and to provide a chlorine residual in \nthe water for disinfection.  The facility is equipped with chlorine detectors and a chlorine vapor scrubber system.\n\nThe facility is normally un-manned.  Operators and maintenance staff travel to the Bailey WCF from the City\u0012s \noperation center at the Avenue Water Treatment Plant in Ventura.\n\n\nCHEMICALS SUBJECT TO ARPP RULE \n\nThe Bailey facility uses chlorine in quantities large enough to trigger the Environmental Protection Agency\u0012s \nAccidental Release Prevention Program (EPA\u0012s ARPP) and California\u0012s Accidental Release Prevention Program \n(Cal ARPP).  One-ton cylinders of liquid chlorine are delivered to the plant by truck.  A maximum of 9 one-ton \nchlorine cylinders can be stored onsite in a building equipped with gas detectors and an automatic emergency \nscrubber.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASES DURING PAST 5 YEARS\n\nThe facility has not had any releases during the past 5 years that resulted in any injuries, off-site evacuations, or \nproperty damage.\n\n\nPROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT ACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe facility is subject to OSHA\u0012s Process Safety Management (PSM) rule.  The City has developed a stringent PSM \nsafety program that includes the following elements:\n\n? Review of the design of all equipment and controls for the chlorine system to ensure they are properly designed \nand installed.\n  \n?
