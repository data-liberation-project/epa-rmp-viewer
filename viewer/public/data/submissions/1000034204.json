Also, all employees shall act as ?initial responders? in an emergency incident within the capabilities of each one and without compromising their safety.\n\n* SACHS immediately informs the Local Emergency Planning Committee of any changes at the site which may be relevant to emergency planning, as well as any information necessary for development or implementation of local emergency plans [40 CFR 355.30(d)].\n\n\n\nThe General Duty Clause [Section 112(r)(1) of the Clean Air Act] requires facilities to manage their facilities in a safe manner which prevents and abates accidental air releases; SACHS adopts the General Duty Clause as one of its most important incident prevention policies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB) DESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE & REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nSACHS is a facility engaged exclusively in the distribution and sale of oils/chemicals [North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code # 42469].  No manufacturing operations occur at SACHS.       The SACHS' warehousing, shipping, and distribution facility is located within a lot of approximately 7,925 square meters.     The site is within an industrially-zoned region. The facility is bordered by Servimetal, Inc. to the north; an unnamed creek to the south; a depository of bank-repossessed road-and-marine vehicles managed by First Bank to the east; and Steel and Pipes, Inc. to the west.\n\n\n\nThe facility consists of a reinforced concrete building (of approximately 50,000 square feet), which provides for adequate protection against weather and vandalism.  The building shelters properly (i.e., within concrete roof, walls, and floor) the following: office/administration areas, warehousing areas (for the storage of oils/chemicals in non-bulk"

An Electricity Generation Unit (EGU) is located outside of the building (i.e., at the southwestern corner of the site), which provides power to the facility in the eventuality of failure at the P.R. Electric Power Authority (PREPA) electrical power system. \n\n\n\nSACHS is a facility with relative minor hazards. There is no underground storage on site; however, the facility has a below-ground sanitary wastewater treatment system.\n\n\n\nRegarding regulated substances and processes subject to 40 CFR 68, there is only one (1) regulated substance and one (1) regulated process at SACHS:  storage in 55-gallon containers of hydrochloric acid (concentration 37% or greater).   This single-regulated process is subject to Program 2 Prevention Program elements.\n\n\n\nC) HAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\n\n\nThis section discusses the hazard assessment performed for the following regulated substance that triggered its corresponding regulatory threshold of 40 CFR 68.130 at SACHS: hydrochloric acid (concentration 37% or greater).  The hazard assessment was oriented toward analyzing the consequences of worst-case/alternative release scenarios for the previously mentioned regulated substance [the analyses of these two (2) scenarios are hereinafter called as Offsite Consequence Analyses or OCAs]. Each of the analyses include a determination of the area surrounding the facility impacted by the scenario (assumed to be a circular-shaped area), the offsite impacts to the population, and the offsite impacts to the environment.  \n\n\n\nOCAs (for worst-case/alternative release scenarios at SACHS, respectively) were conducted using RMP*Comp, a software developed by EPA for this type of anal"

Since there are no meteorological monitoring stations near SACHS, the default meteorology/values provided by RMP*Comp were utilized for both the worst-case/alternative OCAs.  The following information/values were input into RMP*Comp: area setting (i.e., urban), release quantity, and ambient/liquid temperatures. \n\n\n\nFor the estimate of the population affected within the estimated release-impacted zones (another requirement of the hazard assessment), MARPLOT version 4.2.3 (April 2013) was used.  For the determination of offsite impacts to the environment, a review of the USGS 7.5 topographic quadrangle for Aguas Buenas was used, together with a physical reconnaissance of the areas in the immediate vicinity of the site (i.e., at the release impact zones estimated by the OCAs).\n\n\n\nFor the worst-case release scenario, SACHS considered four (4) 55-gallon containers of the regulated substance [i.e., the four (4) containers stored within a pallet] to be involved in the worst-case release.   This corresponds to an estimated quantity of 2,184 pounds of the regulated substance involved in the release; the release was assumed to occur at ground level, within an elapsed period of ten (10) minutes, and with the following mitigation measure allowed by RMP*Comp: \"release in enclosed space, in direct contact with outside air\".  The analysis indicate that, under worst-case release scenario conditions, the regulated substance could travel 1.1 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  The affected population estimate was 5,800 persons [rounded to two (2) significant figures].\n\n\n\nFor the alternative release scenario, SACHS considered one (1) 55-gallon container of the regulated substance to be involved in the alternative release.   This corresponds to an estimated quantity of 546 pounds of the regulated substance involved in the release; the release was assumed to occur at ground level and within an elapsed period of ten (10) minutes.

The ICP has been coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) emergency response plan.  SACHS?s ICP is designed to minimize hazards to human health and the environment from contingencies such as medical emergencies, chemical/waste/oil releases (including releases of regulated substances), fires/explosions, natural disasters, general threats, biological agent threats, and air pollution emergency episodes of CAA?s criteria pollutants at SACHS.  The ICP, in turn, constitutes the Emergency Response Plan for releases of regulated substances, as required by SACHS Risk Management Program.    \n\n\n\nG) PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe compliance audit conducted at Sachs Chemical, Inc. for overseeing compliance with 40 CFR 68 Program 2 Prevention Program elements for the original RMP (2008) identified the following change to improve the safety of the only-regulated process at the facility [storage in containers of hydrochloric acid (concentration 37% or greater)]: provide secondary containment to the containers.  Sachs Chemical, Inc. implemented this process change on June 30th, 2008.  The secondary containment system consists of dikes [i.e., semicircular bumps at warehouse exit points - the bumps are made of Stonclad GS epoxy mortar and have an approximate height of one (1) inch - the system provides a secondary containment capacity of 21,187 gallons, which is"
