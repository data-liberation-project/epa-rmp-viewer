Isopropylamine is the only chemical handled on this site that is included in the Risk Management Plan. We receive isopropylamine in trucks and railcars and have one 37000 gallon storage tank for 100% or 70% isopropylamine.\n\nHelena Industries, Inc. is committed to safety from the senior management level to the employees. Compliance with federal and state regulations is a priority. Several company safety programs are in place; Process Safety Management, Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures Plan, Hazard Communication and Community Right-To-Know, Safety Committee, written emergency procedures, incident investigations, management of change, and employee training. Each new employee is given Right-To-Know training, and overall Safety Awareness training. These programs combined with safe operating procedures, controls, and equipment maintenance contributes to the overall climate of safe working conditions.\n\nHelena Industries, Inc. plant is located on 20 acres of flat terrain in a rural/industrial area of the community. Within the facility, a storm water drainage system manages water runoff. This system operates under an NPDES Permit issued by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources (IADNR) and required monitoring of the outflows from this system is done by annual reports to the IADNR.   A shallow concrete trench located between the facility railroad tracks in the paved area directs spills on toward the spill containment basin west of the main building.  There is a sluice gate located at the west end of the trench, which is normally closed during unloading operations, in order to help contain any spill and prevent it from migrating to the basin.  The basin is sized to handle a spill from a full tank truck and a 24 hour, 25 year rain event.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program: \nThe facility operates under OSHA Process Safety Management.

      "SummaryText": "cility operates under a Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures Plan (SPCC Plan). This plan outlines procedures for plant operations pertaining to oil products and by extension all other liquid chemical products handled at this facility. This plan covers operations pertaining to transfer, loading, unloading, piping, storage, and containment of liquid chemical products. The Isopropylamine is stored in a specially constructed tank that is double walled and is its own containment system, which will reduce the chance of an accidental release.\n\nEmergency Response: \nFacility personnel do not respond to emergency situations. They do clean up incidental spills of chemical products. The facility has coordinated its response actions with the local fire department. The fire department annually receives the facility EPCRA report.  We have training on the emergency plan annually and evacuation drills at least annually.\n\nAccident History: \nIsopropylamine is a new chemical for this facility and there is no accident history associated with its use.\n\nPlanned Changes:\nThis is a new process and there are no planned changes at this time."
