Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Gordon Gas Processing Plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team\u2019s findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nNo incident resulting in onsite or offsite impacts from an accidental release from a covered process has occurred at the Gordon Gas Processing Plant within the last five years. Although we take pride in that record, we also place daily emphasis on our prevention and safety programs to ensure this record continues. \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our natural gas liquid extraction, LP-Gas handling, and storage facility, it is our policy to follow our Emergency Response Plan, which is linked with the Palo Pinto County Emergency Management District Emergency Response Plan. Activation of this emergency response plan sets in motion a pre-planned series of events that notify all area emergency response agencies. Emergency response agencies are notified on the 911 system and directly. The 911 call is channeled through the Palo Pinto County Sheriff\u2019s Department. All agencies and personnel respond to predetermined staging areas with representatives from each agency reporting to the Central Command Post (CP).

Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping and equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e. hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely. \n\nManagement of Change:  Gordon Gas Processing Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change. \n\nIncident Investigation:  Gordon Gas Processing Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules, and (6) inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with orientation sessions pertaining to these key points. \n\nPre-startup Safety Review (PSSR):  Gordon Gas Processing Plant conducts a PSSR on any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented. \n\nMechanical Integrity:  Gordon Gas Processing Plant has well established practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. The facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) method analysis technique to perform these evaluations. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. Periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. \n\nOperating Procedures:  Gordon Gas Processing Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process. These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and provide the basis for training new operators.  Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff. \n\nTraining:  In addition to training on operating procedures, the facility has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process.

Additionally, all employees, contractors, and visitors have stop work authority when potential unsafe conditions are observed.\n\nProcess Safety Information:  Complete and accurate written process safety information (PSI) concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to an effective PSM and RMP program and to completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis (PHA). The PSI will be useful to the operators; the team performing the PHA; those in charge of training; contractors; those conducting pre-startup safety reviews; and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans. Process safety information is readily available to all employees. Gordon Gas Processing Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and"

      "SummaryText": "ased on a 2022 Google Maps aerial review the property surrounding the Gordon Plant within a 0.4-mile radius is mostly a mixture of agriculture and residential properties.  No public parks or churches were identified within the 0.4-mile radius.  The following provides a summary of the worst-case analysis performed. \n\nNGL - Vapor Cloud Explosion: 0.4 Miles\nPropane - Vapor Cloud Explosion: 0.4 Miles\n\nIn addition to the worst-case analysis, the following alternative case analyzes summarized below were performed.   The alternative release scenarios are characterized as more likely scenarios that would involve offsite consequences.\n\nPropane - Fireball from BLEVE: 0.3 Miles\nNGL - Vapor Cloud Fire: <0.1 Miles\n\nThese scenarios would account for any potential releases from process piping including flanges, joints, welds, valves, and valve seals.  Any releases from vessels including drains, bleeds, cracks, seal failures, plug failures, overfilling, over pressurization, and venting would also be accounted for in these scenarios.  Methods utilized to preventing such events include regular site walks during the day to identify abnormalities not automatically monitored by the sites computer system, alarm systems, isolation valves, auto shut-off systems, training of operational staff, training requirements for contractors and visitors, signage posted to provide unloading and loading instructions, and barriers in place to prevent vehicles from hitting equipment and tanks.\n\nColt has discussed these potential hydrocarbon releases with its employees and with local emergency response officials in Palo Pinto County, thereby further reducing the possibility of any impact on the public.  \n  \nPrevention Program\n\nBelow is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Gordon Gas Processing Plant.  Because the processes at the facility are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA\u2019s) Risk Management Program (RMP) and are also subject to the OSHA PSM, this summary a"

      "SummaryText": "eam enters the refrigeration unit, where propane from one of two 18,000 gallon propane tanks is used to cool the gas and remove heavier hydrocarbons. The refrigeration system includes a 2,800 gal propane carryover tank as well.  The remaining gas (residue) is sent to compressor engines where it is compressed and sent to pipeline. After passing through an amine contactor to remove carbon dioxide, the Natural Gas Liquids (NGL) recovered in the refrigeration unit is passed through a 11,000 gallon NGL surge tank and routed offsite via pipeline.  The Gordon Plant has the capabilities to also receive from off-site via truck or store NGLs into two 32,000 gallon NGL Tanks for further processing or transport off-site.  The facility consists of multiple small lube oil, waste oil, condensate and fuel tanks and their associated piping, valves, pumps, and compressors on site that support the compressor station as well as the NGL tanks.  As such, the Gordon Gas Processing Plant is classified as a Program 3 RMP facility.\n\nThe purpose of the Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about our operations at the facility, our programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, our emergency response plans in case an accidental release should occur, our 5-year accident history, and our planned changes to improve safety at the facility.  \n\nWorst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nAs specified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP Regulations, the worst-case release scenario for flammables, vapor cloud explosion, was performed.  Based on the analysis using the EPAs RMP*Comp \u2122 calculations, the worst-case scenario resulted from the 32,000-gallon Natural Gas Liquids (NGL) Storage Tank.  The calculated endpoint of the one pound over pressure from a vapor cloud explosion is approximately 0.4-mile each vessel.  2010 Census Data provide through the EPA MARPLOT Version 5.1.1 identified that approximately 0 people and 0 residences were within the impact area.

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nIntroduction and Policies:\n\nGordon Gas Processing Plant, owned and operated by Colt G&P (North Texas) L.P., is committed to the same quality of safety and environmental excellence that all other Colt assets promote.  This philosophy involves making each and every employee and contractor accountable for their own safety as well as that of the community around them.  As a company we follow a close adherence to all applicable federal, state, and local laws to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all.\n\nEmployees who enter the Gordon Gas Processing Plant complete a thorough training, both in the classroom and on-the-job, that enables them to address emergency issues as they arise.  This preparation includes standard operational, emergency operational, and release prevention training.  In addition, periodic refresher courses help to keep operators\u2019 problem solving abilities up to date and in sync with our recurring safety improvements.  Our regular internal audits provide an excellent checks and balances system for monitoring these high standards that we set.\n\nThe Gordon Gas Processing Plant, located along County Road 193 (CR-193) east of Gordon in Palo Pinto County, Texas, is a natural gas plant that extracts natural gas liquids (NGLs) from natural gas.  County Road 193 splits the plant into two sections with the initial liquid separation and dehydration occurring in the section south of CR-193 and the majority of the gas processing occurring in the northern potion.  The facility operates a variety of processes to recover petroleum products (e.g., natural gas and NGLs) from field gas.  Natural gas enters the Gordon Processing Plant, where condensate and water are separated from the field gas.  The condensate is routed to two 27,000 gallon or one 23,000 gallon pressurized condensate storage vessels and then routed offsite via trucks.  Produced water and slop oil are routed to atmospheric tanks and later routed offsite via trucks.  The inlet gas str"
