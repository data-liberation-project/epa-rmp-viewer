The safety and health of all personnel are very important. The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the Smithfield Clinton Plant facility.  ColonialWebb Contractors was contracted to assist Terry Orness and Frederick Bowen in updating and submitting the Risk Management Program to the EPA.  The RMP was developed and updated with the most current information available from Smithfield Clinton Plant.  In this document, there are four scenarios that were evaluated, two per facility ammonia system, per mandate of the EPA.  The Worst Case Release Scenario 1, for the LPC System, found that 8,889 people would be affected by the potential ammonia release.  The Worst Case Release Scenario 2, for the BTL System, found that 12,163 people would be affected by the potential ammonia release.  The alternative Release Scenario 1, for the LPC System, found that 0 people would be affected by the potential ammonia release.  The Alternative Release Scenario 2, for the BTL System, found that 0 people would be affected by the potential ammonia release.  The submission is due to the need to fulfill the requirements mandated by the EPA for a new submission or an update to occur every 5 years. The RMP was resubmitted due to a major construction project adding a vessel to the BTL System, which changed the Worst Case Release Scenario for the system. The RMP resubmission was completed on 11/28/2016 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n "
