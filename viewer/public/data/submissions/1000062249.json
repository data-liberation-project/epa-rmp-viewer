      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\n\n\n\nDollar General Corporation has developed a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to address the Environmental Protection Agency's RMP Program requirements (Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40, Chapter I, Subchapter C, Part 68). The facility is extremely diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community. The facility's staff is trained and utilizes modern equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while safely storing and distributing anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICIES\n\n\n\nThe facility has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Ammonia Refrigeration System. The facility policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent the foreseeable release of regulated substances.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is ammonia refrigeration. The largest vessel storing anhydrous ammonia in the system is the High Pressure Receiver (HPR), which is capable of storing 11,220 pounds (lbs.) of anhydrous ammonia, taking into account administrative controls. The total inventory of anhydrous ammonia at the facility is 19,115 lbs., which classifies the process as an RMP Program 3 process, which is regulated by OSHA PSM regulations as well.\n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nThe Off-site Consequence Analysis must be reviewed every five years or within six months of process changes or other changes that may significantly affect the results of the Off-site Consequence Analysis.\n\n \n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\n\n\n\nScenario Description: Per the CalARP Regulations, one worst-case release scenario has been defined for the Ammonia Refrigeration System. The results can be found in the Hazard As"

The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation.\n\n\n\nRisk Considerations\n\n\n\nAlthough the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia has inherent potential risks and the release scenarios can potentially reach sensitive populations within the community, the facility has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst case type of event non-credible.  It should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event, which further makes the worst case type of event non-credible.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an anhydrous ammonia release.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nAs part of the implementation of RMP Program 3, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by the facility to manage process safety issues associated with the use of anhydrous ammonia. Prevention Program 3 elements are listed below:\n\n\n\n?    40 CFR ? 68.65 Process Safety Information (PSI)\n\n?    40 CFR ? 68.67 Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n?    40 CFR ? 68.69 Operating Procedures (OP)\n\n?    40 CFR ? 68.71 Training (TRN)\n\n?    40 CFR ? 68.73 Mechanical Integrity (MI)\n\n?    40 CFR ? 68.75 Management of Change (MOC)\n\n?    40 CFR ? 68.77 Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\n?    40 CFR ? 68.79 Compliance Audits (CA)\n\n?    40 CFR ? 68.81 Incident Investigation (II)\n\n?    40 CFR ? 68.83 Employee Participation (EP)\n\n?    40 CFR ? 68.85 Hot Work Permit (HWP)\n\n?    40 CFR ? 68.87 Contractors (CON)\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere "

      "SummaryText": "have been no EPA RMP-applicable releases of anhydrous ammonia at the facility in at least the past five (5) years.\n\n\n\nEXTERNAL EVENTS ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nDuring the PHA, a broad list of external events was considered by the Team. General events external to the plant that can conceivably cause a release of anhydrous ammonia were addressed. The External Events that were considered credible include, but are not limited to, earthquake, tornadoes, aircraft impact, external fire, and human error/mis-operation.\n\nThe estimated magnitude or scope of external events which were considered. The magnitudes of the external events considered are detailed within the PHA Worksheets and were qualitatively risk-ranked by the PHA Team. This technical document can be found in the PSM/CalARP/RMP Program 3 Compliance Workbook. General events external to the plant that can conceivably cause a release of anhydrous ammonia were addressed by the Process Hazard Analysis. This technical study can be found in the PSM/CalARP/RMP Program 3 Compliance Workbook.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \n\n\n\nThe facility is included in the written Community Emergency Response Plan (ERP) and has an Emergency Action Plan in place. Furthermore, the facility has procedures in place to evacuate the facility and notify responders when there is a need for response, located onsite.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe PHA study has been conducted to examine mitigation measures to improve safety at the facility. Planned changes to improve safety are listed as recommendations in the PHA Report. Any outstanding recommendations will be addressed.\n\n"
