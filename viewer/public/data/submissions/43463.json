(\"Sterling\") Texas City, Texas facility (\"Texas City Plant\") are engrained in the fundamentals of the process safety prevention program. \n\nIn the Texas City Plant, Sterling handles chemicals, which are considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The same properties that make these chemicals valuable as commodities in the production of consumer products also make it necessary to observe specific safety precautions.  \n\nThese safety precautions are exercised in the handling and production processes to control human and environmental exposure in an effort to reduce the overall threat to our workers as well as the surrounding communities.  \n\nIt is Sterling's policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws, rules, and regulations.  However, the safe handling of hazardous chemicals is paramount at Sterling.  Standards and recommended practices governing the safe handling of hazardous chemicals are used to ensure that a reasonable level of risk reduction is maintained.  Investigation of inherently safer technologies, hazardous chemical inventory reduction and/or elimination studies, and fail safe design applications are a few of the continuous improvements occurring at Sterling.  Safety depends upon management commitment, the manner in which chemicals are processed and handled, the safety devices inherent to process designs, operating procedures and philosophies, and the training of Sterling workers.\n\nAdditionally, Sterling believes employee involvement is the cornerstone to continued safe operations.  This is known as employee ownership and its success is portrayed through lower injury rates, fewer incidents, and improved operating efficiencies at the Texas City Plant.

They are: a) Hazard Recognition Inspection, b) Contractor Safety, c) Safety Procedure Review, d) Process Safety Management Steering Committee, and e) Emergency Response Improvement. \n\n \nThe Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan outlines procedures for warned and unwarned emergencies that may occur at the plant.  Warned emergencies are usually weather related, such as hurricanes, or freezes.  Unwarned emergencies usually consist of on-site emergencies such as fire, explosion or a chemical release.  Sterling provides the emergency response teams with equipment and the latest training and procedures.  This ensures prompt mitigation actions during incidents and rapid notification to any surrounding neighborhood that may be inadvertently affected by a plant emergency.\n\nSterling maintains policies covering five organizations that make up the overall emergency preparedness and response program for the plant.  These five emergency response organizations include the: a) Fire Brigade, b) Emergency Medical Technicians, c) Emergency Wardens, d) Emergency Operations Communication Coordinators, and e) STEPS Emergency Response Improvement Team.  These organizations are capable of responding to onsite and offsite emergencies.  In addition, Sterling is an active member of the IMAS (Industrial Mutual Aid System).\n\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nSterling is a diversified chemical company.  Its petrochemical business currently manufactures styrene, acetic acid, and plasticizers at the Texas City Plant.  \n\nThe Texas City Plant covers approximately 290 acres within the Texas City Industrial Complex.   It has marine facilities for receiving sea-going ships and barges, rail facilities for delivery and shipment of chemicals by rail, and a network of pipelines supplying needed feedstocks.  It is located at 201 Bay Street South in Texas Ci"

There may be approximately 300 total workers at the plant at any one time during labor-intensive activities such as turnarounds. \n\nSterling presently handles both toxic and flammable chemicals, which are considered hazardous by the EPA.  These substances are present in quantities greater than the threshold quantity identified by the RMP regulation and therefore are included in Sterling?s risk management program.  \n\nAmmonia (anhydrous) - Ammonia is primarily used at the plant to produce acrylonitrile. Ammonia is currently received by refrigerated barge.  It is stored in a refrigerated tank at atmospheric pressure.  The storage tank is contained within a concrete bunker to mitigate any failure of the storage tank.  Sterling has a capacity of approximately 30,000 tons of ammonia.\n\nChlorine ? Chlorine is used for water treatment at Sterling.  It is received by special equipped truck, designed to transport chlorine one-ton containers.  Approximately 22, one-ton containers may be in use at the Texas City Plant at any one time for the purification of water.\n\nHydrogen Chloride (anhydrous) ? Hydrogen chloride is received into the plant by tank car (rail service) from Dow Chemical.  These tank cars are temperature controlled and are constantly monitored while inside the plant to ensure that the chemical remains within safe temperatures and pressures.  Each tank car at the Texas City Plant has a capacity of approximately 145,000 pounds.  At any one time, two tank cars may be onsite at the Texas City Plant.\n\nFlammable Substances (natural gas) ? Methane (natural gas) is delivered to the Sterling site by pipeline.  It is used as a dilution gas, to provide fuel for steam generation, and general utility operations; it is used as a fuel source.\n\nAcrylonitrile ? The only acrylonitrile onsite at the Texas City plant is incidental storage re"

The remaining acrylonitrile in quantities greater than 1% is stored in tanks 51T7-1, T7-2, T18-1, T15-2, and T15-3. \n\nHydrocyanic Acid (hydrogen cyanide) ? Hydrocyanic acid is present in 51T15-2 as a mixture at a concentration at or below 0.7% by weight, although it may be present in quantities above the TQ, mixtures below 1.0% are not reported in accordance with the provisions outlined in EPA 550-B-99-009, Section 3.2.4.\n\n\nAccidental Release Program & Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nSterling continues to manage changes to its process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures for processes covered by OSHA's Process Safety Management (\"PSM\") program and EPA?s Risk Management Program.  Sterling's \"Management of Change\" Safety & Health Procedure has been a useful tool in helping employees understand how to apply Management of Change (\"MOC\") to prevent or minimize the potential consequences associated with a catastrophic release of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals at Sterling.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (\"PSSRs\") are performed for new facilities and for modified facilities when the modification is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information, and the facilities are a part of a PSM or RMP covered process.  These PSSRs are held to verify that all appropriate safety information has been updated and that all appropriate reviews are performed and training has been completed.\n\nSterling conducted its first iteration process hazard analysis study of the proposed ammonia modification in August of 2003.  This was followed by a more recent evaluation, a Hazard and Operability Study, conducted in March 2004.\n\n\nFive year Accident History\n\nSince Sterling?s initial RMP submittal in June 1999, and an updated submittal in 2000, there have been no accidental releases of RMP regulated chemicals in accordance with the reporting requirements outlined in 40 CFR Part 68.42. \n\n\nEmergency"

      "SummaryText": " Response Program\n\nIn order to improve emergency response efforts within the plant, Sterling formed the Emergency Operations Communication Coordinators (EOCC) group of plant volunteers.  The function of this group is to provide: offsite industrial hygiene monitoring during a chemical release incident, perform dispersion modeling in the event of a release, and act as a communications resource to make notifications and provide pertinent information during an incident.\n\nSterling also enacted an Emergency Response Improvement Team (\"ERIT\"), which was formed to coordinate emergency response activities at the plant.  The team looks at each part of emergency response and determines if improvements are needed in areas of training, communications, etc.    \n\nPlanned Improvements to Reduce Risk\n\nIn accordance with its risk management program, Sterling Chemicals conducts continuous self-examination evaluations designed to identify and assess process/operational risk employees and the community.  One of the primary aspects of Sterling?s risk management program is the empowerment of each business unit with the responsibility for continuous safe operations.  \n\nSince the previous RMP submittal Sterling has significantly reduced its inventory of highly hazardous chemicals.  The Texas City plant site no longer maintains inventories of sulfur dioxide, propane, and propylene.  The only inventory of hydrocyanic acid onsite is as a mixture of less than 1.0% in acrylonitrile storage."
