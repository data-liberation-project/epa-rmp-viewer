At this point the fire chief would serve as the incident commander with extensive consultation being made with the site shift supervisor.  Through this team effort the emergency would be controlled quickly and safely.\r\n\r\nB.

Describe the primary activities at the facility (e.g., manufacturer of polyethylene, pulp mill, etc.) and the regulated substances used.  In addition, you may want to mention the quantities of these substances handled or stored at your facility.\r\n\r\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\r\n\r\nThe first sections of the Delaware City PVC plant were built in 1966 by Stauffer Chemical Co. The facility was acquired in 1981 by the Formosa Plastics Corporation USA.  The current plant property line covers 112 acres of which approximately 30 acres is leased as farmland.  The site employs 100 full-time employees.  The major components of the facility involve two PVC Polymerization units, two dryer units, an automatic bagging plant, waste water treatment plant, and the finished goods warehouse.  The plant production capability is 180 tons of PVC Resin per day. \r\n\r\nPRIMARY ACTIVITIES:\r\n\r\nThe primary activities carried out at the facility involve polymerization of Vinyl Chloride and Vinyl Chloride / Vinyl Acetate Copolymers, drying of PolyVinyl Chloride, Packaging of PolyVinyl Chloride, Storage and Shipping of PolyVinyl Chloride, and treatment of process waste water.\r\n\r\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES:\r\n\r\nVinyl Chloride - Three 425,000 pound storage tanks\r\n\r\nVinyl Acetate - One 240,000 pound storage tank\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION PROCESS:\r\n\r\nThe facility produ"

      "SummaryText": "ction process involves converting Vinyl Chloride to PolyVinyl Chloride Dispersion Resins and Specialty Resins.  In order to produce PolyVinyl Chloride, vinyl chloride is received in rail cars and unloaded into storage tanks.  From the storage tanks the vinyl chloride is then transferred into reactors.  Then under controlled temperature and pressure conditions in a water medium, the vinyl chloride molecules are linked together to form long chains.  These long chains are called polymerized vinyl chloride or PolyVinyl Chloride.\r\n\r\n \r\nIn order to produce copolymer resins, an additional raw material, vinyl acetate is used at the facility.  The use of this raw material allows the production of co-polymers with vinyl chloride.  These products provide improved fusion rate properties which allow users to process the resin at lower operating temperatures.  After the PolyVinyl Chloride is created it is then dried through a natural gas fired dryer.  The dried material is then deagglomerated and transferred into storage silos.  From the storage silos the final product is packaged and stored in our finished goods warehouse from where it is transported to our customers.\r\n\r\nAs part of the reaction process a large volume of water is required.  Water that is not evaporated during the drying process and storm water that falls on site is treated through the facilityA\u00bfs waste water treatment plant prior to final discharge through the plant outfall to the Delaware River.\r\n\r\nFinal products produced at the Delaware City plant are used for medical examination gloves, adhesives, carpet backing, floor covering, automotive sealants and upholstery, bottle cap seals, traffic safety cones, automotive air filter gaskets and many other useful finished products.\r\n\r\nC.

In addition, if you considered passive mitigation measures in your analysis, you must identify both the mitigation systems in use and their effect (e.g., \"A concrete dike around the tank limits the exposed surface area of a pool and thus reduces the release rate to X.\").

In this scenario, 240,000 pounds of vinyl acetate would be released within 10 minutes and the resulting pool of chemical then vaporized.  Using EPAA\u00bfs RMP*COMP Version 1.07 modeling program, it was determined that the impact of this scenario would be felt 0.2 miles away from the point of the spill.  In the impact zone it has been estimated that 60 residences, and neighboring industrial facilities would be impacted.\r\n\r\nAs part of conducting the evaluation of the impact of this scenario a passive mitigation system 40' x 41' x 3' dike surrounding the storage tank was considered to limit the impact of the release.  The reasoning behind documenting this scenario as the alternate case toxic release was based upon the fact that all Vinyl Acetate is stored in this tank, but passive mitigation reduces the impact zone.\r\n\r\n\r\nD. The general accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps\r\n\r\nYou may wish to mention the rules and regulations with which your facility complies, such as the OSHA PSM rule. You should also highlight practices that you believe are important to your prevention program.  The steps you list may be either technological (e.g., backup systems) or procedural/managerial (e.g., improved maintenance or training).\r\n\r\nOSHA PSM\r\n\r\nDue to the fact that the facility uses, stores, and handles Vinyl Chloride and Vinyl Acetate, and the fact that the quantities are gr"

      "SummaryText": "eater than 10,000 pounds, the facility must comply with OSHAA\u00bfs Process Safety Management Standard 29 CFR 1910.119.  This regulation requires that several conditions must be met such as; ensuring that Hot Work Permits are issued for welding and cutting operations, conducting routine compliance audits to ensure compliance, mechanical integrity to ensure the equipment is properly maintained and conducting process hazard analyses.  Each of these requirements ensure that employees are provided with a safe working environment and in turn ensure that the community are adequately protected.\r\n\r\nNESHAP\r\n \r\nVinyl Chloride is a regulated substance under the EPA NESHAP and PVC MACT Standards.  These regulations limit the amount of vinyl chloride emitted to the atmosphere from routine operations. The site is also required to implement and maintain an enhanced leak detection and repair program for the early detection and repair of leaks from equipment. \r\n\r\nAmbient Air Monitoring Program (ARCAS)\r\n\r\nIn an effort to respond quickly to potential hazardous conditions an ambient air monitoring system and associated program has been implemented.  This program enables employees to monitor the atmosphere of critical process areas on a 24 hour basis.  The program is comprised of 4 gas chromatographs, each with the capability to collect atmospheric samples from 20 monitoring points.  The monitors are tied into visual alarms that are set to go off at 1 ppm (part per million).  This allows employees to be informed quickly so that immediate action can be taken to locate and stop possible leaks. \r\n\r\n5 - 50 and >100 PPM Emission Investigation Program\r\n\r\nThe 5 - 50 ppm and >100 ppm emission investigation programs were voluntarily instituted to pro-actively determine the date, time, cause, equipment, shift, location and probable cause of potential VCM emissions.  When the ARCAS emissions monitors detect a concentration of VCM in the facility greater than or equal to 5 ppm, the area operators conta"

Once the situation has been corrected, a more thorough investigation, depending on concentration, is conducted to determine the root cause of the incident and to implement preventive measures to prevent recurrence of the situation. Corrective actions, that are the result of a > 100ppm emission, are tracked through the siteA\u00bfs ISO non-conformance process to ensure timely completion and a determination of the effectiveness of the action to prevent future leaks.\r\n\r\nEarly Relief Vent\r\n\r\nThe early relief venting system is designed to relieve vinyl chloride from vessels at a pressure below the pressure relief valve (PRV) rating.  This closed system prevents the release of vinyl chloride gas to the atmosphere by utilizing the siteA\u00bfs recovery system to contain vinyl chloride. \r\n\r\nISO 9002 and ISO 14001\r\n\r\nIn 1994 the facility achieved ISO 9002 Registration and in 1996 the facility achieved ISO 14001 Registration.  Furthermore the site attained registration to the new ISO9001-2000 standard in 2003, and to ISO14001-2004 in 2005. As part of the registration process, program audits are conducted by a third party on a semi-annual basis to ensure compliance.  The facility has maintained registration under these standards on a semi-annual basis by demonstrating that a strong quality assurance program and environmental management system program are in place and that these programs are effective.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nE.

The emergency response program\r\n\r\nBriefly describe the elements of your response program such as coordination with local emergency responders, training received by personnel, drills conducted by your facility, public notification and alert systems, as appropriate.\r\n\r\nFormosa Plastics Corporation, Delaware has prepared a written emergency response plan that addresses the action to be taken in the event that one of the following conditions occur; fire, explosion, gas release, natural disaster, bomb threat, utility failure, medical emergency, transportation incident, emergency at neighboring facility, chemical spill.  Drills are conducted internally at least once every year to ensure that all employees can safely shut down all operating units and then evacuate the facility.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the site specific emergency procedures, the facility is involved in the Delaware City Community Awareness and Emergency Response (DC-CAER) group.  This is a mutual aid effort which allows the facility to be prepared to assist with an emergency at a neighboring facility and to elicit the help of neighboring plants if warranted.  This includes working with the DC-CAER during annual emergency drills and meetings to discuss necessary improvement plans.\r\n\r\nIn the event that an emergency occurs at the facility that would impact the community, notification to affected individuals would be made through the DC-CAER Radio Systems which is a 24 hour manned radio established to provide neighboring plants with instant communication of emergencies. \r\n\r\nG.
