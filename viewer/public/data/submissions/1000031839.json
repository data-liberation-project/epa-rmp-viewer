      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\n\n\nDuPont's Fort Hill Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Fort Hill Plant manufactures and processes sulfuric acid in Hamilton County, Ohio.  Raw material, intermediate and process storage tanks are in use at the site.\n\n\n\nThe Fort Hill Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Based on process knowledge, DuPont identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site. The facility uses two regulated substances, oleum and sulfur trioxide, in the sulfuric acid process (Process 1). In addition, railcars contining sulfur trioxide and oleum are occasionally on-site for a short period of time prior to shipping without active shipping papers  (Process 2). \n\n\n\nBased on worst-case analyses, the distances to endpoints [i.e. Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2) developed for each substance by the American Industrial Hygiene Association] exceed the distances to public receptors (i.e., off-site residences, institutions, industrial and commercial office buildings, parks, or recreational areas inhabited or occupied by the public).  In addition, DuPont is subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) and is classified under a listed SIC Code 2819.  Therefore, the sulfuric acid process and railcar storage are classified as Program 3 under the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program.\n\n\n\nOff"

      "SummaryText": "-Site Consequence Analysis Results\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Releases\n\n\n\nFlammable Substances\n\n\n\nThe endpoint for the worst-case release of a flammable substance is 1 psi overpressure (i.e. 15.7 psia) for vapor cloud explosions. DuPont Fort Hill Plant does not store any flammable substances listed in the rule in the threshold quantities required by the regulation; therefore, DuPont does not have a worst-case scenario for flammable substances.\n\n\n\nToxic Substances\n\n\n\nEndpoints for toxic substances are based on the ERPG-2.  Toxic endpoints are listed in Appendix A to 40 CFR Part 68 (Table of Toxic Endpoints). Each of the regulated toxic substances at the Fort Hill Plant was reviewed to determine the substance with the greatest distance to an endpoint.\n\n\n\nFor the sulfur trioxide storage vessel, an administrative control exists in which the tank is filled to 80% of capacity.  Alarms are in place to ensure that the tank is never filled past the 80% capacity.\n\n \n\nThe distance to the toxic endpoint resulting from the instantaneous release of the contents of the process equipment would have off-site impacts based on the U.S. EPA lookup tables contained in the OCA Guidance Document.\n\n\n\nEndpoints for toxic substances are based on the ERPG-2.  Toxic endpoints are listed in Appendix A to 40 CFR Part 68 (Table of Toxic Endpoints).  Each of the regulated toxic substances at the Fort Hill Plant was reviewed to determine the substance with the greatest distance to an endpoint.\n\n\n\nAlternative Releases\n\n\n\nAlternative release scenarios are those that are more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.  Alternative release scenarios for toxic substances should be those that lead to concentrations above the endpoint beyond the facility's fenceline.  The following conditions are considered for alternative release scenarios:\n\n\n\nRelease rate dependent upon scenario;\n\nUse of typical meteorological conditions at the stationary source; and\n\nConsideration of active and passive mitigation systems"

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Both operators and mechanics are involved in all incident investigations.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the Fort Hill Plant's accident prevention program. One way that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program is our Safety, Health, and Environmental (SHE) Committee.   In addition,  Fort Hill has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety. The teams have members from all areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Fort Hill Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. \n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).

The plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using state-of-the-art process controls and monitoring instruments, emergency relief systems, redundant power supply and safety systems, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nThe plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis  (PHA)   \n\n                                                                                                                                  \n\nFort Hill has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.

HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such "

All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.

After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nFort Hill uses contractors to supplement its workforce.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.
