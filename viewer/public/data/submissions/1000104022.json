Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy:  Ralcorp Frozen Bakery Products, Inc. maintains a comprehensive safety, health, and environmental program at the plant.  The program includes engineering, education, and enforcement provisions for hazard communication, spill prevention and response, hazardous waste, universal waste and waste oil management, waste water and storm water management.\r\n\u00a0\r\n2. Emergency Response Program:  The Ralcorp Frozen Bakery Products, Inc. facility has developed an OSHA hazardous substance emergency action plan. The plan outlines specific procedures for evacuations, incident alarms and alerting.  Depending upon a given situation, the Fire Department will be called to provide emergency responders and equipment. The Fire Department will be called for all fire related emergencies. The facility has communicated hazard of ammonia with the local fire department and LEPC. The incident commander has ultimate control of implementation of the emergency response plan.  \r\n\r\n3. Stationary Source and Regulated Substance:  Ralcorp Frozen Bakery Products, Inc. is a processing plant located at 273 Central Avenue, Forest Park GA.  The facility houses a processing plant used for manufacturing and freezing of frozen dough products.  The products require refrigeration for the processing and freezing associated with the products. \r\n\u00a0\r\n4. Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios:  RMP*Comp was used to calculate the worst case and alternative release scenarios for the process.\r\n\u00a0\r\n5. Five Year Accident History:  There have been no reportable incidents during the past five years.  However, the facility maintains records of all incident investigation reports regardless of anhydrous ammonia quantity released into the atmosphere.\r\n\t\u00a0\r\n\r\n6. Planned changes to improve safety:  Based on the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for anhydrous ammonia, lists of action items were developed.  The status of these action items will be monitored to ensure that i"
