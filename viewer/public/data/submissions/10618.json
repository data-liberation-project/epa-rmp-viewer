This is \naccomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information \nabout safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) \nsafe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, the Big Thicket Gas Plant \nevaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a \ncontractor. Gas plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure \nthat contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe Big Thicket Gas Plant  conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification \nthat requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to \nensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately \nprepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides \none additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design \nspecifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR \nreview team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field \nverification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring \nverification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Big Thicket Gas Plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain \npressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and \ncompressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.

This system requires that changes to items such as process \nequipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, \nand other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being \nimplemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place \nto manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been \ncompromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating \nlimits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate \nthese changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any \nnecessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Big Thicket Gas Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or \nreasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, major property damage, \nenvironmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine \nthe facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a \nsimilar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops \nrecommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to gas plant \nmanagement for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation \nteam's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.

The plant does not have \nthreshold quantities of any regulated toxic substances.\n\nVastar became the owner and operator of the Big Thicket Gas Plant in January, 1999.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) is failure of a 45,000-gallon storage tank containing \nnatural gas liquids (NGL) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion (VCE). Based on the TNT \nequivalency method contained in EPA\u0012s RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance, \nthe WCS would impact public receptors.\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) is a VCE resulting from the release of 2,900 \ngallons of NGL, which is the normal inventory of the 45,000-gallon storage tank. (The \nNGL storage tanks are almost never filled to capacity.) While vapor cloud explosions \ngenerally are considered unlikely events, this ARS is more likely than the WCS.\n\nBased on flash formation factors from EPA\u0012s RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis \nGuidance and a yield factor of 0.03, this ARS would not impact any public re"

Any ARS that would impact public receptors would impact exactly the same \nreceptors as the WCS. \n\n? The only scenario which would impact public receptors is a VCE involving an \n\u0013almost full\u0014 inventory (say, 80 to 99 % full) of an NGL storage tank. This would not \nrepresent a significantly more practical scenario for planning purposes as opposed \nto the WCS.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant. \nBecause processes at the gas plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection \nAgency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management \n(PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and \ndescribes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention \nprogram.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Big Thicket Gas Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process \nsafety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation \nrange from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to \nparticipating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have \naccess to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program. \nSpecific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are \ndocumented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the gas plant and \naddresses each accident prevention program element. \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Big Thicket Gas Plant  keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help \nmaintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical \nproperties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific \nchemical inventories, and equipment design basis/co"

These procedures are \nperiodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures \nare kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made \nthrough the management of change process.\n\nIn addition, the Big Thicket Gas Plant maintains a Key Process Parameter Document \nthat provides guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for \nspecific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written \noperating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other \npersonnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Big Thicket Gas \nPlant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in \noperating a process. New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if \nthey are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this \ntraining, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties \nand tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having \nadequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, \nthey can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher \ntraining on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are \nmaintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 \nyears. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to \nverify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Big Thicket Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods \nof increased maintenance or construction activities.

For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety-related \nlimits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in a Key \nProcess Parameter Document. The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained \nwithin these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained \npersonnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information \nabout the design and construction of process equipment.

HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the \nmost systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are \nconducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as \nwell as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the \nprocess as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes \nsuggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team \nbelieves such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for \nresolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based \non a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that \npotential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All \napproved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are \ncompleted. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually \ndeviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically \nupdates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are \nconducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the \nprocess is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are \ndocumented and retained.
