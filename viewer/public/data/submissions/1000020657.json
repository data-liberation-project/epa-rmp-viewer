In the worst-case situation, this type of release would coincide with meteorological conditions that would result in minimal dilution of the vessel contents. The endpoint for toxic substances is the maximum airborne concentration below which nearly all individuals can be exposed for up to one hour without developing serious health effects which could impair the ability to take protective cover.  The toxic endpoint for Chlorine Dioxide is 0.0028 mg/L (Appendix A of Part 68).  The distance to endpoint was determined using RMP*Comp, a software program developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario for the CCF facility involves a tank rupture, which would result in the release of both of tanks, since the tanks are in communication.  This corresponds to a release of 188,000 gallons of Chlorine Dioxide. With a density of 11.2 grams/liter the 188,000 gallons translates to approximately 17,572 pounds of chlorine dioxide.  The distance to endpoint for this release is approximately twenty five miles (25) miles.\r\n\r\nHazard Assessment, Alternative Release Scenario:\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario is an event more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario and will reach an endpoint offsite, unless no such scenario exists. In determining the distance to endpoint for the alternative release scenario, any mitigation controls employed in the process can be used.  The distance to endpoint for the alternative release scenario was determined using RMP*Comp.\r\n\r\nThe most likely alternative scenario for the CCF facility would also involve a tank rupture.  The release rate would be approximately 5.4 pou"

Approximately 50 yards from the tanks is another gas detector which adds another level of warning.  The detectors would allow for faster mitigation of the leak.  The alarm sounds at 1 ppm.  The bleach plant control room can close the connection between the tanks.  Additionally, a manual emergency stop is approximately 100 yards to the west of the tanks.  The corresponding distance to endpoint for the alternative scenario would be 0.4 miles.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information:\r\n\r\nIn accordance with RMP requirements the covered stationary sources must compile and maintain on-site safety information related to the regulated substance, processes, and equipment.   The information includes the following:\r\n1. \tMaterial Safety Data Sheets;\r\n2. \tMaximum intended inventory of the vessels;\r\n3. \tSafe upper and lower temperatures, pressures, and flows;\r\n4. \tEquipment specifications; and\r\n5. \tCodes and standards used to design, build, and operate the process.\r\n\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis: \r\n\r\nCCF performs and periodically updates process hazard analyses (PHAs) of the covered processes to help identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.

Contractors are given a PSM Safety Orientation to the hazards of the process, how to protect themselves from those hazards and what to do in the event they do get exposed. After the Safety Orientation they must pass a written exam to document their understanding of the material presented. \r\n\r\nEmergency Planning and Response: \r\n\r\nCCF facility has established a written emergency response program to help safely respond to accidental releases of hazardous substances. A formal review process to solicit and obtain employees input on millwide procedures exists to improve site emergency response plans. Employees and participants in both safety incidents and drills conduct critiques to get comments and observations, identify learnings, identify opportunities for performance improvement and improve both emergency response planning and responder performance. Communication to both team members and contractors takes place on both formal and informal levels so that there is a complete understanding of the actions one should take in an emergency situation. The written plan, which is consistent with the approach in the National Response Team's Integrated Contingency Plan Guidance (One Plan), contains the following elements:\r\n\r\n1.\tProcedures for informing the surrounding public and loca"
