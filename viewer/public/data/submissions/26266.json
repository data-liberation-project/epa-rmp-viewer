This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  It is the policy of Calpine to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.\n\nCalpine's Ontelaunee Energy Center(OEC)is a power plant that uses clean-burning natural gas to produce enough electricity to meet the needs of more than 500,000 homes throughout the region.  The Ontelaunee Energy Center uses combined-cycle turbine technology, making the facility up to forty percent more fuel efficient than most existing power plants.  \n\nOEC meets the Lowest Achievable Emission Rate for nitrogen oxides, a combustion product that can produce smog.  Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) pollution control technology reduces the nitrogen oxides through a reaction with ammonia that creates harmless nitrogen and water.  \n\nOEC stores ammonia for use in the SCR pollution control system.  Specialized tanker trucks bring anhydrous ammonia onsite, where it is transferred to two 1,600 cubic foot tanks and stored as a pressurized liquid.  Ammonia vapor is drawn from the tanks through a sealed system and into the SCR pollution control system.\n\nOEC has been designed for safety, and uses best industry practices for the safe unloading, storage, and use of ammonia.  Multiple, redundant monitors of system temperature, pressure, and flow will automatically notify the control operators before a problem occurs.  Fail-safe interlocks can shut the system down without human intervention.  Multiple electronic sniffers can quickly detect a release and automatically trigger a water deluge system to knock down ammonia vapors.\n\nCalpine has implemented a comprehensive accidental release prevention program.  The program includes a detailed analysis of process hazards, written and re"

      "SummaryText": "viewed operating procedures, employee training, contractor evaluation and training, a management-of-change program, and regular mechanical integrity inspections and compliance audits.  Special additional programs are put in place during process startup, and whenever hot work (welding or cutting) is taking place.  Employees participate fully in the implementation of the accidental release prevention program.\n\nCalpine works closely with local response personnel to plan for emergencies.   The Leesport Fire Department and the Bucks County Emergency Management Agency have toured the site and trained with Calpine personnel.  The Ontelaunee Energy Center Emergency Response Plan is integrated with the Berks County Local Emergency Planning Committee plan."
