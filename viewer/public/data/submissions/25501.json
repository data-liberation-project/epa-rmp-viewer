      "SummaryText": "Heinz North America - KOP, PA facility produces soups and related food products to a wide range of commercial clients.  HNA-KOP is a subsidiary of H.J. Heinz Co, LP.  Our workforce of approximately 250 employees is comprised of production, maintenance, plant operations, technical, clerical, and management personnel.  Many of our employees have been with us for many years.  We are proud of our facility, the quality of our products and the stability of our workforce.\n\nThe federal Accidental Release Prevention Requirements under section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act, codified 40 CFR Part 68, were written to help prevent the accidental release of extremely hazardous substances and to minimize the consequences of any such release.  All facilities with threshold quantities(TQ's) of the listed regulated acutely toxic and flammable substances are subject to these provisions.  The listed substances all have a TQ of 10,000 lbs.\n\nHNA-KOP has one chemical that meets the toxic chemical TQ, and thus, this substance must be included in a Risk Management Program.  The chemical is anhydrous ammonia (NH3).  The TQ for NH3 is 10,000 lbs.  HNA - KOP stores approximately 46,000 lbs. For use as a refrigerant in the Chef Francisco plant.  The major Clean Air Act Section112(r) requirements with which HNA-KOP must comply for use of NH3 in the refrigeration policy include:\n-Managements System development and documentation\n-Hazard Assessment for the affected process\n-Prevention Program Completion\n-Emergency Response Program coordination; and\n-Risk management plan submittal\n\nWith regards to hazard assessment, HNA-KOP has developed worst case and alternative scenarios.  The worst case scenario of an ammonia release would be to the high pressure reciever which could release up to 10,360 pounds of ammonia.  An alternative scenario would be a rooftop leak froma  3 inch liquid line that runs for 500 feet then steps down to a 1 1/2 inch line for 200 feet.  The total amount that would be released would"

      "SummaryText": " be 7,250 pounds over 30 minutes.  These parts of the ammonia system fall under the mechanical integrity part of PSM and are inspected and tested numerous times throughout the year to check for any deficiencies.\n\nHNA - KOP has no reportable accdients within the past 5 years of any ammonia releases.  In the event that a release does occur, HNA has developed an emergency response program.  This program consists of employees trained in Hazard Materials Operations, evacuation plan for all employees, conducting evacuation drills 2 times a year, created emergency teams consisting of managers and supervisors, and listings of emergency contacts throughout the facility.\n\nIn addition, HNA-KOP recognizes its responsibility under Section 112(r)(1), the \"general duty clause\", to handle all extremely hazardous substances safely to prevent thier accidental release and to minimize the consequences of any such release.  Additional chemicals on site not meeting their TQ or not identified in the 112(r) list rule include small quantities of standard industrial maintenance and cleaning chemicals, Number 2 fuel oil (home heating oil).  These \"general duty\" chemicals are managed using the same risk-management principals applied to our chemicals fully covered by 112(r).  HNA-KOP follows a prevention program including the use of process safety information, operating procedures, employee training, mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-start up safety review, incident investigation, compliance audits, \"hot work\" by permit only, and evaluation of contractors."
