Smart Warehousing is engaged in the same general business as the former site operator, i.e., managing a controlled climate warehouse and distribution services company with a variety of storage areas including dry storage, chilled storage (down to -5 deg. F) and humidity-controlled environments to ensure or prolong product integrity.  The facility is located in Independence, Missouri, within an underground structure that resulted from the mining of limestone. Smart Warehousing benefits from an ambient temperature of 58 degrees F. in the underground structure, making it more efficient (than surface storage) to achieve freezer and other refrigeration temperatures. The facility has rail line connectivity and truck docks.  The refrigeration and freezer warehouses at the facility are cooled with brine, which is chilled by an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.  The anhydrous ammonia is stored above grade and piped to a below grade mechanical room where it is used to super cool a brine solution.  The brine is then piped to specified areas to refrigerate those areas.   Anhydrous ammonia is the only substance present at the facility in quantities exceeding the U.S. EPA's Risk Management Plan thresholds.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies                                                                                          \r\n\r\nSmart Warehousing has a mechanical integrity program based on industry standards for equipment inspections and preventive maintenance practices, including practices and procedures recommended by the International Institute of Ammoni"

Prior to Smart Warehousing's operation of the facility, the previous operator notified the Mid-America/Jackson County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Independence Fire Department (IFD) of the presence and quantity of liquid anhydrous ammonia on the site and provided the results of the Worst Case Scenario analysis to the LEPC and IFD; and made a request for inclusion of the facility in the community emergency response plan developed by the LEPC.  These relevant features of the ammonia refrigeration system at the facility remain unchanged. Smart Warehousing notified the Mid-America/Jackson County LEPC and the Independence Fire Department of the change of site operating entity and the continuance of site operations with respect to storage and use of anhydrous ammonia. \r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nAs stated above, Trams Industrial, LLC, purchased the subject real estate and improvements from a closed business entity on April 1, 2012, and leased the property to Smart Warehousing, LLC.  After initiating operations, Smart Warehousing discovered 40 CFR Part 68 scheduled compliance irregularities that relate back to the previous owner/operator (i.e., out-of-date Prevention Program Compliance Audit and out-of-date PHA Revalidation).  Smart Warehousing updated these program audit and assessment requirements.  Subsequently, process improvements, such as an Engine Room Overhaul (including replacement/upgrade of compressors, a heat exchanger, and an intercooler and associated lines) have been completed and P&IDs have been updated. Scheduled safety relief valve replacement was also performed.  Signage has been improved, bollards and cables were installed around loading docks, and an additional means of egress from the Engine Room was constructed.

Our emergency response policy with regard to potential substantial releases of anhydrous ammonia stipulates evacuation of personnel from the underground complex (if necessary) and notification of the primary emergency response agency (the Independence Fire Department) and a pre-identified local area contract emergency response firm, HAZMAT Response, Inc (Olathe, Kansas).         \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program           \r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration equipment is generally inspected each work-week day (Monday-Friday; but at a minimum of every 72 hours) by a qualified operator.  Smart Warehousing has a preventive maintenance system that calls for replacement of parts and equipment at recommended frequencies or at any sign of undue wear or impending failure.  The control system is equipped with automatic shut down features that are designed to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the event of significant upset conditions or equipment malfunction.  The facility has a 24-hour manned security presence, as well as remote video monitoring of equipment with a large ammonia inventory.         \r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History      \r\nSmart Warehousing initiated operation of the storage facility on April 1, 2012.
