      "SummaryText": "SITE INFORMATION.\n\nThe main operation at Delta Chemical Services is the packaging, warehousing and distribution numerous chemicals used in various industries.  The facility was completed in late 1998 and began packaging operations in October 1998.  The facility is situated on approximately 9 acres located at 334 Tidal Road, Deer Park, Texas 77536.\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED.\n\nThe two regulated substances handled at the facility are Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI) and Formaldehyde.  Both chemicals routinely are present within the facility in quantities sufficient to trigger Program Level Three requirements.\n\nWORST-CASE &ALTERNATIVE CASE SCENARIOS.\n\nThe worst-case scenarios for both chemicals involve the catastrophic failure of the bulk delivery vessels: a rail tankcar for the TDI and a tanker truck for the Formaldehyde.  The vessels are assumed to be in position for unloading.\n\nIt is estimated that the railcar will hold approximately 190,000 pounds of TDI; the tank truck will hold an estimated 40,000 pounds.\n\nAdopting the worst-case parameters established in the RMP Sandard and using the RMPComp modeling software, the Toxic Endpoint distances were computed to be 0.4 miles for TDI and 8.1 miles for Formaldehyde.  The endpoint radius for TDI encompasses an office building and adjacent industrial structures, and possibly some effect on the northern outskirts of Deer Park.  However, the toxic endpoint radius of Formaldehyde includes several communities (Deer Park, Pasadena, La Porte, Channelview, etc.) and is estimated to contain a population of between 300,000 and 350,000 people.\n\nAlternative case scenarios for both chemicals involve the failure of the storage container (55 gallon drum) within the confines of the warehouse.  In both cases, the distance to the toxic endpoint was calculated to be 0.1 miles or less.  There are no public receptors within the endpoint radius.\n\nMITIGATION MEASURES.\n\nThe physical safety features of the facility include such features as:\n\n1.  A c"

A six-inch concrete roll-over berm around the tank truck unloading area.  This area is graded to flow into the concrete sump;\n3.  Dry disconnect hoses with fail-close valves to prevent product from flowing from the bulk container in case of equipment or power failure.\n4.  Six-inch concrete curbing around the entire facility perimeter;\n5.  Emergency valve to prevent storm water, fire-fighting water or chemical released in an emergency situation from traveling off-site;\n6.  High volumewater and foam fire fighting system in the product unloading area, designed to extinguish fires and suppress fumes from releases;\n7.  Emergency alarm system monitored 24 hours per dat, sever days per week by response unit of neighboring company.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY.\n\nThere Have been no releases of regulated chemicals, in reportable quantities, since packaging operations began in October, 1998.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM.\n\nThe primary methods for generating recommendations are through periodic review and/or revision of Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs), incident investigations and operational procedures review (Management of Change). These reviews provide a means for continuous improvement.\n\nTo further reduce the likelihood of an accidental release, an extensive review program has been established for all system components and operating parameters.  This includes a daily briefing on  materials being handled, required procedures, PPE and associated equipment, monthly and annual inspection and maintenance schedule that is rigidly followed, ensuring a well?maintained physical plant.\n\nAll operating procedures have been recently reviewed/revised and all personnel responsible for the proper operation of the refrigeration units have received refresher training in the procedures.  These elements of this program will further reduce the possibility of an ac"

      "SummaryText": "cidental release caused by human error.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nIn addition to a detailed operator training program, Delta Chemical Services has coordinated its emergency response program with neighboring Lubrizol Corp.  Lubrizol owns all adjacent land to DCS, and has a significant amount of emergency response resources.  The facility's fire and ambulance vehicles are stationed on adjoining property and there is no barrier to prevent the immediate access of these vehicles onto the DCS property.  Additionally, DCS and Lubrizol have planned at least annual joint emergency drills to be held at DCS.  Finally, DCS is currently working towards membership in the Channel Industries Mutual Aid organization, which provides mutual emergency response assistance between industries in the Houston Ship Channel area.  The company is also an active member of the Deep Park LEPC, and has communicated its emergency response plan to that organization.\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\nDelta Chemical Services sees the EPA's Risk Management Program as an opportunity to communicate about our facility with the public.  Delta Petroleum Co., the parent company of Delta Chemical Services, is committed to providing and maintaining a safe and healthy workplace for employees, neighboring facilities, and the community of Deer Park.  To that end, the company has designed and constructed a state of the art facility with multiple layers of protection for employees and the community.  The company has committed to providing the surrounding community with information regarding the company's safety performance and commitment to the environment, and the Risk Management Plan is one way to do this.\n\n\nCERTIFICATION\n\nI certify that, to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry, the information submitted is true, accurate, and complete.\n\n\n     /S/ \nTommy Boyette, General Manager\nDelta Chemical Services"
