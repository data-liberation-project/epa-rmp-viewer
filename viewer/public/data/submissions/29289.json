A forest products company with offices and operations around the world, MeadWestvaco?s distinctive products manufactured for customers around the globe include paper, packaging, envelopes and specialty chemicals.\n\nMeadWestvaco?s presence in Virginia began in 1899 when the company launched operation of its papermaking facility in Alleghany County.  The company was known as Westvaco until a merger with Mead in 2001. Since then, MeadWestvaco has invested extensively in its Alleghany Highlands operations.  Today, nearly 2,000 men and women work at MeadWestvaco?s Alleghany Highlands manufacturing and research operations.\n\nA commitment to excellence in all aspects of its operations defines MeadWestvaco.  The company?s Packaging Resources Group paper mill in Covington, VA is recognized worldwide for its technological sophistication and production of premium coated bleached paperboard.  Paperboard from the Covington mill is used for a variety of consumer packaging and printing applications including packaging cartons, aseptic and other liquid packaging, books and greeting cards.\n\nMeadWestvaco also sets the highest standards for workplace safety.  The company and its employees have worked consistently to build a strong and solid system of work practices and procedures to prevent accidents from happening.  MeadWestvaco remains committed to maintaining the integrity of a workplace safety program that is among the industry?s best.  \n\nMeadWestvaco?s Packaging Resources Group in Covington, VA has two substances that fall under the EPA?s Accidental Release Prevention and Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The regulated substances handled at the source in excess of their applicable threshold qualities are chlorine dioxide (CAS No. 10049-04-4) and chlorine (CAS No. 7782-50-5).  There are six covered processes using chlorine and one covered process using chlorine dioxide.\n\nIn eac"

Written safe operating procedures, including emergency guidelines, that are reviewed annually;\n!    Regular preventive maintenance of critical equipment to prevent mechanical breakdowns;\n!    A tank integrity program that ensures safe storage of materials;\n!    Processes that are manned and monitored 24 hours a day;\n!    Safety systems that include emergency relief systems, remotely-activated isolation valves, and interlocking systems to shut down a process;\n!    Scheduled safety audits;\n!    Regular process hazard analysis to identify and correct potential safety concerns;\n!    Detailed safety reviews completed prior to startup following any changes made to our equipment or processes; and\n!    Thorough and regular safety and operational training for employees who work with processes that involve potentially hazardous materials.\n\nIn addition to the above, the chlorine dioxide process has these safety systems in place:\n\n!    All operators undergo extensive operator training and qualification programs;\n!    Storage tanks are diked;\n!    Chlorine dioxide is manufactured on-site and not transported from off-site;\n!    Continuous monitoring systems are in place for the production, storage and distribution of chlorine dioxide within the mill, including extensive leak detection monitors; and\n!    Vented gas is captured in a collection system.\n\nThe chlorine process has these additional safety systems in place:\n\n!    All operators undergo extensive operator training and qualification program;\n!    Chlorine residuals are checked regularly;\n!    If water flow is lost to the system, gas flow is stopped; and\n!    Area atmosphere is continuously monitored and alarms will sound if chlorine is detected.\n\nThe worst case release scenario for the site consists of the catastrophic failure of Tank I with the release of 140,000 gallons of chlorine dioxide (ClO2) solution (7,154 kilograms of ClO2) into a  dik"

EPA designated endpoint concentration out to a distance of 4.8 miles (7.8 kilometers) from Tank I.  The estimated population within this distance from the Covington Mill Tank I is approximately 2,900.  The one environmental receptor within this distance is a state forest.  The public receptors within this distance are public recreation areas, residences, schools, commercial and industrial facilities, office buildings, a correctional facility and churches.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine dioxide consists of the release of 100 gallons of  ClO2 solution (5.1 kilograms of ClO2) as a result of a failed gasket in the valve of a pipeline containing this solution at the Bleached Pulp Mill.  This alternative release scenario results in ClO2 concentrations that equal or exceed the U.S. EPA designated endpoint concentration to distances of 784 feet (239 meters) from the release point.  This area is entirely within the mill property.  Thus, there is no estimated population to be affected within this distance from the Bleached Pulp Mill.  Likewise, there are no environmental or public receptors within this distance from the release point.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine consists of the release of 0.4 kilograms of Cl2 from failure of the lead gasket at the Cl2 container valve of one of the Cl2 containers at Paper Machine No. 2.  This alternative release scenario results in Cl2 concentrations that equal or exceed the U.S. EPA designated endpoint concentration to a distance of 171 feet (52 meters) from the release point.  This distance extends to slightly beyond MeadWestvaco?s boundary into Dunlap Creek; there is no affected population within this distance from Paper Machine No. 2.

The purpose of this regulation and MeadWestvaco?s PSM program is to prevent accidental releases and to minimize the consequence if one should occur.  The location also has an Emergency Response Program in place that includes:\n\n!    Two full time nurses, a first aid squad, and a  firefighter team specifically including  structural firefighting  all on site;\n!    Participation in the Local Emergency Planning Committee; \n!    Procedures for informing the public and local emergency response agencies about accidental releases;\n!    Documentation of proper first-aid and emergency medical treatment to treat accidental human exposure;\n!    Procedures for emergency response after an accidental release of a regulated substance;\n!    Procedures for the use of emergency response equipment and for its inspection, testing and maintenance;\n!    Training of all employees in relevant procedures, and;\n!

In that regard and as part of Process Safety Management, Process Hazard Analyses are completed for each covered process.  The most recent Process Hazard Analyses for chlorine and chlorine dioxide have been completed with all action items completed.
