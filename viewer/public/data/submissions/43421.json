When application begins for anhydrous ammonia, the nurse tanks are checked daily.  When in use, they are filled and are returned to the facility \nand checked before being refilled again.  Any minor discrepancies are corrected on the spot as they are noted.  For major discrepancies, nurse tanks are taken out of service and positioned in a designated are until time permits an employee to fix the problem.\n\n    The couple of individuals that does work with anhydrous ammonia have worked with it for numerous years.  They are familiar with the operation of transferring of products from the holding tanks to the nurse tanks as well as the maintenance procedures.  They both have attended the anhydrous ammonia \nsafety workshop sponsored by the Ohio AgriBusiness Association.\n\n    The corrosion that was listed in the hazard review section, under the major hazards identified block regards to the nurse tanks which needs to be re-painted due to corrosion.  These nurse tanks that are identified is scheduled to be repainted this summer and be completed before September 1, 2004.\n    \n    There is no mitigation system in use since the location of anhydrous ammonia is located in the open on the southwest corner of the property.  Any release of the product would go up into atmosphere as gas release.\n\n    The Ohio Dept. of Agriculture has reports of numerous incidents across the country of individuals stealing ammonia out of nurse tanks parked in fields and facilities.  To help prevent such an incident, nurse tanks that are filled and will not be used within a short time period, will have tie-ties placed around the valves to prevent any tampering and as a quick visual inspection tool.",

The Facility Policy\n\n    The owners, management, and employees of Whitehouse Grain Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.         Facility Inrmation\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of grain purchased from farmers and providing feed and supplies to customers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for the owners only. The maximum quantity stored on site would be 200,000 pounds in our two storage tanks; which the largest is a 30,000-gallon tank and the smaller tank is 18,000 gallon.\n\n3.    The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThe facility has implemented the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\"\n\n4.    The five year accident history.\n\nThere has been no accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at this facility. Nor to our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, and evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n5.   The emergency response program\n\nThe facility has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard, 29 CFR 1910.38, and a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\nThe plan includes employees to shut-off the appropriate values to stop any small accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. Otherwise, the fire department would be notified and full cooperation would be given to them to take the necessary steps to contain, stop the leak, a"
