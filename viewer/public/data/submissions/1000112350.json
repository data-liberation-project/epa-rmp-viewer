It is manufactured in three parallel reactors. The polymer exiting the reactor is transferred to a dump tank where polymer and un?reacted monomers are separated. Un?reacted monomers are recycled through a monomer recovery system. The polymer is routed through dryers and then extruded and cut into beads. Some of the polymer is not extruded but is routed through an air classifying milling operation to form a powder product. Other unit operations supporting the fluorocarbon polymer manufacturing process include chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) storage tanks, catalyst systems, methanol scrubbing system, boilers, a monomer recovery system, and a brine cooling system. Dust collectors, scrubbers, and a process flare are used to control air emissions. \nThere are three chemicals at the site that are on Table 1 of 40 CFR \u00a768.130; chloroform, ethylene, and CTFE. Chloroform is not kept onsite in quantities greater than 20,000 lbs. Ethylene is brought onsite via pipeline and the amount of ethylene used during the process is less than 10,000 lbs, therefore not subject to RMP requirements. Trifluorochloroethylene is kept onsite in quantities greater than the threshold, 20,000 pounds (lbs), and is subject to Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements. \n1.1\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\nCTFE serves as a crucial component in various processes conducted at the Syensqo facility. This chemical is stored in railcars, transferred to tanks, and employed in on-site reactors. Despite its significance to Syensqo's production processes, the unique properties of CTFE necessitate rigorous safety precautions to minimize risks associated with human exposure. It is paramount to uphold the health and safety of both employees and neighboring communities. Syensqo is fully committed to adhering to a"

Syensqo's emergency response strategy is aligned with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards. The emergency response plan includes procedures for promptly notifying local emergency services and informing affected neighbors in the vicinity of the facility. \nThe organization maintains an integrated contingency plan that consolidates all federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning. This program ensures the protection of workers, the public, and the environment during emergencies. The plan includes instructions for emergency reporting, notifying responders, shutdown procedures, establishing command centers, and defining key roles.\nAdditionally, it outlines procedures for handling specific emergencies such as fires, chemical releases, spills, hurricanes, bomb threats, evacuations, and HAZMAT incidents. The organization coordinates this plan with local emergency services and conducts annual drills involving community responders.\nAfter each drill, a thorough review assesses the plan's effectiveness. Furthermore, the plant has a contract with the city fire department for emergency response and rescue. This approach highlights the organization's commitment to emergency preparedness and safety.\n1.2\tStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nChlorotrifluoroethylene (CTFE) is transported to the site via railcar, contained within 6,000-pound International Organization for Standardization (ISO) containers. Onsite, four of these containers securely store the CTFE, ensuring a steady supply for the site's operations. Additionally, a 50,000-pound storage tank is utilized to accommodate larger quantities of CTFE when necessary. These containers a"

Its design and construction were executed in line with guidelines from OSHA, the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), and widely accepted engineering standards. Syensqo employs a comprehensive approach to process hazard analysis, systematically examining each process or change to identify and manage hazards effectively. Standard operating procedures offer clear instructions for safe activities, while a thorough training program certifies operators in unit operations and emergency response procedures, emphasizing safety and health hazards, including refresher sessions on operating procedures and chemical hazards.\n1.4\tFive-Year Accident History\nThere has not been an accident from a covered process that resulted in deaths, injuries, or\nsignificant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in\nplace, property damage, or environmental damage in the past five years at this facility.\n1.5\tEmergency Response Program\nThe emergency response program at the facility is based on OSHA Standards.  Syensqo has engaged in discussions regarding this program with local emergency response agencies, such as the Orange Fire Department and the Orange Local Emergency Planning Committee.\nEmergency Response Training   Orange site personnel are not trained First Responders. The Orange Fire Department acts as First Responders for the site.

Addressing safety procedures is essential for maintaining a secure environment, and the site regularly reviews and updates these procedures as needed. This decision is based on thorough evaluations aimed at ensuring the effectiveness of existing measures. Continuous improvement remains a priority, with ongoing efforts in feedback collection, training, and regular reviews.Any future updates to safety procedures will be communicated. \n2.0\tRegistration Information\nStationary Source Name:\tHalar Manufacturing Unit\nStreet:\t4059 FM 1006\nCity:\tOrange\nState:\tTexas\nZip Code:\t77630\nLatitude:\t30.0504\nLongitude:\t-93.7666\nMethod:\tWGS84  \nDescription:\tHALAR Manufacturing Unit\nStationary Source Dun and Bradstreet Number:\t154288492\nParent Company Dun and Bradstreet Number:\t154288492\nOwner/Operator Name:\tSolvay USA LLC\nTeleph"

According to the USEPA\u0092s \u0093Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis\u0094 from March 2009  , the worst-case scenario involves the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single vessel or process line failure, resulting in the greatest distance to an endpoint. An alternative release scenario, conversely, encompasses scenarios more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario and that will reach an offsite endpoint, unless no such scenario exists. There exists flexibility in selecting the appropriate alternative release scenario that best fits the parameters of the subject process or vessel. For this particular process, the alternative release scenario is based on maximum operating conditions.\nCTFE is regulated as a flammable gas. The OCA will be conducted for the single largest vessel containing CTFE. Railcars on-site contain volumes smaller than the bulk storage tanks and have not been included in the release calculations. CTFE, being a gas liquefied under pressure, is subject to active or passive mitigation measures, including a safety integration system (SIS), fire protection (smart monitors, manual moni"

The results of the OCA are displayed in the following sections, with supporting documentation provided below. Specific receptors are not required to be listed as per EPA\u0092s OCA guidance document; only the types of receptors present within the toxic endpoint distance are noted, detailed within Sections 3.1.1 and 3.1.2.

The 6,000 lbs ISO containers do not have to be considered for the offsite consequence analysis because they are kept separate from the largest CTFE storage tank.  For the alternative scenario, a boiling liquid, expanding vapor explosion (BLEVE) scenario was chosen.
