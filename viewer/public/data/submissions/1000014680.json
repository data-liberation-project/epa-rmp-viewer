NEWPORT, MN 55055 . 651-459-5555 . 651-459-5951 (FAX)\n\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nJune 30, 2010\n\nNewport St. Paul Cold Storage was established in 1959 as a public refrigerated warehouse serving frozen and refrigerated food companies storage needs. Newport St. Paul Cold Storage has transformed their older multi-story facility into a modern single story facility with an updated refrigeration system. Our two stage refrigeration system utilizes over 20,000 lbs. of ammonia (anhydrous). The key individuals involved in the day to day operations are Andrew R. Greenberg, President, Robert Franklin, Vise-President, Randy Lewis, Director of Operations, and Steve Hall, Refrigeration and Facility Manager. \n\nNewport St. Paul Cold Storage has an on-going safety program, which includes ammonia safety, prevention, and emergency response. We are a member of the International Association of Refrigerated Warehouses. We utilize the resources of the IARW for information, education, and training. We invest significant time and money into maintaining our refrigeration system and facilities. Our Refrigeration and Facility Manager handles most day to day operations of our refrigeration system. Each year we review, repair, and audit all critical refrigeration components. We utilize the services of a qualified ammonia refrigeration contractor for major repairs.\n\n Newport St. Paul Cold StorageA?s worst case scenario was based on the potential liquid ammonia release from the Hi-Pressure Receiver. The Hi-Pressure Receiver(HPR) can hold up to 10,479 lbs. of liquid ammonia at 80%capacity, but we maintain 2,100 lbs. or at 20% capacity. Based on the release rate of 1,050 lbs. per minute, it would take the HPR 10 minutes to empty.  There are 648 residents within the .6 mile toxic end point if we have an ammonia liquid spill. The ammonia should have minimal impact on the surrounding community because of the dissipation level of ammonia, ammonia is lighter "

      "SummaryText": "than air. We can somewhat control the release rate of ammonia if we maintain an acceptable pressure level. We have an energy management program (Hench System) that controls and monitors the process 24 hours per day, and on critical equipment - data points are also monitored through ADT. If there is any disturbance with the refrigeration system our Refrigeration and Facility Manager or Gartner Refrigeration are contacted.\n\nOur alternative case scenario was based on the potential liquid release from the Inter Cooler(IC). The IC can hold up 5,631 lbs. of liquid ammonia at 60% capacity, we maintain less than 3,000 lbs. or 30% capacity. Based on the release rate of 563 lbs. per minute, it would take the IC 10 minutes to empty. There are 6 residents within the .2 mile toxic end point if we have an ammonia liquid spill. \n\nIn our sixty years of business we have had two significant ammonia leaks. First one was on July 14, 1997 at 3:30 PM an outside ammonia leak was reported. We assessed that the check valve connected to the low pressure receiver had fractured causing a slow but noticeable leak. We estimated that we lost about 2,000 lbs. of liquid ammonia over a 45 minute period. The system was shutdown, repaired, and recharged within 2 hours. There were no injuries or deaths. \n\nThe second ammonia leak was on June 25, 2010 at 12:35 PM when plant personnel reported ammonia leak back by the vessels. It was determined to evacuate the facility at 12:45 PM and all employees, contractors, and drivers were accounted for. Andrew Greenberg remotely shutdown the evaporators and compressors except one screw compressor. The Fire Department immediate decision was made to fog the affected area, which contains and dissipates the ammonia cloud. We then shutdown last compressor, but leak still continued. A Gartner Refrigeration Technician and a Fireman were able to get back to the Intercool oil pot and valve it off. The leak stopped. It was found the relief valve didnA?t reseat itself, and it"

      "SummaryText": " was replaced. The root cause of the problem was human error, closing more than one section of condenser without shutdown enough compressors in the engine room. It was calculated the loss of 2,212 lbs. of liquid ammonia over a 100 minute period. The system was shutdown, repaired, and recharged within 2 hours. There were no injuries or deaths.\n\nThrough efforts of Newport St. Paul Cold StorageA?s Safety committee, a detailed emergency response plan has been developed with easy to use manuals to help with the details of the ERP. Our plan includes a flow chart of individual responsibilities, emergency phone numbers, a summarized Crisis Management procedures, containment and repair procedures, and decontamination procedures. We provide the Newport Fire Department with our Crisis Management manual and facility layout. Each year we initiate a facility walk through with the entire NFD department.  Our Refrigeration and Facility Manager has the initial 24 hour certification for Emergency Response training and each year he is sent to the 8 hour refresher training. In addition, he is trained each year to use all the personal protective gear and devices; ammonia indicator, suit, respirators, and safety harness. NCS has certain employeeA?s trained in CPR and first aid. Safety training is provided to each of our employeeA?s through company safety meetings. \n\nIt is in NCS best interest to provide for the safest work environment for our employeeA?s, customers, and shareholders. Safety is an ongoing improvement process that management mandates. The safety program is constantly reviewed, evaluated and changed as needed.  \n"
