      "SummaryText": "The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the plant consist of all regulations that are regulated by OSHA and the PSM program at the facility.  All refrigeration employees and numerous supervisors are trained in the 40 HAZMAT course to respond to accidental releases.  All refrigeration maintenance personnel go through training on all the SOP's from the PSM program.  These procedures are reviewed yearly to help insure that all problems are corrected.  All refrigeration maintenance personnel are currently scheduled to go through ammonia refrigeration school to teach them the operations and safety.  The school is located in Garden City, Kansas and is part of the local community college.  The preventative maintenance program is periodically reviewed and updated as the monitoring and repair on equipment is performed.  This process has been of great benefit to the plant in finding problems in a timely manner.\n\nThe Swift & Company plant in Louisville, Kentucky, is a pork slaughter and processing facility.  The plant is defined by the EPA as a \"Complex Slaughter\" facility.  Final products produced include: meat products, edible lard, inedible lard, dried blood, and meat and bone meal.  The regulated substance used at this facility that meets threshold quantities is anhydrous ammonia.  Ammonia is used as a manufacturing aid in the refrigeration process.  Refrigeration is used in processing and storing of the meat and meat products.  The total calculated amount of anhydrous ammonia in the facility is equal to 97,980 pounds.\n\nThe worse case scenario for this facility is a rupture in the receiver vessel resulting in a loss of the entire contents of 34,262 pounds of ammonia.  This loss will occur within 10 minutes and the spilled liquid will vaporize at room temperature releasing gas to the atmosphere.  The American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) has determined that the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all in"

Under the worse-case weather conditions with dispersion into an urban area, the distance that the release would travel before it no longer causes a health threat is 2200 meters (1.37 miles).  A release of this magnitude is very unlikely because of the protection to the equipment and the PSM processes in place.\n\nThe alternative release scenario or more likely case for the facility is a failure of a rupture/relief disk resulting in the loss of 2,000 pounds of ammonia in a 60 minute period of time.  This release would result in the 200 ppm exposure limit to just reach the property line of the plant.  This case is at low risk because of the PSM processes in place.\n\nThe Swift & Company facility is in compliance with all OSHA PSM rules and this RMP rule requirements.  The procedural and managerial steps that are in place are a preventative measure to accidental release prevention as well as maintenance and training programs that are in place.\n\nThere have been no releases at this facility in the past five years that have resulted in death, injuries, or property damage on site or in death, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage offsite.\n\nThe Swift & Company facility has an emergency response plan on file with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC).  The facilities HAZMAT team conducts regular drills and training of specialized personnel and the local fire department personnel.  The policies for reporting spills and releases is documented in the \"Policies and Procedures\" manual updated by the Corporate Environmental Operations office.\n\nThe ammonia compressor rooms of this facility are not protected by monitoring systems at this time.
