      "SummaryText": "The Savannah plant is a manufacture of chemical additives to the pulp and paper industry.  For example, epichlorohydrin is used in the production of wet strength resins.  These resins are used in paper towels, napkins, tissues, etc, so that they hold their strength when they get wet.  Epichlorohydrin is a raw material for the process and is consumed in the chemical reaction to make the product.  The plant receives epichlorohydrin primarily in railroad tank cars and occasionally in tank trucks and isocontainers.  The epichlorohydrin is stored currently in five 279,000 pound each capacity tanks within a containment dikes which has adequate capacity to hold 110% of the volume of the tank.  The railcar unloading area also drains into the tank containment dike.  In Spring 2025, the plant will also load tank trucks.  A nitrogen blanket of 4 inches is maintained in the storage tank dike to reduce the potential for release of epichlorohydrin vapors in the event of a spill or leak into the dike.  \n\nAccident Prevention\nThe Solenis-Savannah facility complies with the OSHA PSM rule.  As a PSM facility, Solenis completes a detailed Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) every 5 years.  The PHA seeks to identify and address potential causes of incidents before they occur.  In addition, PSM training on safe handling of equipment and chemicals is conducted every three years for all Kymene area operators and all maintenance mechanics.  Management of Change (MOC) procedures are followed to ensure that any changes that occur in the Kymene process do not have the potential to result in an increased risk of a safety incident or an accidental release. In addition, routine maintenance is conducted under the facility's preventative maintenance program to ensure that equipment critical to the safe handling of epichlorohydrin is maintained in good condition at all times. System interlocks ensure that incompatible chemicals are never mixed together.  Leak detection monitoring is performed quarterly an"

      "SummaryText": "d scheduled mechanical integrity testing is performed on vessels and piping to detect potential releases.\n\n\nEmergency Response \nThe facility maintains an emergency response action plan.  All plant employees are trained in how to respond small spills and releases in their area and how to report a spill or release.  Due to our small work force, we rely on emergency response contractors for the containment and clean up of significant spills of hazardous chemicals. Annual evacuation drills are conducted to ensure employees are familiar with emergency response procedures. Additionally all employees are trained at the 8 hour HAZWOPER level.\n\nFive Year Accident history \nIn the last 5 years, Solenis has not had an incident involving epichlorohydrin.  \n\nNew Production\nIn Spring 2025, Solenis will be starting 2 new production processes at the facility using RMP listed chemicals.  The first production is polyamine material that will be located within the Kymene plant.  This will add anhydrous dimethylamine to the process which will be stored in a pressurized 45,000 gallon tank with toxicity sensors.  Dimethylamine will be received into the plant by railcar.  \nThe second production process will be producing peracetic acid.  The process will initially start as a manual process of mixing totes and allowing the mixed totes to cure over 7-14 days.  Initially the plant will start by making only 20 totes of the material.  This production will eventually be developed in a more automated process in the future."
