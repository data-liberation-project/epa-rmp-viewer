According to EPAs RMP Comp, \n the distance to endpoint is 3.2 miles. There are residences, schools, a hospital, nursing home, recreation \n area and a jail within the distance to endpoint with a total of 552 people affected.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario:\nOur alternative release scenario is a transfer hose failure. According to EPA's RMP Comp, the distance to endpoint is 0.20 miles There are residences within the distance to end point with a total of one person affected.\n\nThis facility has excess flow valves and emergency shutoffs in place to minimize the chances of an accident occuring. All personnel are trained annually in the safe operation of the equipment and facility. We have also installed concrete barriers in traffic pattern areas in an effort to elimanate any damage from a a vehicular accident. \n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable federal, state and local codes\n and regulations. This facility is annually inspected by in-house personnel and by the Iowa Department \n of Agriculture."
