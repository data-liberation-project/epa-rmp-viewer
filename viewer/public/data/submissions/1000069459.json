The Company's manufacturing facility at 799 Route 206 in Belle Mead, New Jersey produces many of these products. \r\n\r\nWe produce high quality products at the Belle Mead facility that are preferred by millions of consumers to: clean and disinfect surfaces throughout the home, freshen the air, clean the oven, take care of carpets, polish furniture and help maintain an overall healthy home environment.\r\n \r\nThe Belle Mead team, which consists of approximately 200 men and women, works with an emphasis on safety, quality and quantity -- in that order. We accomplish our goals through a commitment to teamwork and are continually re-certified in the renowned International Organization of Standardization for Quality Management Systems (ISO 9002).  Attainment of the certification entails meeting a comprehensive set of guidelines for areas that affect quality such as production, planning and process controls, and required team members to undergo thousands of hours of training. \r\n\r\nWe take seriously our commitment to the environment and design products, processes and packaging to minimize waste through reuse and recycling and ensure materials are safe for disposal. We also spend many hours internally on developing safety procedures, conducting drills, and training personnel.  Externally, we coordinate efforts with local emergency responders to ensure safety and proper preparedness.\r\n\r\nThe Belle Mead facility is also subject to several safety and environmental regulatory programs including:\r\n\r\nFederal & State Employee and Community Right-To-Know requirements;  \r\nOSHA's Process Safety Management and Hazard Communication requirements; \r\nFederal & State Hazardous Waste Management regulations; \r\nFederal Clean Air Act requirements & State Air Pollution Control regulations;\r\nFederal Clean Water Act requirements & State Water Pollution Control regulations; and"

One element of that approach is a thorough risk assessment, a formal and exhaustive analysis of chemical processes used to identify and address process hazards.  Risk assessments are conducted on a periodic basis for existing processes and immediately before the final design stage of new or modified processes.\r\n\r\nIn a typical risk assessment, team members from a variety of disciplines - engineers, team leaders, plant operators, and maintenance technicians - gather to analyze a chemical process. Every component of the process - pumps, piping, storage tanks, instruments, valves, controls, and safety devices - as well as operating and maintenance practices are evaluated to determine possible causes of failure. Each cause is then reviewed to ensure that one or more levels of safety protection are available in the event a failure occurs. \r\n\r\nThe use of risk assessment by analyzing process hazards became universal with the introduction of OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation in 1993. Although this regulation applies only to certain flammable liquids used at the Belle Mead facility, we recognize the importance and benefits of risk assessment to all our operations and have applied it to other processes that have the potential of creating a significant safety hazard.\r\n\r\nSubject to several Federal and state discharge prevention and process safety requirements for many years, Reckitt Benckiser maintains an environmental program that requires continuous evaluation and improvement of facility compliance programs, work practices, employee training programs, first-responder spill response capabilities, equipment maintenance and repair programs, leak detection systems, and other safety measures.

The intention of this Executive Summary is to provide general information to the EPA, employees of Reckitt Benckiser, and the local community about the regulated flammable substances stored and handled at the Belle Mead facility and the facility's accidental release prevention program and emergency response policies associated with the ISO Farm. Additionally, it reports on the five-year accident history of the Belle Mead facility, as it pertains to the flammable substances stored in the ISO Farm. \r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this Executive Summary and for the facility's Risk Management Program and Plan, the substances, equipment and procedures of focus are the regulated flammable substances, equipment, and procedures associated with the ISO Farm only. This area encompasses the ISO Farm, unloading area, and process piping entering the aerosol propellant gassing operation at the gashouse.\r\n\r\nDescription of Regulated Substances\r\nThe Belle Mead facility does not handle, manufacture or use any toxic substances over the regulatory threshold.  Reckitt Benckiser does use blends of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and difluoroethane in the aerosol propellant gassing operation at the Belle Mead facility.  Difluoroethane is a flammable substance and is regulated under the NJDEP TCPA program and RMP Rule if handled, manufactured or stored in a process at a facility in a quantity greater than its listed threshold quantity.  The specified threshold quantity for flammable substances under the RMP Rule is 10,000 pounds. \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Programs\r\nReckitt Benckiser places great importance on the implementation of procedures for responding to and, more importantly, preventing accidental rele"

This plan also provides guidance to include local emergency responders such as police, fire, and rescue as appropriate.\r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History\r\nFacilities subject to the RMP Rule are also required to report accidents and releases occurring in the last five years in which exposure to a regulated flammable substance, overpressure generated by an explosion of the substance, or radiant heat generated by a fire involving the substance led to death, injury, or response or restoration activities at an environmental receptor on-site or off-site.  Reckitt Benckiser certifies in the RMP submission to the EPA that during the past five years, no accidental releases have occurred involving regulated flammable substances from the ISO Farm according to the EPA's criteria.  \r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nThe safety and control systems on the equipment in and associated with the ISO Farm are state-of-the-art and represent the highest degree of safety and accident prevention currently available for unloading, storage, and distribution of flammable substances.  We also meet and exceed National Fire Protection Association (NFPA 58) standards for the LPG.  As a responsible corporate citizen and neighbor in the community, Reckitt Benckiser acknowledges its duty to prevent accidental releases of potentially harmful substances into the environment.  Reckitt Benckiser's strong environmental management program, including the elements of an effective Risk Management Program, commitment to personnel training and adherence to standard operating procedures ensure continuous environmental compliance and the attainment of Reckitt Benckiser's primary goal for the Belle Mead facility: Safety, Accident Prevention. \r\n\r\nThrough our"

The programs enlist the services of corporate and plant management, plant engineering, employees in production and maintenance functions, professional environmental and safety consultants, and local community representatives.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to the above-listed environmental and safety regulations listed above, the Belle Mead facility is also subject to requirements of the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions in 40 CFR Part 68.  These regulations, also known as the Risk Management Program Rule (RMP Rule), were promulgated pursuant to Section 112(r)(7) of the US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Clean Air Act Amendments. Industrial facilities must comply with the RMP Rule if they handle, manufacture, or use certain toxic or flammable substances in a quantity greater than specified threshold quantities in a process.  A list of regulated toxic and flammable substances and their individual threshold quantities is located in Section 68.130 of the RMP Rule.  All regulated facilities are required to submit risk management program information summarizing their Risk Management Programs by June 21, 1999 and at least every five years thereafter.  The Belle Mead facility is subject to the requirements of the RMP Rule due to the type and amount of regulated flammable substances stored in vessels in a storage tank farm referred to as the ISO Farm (abbreviation for Isobutane stored in an area also known as the Propellant Storage and Distribution Process).  The ISO Farm qualifies as Program Level 3 under the RMP Rule.  The Belle Mead facility has prepared and implemented a Risk Management P"
