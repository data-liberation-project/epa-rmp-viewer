Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\n\nThe Company's accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, employee training and management practices.\n\nThe Company's emergency response plan involves the preparation of action plans and training of employees. The Company's refrigeration personnel are trained in hazardous materials response (24 hours). This training includes emphasis on anhydrous ammonia, in addition to other requirements set forth in 29 CFR 1910.119\n\nAt The Company, anhydrous ammonia is used on-site. Ammonia is considered hazardous by EPA and is listed on the Extremely Hazardous Substance (EHS) list. Chemical properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling ammonia in order to:\n\n&#61623; Prevent unnecessary human exposure\n\n&#61623; Reduce the threat to our personnel\n\n&#61623; Reduce the threat to the community\n\nB. Facility and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nMcDougall & Sons Inc. South Baker Flats Facility is a fruit cold storage facility, located at 13048 Hwy 2. East Wenatchee, Douglas County, WA 98802. The facility is used as a refrigerated warehouse to hold fruit in storage till it can be packaged for shipment.\n\nThe hazardous substances which exceed the threshold quantity IAW EPCRA at South Baker Flats are:\n\n1. Anhydrous Ammonia, AKA NH3, or R717. Anhydrous ammonia is used at the facility as refrigerant. CAS number is 7664-41-7\n\n\n\nC. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe Company's accidental release prevention program is based on the following key\n\nelements:\n\n&#61623; High level of training of personnel, using both IIAR and RETA as resources.\n\n&#61623; Technology in the form of a remote controls system, through phone land lines and\n\ncellular networks, which allows constant 24 hour monitoring by engineers. System\n\nparameters and controls can be a"

Five-Year Accident History\n\nThe South Baker plant was brought online in October 4th 2017.\n\nThere has not been any reportable incident since that date.\n\nD. Emergency Response Program\n\nIn addition to the operating procedures, The Company has established Emergency Action\n\nplans for this facility. This plan provides guidance for employees on actions to take in the\n\nevent of an ammonia release. These actions include initial action procedures, evacuation\n\nprocedures, reporting procedures and control procedures.\n\nThe Company will work with the local LEPC to ensure it is aware of the emergency actions\n\nwhich will be taken in the event of a release at the North Baker facility.\n\nE. Planned Safety Improvements\n\nThrough our ongoing implementation of the PSM / RMP program, McDougall & Sons looks\n\ncontinuously for possible ammonia system changes to improve the safety of our process and\n\nour employees.\n\nWe will continue to seek educational opportunities to build on our knowledge to improve\n\nemployee's expertise in operating the process."
