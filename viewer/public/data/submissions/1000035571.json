The prevention program includes assuring all process equipment and materials meet appropriate standards and code requirements, implementation of detailed safe operating procedures, an effective maintenance program, and a training program to assure that all personnel are thoroughly trained in the safe operation and maintenance of the ammonia system.  Process controls include relief valves, check valves, automatic and manual shutoffs, excess flow devices, interlocks, alarms and procedures.  Sudden surges in flow or pressure will cause automatic shutoff valves, located above valve ends of tanks, to close and isolate the system.  A water spray system, located at each unloading station can be manually activated by control room operators or storage facility operators.

The process contains an anhydrous ammonia storage facility, including four, 67,000 gallon storage tanks with supporting unloading equipment, vapor compressors and liquid transfer pumps, piping to convey the liquid ammonia, vaporizers to convert ammonia from a liquid to a gas, and a gas dilution and injection system to inject ammonia into a selective catalytic reduction emission control system.\r\n\r\nThere is only one regulated substance at the facility, anhydrous ammonia.  With four 67,000 gallon storage tanks, the maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia in the storage facility at any time is 1,200,000 pounds and the maximum amount contained in the largest single vessel is 300,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nIII. Summary of Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\r\nThe worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario were identified and analyzed to determine the distance to endpoint for each assumed release.  To perform the required offsite consequence analysis for the facility, the very conservative EPA RMP*Comp model was used.\r\n\r\nThe worst case release scenario involves the complete rupture of one 67,000 -gallon storage tank, filled to 88% capacity.  A maximum release of 302,320 pounds of anhydrous ammonia over a 10-minute period was considered.  The released quantity was not limited by a system of administrative controls.  Under worst case meteorological conditions of Class F stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, ammonia could travel up to 6.1 miles before reaching the specified toxic endpoint level of 0.14 mg/L.\r\n\r\nThe alternative case release scenario involves the release of 700 pounds of ammonia from the rupture of the 2 ammonia feed line to the vaporizers.

The What-If analysis methodology was used to assess the potential hazards of the process. The study was conducted by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, control logics, and process operations.  Findings from the analysis were addressed.  The What-If analysis was conducted on March 27-29, 2001, a revalidation was conducted on September 6, 2001, and a pre-startup safety review was conducted on January 4, 2002.  The most recent Process Hazard Analysis update occurred on October 18-19, 2011.  Findings from the analysis have been addressed and resolved.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures: DP&L has established and maintains procedures for safely conducting activities within our covered process.  The procedures cover various operational phases including initial startup, normal shutdown, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, and startup following a turnaround or emergency shutdown.  The information is readily available to operators and maintenance personnel involved in the process and the information is periodically reviewed to assure it is current.\r\n\r\nTraining: DP&L's training program is comprehensive and is implemented to ensure that all personnel involved in the operation and maintenance of the process are properly trained in the safe operation and maintenance of the process and knowledgeable of the hazards of the process.

All maintenance operations conducted on the covered process are performed by qualified personnel who have had proper training.  Equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected promptly and safely.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change: DP&L maintains written procedures to manage changes in the process equipment, procedures and monitoring technology.  Personnel whose job tasks are affected by a modification in the process are promptly apprised of the modification and provided training to address the modification.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Review:  A pre-startup safety review was conducted prior to the startup of the new process.  Established pre-startup safety review procedures will assure that construction, equipment, operating maintenance procedures are suitable for a safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits: DP&L will conduct audits of the risk management plan at least every three years.  Any corrective actions required as a result of the audits will be promptly and safely implemented.  The last compliance audit conducted at Stuart Station was completed on 2/9/2011.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigations: Any incident that results in or could reasonably result in a significant release of a regulated substance is promptly investigated.

The requirements for non-responding facilities are covered in Section 68.90 of the rule.  To determine whether a facility is a responding one, the EPA interpretation of response is commonly used.  It is the definition of response used in the OSHA HAZWOPER standard in 29 CFR 1910.120(a)(3).  \r\n\r\nThe standard defines response as a response effort by employees from outside the immediate release area or by other designated responders to an occurrence which results, or is likely to result, in an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance.  This definition specifically excludes responses to incidental releases, which are those where there is no potential safety or health hazard.
