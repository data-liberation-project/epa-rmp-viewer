Therefore, for reasons that are always connected to the economic survival, we are committed to every and all measures that prevent accident of incidental releases of ammonia, our one and only extremely hazardous substance (EHS), we store, distribute and repackage for living.\n\nTo that effect we maintain a formal schedule of monthly safety meetings for all employees of MSI, Inc.  The topic of each of these meetings is carefully selected to embrace not only subjects of personal safety in handling of ammonia and adherence to our written Standard Operating Procedures and Safety Process Management, but included are individual measures and steps to prevent accidental releases of ammonia into the atmosphere and the communal vicinity surrounding our plant.\n\nThe accidental release prevention rests on four pillars of managerial baselines/sineguanons:\n      A.  Regular, semi-annual reviews of all pressure vessels data base information maintained in our special excel and maximizer computer programs involving tank maintenance, repairs and testing, The data base includes dates & read-outs of hydrostatic pressure tests; ultrasound metal thickness and metal attrition read-outs if any; magnaflux inside surface integrity test; visual examination of inside and outside surfaces; d"

The town proper houses about 3,000 people (more or less) and lies generally southeasterly of our plant.\n\nLOCATION WITHIN ITS GEOGRAPHIC AREA:  The facility/site/ plant inclusive rail spur, off-loading dock, warehouse, shop with service facilities, administrative building, two private residences and the equipment parking yard is situated on 4.5 acres in the industrial zone on the west -- northwest edge of the town limits.

North of the site continues the industrial zone of the town including intermittently operated Onion Packing & Storage facilities, then an open area followed with a Potato Processing  Plant of J.R. Simplot Co., Hay Storage Area; Alfalfa Pellet Mill adjoined with open area of irrigated farm fields.  NE of our site are open farm fields.  Immediately east of our site is a commercial zone of the town adjoined with a thinly populated residential area, then the northern part of the town's residential area that is then better than one half a mile away.  South of our industrial site is the continuation of town's industrial and commercial zone that is a home, among other ag-related businesses, to a Readymix plant and to the Adams County fire department.\nCOMMERCIAL FUNCTION & MISSION: The principal activity on the site is ammonia repackaging and ammonia bulk distribution. MULTiSTAR Indusries, Inc., dba MULTiFROST, Inc., MULTiCHEM, Inc., MULTiCROP, Inc. (hereafter referred to only as MSI) buys anhydrous ammonia in railcar quantities, which the Columbia Railroad delivers to its sidings located on the northwest side of its industrial property. There it is off-loaded into its bulk trucks -- for L/TL(less than a truckload lots) deliveries -- or its stationary ammonia storage tanks. Like a fuel distributor/bulk plant operator does with fuel, we bring in anhydrous (waterless/dry) ammonia in quantities that are larger than end-users in the cold storage/food freezing industries and/or farmers want to buy, off-load it onto our bulk trucks, than in turn deliver it to the end-users that need this common refrigerant to \"make cold\" or apply it as a plant nutrient (fert"

Unlike the fuel bulk plant operator, we cover a considerably larger territory, are subjected to a strict DOT protocol concerning operations of our trucks on public highways and transloading safety measures. Since MSI sends its repackaged ammonia refrigerant all the way to Alaska, to where it is sold in one product dedicated, specially designed, DOT certified pressure vessels, it details these P/V's with ammonia and freights them to seaports on the west side of the state. There they are loaded on sea-going freighters (boats or barges) to be disgorged at various points of fish processors lining up the coastal waters of Alaska. \nMARKET PRESENCE, SUPPORT ACTIVITIES, MARKET OBJECTIVE:  More than 700 individual fish canners/fish processors, dairy operators, meat processors, food processors, fruit packer & processors, fruit storage operators, cold storage operators and farmers of the Columbia Basin, all the way from small family  establishments to large multi-facility national firms depend, often on very short notice, on timely performance and special technical skills of MSI, Inc. To and for that end, the support activities of MSI consist of rather strict & formal truck maintenance, pressure vessel testing, repair & maintenance, inventorying of specialized ammonia equipment parts, surface & tank coating repair & maintenance, truck detailing and road load mobilization together with administrative protocol needed to make formal, to make legal and safe shipments of the HAZMAT product, anhydrous ammonia.! Finally, we also fill with ammonia, - for a third party distributor/dealer, - small steel containers/ bottles that represent the main activity in the warehouse located on the west - SW  part of the site.

Accidental gas release was selected as the only scenario to be considered in any modeling. The tanks are not subject to any other accidental release, with a possible exception of a malfunctioning PRV's  [Pressure Relief Valve)\nWritten Standard Operating Procedures / Process Management Plan include periodic maintenance & testing of the PRV's, yet even in the case of their unlikely malfunctioning,  the accidental release shall involve only a gas/vapor release. However, when ammonia vapors are released from a top of self-pressurized liquid, the liquid below is subject to rapid cooling, therefore rapid pressure drop leads to a \"self-healing\" of the accidental discharge. We know from experience that in a scenario where the pressure relief valve was completely broken off on a tank full of ammonia in Alaska, the same tank made a journey from Alaska to Seattle and from Seattle to Othello, WA yet the tank still contained over 65% of the depressurized, super-cooled liquid when it arrived in Othello. It did not emanate ammonia vapors beyond negligible, non-offensive amounts.\n\nThe railcars serving as temporary ammonia storage-- the bulk of stored liquid ammonia at the site-- are double shell pressure vessels equipped with top off-loading valves only,"

The off-loading of ammonia liquid is done through Goodall's self-closing \"smart-hose\" designed to \"heal\" and close immediately subject to rapturous escape of the ammonia liquid.\n\nTherefore, the worst-case scenario deploys only sudden and accidental release of ammonia vapors released from vaporization of 1000 gal / 5300# of liquid ammonia.\nBeyond these escaped quantities, it is foreseen that the ammonia liquid will super-cool itself in the tank from which the ammonia vapors are escaping, self-heal to a minimal discharge till the liquid below is removed and the release brought under control.\nSince ammonia vapors mix readily with air, they are subject to instantaneous dilution, hence the one half mile selection of the distance to the endpoint.\nHISTORICALLY, 40 YEARS OF UNINTERRUPTED OPERATIONS DO NOT RECORD ANY AMMONIA RELEASE MODELED EITHER IN THE WORST-CASE OR THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\n\n4. The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n\nTECHNOLOGICAL STEPS:  MSI practices a documented maintenance and testing of its process equipment to ensure proper operations.\nMechanical Integrity. 1) Strict adherence to the maintenance & testing protocol of all ammonia pressure vessels and its instruments. 2) Deployment of the highest (most expensive) quality brand(s) of valves, pressure relief valve, excess flow valves, hoses, pipes, fittings etc connected with ammonia conveyance. 2) Strict adherence to engineering standards of the industry as well as installations of redundant excess flow valves on all tanks and throughout the system. 4) Uncompromising dedication to rust prevention, inhibition, control.\n\n\nPROCEDURAL / MANAGERIAL STEPS: Our facility has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40CFR part 68 of the EPA.

MSI maintains safety information that describes the hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with its operation(s).\nProcess Hazard Analysis.  MSI conducts reviews to ensure that hazards associated with our operations are identified and controlled effectively. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. The most recent PHA update was performed DEC 15, 2003.\nOperating Procedures & Training. For the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, MSI deploys the \"buddy\" system to implement operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shut-downs, emergency . Operations. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes. A new employee is assigned to a \"buddy\" and stays with him for the entire training period  which may last up to one year. Furthermore, managers / supervisors are involved with hands-on participation in the process and their daily, hour-by-hour supervision.\nManagement of  Change. The most recent review / revision of the maintenance protocol was performed in December 2003. All employees, in once a month safety meetings, are appraised of the changes and trainings are conducted to deal with the changes / modifications.\nPre-start-up reviews. The start-up reviews are very rare. Our processes of dealing and handling ammonia hardly change. Consequently, the routine is well defined and followed.\nCompliance Audits. MSI audits are informal & ongoing. With the management living on the premises and participating daily in the supervision, often engaged physically in the tasks at hand, the implementation and compliance with the RMP provisions is constant and continuous.\nIncident Investigation. MSI would investigate formally & investigate promptly any incident that wou"

Formal reports would be written up and needed preventive corrections / improvements will be promptly followed. For 40 years of our operations we have been spared this formality. No incidents, nor any accidents have ever occurred and we are doing everything we can to keep the stellar record unblemished.\nEmployee Participation. MSI has always considered the safety process management, as well as the accident prevention efforts & goals to be a team effort. Therefore, all employees are strongly encouraged to express their views on issues of accident prevention and to make suggestions for its improvement. At the same time our employees have at all times access to information(s) that are a part of our implementation of the RMP including information resulting from the process hazard analysis in particular.\nOutside Contractors: MSI informs outside contractors of known potential hazards related to contractors' work in our work process  and/or on the facility. They are also informed of the emergency response should an accidental release of ammonia occur.\n\n\n5. The five year accident history. 40 years of accident / incident / unwanted release free history.\n\n\n6. The emergency response program.\n\nMSI operating since 1986 -- (prior to that date operated as SOIL & CROP SERVICE, Inc since 1963) -- has not had any recordable ammonia release in all these years. In late July, summer of 2001, a group of thieves, assumed producers of controlled substances, attempted an ammonia theft from our 8,500G storage tank.  They did not succeed, but in the process of their theft they left a liquid valve slightly cracked. The escaping ammonia created an alarm that we brought internally immediately under control with the aid of our SCBA apparatus. Valve closed, end of alarm, end of ammonia release. The estimated amount of escaped ammonia was under 100#. While the local police & the county fire depart"

      "SummaryText": "ment got involved, the ammonia release was handled by MSI personnel living on the commercial premises. While, ahead of the attempted theft the valve handle on the tank was capped and locked, following the release, the valve was redundantly capped with a steel cap equipped with heavier lock. No left attempts have been registered since.\nMSI has an emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including first aid & medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced. In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\nAdams County LEPC is the Local Emergency Planning Committee with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\n\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.  Having covered all aspects of the emergency response plan already; working only with one hazard namely anhydrous ammonia, MSI has no additional plans at this time. The management firmly believes that the operations & processes are managed clean, uncluttered, that the housekeeping is above par and that the measures for accident / incident prevention are at a very high level of alertness, preparedness and ready responsiveness.\n\n\n8. Certification Statement for Program 2 & 3 Processes.\n\nTo the best of the undersigned knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable injury and scrutiny, the information submitted is true, accurate & complete."
