This Risk Management Plan has been developed in accordance with the requirements specified under 40 CFR part 68, Subpart G.  The Risk Management Plan certifies that KIK has instituted a Risk Management Program at the Danville, Illinois facility that is in compliance with U.S. EPA RMP requirements.\n\nThe Risk Management Plan follows the format provided by the RMP Data Elements published by U.S. EPA.  In addition to identifying the applicable corporate policies and risk management systems, including comprehensive accident prevention and emergency response programs, the Risk Management Plan identifies a set of worst case and alternative release scenarios and summarizes the facility?s five-year accidental release history.  The Risk Management Plan also verifies that prevention program and emergency response plans are appropriately designed to minimize risks to workers and the potentially affected public.\n\nKIK initially submitted a Risk Management Plan in June 1999.  Under 40 CFR 68 Risk Management Plans must be updated at least once every five years.  KIK has updated the plan in accordance with EPA guidance and has made minor changes to the process hazards analysis.  However, no conclusions have changed.  This document presents the updated Risk Management Plan for KIK?s Danville facility.\n\n1.1  Corporate Statement\n\nKIK Custom Products recognizes and believes in the importance of safeguarding both our natural resources and our environmental heritage.  As such, we are committed to our customers, employees, and the various communities in which we operate to protect the health of our environment through the developmen"

      "SummaryText": "Program 1 can be applied to any process which has not had a ?significant? release of a regulated substance over the previous five years and for which the worst-case release does not affect ?public receptors? (e.g., residences, parks and recreation areas, commercial/industrial facilities, hospitals).  Program 2 apples to any process that is ineligible for program 1 and is not subject to Program 3.  Program 3 apples to processes that are subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  The KIK Accident Prevention Program elements are adopted directly from the compliance program for the PSM standard, consistent with Level 3 RMP Program requirements for this KIK facility under 40 CFR 68.  Program 3 related information is included in the Data Elements section of the Risk Management Plan.\n\n2.1  Program 3 Process\n\nThe KIK Custom Products plant in Danville produces various consumer aerosol products for major marketers.  These aerosol products contain various amounts of flammable hydrocarbon propellants to provide the pressure to force the product from the container.  Five flammable chemicals are stored at or above the threshold amounts for regulated substances.  These include isobutane, n-butane, propane, 1,1-difluoroethane, and dimethyl ether (DME).\n\nHydrocarbon propellant is delivered to KIK by railcar or truck, transferred to dedicated pressure tanks located in the tank farm and, when needed, piped through a central manifold to the propellant charging rooms.  Because of the high volatility and flammability of the propellants, all filling operations are conducted in an isolated, specially designed propellant charging room.  These rooms, the high speed filling equipment, and the auxiliary equipment contained therein are designed according to stringent safety codes to guarantee that explosive concentrations of propellant do not occur.

      "SummaryText": "and halon suppression equipment are a few of the standard installations.  Typical rooms contain:  welded piping, air opened/spring-closed remotely and manually operated ball valves, heat exchangers, flow, temperature, and concentration sensors and exhaust air plenums.  Each propellant charging room is also equipped with an explosion relief panel.  \n\nThe atmosphere within each room is constantly removed and directed out one or more exhaust stacks.  The concentration of propellant within each room is continuously monitored at the duct?s collection plenum near the floor.  When the concentration within the room is less than 20 percent of the lower explosive limit (LEL), the room is ventilated by at least one and one-half air changes per minute.  When the concentration reaches 20 percent of the LEL, high-speed fans automatically activate to ventilate the room more quickly at more than three air changes per minute to decrease the propellant concentration.  If the percentage of LEL exceeds 40, the production filling operation and associated equipment is automatically shut down and the local fire department is automatically notified.\n\nPropellant is transferred from the tank farm at its equilibrium pressure at the liquid temperature.  To achieve the significant pressure differential required to facilitate high-speed, efficient filling, the pressure of the propellant must be raised between 600 and 800 psig.  These pressures are obtained through the use of ?pressure booster? pumps.  At KIK, these pumps are located outside each gassing room.  The propellant is then piped to the rotary filling machines in the gassing room.  A recirculation loop handles excess propellant and can accommodate higher recirculation rates depending on the filing machine?s demand.  The recirculated propellant may be water-cooled or steam-heated as necessary.\n\n2.2  Program 1 Process\n\nKIK also warehouses up to one million aerosol cans in an on-site area that is separate from the Program 3 processes.

With an average amount of 40 grams of propellant per can, the total amount of propellant stored is about 44,000 pounds.  According to the RMP regulation, a vapor cloud explosion of the flammable material inside such a vessel is considered the worst-case release in the storage process.  The process is considered Program 1 because, according to Section 68.12(b) of the regulation, no public receptors would be affected within the endpoint distance from a worst-case release (see Appendix B) and no accidents have occurred within the past five years resulting in offsite deaths, injuries, or damage to the environment (see Section 5.0).  RMP Program 1 requires a review of the five-year accident history and evaluation of a worst-case release to verify that public receptors would not be affected, and procedures to notify off-site emergency response agencies (e.g., fire department) of the on-site hazards associated with the regulated substances. \n \n3.0  ACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nSome processes subject to the Risk Management regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  PSM governs the same processes and regulated substances at the site that are subject to 40 CFR 68.  KIK has a PSM program at the Danville facility that includes the following elements:\n\n- Employee Participation;\n- Process Safety Information;\n- Process Hazards Analysis;\n- Operating Procedures;\n- Training;\n- Contractors;\n- Pre-Startup Safety Review;\n- Mechanical Integrity;\n- Hot Work Permit;\n- Management of Change;\n- Incident Investigation;\n- Emergency Planning and Response; and\n- Compliance Audits.\n \n4.0  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nIn conjunction with the current RMP and PSM programs in place at the KIK Danville facility, there is a standard management practice that requires immediate internal reporting of unusual events, including those in which any abnormal emission "

The incident information is reviewed by supervisory staff and a determination is made as to whether a reportable quantity of any chemical listed as requiring reports to regulatory authorities is involved.  If so, the appropriate authorities are notified.\n\nDuring the past five years (September 2000 to September 2005), KIK Custom Products has not had a release of regulated flammable substances from the Danville facility that has caused onsite or offsite injuries, emergency response, offsite evacuations, or damage to property or the environment.  \n \n5.0  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nKIK?s Danville plant has established an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) to ensure appropriate steps are taken to protect public health and the environment, as well as the safety of plant employees.  The EAP is designed to address foreseeable emergency situations at the facility and provide appropriate hazard and emergency preparedness information to employees, contractors, emergency response personnel, and the community.  Emergency situations can include fire, explosion, chemical release or spill, bomb threats, weather emergencies, site security (i.e., terrorism) and other natural emergencies.\n\nKIK has developed procedures to be followed in the event of an emergency and a command structure to evaluate an emergency to determine the appropriate action to be taken to remedy it.  KIK staff has a ?first response? capability and are able to administer basic first aid and CPR.  KIK will rely on the Westville Area Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) for assistance in controlling emergency releases and extinguishing fires.\n \n6.0  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nKIK is committed through its grass-roots Continuous Improvement process to the expansion and refinement of its safety programs with special emphasis on training.
