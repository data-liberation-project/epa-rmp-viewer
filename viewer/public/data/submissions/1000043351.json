Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe ExxonMobil Beaumont Chemical Plant, in Beaumont, Texas (BMCP) manufactures commodity building block chemicals for further refinement into plastics and chemical derivatives, as well as synthetic lube oils.  BMCP maintains a policy to be a good business partner and a safe and conscientious community member who operates the facility in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.\n\n\n\nBMCP has a longstanding commitment to worker and public safety.  This is evidenced by:\n\n\n\n     -  Our history of support and commitment to the community;\n\n     -  Our high environmental standards; and \n\n     -  Our participation as a STAR facility in the U. S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) since 1984.  On November 21, 2012, we were awarded our 9th STAR, and are the longest continuous Star site in OSHA Region VI.  We are listed by OSHA as a \"Star of Excellence.\"\n\n\n\nBMCP utilizes a management system framework called Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS) to effectively establish safety, health, and environmental expectations and manage operating integrity risks.  OIMS addresses all aspect of the business including security measures to prevent unnecessary on-site human exposure and to minimize the potential for any offsite exposure.  The 11 OIMS elements are:\n\n\n\n     1.  Management, Leadership, Commitment and Accountability\n\n     2.  Risk Assessment and Management\n\n     3.  Facilities Design and Construction\n\n     4.  Information/Documentation\n\n     5.  Personnel and Training\n\n     6.  Operations and Maintenance\n\n     7.  Management of Change\n\n     8.  Third-Party Services\n\n     9.  Incident Investigation and Analysis\n\n     10.  Community Awareness and Emergency Preparedness\n\n     11.  Operations Integrity"

      "SummaryText": " Assessment and Improvement\n\n\n\n\n\n2.  Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nBMCP handles or manufactures hydrogen, methane, ethane, ethylene, acetylene, propane, propylene, isobutane, 2-methylpropene, butane, butene, crude butadiene, pentane, pentene, and isopentane as materials or RMP-regulated flammable mixtures.  Chlorine is used for water treatment and boron trifluoride is used for synthetic lube processes.  BMCP is organized into four business units: Olefins, Aromatics, Synthetics and Catalyst.  Only Olefins, Aromatics, and Synthetics are RMP-covered processes per the criteria in 40 CFR Part 68.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.  General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nTo ensure that our risk management program is appropriately developed and implemented, the BMCP Plant Manager has assigned the role of RMP Coordinator to the Beaumont Complex SHE Manager.  The Beaumont Complex SHE Manager, acting with the authority delegated directly from the BMCP Plant Manager, has the responsibility for the development and implementation of our risk management programs.\n\n\n\nBMCP has developed effective programs to comply with the industry's most stringent environmental, health, and safety standards.  Our plant adheres to the American Chemistry Council's mandatory Responsible Care Program.  This site was the first in the nation to have all of its facilities certified as STAR facilities in OSHA's VPP.  Facilities in the STAR program are required to demonstrate exemplary safety performance and agree to work cooperatively with OSHA to serve as an example for the industry as a whole.  They are audited by OSHA for compliance every few years.  Heritage sites in BMCP were among the first facilities in the nation to earn the prestigious STAR recognition and have maintained it through nine OSHA inspections over a twenty-nine year period.\n\n\n\nBMCP takes a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.

      "SummaryText": " OIMS elements address each of the essential features of successful accident prevention programs including:\n\n\n\n     -  Employee participation is included in Elements 1, 2, and 5\n\n     -  Process safety information is included in Element 4\n\n     -  Process hazard analysis is included in Element 2\n\n     -  Incident investigation is included in Element 9\n\n     -  Operating procedures is included in Element 6\n\n     -  Training is included in Element 5\n\n     -  Mechanical integrity is included in Element 6\n\n     -  Management of change is included in Element 7\n\n     -  Pre-startup safety review is included in Element 7\n\n     -  Hot work permit is included in Element 6\n\n     -  Contractor safety is included in Element 8\n\n     -  Emergency Preparedness is included in Element 10\n\n     -  Compliance audits is included in Elements 6 and 11\n\n\n\nOur RMP uses these individual elements to prevent accidental chemical releases.  In addition to our industry-leading management programs, we have designed state-of-the-art systems and equipment to control, prevent, detect, and mitigate potential accidental releases.  An important tool for managing changes, for example, is our Safe Operations Committee (SOC), which is a review body to ensure that high quality, cost effective facilities, procedures, techniques, and maintenance reduce to the minimum practical level the likelihood of personnel injury, fire or explosion, thereby ensuring a safe and reliable operation.\n\n\n\nBMCP employs extensive mechanical integrity and preventive maintenance programs to ensure the integrity of our equipment and safety systems.  Our mechanical integrity program uses equipment surveillance and preventive maintenance activities to identify equipment that may be in need of repair or replacement, before failure occurs.  This program also specifies the repairs (or parts replacement) needed to maintain equipment in acceptable operating condition.\n\n\n\nWe train our employees to safely perform their assigned tasks.

Training is also provided special topics, such as the management of change (MOC) system.  As part of our training, we include provisions for ensuring that employees understand the covered material, including written tests and field demonstrations.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.  Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nBMCP had no accidents that met the reporting criteria for the RMP Five-Year Accident History.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.  Emergency Response Program Information\n\n\n\nBMCP Emergency Response Plan which is outlined and managed under OIMS Element 10, serves as the final line of defense against, and the mechanism for response to, accidental releases and other emergencies. BMCP has an extensive emergency preparedness organization which includes resources from the ExxonMobil Beaumont Refinery.  Emergency drills and exercises are conducted frequently and coordinated with the City of Beaumont's Fire Department, various government agencies (TCEQ, Coast Guard, LEPC), local hospitals, and the news media.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nBMCP is a STAR facility in OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program.  We continue to improve our security, safety, health, and environmental programs through scheduled and non-scheduled auditing and assessing. Improvement plans are developed to make the systems and the people who use them more effective. These plans are tracked to completion and validated to ensure they are effectively implemented.  We conduct ongoing training and preplanning for emergencies.  We steward progress of process safety and RMP prevention program elements as key performance indicators.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to these actions, the Chemical Plant is working to implement new systems to assist in improving safety performance in the site. The systems being implemented are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nLoss Prevention System (LPS) - Implementation of a proactive beha"
