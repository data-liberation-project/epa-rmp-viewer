The Water Division is committed to providing a safe work environment for its employees. Water Supervisor is tasked with the implementation of the safety programs and policies at the Valley Pumping Plant. In addition, the Division has an Accident Review Committee that is responsible for reviewing all incidents and near misses that occur at the facilities. This group is responsible for collecting all necessary information from employees (and contractors as necessary) regarding a reported incident through interview sessions. Following the data collection, the Accident Review Committee will meet to hypothesize potential causes and develop mitigation measures to prevent future occurrences.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe City of Burbank Valley Pumping Plant is located at 2030 North Hollywood Way in Burbank, California 91505.  The chlorine system was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.  The facility is surrounded by chain link fence with access through several gates.  Visitors are permitted to enter the facility by checking in with the operations personnel.  A maximum of 4 one ton containers and twenty 150 pound cylinders (11,000 pounds) of chlorine is maintained on site.\n\nThe chlorine system is operated under vacuum conditions.  Gaseous chlorine stored in one-ton containers in the chlorine storage room is metered and added to potable supply water in the chlorine feed room using two chlorinators and two injectors, respectively.  The resulting chlorine solution is added to the influent groundwater in a diffuser vault prior to the five million gallon reservoir (forebay) for primary disinfection.  The forebay is used to provide the required chlorine contact time for primary disinfectio"

A automatic switchover valve allows only one of the containers to feed chlorine at a time. When the switchover valve detects high vacuum from one of the containers, it opens to supply chlorine from the other container. All empty tanks connected to the manifold are replaced with a full tank from the storage area.  This replacement is done by City of Burbank operators using a monorail hoist.\n\nWhile connected to the system, two one-ton containers are placed on a scale to allow City of Burbank operators to plan the change out procedure.  Each one ton container is positioned so that the valves are vertically aligned.  The vacuum regulator/heater assembly is placed on the top container valve to ensure that chlorine gas is pulled from the container. The vacuum created at the injector(s) produces the necessary vacuum to operate the vacuum regulators in the chlorine distribution system.  The heater is used to ensure that gaseous chlorine does not condense.\n\nThe chlorine gas is pulled from the one ton container to the chlorinators through the vacuum regulator.  The chlorinators are equipped with rotameters to control the flow of the chlorine gas.  After the chlorinator, the chlorine is injected (by the injector) into the water line to create a chlorine solution.\n\nDetectors in the storage and feed rooms indicate chlorine gas leaks.  The disinfection building is also equipped with an automatic emergency chlorine scrubber system that is capable of neutralizing more than 400 pounds of chlorine vapor (the equivalent of a complete one-ton container failure with an average 20 percent flash-off rate).\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe City of Burbank chlorine system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of t"

For example, the City of Burbank facility operates in accordance with OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management regulation and the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.\n\nThe pumping plant operating schedule is 9 hours per day, 7 days per week, with at least two (2) employees assigned to each shift.  The disinfection operations at the facility operates 24 hours a day, seven days per week.  The Valley Pumping Plant maintains tight control of its chlorine system through various process controls and monitors.  In the event that the primary engineering or administration controls at the facility fail and result in a release of chlorine, there are three mechanisms in the plant to minimize the impact: 1) chlorine sensors / detectors, 2) alarms, and 3) emergency chlorine scrubber system.  The chlorine sensors that trigger audible and visual alarms at a chlorine concentration of 1 ppm are located in the chlorine storage room and the chlorinator room.  Once a chlorine concentration of 3 ppm is detected by the sensors, the chlorine scrubber system is activated which neutralizes gaseous chlorine in the room resulting in a lower chlorine concentration, and an off-site alarm company will alert the local fire department via telephone.  \n\nThe emergency chlorine scrubber is located outside and east of the chlorine storage room.  The system is designed to achieve a flow rate of 3,000 cubic feet per minute and is capable of completely neutralizing more than 400 pounds of chlorine vapor on a once-through basis (equivalent to a complete ton container failure with an average 20% flash off rate).  The scrubber design requirements are based on the Uniform Fire Code (UFC), which allows for a maximum concentration of chlorine in the scrubber exhaust of 10 parts per million (ppm).\n\nFuse plugs serve as safety relief for one-ton containers.  There are three fuse plugs on each end of the one-ton containers for a total of six.  They are designed to melt, relieving pressure,"

In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from a chlorine release.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe City of Burbank Water and Power, Water Division (City of Burbank) facility has an emergency action plan in effect.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Action Plan Manual, which is maintained at the facility and updated as necessary.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\nCity of Burbank maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, chlorine health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes due to the renovation of the facility.\n\nCity of Burbank has coordinated emergency response efforts with the local fire department.

Both studies resulted in minor procedural modifications to ensure safe operation. These modifications are currently being implemented with an expected date of completion being November 2005. The Water Supervisor is responsible for ensuring that these recommendations are implemented. \n\nThe Process Safety Management team is planning to complete several items over the next year as their continued effort to provide a safe work environment for the City employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n1.\tContinue to train all employees in Process Safety Management and the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\n\n2.\tContinue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\n\n3.\tContinue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n\n4.\tContinue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."
