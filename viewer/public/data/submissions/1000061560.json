It is MRD's policy to conduct its operations in accordance with the highest standards of environmental stewardship, employee and contractor safety and community responsibility. As part of this policy, MRD has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility. One part of these systems is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at MRD and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) RMP rule (40 CFR part 68). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at MRD. This document is intended to satisfy the executive summary requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at MRD.\n\n\n\nOn October 1, 2017, Marathon Petroleum Company LP (MPC LP) transferred ownership of certain logistics assets, including various storage tanks, unloading/loading operations, docks, and ancillary equipment at its petroleum refinery located in Detroit, Michigan (Detroit Refinery) to a separate operating company, Detroit Refining Logistics LLC (DRL). Both MPC LP and DRL are wholly-owned, indirect subsidiaries of Marathon Petroleum Corporation.\n\n\n\nDRL owns and operates the transferred logistics assets; however, by contractual arrangement, MPC LP will provide various administrative services to DRL, including services related to the maintenance of and compliance with this plan. The logistics assets owned and operated by DRL and the refinery assets owned and operated by MPC LP remain a single stationary source for purposes of this plan.

One primary element of this commitment is the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances in and around the refinery. MRD utilizes engineering controls, inspection programs, and detailed procedures to reduce the probability of an accidental release.\n\n\n\nIn the event of a release, the MRD has a well-trained emergency response team (ERT) to contain, mitigate, monitor, and stop the release. The emergency response team is an industrial fire brigade fully trained for firefighting, hazardous material releases and spill response. A dedicated air monitoring team (AMT) exists to provide perimeter and community air monitoring in the event of a release. MRD evaluates each situation, responds based on our capabilities and training, and if necessary, requests assistance from outside emergency responders including local fire departments to help control and contain the release and to prevent and/or reduce the consequences of a release. In conjunction with the Wayne County and Detroit local emergency planning committees (LEPCs), the refinery has the ability to notify the local community through media broadcasting systems.\n\n\n\nThe Michigan Refining Division Manager has overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the risk management program for EPA-regulated processes at MRD. However, the specific responsibilities for certain aspects of that program have been delegated to other personnel who report either directly, or through other management personnel, to the Division Manager.

In keeping with our policy that safe operation is part of everyone's job, many other division personnel are also involved in RMP activities on an ongoing basis.\n\n\n\n1.2 Michigan Refining Division Regulated Substances\n\nMRD is a petroleum refinery and petroleum products facility located principally in Detroit, Michigan with a tank farm in Melvindale, Michigan and a marine terminal located on the Rouge River in Detroit, Michigan. MRD uses crude petroleum as its primary feed material and makes a variety of petroleum-based products, including gasoline, diesel fuel, and liquefied petroleum gases such as propane and butane. Many of these products are flammable mixtures with components that EPA has specifically listed in the RMP rule and are present in the refinery process units above the EPA threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds. MRD has no toxic substance regulated by the RMP rule in sufficient quantity to be covered by the RMP rule.\n\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\n\n\n\nMRD performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance that could affect the public or the environment. The offsite consequence analysis consisted of evaluating both worst-case scenarios and alternative release scenarios. MRD does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur. An alternative release scenario represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility like the refinery. Al"

We have submitted release scenario analyses to EPA and have shared that information with the LEPC and other organizations involved in emergency response activities.\n\n\n\n1.3 Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at MRD. Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) standard, and because the OSHA PSM requirements are very similar to the EPA RMP requirements for refineries, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements. \n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nMRD encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team, incident investigation, and compliance audit teams. Employees have access to all information created as part of the refinery's accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the refinery.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe refinery keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safe"

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, the refinery has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, pressure) in the operation manuals for each process unit. The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, operating procedures, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nMRD also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nMRD has a comprehensive Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each existing covered process and future processes are systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage those hazards.\n\n\n\nThe refinery primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques available. The analyses are led by a person trained in the HAZOP methodology utilizing a team comprised of individuals who have experience in operations, operations supervision, engineering, technical services, and mechan"

All approved safety improvements being implemented in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained by the Health, Environmental, Safety & Security Department.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the refinery periodically updates and revalidates its process hazard analyses of affected units. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The PHA Team has considered offsite effects of potential releases as part of all PHA updates completed after August, 1996. The results and recommendations from these updates are documented and retained. The team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the recommendations is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nMRD maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by qualified operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. Procedures are maintained current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made to the process.

The written operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, MRD has a training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in refinery operations and specific training on the process they will operate. After a new operator demonstrates through tests and skills demonstration adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. Operators are given the opportunity to take part in more frequent refresher training if desired. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nMRD uses contractors to supplement its work force especially (because we do always have them, not just during increased maintenance) during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform MPC personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.

If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\n\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. MPC incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\n\n\nMRD has safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel in process areas, (2) Energy Isolation procedures to control hazardous energy sources during the servicing and maintenance of machinery and equipment, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control hot work including welding and other spark-producing activities, and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that precautions are in place for confined space entry.

The details of the accident are included in Section 6 of the RMPlan.\n\n\n\n1.5 Emergency Response Program Information\n\n\n\nMRD maintains a written Emergency Response Plan (ERP), which aims to protect employees, public health, and the environment. The purpose of the ERP is to protect personnel and to minimize the impact on the refinery and surrounding areas in the event of an emergency situation. The plan consists of procedures for responding to such emergencies as fires, explosions, hazardous gas or liquid releases, natural disasters, medical incidents and bomb threats. The plan, along with tactical emergency response procedure, such as pre-fire plans and the boom deployment plans, addresses responsibilities of the Emergency Response Team and the Emergency Operations Center, emergency communication including notification of authorities, emergency planning, training, event documentation, and guidelines for compliance with applicable government regulations. All employees receive annual safety training to instruct them in proper emergency response procedures. The Emergency Response Team participates in additional training sessions so that they can safely handle potential emergency situations. Furthermore, the refinery has procedures that address proper use, maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment.\n\n\n\nThe overall ERP for the refinery is coordinated with the Wayne County LEPC, Detroit LEPC, and local community fire and police departments.
