If a PSSR or a PHA is required, employees are assigned task(s) to:\n\n\n\n?    Update process information or maintenance schedules or procedures\n\n?    Provide employee and/or contractor training\n\n?    Revise operating procedures\n\n?

A PHA, if performed, would identify additional action items to be addressed many of which would also have to be addressed prior to start up of the change in the process.\n\n\n\nThis procedure assures that all information involved in all elements and aspects of PSM and RMP are managed and kept current.

This guideline formalizes the process by which an accident must be reported and can be investigated by employees (and contractors when appropriate) to determine the direct and/or contributing causes of an incident.  Both types of causes are used to help formulate corrective action(s) intended to prevent the possibility of a reoccurrence of the specific accident or a similar event.

For the covered process of the butane tank system, Allied Energy has coordinated with the local Fire Department (See Fire Safety Analysis).  The FSA plan details specific emergency devices and equipment such a location of emergency shut off valves, fire suppression equipment and hydrants.    It also summarizes the local fire departments ability to respond to a butane tank system fire.   Per the plan, the Birmingham Fire and Rescue Service could respond in less than 6 minutes should an emergency occur.   The FSA is periodically updated and shared with local fire department as needed.   \n\n\n\nAllied Energy Company further coordinates with the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) by reporting when required any hazardous or extremely hazardous chemicals that may be on-site over the Threshold "
