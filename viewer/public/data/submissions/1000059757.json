Employee participation in these efforts is accomplished on several levels both formally and informally.  Below are specific procedures and programs implemented at the facility: \r\n\r\n\u00bf\tQuarterly Safety Meetings\r\n\u00bf\tBehavioral Based Safety (BBS) program\r\n\u00bf\tEmployee Safety Suggestion Program\r\n\u00bf\tProcess Hazard Analyses (PHA)\r\n\u00bf\tJob Safety Analyses (JSA) \r\n\u00bf\tInjury and Illness Prevention Plan\r\n\r\nQuarterly Safety Meetings are held with employees.  The purpose is to elevate safety awareness of all employees through activities, organized meetings, review accident investigations, review inspection reports, safe work practices etc.  The end result desired is to achieve a reduction of risky behaviors associated with incidents and injuries both on and off the job.   Formal safety meetings are supplemented by toolbox talks of 10 to 15 minutes that are done at the start of a work shift or at other times designated by the supervisor.\r\n\r\nBBS Periodic Safety Field Visits are performed by salaried and hourly employees to provide informal forums for discussion of safe job performance and concerns.   Potential safety concerns are identified while a job is in progress and addressed before they result in injuries or near misses.\r\n\r\nThe Employee Safety Suggestion Program is designed to provide another avenue for employees to voice any safety issues.  \r\n\r\nThe Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) is conducted by a team of Allied Energy employees and may be lead by an outside consultant or an internal employee.

This will assure that the procedures and practices developed are adequate and are being followed.  Various employees including hourly and salaried employees participate in the audit by gathering required documentation, researching requested documentation, verifying information and participating in interviews.  All audits results, future or current pertaining to the two most recent OSHA PSM audits will be fully documented and kept on file.  The filed documents include the protocol of the audit and the results of the audit in which all deficiencies are recorded, assigned to qualified employees and tracked to completion.\r\n\r\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe Accident Prevention Programs described above ensure the safe operations and management of the chemical hazards.  In addition to these programs and procedures, there are safety systems and equipment installed in the plant to provide various levels of safety.  The levels of safety include:\r\n\r\n1)\tPrevention;\r\n2)\tQuick detection;\r\n3)\tContainment/control; and \r\n4)\tMitigation  \r\n\r\nSpecific safety features used in various processes are described below:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tRelease prevention \r\n1.\tEmergency Shut off Valve \r\n2.\tRemote Emergency Shutoff valve\r\n3.\tButane tanks internal valves designed to close during rapid flow situations\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tRelease detection \r\n1.\t24 -hour manned operation\r\n2.\tPeriodic walk through by trained personnel\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tRelease containment/control \r\n1.\tProcess safety valves that dis"

For the covered process of the butane tank system, Allied Energy has coordinated with the local Fire Department (See Fire Safety Analysis).  The FSA plan details specific emergency devices and equipment such a location of emergency shut off valves, fire suppression equipment and hydrants.    It also summarizes the local fire departments ability to respond to a butane tank system fire.   Per the plan, the Birmingham Fire and Rescue Service could respond in less than 6 minutes should an emergency occur.   The FSA is periodically updated and shared with local fire department as needed.   \r\n\r\nAllied Energy Company further coordinates with the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) by reporting when required any hazardous or extremely hazardous chemicals that may be on-site over the Threshold"
