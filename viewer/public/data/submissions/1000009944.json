The Facility Policy \n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Co-Alliance LLP, should  a Release occur, are prepared to work with the various fire departments or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information.\n\nA The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\nB  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n\nC The maximum quantity stored is 513951 pounds in all of our storage tanks. There is 234123 pounds stored in Nurse Tanks and 279828 pounds stored in Bulk Storage Tanks\n\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario And The Alternative Release Scenario. \n\n    A. The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a Liquid over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 30,000 Gallons which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 PPM) is 6.9 miles.\n\nB The alternative release scenario based on the five year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break or tear in a 1.5 inch transfer hose. This Hose is used on our Risers to load Nurse tanks. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 PPM) is 1.2 miles.\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K61.1\", published by The American National Standards institute, inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\". \n\n5. The five-ye"

The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility has:\n\n\na. A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910 38;\nb. Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right to know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\nc.A written emergency response program. In accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7. Planned Changes To Improve Safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
