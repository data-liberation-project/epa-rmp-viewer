Employees are trained by PB&S Chemical Company in the proper handling of chemical leak.  Emergency equipment on hand include, fully encapsulating suit with self-contained breathing apparatus, rubber boots, gloves, face shields, splash-proof safety goggles. In case of an accidental release, Community responders are trained to OSHA's \"Awareness\" and \"Operations\" with some \"Incident Management System\" Level by the Kentucky TECH/Fire and Rescue Training Branch. The local radio stations and Televison station would be notified in case of such accident.\n\nChlorine is transported by truck on I-65, the Cumberland Parkway and US 31-E into Canmer to the Green River Valley Water Treatment Plant by P B & S Chemicals Company, 755 Brownslock Road, Bowling Green, Kentucky.  Approximately 6000 lbs are handled and stored.\n\nWith any accidental release if the door to the facility can be closed safely, the spill will be contained in the chlorine room.  A water spray can be directed at the vapors, not the point of leak, to reduce vapors.  This runoff will be contained and neutralized with soda ash. The Hart Co DES would be contacted for the spill containment and the cleanup and disposal would be accomplished per EPA and Kentucky Department of Natural Resources regulations.  The facility's hazardous materials clean-up will be First Response, 1052 Searcy Way, Bowling Green, Ky 270-793-0906, 24 hr. Emergency, 1-800-914-9111.  If not available, Chemtrec would be called to activate Chlorep (Chlorine Emergency Response Team) to clean up spill.  Any cleanup of hazardous waste will be accomplished through a plan approved by KY Natural Resources and/or U S EPA.  The distance to the endpoint (under worst case weather)  the substance could travel 10 miles before dispersing enough to no loger pose a hazard to the public.\n\nThe chlorine cylinders are checked daily for any leaks and the em"
