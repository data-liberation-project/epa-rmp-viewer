The Facility Policy\n\n\tThe owners, management, and employees of Naasz Chemical & Fertilizer are\ncommitted to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an\naccidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire\ncompany, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the\nrelease to people and the environment.\n\n  2.  Facility Information\n\n\t- Naasz Chemical & Fertilizer, P.O. Box 234, Downs, KS  67437\n\t  (785)454-3305\n\t   Southeast corner of Downs, south of Commercial St., east of Clark St.\n\n\t- The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\n\t- Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application.\n\n\t- The maximum quantity stored would be 110,000 pounds in our two 12,000\ngallon storage tanks.  \n\n  3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\n\ta.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a\nstorage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be\n53,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent\ncapacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion\nto 200 ppm) is 1.63 miles.\n\n\tb.  The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the\nmost likely potential incident is a release from a pipe leak.  The distance to the endpoint\n(point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.47 miles.\n\n\n  4.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\n\tThe facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the\nStorage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by The American\nNa"

There are no additional specific\nanhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
