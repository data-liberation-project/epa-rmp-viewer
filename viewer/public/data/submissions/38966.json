More importantly, our employees have been trained in their respective emergency action plans, including the emergency meeting place and each of their individual responsibilities regarding an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nFrontier Equity Exchange maintains and operates our NH3 plant in strict accordance with all State and Local regulations.  The Kansas Department of Agriculture inspects our plant on a regular basis and we comply promptly with their requests for improvement.  \n\nOur employees are trained in safety procedures, sete specific operating procedures, plant maintenance and are competency tested over the training material.  Each employee uses goggles and gloves as well as having adequate safety water during all operational procedures.  With this in mind it makes it easy to report that there have been no injury accidents or property damage over the past five years.  \n\nOur Emergency Action Plan is designed to minimize the risks to employees, the surrounding public and the area First Responders.
