              "Description": "Prevention of a release is a core component of the Risk Management Program. This program is designed to insure proper work practices and an on-going mechanical integrity program. The primary methods used by this facility are a part of the Process Safety Management Program as follows:\n-Written Plan of Action - Process Safety Information - This part of the program is one of the most in involved and included the development of a written plan of action regarding the implementation of employee participation in the program. In accordance with a specific schedule outlined by the standard, as per 29 CFR 1910.119, Turner Dairy has completed a compilation of written process safety information concerning the process and operations involved with Anhydrous Ammonia of these standards of operating procedures. For purposes of defining a process covered under this program, the use of Anhydrous Ammonia as a refrigerant system has been considered \"a process,\" whereas a production or usage system/function is considered an \"operation.\" By identifying each functional operation, the team was better able to ascertain the potential and develop preparation plans in the case of a release. This compilation of information is to enable Turner Dairy and the employees involved in the operations related to Anhydrous Ammonia to identify and understand the hazards posed by these processes. This process safety information includes information pertaining to the toxicological and physical hazards of the chemical listed. \n-Hazard Analyses/Abatement Schedule - This analysis is the heart of Turner Dairy's process safety management program. The safety and health staff, and maintenance personnel, and certain operational personnel have performed an initial process hazard analysis (hazard evaluation) on each operation within each of the processes where the Anhydrous ammonia are used. A team with expertise in the operations completed the analysis. The team included employees who have experience and knowledge specific to the operations of handling and using the chemicals at each of the process operations A system was developed and is maintained to promptly address the team's findings and recommendations. Also, a written schedule of when these actions are to be completed has been developed, indicating by whom and when. The hazard analyses will be updated as needed and at least every five (5) years.\nThis analysis involved a review of each operation of the processes to address steps for each operating phase, operating limits, safety and health considerations, and safety systems and their function. The assessment also includes information concerning the emergency action plans related to the process; development and implementation of safe work practices regarding the control of entrance and exit of personnel in the process areas; pre-startup safety; mechanical integrity of equipment; inspection and testing, correction of deficiencies in equipment, planned or unexpected changes to the process, equipment, and procedures to the processes.\n-Written Operating Procedure - Turner Dairy has developed and implemented written operating procedures to provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in the processes at each operation by our employees. These procedures are consistent with the process safety information and to addresses steps for each handling phase, limitations, safety and health considerations, and safety systems and their functions. Other written documentation of standard operating procedures as a part of this program is included in the following documents:\nMechanical Integrity Study of Process Equipment\nPreventive Maintenance Program\nWritten Emergency Response Plan\nEmployee Emergency Action and Evacuation Plan\n-Training\nProcess Safety Management - Each employee involved in operations within the processes where Anhydrous Ammonia is received, processed, or used at the facility has been trained in an overview of the processes and in the operating procedures as outlined by 29 CFR 1910.119. Refresher training is required every three (3) years and more often if necessary. Training includes:\na. Emphasis on the specific safety and health hazards;\nb. Emergency operations in the case of a release including shutdown; and\nc. Safe work practices applicable to the employee's job tasks.\nA record of the training that contains the identity of the employee, the date of training, and the means used to verify that the employee understood the training is completed and maintained.\n-Contractors - Designated personnel have specific responsibilities related to the use of contractors who perform maintenance or repair, turnaround, major renovation, or specialty work on or adjacent to areas where the Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, or processed in the facility. These responsibilities include:  specific requirements in selection of contractors regarding the contractor's safety performance and programs; the provision of information concerning the emergency action plans related to the process; development and implementation of safe work practices regarding the control of entrance and exit of contract employers and contract employees in the process areas; periodic evaluation of the contractor related to safety management at the process; maintenance of certain records related to contractor employee injury and illness; development of written procedures for any new processes; and provision of training to employees.\nContractors performing work on or adjacent to equipment or processes in which Anhydrous Ammonia is present must have clearance from the Maintenance Supervisor prior to beginning operations. \nIn those cases where contractors will perform work directly to or on the process equipment in which the Anhydrous Ammonia is present, the Safety Coordinator and Maintenance Supervisor will provide an orientation session to them prior to beginning operations. This orientation includes an introduction to the Turner Dairy Process Safety Management Program, information concerning the toxicological and physical hazards of Anhydrous Ammonia, and the emergency response plan in the case of an incident involving a release. Upon completion, the contractor will be issued a permit by the Maintenance Supervisor to begin work.\n-Inspection and Testing - A program has been developed for inspection and testing, correction of deficiencies in equipment, quality assurance, management of changes in the handling of the Anhydrous Ammonia, and procedures to the process, and compliance audits.\n1) Equipment Preventive Maintenance and Quality Assurance Program - In an effort to maintain the mechanical integrity and to complete repairs of the equipment in the process, the Maintenance Supervisor oversees a Preventive Maintenance Program.\n2) Management of Change - To insure that proper safety precautions are initiated when change in the operations of the process occurs, the PSM committee will meet to discuss the planned changes before authorization is given. The committee will address the following issues prior to approval of a change in the process:\na. The technical basis for the proposed change;\nb. Impact of the change on employee safety and health;\nc. Modifications to operating procedures; and,\nd. Necessary time period for the change.\nIf changes are decided upon, training for personnel in the operation will be provided. Also, any changes to be made will be evaluated by performing a Hazard Operability Study to identify any hazards and/or actions that must be taken, Additionally, if a change covered by these procedures results in a change in the process safety information, such information will be updated accordingly.\n3) Pre-Startup Safety Review - To insure that proper safety precautions are initiated when shutdown and startup of the systems occurs after such things as renovations or major repairs, the PSM Committee will meet to discuss the changes. The committee will decide if the changes are significant enough to require a change in the process safety information. If the modification is significant enough to require such a change the committee will confirm the following:\na. Construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications,\nb. Safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate,\nc. A process hazard analysis has been performed for new facilities and recommendations have been resolved or implemented before startup, and modified facilities meet the management of change requirements; and,\nd. Training of each employee involved in operating the process has been completed.\n4) Compliance Audits - Compliance audits will be conducted with these operating procedures at least every three (3) years to verify that the procedures and practices developed are adequate and are being followed. The PSM Committee will certify that they have evaluated compliance with the provisions of the program. The compliance audit must be conducted by at least one person knowledgeable in the process and a report of the findings will be developed and documented noting any deficiencies that have been corrected. The written report of the two (2) most recent audit reports will be retained.\n-Incident Investigation - A crucial part of the Turner Dairy process safety management program is a thorough investigation of incidents to identify the chain of events and causes so that corrective measures can be developed and implemented. An investigation will be conducted on each incident that resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release of the Anhydrous Ammonia in the workplace. Accident Investigations will be conducted by:\nPlant Manager\nSafety Coordinator\nMaintenance Supervisor\n-Emergency Planning and Response - The facility Emergency Response Plan will be maintained according to the provisions of 29 CFR 1910.38 and 29 CFR 1910.120 and EPA guidelines.\n-Maximum Intended Inventory - The maximum inventory onsite is 28,404 pounds. The Maintenance Supervisor will monitor these inventories.\nHot Work Permits - In accordance with 29 CFR 1910.252, authorization is required from a designated person before cutting or welding is permitted in areas not specifically designed for such purposes. Based on fire potentials of the plant facility, areas are established for cutting and welding and procedures for a permit for other areas. Prior to welding or cutting in other than established areas, any Turner Dairy employee or contract employee must acquire a written permit.",

The water chilling process involves the distribution of liquid ammonia through piping (coils) around \nwhich water flows for chilling. The glycol cooling involves the use of liquid ammonia flowing through coils cooling the glycol to a temperature of approximately 25 degrees and is used to cool the product coming from the HTST system.\n-Technology of the Process\nRefrigeration is the control of heat. According to American Heritage Dictionary heat is defined as: \"The energy associated with the motion of atoms or molecules in solids, which can be transmitted through solid and fluid media by conduction, through fluid media by convection and through empty space by radiation.\"\nHeat is energy. The amount of motion or excitement of the atoms or molecules determines the amount of energy or heat available. The more excited the molecules, the more energy or heat available. This energy or heat can be moved or transferred. This transfer occurs when there is a difference of temperature. Heat flows from a source of greater energy (higher temperature) to a source of lower energy (lower temperature). The greater the temperature difference, the more rapid the heat flow. There are three types of heat transfer mechanisms: Conduction, Convection and Radiation. The use of liquid ammonia as a refrigerant is the transferring of heat by conduction and convection. In conduction the molecules in a medium coming in contact with each other transfer heat. The warm molecules collide with colder molecules giving them some of the energy (heat). The flow will occur if there is a difference of temperature from one side of the medium to the other. Metals are very good at transferring heat by conduction. By blowing air or moving a liquid such as water or glycol over a material such as \nmetal that has been cooled, heat is transferred by convection. The heat load in a freezer is moved via convectio"

It simply moves the heat from an area where it is not wanted to a place it can be discharged. \n-Turner Dairy receives Anhydrous Ammonia by wheeled vehicle. The receiver has a maximum of 1,500 gallons, which is filled to 80% capacity. The Anhydrous Ammonia is in a liquid form at receipt. Contract personnel complete the connection to the tank. Liquid ammonia has the ability to absorb very large amounts of heat as it vaporizes. This ability is the basis for mechanical refrigeration systems. These \nmechanical systems utilize both pressure and temperature in the refrigeration cycle. There are five major components in a mechanical refrigeration system. These include 1) Receiver, 2) Metering device/expansion valves, 3) Evaporator, 4) Compressor, and 5) Condenser. From the receiver (Add-In Tank) the liquid flows via the Hot Gas Line to the six evaporators for the Ice Cream Vault; to the eight (8) Frick Air Units in the Milk Vault, and to the dump tank of the Watkins Accumulator. From the Ice Cream \nVault and the Frick Unit the gas enters the Low Pressure Side, and the Recirculating Tank via a High Pressure Line. From the Low-Pressure side the gas goes to the Booster Compressors. Hot gas travels to the condensers. Liquid is received from the condensers to the Liquid Receiver. The level of liquid in the Recirculating Tank is maintained at approximately 78% of its capacity with an audible and visual (lights) alarm if level exceeds this level, and also an additional alarm if the level reaches the 85% level. From the Recirculating Tank, ammonia liquid is pumped to the Shell & Tubes of Evaporator 4, 5, and 6, above the Ice Cream Vault, Evaporators 1, 2 and 3 in the Milk Vaults, Frick Air Units in the Milk Vault, to the HX-6 Heat Exchanger, to Ice Builders #1 and #2,#3 and#4, the Intercooler, to HX-1 Heat Exchanger, and \nCompressors HC-3, HC-4, "

The hazard assessment and the RMP has defined the toxic endpoint and determined the populations and public areas within the radius. They have also determined environmental receptors within this radiance that would also be affected by an accidental release.\nThe worst case scenario for Anhydrous Ammonia was decided as the complete rapid loss of 1,500 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia during a ten-minute time frame. The following information was determined using the RMP*Comp Consequence Analysis model based on the stability class F, 1.5 m/s wind speed, \nand the IDLH level of 150ppm for Anhydrous Ammonia. This resulted in a release rate of 150 lbs./min., and an endpoint of .7 miles from the spill point a temperature of 77 degrees.\n-Alternative Case Scenario\nThe alternative case scenario for Anhydrous Ammonia was decided as the loss of Anhydrous Ammonia resulting from a release through a 1-inch line break. The following information was determined using the RMP*Comp Consequence Analysis model, based on the stability class D, 3 m/s wind speed, and the IDLH \nlevel of 200ppm for Anhydrous Ammonia.
