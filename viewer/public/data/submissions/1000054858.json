We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment. The company/corporate policies are embodied in the numerous EHS and Engineering standards which apply globally. At Rohm and Haas Texas, these policies are implemented through the site and global EH&S programs. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\n- A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n\n- Notes relating to our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n\n- An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n\n- A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n\n- An overview of our emergency response program\n\n- An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from\n\noccurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n\n- The certifications that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide\n\n- The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program.\n\n\n\nBayport Facility and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Bayport facility produces specialty monomers by reacting oxides with various chemicals. In our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\n\n\nToxic Chemicals:Ethylene Oxide and Propylene Oxide\n\nBoth oxides are stored in rail cars in quantities up to 185,000 lbs per rail car.

The potential exists for up to four propylene oxide railcars to be stored on-site.\n\n \n\nWorst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios:\n\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario:\n\nEthylene oxide is received in railcars with up to 185,000 lbs per railcar. The worst case release scenario is complete tank failure with entire tank inventory being released in 10 minutes. This will result in liquid spill and vaporization that will produce a cloud that will have off-site residential impacts.\n\n\n\nAlternate Case Scenario\n\nFor both ethylene oxide and propylene oxide the alternative release scenarios are pump seal failures. With detection (process control instrumentation) and response (shut down of unit operation) both releases will travel off-site but with no residential impacts.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n- Process safety information - All of our processes have comprehensive information that is used to guide the choice of process and control technologies, operating parameters, and inspection intervals for equipment such as pipes, vessels, and protective systems.\n\n\n\n- Process hazard analysis - All processes have been subjected to a rigorous analysis. These PHAs were used to define the scenarios used in this report. The accident scenarios found in PHAs form the basis of additional analyses which allow us to ensure that the integrity levels of all protective systems are high enough to protect both our employees and our neighbors. They also help us target the most important equipment for more frequent inspection.\n\n\n\n- Operating procedures - Operating procedures include windows for safe operations and guides for trouble "

Operators are involved in writing, reviewing, and updating operating procedures.\n\n\n\n- Training - Training is based on the operating instructions. Operators help determine the frequency of refresher training.\n\n\n\n- Mechanical integrity - We have a comprehensive inspection and preventive maintenance system that ensures that equipment maintains its capability to contain the process chemicals. This system is being continuously improved.\n\n\n\n- Management of change - As an industry pioneer in the management of change, we have a comprehensive, well-institutionalized MOC system. Employees at all levels are involved in the operation of the MOC system.\n\n\n\n- Pre-startup review - The Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) is integral to ensuring that any new or modified process is built as intended. It is the completion of hazard analysis to ensure that the analyses conducted are, indeed applicable to the process as built. PSSRs are part of the institutionalized MOC and PHA systems.\n\n\n\n- Compliance audits - Several types of compliance and management system audits are performed. RMP/PSM self-audits are performed every three years. Actions needed are entered into a computer-based action tracking system that automatically tells those responsible if completion of action items is taking longer than anticipated, so that remedial steps may be taken. In addition, annual self-assessments are performed on different elements of process safety.\n\n\n\n- Incident investigation - We have process safety incident investigations using multiple-cause, system-oriented techniques. Many technical papers and presentations came from this work. We continue to investigate process incidents using this technique and other root cause analysis tools so that we can gain all the information from each incident that we can to determine the root cause(s), in order to prevent future incidents and to add to the body of information about each process.\n\n"

Toxics: Worse Case - The worse case release scenario is based upon failure of a rail car which is used to store ethylene oxide. The inventory in a rail car was increased from 165,000 lbs to 185,000 lbs because of the potential to have ?10% tolerance in the amount listed on the bill of lading (168,000 lbs). This scenario has never occurred, however, it is being included in the plan as the most conservative representation of the scenario.\n\n-Update 2: Section 1.17.c - Quantity on-site was updated from 560,000 lbs to 600,000 lbs for ethylene oxide and propylene oxide was updated from 560,000 to 800,000. This increase for both is due to the potential variability as noted in Update 1 above. Further, propylene oxide has the potential to have one more rail car on-site so this was taken into -consideration.\n\n-Update 3: Section 3. Toxics: Alternative Case - The alternative cases were updated with scenarios which are thought to be the most likely to occur. Further, RMP Comp software was used to model off-site impacts as opposed to PHAST which was used in the previous plan.\n\n-Update 4: Minor updates in all other sections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
