(TransCanada) Eunice Loading Facility has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of facility's processes.  The TransCanada policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nTransCanada owns and operates the Eunice Loading Facility located in Evangeline Parish, Louisiana. The Eunice Loading Facility is a truck and railcar loading facility capable of loading propane, n-butane, isobutane and raw feed pipelined to the site.  The facility is capable of storing n-butane and raw feed in three pressurized bullets located on site.\n\nThe Eunice Loading Facility was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Based on process knowledge, TransCanada identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site.  Listed flammable substances which are stored above threshold quantities at the Eunice Loading Facility are n-butane and raw feed.  There are no listed toxic substances which exceed threshold quantity.  Based on worst-case analysis of flammables, the distances to the endpoints (i.e. an overpressure of 1 psi) do not exceed the distances to public receptors.  In addition, the Eunice Loading Facility has not had an accidental release in the past five years and emergency response procedures have been coordinated with community response orgainzations.  Therefore, the Eunice Loading Facility is classified as a Program 1 process "

      "SummaryText": "under the ARP program.\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nFlammable Substances - Worst-Case Scenario\n\nThe endpoint for worst-case release of flammable substances is 1 psi overpressure (i.e., 15.7 psia), resulting from a vapor cloud explosion. The ARP Program requirement for flammables assumes an instantaneous release and vapor cloud explosion.  A yield factor of 10 percent of the available energy released in the explosion shall be used to determine the distance to the explosion endpoint.  Since the worst-case release scenario for a flammable substance is based on the assumption that the entire quantity of the substance forms a vapor cloud, passive mitigation systems are not applicable.  n-Butane is the worst-case flammable release with a 0.47-mile distance to the endpoint.\n\nToxic Substances\n\nThe Eunice Loading Facility does not have any toxic substances held above the threshold quantity.  Therefore, analysis of a worst-case release scenario for toxic substances is not required.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PROGRAM\n\nBased on the criteria in 40 CFR 68.10, the distance to the specified endpoint for the worst-case accidental release scenario for the following processes is less than the distance to the nearest public receptor:  n-butane and raw feed.  Within the past five years, the processes have had no accidental releases that caused off-site impacts provided in the risk managment program rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1)).  No additional measures are necessary to prevent off-site impacts from accidental releases.  In the event of fire, explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the processes, entry within the distance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to public emergency responders.  Therefore, public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated in the Risk Management Plan.  The undersigned certifies that, to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, t"

Over the past 5 years there have been no accidental releases.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Eunice Loading Facility is coordinated with the Evangeline Parish, Louisiana, Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Eunice Loading Facility has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Eunice Loading Facility conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and the facility provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the plant."
