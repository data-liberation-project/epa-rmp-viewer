The company products are distributed throughout the United States. \n\nWhiteWave City of Industry-North Facility prepared a Chemical Risk Management Program and Process Safety Management Program (RMP/PSM) in general accordance with state and federal regulations. The state risk management regulations, also referred to as the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program, are codified in California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19, Section 2735.7, et. Seq.  The Federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also regulates facilities with certain toxic and flammable substances. The regulations are codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68. Finally, both the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Association (OSHA) and the California Occupational Safety and Health Association (calOSHA) regulate facilities with certain acutely hazardous materials under the PSM regulations, as defined in CCR Title 8, Section 5189 and CFR Title 29, Part 1910, Section 119, respectively.\n\nWhiteWave prepared the RMP/calARP/PSM to satisfy regulatory requirements and to demonstrate a commitment to evaluate and improve anhydrous ammonia handling systems and practices at the facility. WhiteWave Incorporated many state of the art safety features into the ammonia refrigeration system at the facility as part of the original system construction and subsequent system modifications. WhiteWave will continue to improve ammonia-handling safety through the implementation of the prevention program elements of the RMP/CalARP/PSM. In the unlikely event that a chemical release does occur at the facility, WhiteWave"

The surrounding area primarily consists of industrial and commercial businesses.\n\nOperations at the facility consist of the storage, processing, packaging, and distribution  of dairy products. The facility typically operates 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used in the refrigeration at the facility. The system provides cooling for production areas, product and water chilling. The desired temperatures are maintained by controlling the flow of ammonia with manually and electrically operated valves, float switches, and compressor controls.\n\nThe RPM/CalARP/PSM regulations require a review of the five-year accident history at a regulated facility. This facility is reported no accidental releases of ammonia within the past five years.\n\nThe RPM/CalARP/PSM regulations require a review of the accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps used by the facility. Many safety features have been incorporated into the ammonia refrigeration system to prevent system failures and to mitigate potential releases. The safety features include but not limited to the following:\n\n\u00c2?\u00c2\u00a0 Emergency shutdown systems.\n\u00c2?\u00c2\u00a0 Pressure relief valves on vessels and compressors.\n\u00c2?\u00c2\u00a0 Engine room is equipped with ammonia detection system and ventilation system.\n\u00c2?\u00c2\u00a0 Many of the ammonia pipes, valves, and components are labeled.\n\u00c2?\u00c2\u00a0 A fire sprinkler system is installed in the plant.\n\nIn addition to the physical features of the ammonia refrigeration system at the facility, WhiteWave has extensive administrative controls in place to maintain safe operations of the system. Administrative controls include, but are not limited to, training programs for system operators and mechanics, emergency training, a hot work per"

As such, this document, related attachments, and program elements will evolve as White Wave continues their ongoing focus and dedication of risk minimization and safety improvement for their employees and surrounding community. WhiteWave will submit revised information if a change occurs that is considered significant and requires resubmission under the regulations. However, minor improvements/modifications to the RMP/CalARP/PSM, related attachments, and program elements will be incorporated consistent with WhiteWave\u00c2?fs internal review practices, and WhiteWave will maintain the most current versions on site. Thus, the most current version of the  RMP/CalARP/PSM  Program and related documents and elements maintained on site may vary slightly from the information in submittals made to EPA and other regulatory agencies."
