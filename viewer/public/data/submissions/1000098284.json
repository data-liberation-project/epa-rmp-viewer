The Suffolk site sponsored the event and provided a professional facilitator for the exercise.  A team of exercise evaluator published an After-Action Report and provided it to the Suffolk Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) for follow-up actions to ensure the recommendations are addressed\nIn November 2018 Solenis (BASF) hosted a large-scale hazmat railcar exercise on November 9 involving over 100 participants from area hospitals, media, local industry, and local and regional hazmat teams.   COVID put an end to these type exercises but we are working with LEPC and Virginia HazMat to create another drill fall of 2023.\n\n\nEmergency Response\n\nThe site has a 67-member strong Emergency Response Team that is HAZWOPER certified, trained in Confined Space Entry Rescue, certified in First Aid and CPR, have EMT's, and a Fire Brigade. The team participates in training every quarter, some on-site and some off-site.  Training also includes regular drills to test the site's response capabilities. The results of these drills are communicated to all employees including evacuation plans for non-responders.  The site also owns and maintains a wide selection of emergency response equipment.  The site works jointly with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) including a myriad of Virginia's Emergency Response specialists including the hospital staff, HAZMAT teams, local fire and police, and many other experts in emergency response in the state.  The onsite training requirements are determined by the ERT management team and the training is performed by the ERT manager, outside agencies, and trained ERT members.

The committee sponsored two joint agency drills, one in June 2016 and second in November 2018. These drills were designed to ensure there is a good working relationship between the site and local emergency responders such as; Suffolk Fire and Rescue, Police, 911 dispatch, area EMT's and local Hospitals and the city's communication department. \n\nThe June 2016 drill tested the site's Alternative Release Scenario contained in this plan.

The American Chemistry Council (ACC) Responsible Care Management System (RCMS) is composed of six codes of management practice found in the ACC's Association's Responsible Care initiative.  Three of the codes are particularly relevant to this discussion which are, Process Safety (PS); Employee Health and Safety (H&S); and: Community Awareness and Emergency Response (CAER).\n \nProcess safety oversite is managed by the site's Process Safety Management (PSM) Committee, which is comprised of employees from each production area, engineering and maintenance, Senior Management as well as environmental, health and safety personnel.  The committee monitors PSM issues, hosts training activities and performs PSM audits.  \nOversite and management of the elements of Process Safety are the responsibility of site employees who have been designated as a Subject Matter Experts (SME). It is their responsibility to implement and manage the program. The site's SMEs review the status of their element annually and present these findings to the PSM committee through formally scheduled presentations.  These documented reviews consist of a comparison between the site's written health and safety program to regulatory requirements, and other identified best practices.  \n\nImprovement opportunities are typically suggested and entered into a formal electronic tracking databas"

Care should be taken when working with the product. XD1878 is used as a precursor for biocide. Refer to Standard Operating Procedure XD-05, raw materials for information about special product handling.\n\nThe XD plant uses a batch process that is controlled via a process control system. All charges and transfers are automated.\n\nThe process begins with a pre-charge amount of 5,000 lbs. of DMW from the previous batch. The reaction vessel is then inerted with nitrogen. Once inerted, DMW is added in a separate charge of 4,600 lbs. to reach the total water set point of 9,600 lbs. Ammonium Hydroxide is charged into the vessel in quantities as stated on the operator\u2019s recipe sheet. When 80% of the charged volume of ammonia is complete, and a starting temperature of 15\u00b0C is reached, carbon dioxide is charged into the vessel. The polymerization of XD1878 is an exothermic reaction and, as such, the temperature in the vessel is maintained at a set point 53\u00b0C by circulating the contents of the reactor through the heat exchanger until the reaction is complete. The product is then cooled down to less than 40\u00b0C and sodium hydroxide solution is charged into the vessel. A sample is taken to QC lab and, once approved, is then transferred to the storage tank (ST121 or ST119).\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Measures\n\nThe highest probability of a release of ammonia would occur during the unloading process, but the likelihood of a significant release is extremely remote based on the design, construction, operation associated with ammonia"

The plant utilizes acrylic chemistry to manufacture water soluble polymers for use in the water treatment, mining, and paper industries. There is also on-site warehouse that manages the site's distribution activities. The facility can receive raw materials in containers by rail or truck. Finished goods are packaged for shipment in various sized containers or delivered by truck or rail. \n\nThe site covers 225 acres on the west side of Wilroy Road, \u00bd mile north of the Wilroy Industrial Park and east of the Nansemond River. Of the 225 acres the production facility occupies 35 acres and the remainder is utilized for agriculture or undeveloped.\n\nRMP Chemicals on Site\n\nThere are several chemicals on site that are listed under the RMP rule: acrylonitrile, propane, acetylene, sulfur dioxide and ammonia hydroxide.  All but acrylonitrile and Ammonia hydroxide are stored at levels below the RMP threshold.  Acrylonitrile is used in the manufacture of acrylamide, the site's primary raw material.  \n\nProcess Description\n\nProduction of acrylamide monomer from acrylonitrile began in 1997 with a process called catalytic hydration.  This process was discontinued in September of 2013 and was replaced by a biocatalytic process in July 2014. The new operation is a batch process that operates under ambient pressure and temperatures. Acrylamide is produced by feeding acrylonitrile into a biocatalyst slurry until the batch concentration achieves 50% acrylamide and negligible AN \n\nAcrylonitrile is delivered to the site exclusively in rail cars designed to be off-loaded from the top into a closed system. The rails cars and the unloading apparatus were designed to meet NFPA 497A requirements for highly flammable m"
