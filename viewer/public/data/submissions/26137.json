These programs provide for the implementation of detailed prevention and response procedures when storing and handling hazardous chemicals.  The program objectives are to ensure worker and public safety as well as environmental protection.\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees that, Iowa Quality Meats is complying with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u00bfs Process Safety Management (PSM) Regulation, Title 29 Code of the Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, and the Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program Regulation (RMP), Title 40 Code of the Federal Regulation Part 68. These regulations deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and processing of hazardous chemicals. In this way we promote overall facility, employee, and public safety. These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fire, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall these programs are in place to prevent potential accidental injury, illness, death, and to avoid the potential for property and environmental damage.\n\nThese safety programs are applied to all activities involving hazardous chemicals including use, storage, handling, or the on-site movement of chemicals. Any group of vessels interconnected and separate vessels that are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.\n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices that govern processes, activities, and or pieces of equipment. These rules are detailed and revised as necessary.  All information is communic"

Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios have been developed for both items:\n\nAmmonia Scenarios:\n\nIn a worst case scenario, failure of the high pressure receiver containing 1,414 gallons of ammonia under worst case weather conditions [Wind Speed (meters/sec) 1.5, Stability Class F] would release approximately 7,776 pounds of ammonia (Liquid Spill and Vaporization) over a 10 minute period and travel up to .5 miles  before no longer posing a significant hazard to the public.  However this scenario is highly unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n\u00b7\tWorst case weather conditions are uncommon...\n\u00b7\tThe vessel is in a protected area clear of vehicular and pedestrian traffic...\n\u00b7\tIndustry standards for construction and quality control of pressure vessels...\n\u00b7\tSafety relief valves preventing over-pressurization of the vessel ...\n\u00b7\tAccident prevention programs in place  ...\n\u00b7\tMechanical integrity programs in place ...\n\u00b7\tEmergency alerting alarms integrated into the process system  ...\n\u00b7\tEmergency response and action plans in place at the facility...\n \nIn an alternative release scenario under worst case weather conditions (Wind Speed (meters/sec) 3, Stability Class D), a 3/8\u00bf equalizing line hit or ruptured on the High Side Trap could release 1,050 pounds of ammonia (Liquid Spill and Vaporization) over a 45-minute period before no longer posing a significant threat or hazard. The vapor could travel as far as .1 miles.  This alternative release scenario was chosen because of its more probable likelihood that it could occur.  This scenario even though potentially possible is unlikely because:\n\n\u00b7\tEmergency shutdown procedures are in place   ...\n\u00b7\tInspection and rounds made daily"
