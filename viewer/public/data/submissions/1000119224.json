Anhydrous ammonia is subject to EPA regulation under 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Risk Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.  Steven Roberts Original Desserts facility has never experienced a release of ammonia involving consequences that affected residents or the environment.\r\n\r\nPursuant to PSM regulations (40 CFR 68) and the Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations, Steven Roberts Original Desserts assumed control of the PSM program.  The program developed is a comprehensive written PSM program to protect employees and the surrounding community from exposure to the hazardous chemicals onsite. The facility completed a process hazards analysis (PHA) for ammonia using the industry standard What-If/Checklist Analysis developed by the International Institute of ammonia refrigeration (IIAR). The PHA was completed using technical and operations staff from the facility as well as experienced facilitators. \r\n\r\nThe PSM program includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce employee and community exposure to accidental releases of ammonia. The plans include preventative maintenance programs (mechanical integrity) for the ammonia system, and a program for both pre-startup safety reviews and management of changes (MOC) to the system. The program also includes specific requirements for safe work practices (such as safe approaches to welding and similar hot work) and safety requirements for contractors who may be hired to work on the system. \r\n\r\nAs part of the RMP requirements, the management completed a review of the potential offsite consequences of the accidental release of the largest vessel in the system.  Although such a release is highly unlikely, the regulation requires this review.  \r\n\r\nSteven Roberts Original Desserts is committed to minimizing accidental"
