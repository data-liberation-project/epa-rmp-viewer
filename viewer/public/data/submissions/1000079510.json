The Company endeavors to execute this policy through the daily implementation of its Safety Programs. Company safety programs include but are not limited to EPA's and California's Level 3 Prevention Program and Cal/OSHA's Process Safety Management Program (PSM), which are practically identical but with nuanced differences. Together these are a comprehensive and integrated approach to the safe operation of processes using Regulated Substances and form the Program Level III Prevention Program component of the RMP. The DCC~CDS Prevention Program is specifically designed and intended to prevent accidental releases, and to deal safely with emergencies if and when they do happen. It is the primary goal of DCC~CDS to protect its employees, visitors and neighbors from harm due to Company operations. With this in mind, the priorities of protection of life, the environment, and then property have been established.\r\n\r\nThe Company also recognizes the need to be prepared to respond safely to accidental releases that could occur should established prevention programs fail. The Company has adopted a Non-responding facility policy and has established an Emergency Action Plan within its California Haz"

WPS employs ammonia technicians trained beyond 1910.120(q) Awareness level. These technicians would be notified to provide technical support in the event of an emergency.    \r\n\r\n1.2 General Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe facility is a refrigeration plant located in Salinas, CA. and was constructed in the early 1980's.  In February of 1999, DCC~CDS became the owner and tenant.  The facility provides pre-cooling refrigeration effect for the removal of field heat from freshly harvested vegetables, and subsequent short-term refrigerated storage, and is operated seasonally.  Product harvest period pick up in the month of April and finish in November.  Operational maintenance is performed year-round.  Scheduled maintenance is performed in the remaining winter months.  Other commercial neighbors are located on the same site.\r\n\r\nThe Regulated Substance in use is anhydrous ammonia (NH3).  Refrigeration equipment consists of Refrigeration Trailers (Compression Units), Evaporative Condensers, Pressure Vessels, HydroVac&trade; Vacuum Tubes, Pressure Cooling Equipment, Cold Storage Room Evaporators and associated valves, instrumentation and piping.  The vacuum tubes are used to pre-cool agricultural product; the refrigerated storage portion of the facility is used for pressure cooling and short-term product storage.  Evaporators in the storage section of the facility maintain temperature until product is sold and shipped.  The refrigeration system is configured in a closed-loop system with isolation and overpressure relief valves installed i"

Portable refrigeration equipment is common in the industry.\r\n\r\n1.3 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nA comprehensive Prevention Program has been established as described in Section 1.1.  The Program is specifically intended to promote the safe operation of ammonia-handling equipment and process, prevent accidental releases and respond safely to any emergencies that could occur.  DCC~CDS strives to make the Prevention Program elements an integral part of daily Plant operation.  \r\n\r\nDCC~CDS has delegated maintenance of its ammonia refrigeration equipment to WPS.  WPS is a reputable state-wide provider of ammonia refrigeration equipment and services; and has developed comprehensive written procedures for the maintenance of ammonia-handling equipment, including the steps to be taken in the event of a release or threatened release.  Written procedures include necessary safety precautions, from seasonal installation and start-up to tear-down and removal of portable equipment.  As equipment inspection or maintenance needs are determined, the need is expressed at workload meetings conducted by the WPS Area Manager.  Specific repair tasks or upgrade for the expressed need is collaboratively decided by the DCC~CDS and WPS Area Manager and entered into the Service Call system. Tasks are then tracked through the system.  Through this regular routine of inspect, discuss, assign and confirmation of completion, DCC~CDS and WPS have reduced equipment operational problems and also reduced release potential.\r\n\r\nWPS actively encourages its ammonia Technicians to seek Certification through the Refrigeratin"

Improvements include, but are not limited to:  \r\n\r\n - Special self-closing valves are installed as a permissive for oil drain flow\r\n - Seismic improvements\r\n - Ammonia/water diffusion system\r\n - Ammonia sensors and alarms\r\n - Equipment upgrades\r\n - General facility appearance and upkeep\r\n - A vigorous Food Safety Program has been instituted\r\n\r\nOther release prevention steps taken at Dandy Cooling Company~Cross Dock Services:\r\n\r\n - DCC~CDS has enclosed the facility with fencing and gates to limit access to the facility to increase the security of the facility from potential wrong-do-ers.\r\n - Employees are trained for hazard communication (discovery and communicating) for releases, fires, vandals etc.  Training is documented.\r\n - A strong relationship exists with the Monterey County Health Department (CUPA).  Over the years DCC~CDS has worked closely with the CUPA in the planning and execution of refrigeration system improvements.  A \r\n - CUPA representative was invited to and participated in the most recent Process Hazard Analysis.\r\n - DCC~CDS and WPS are long-term sponsors of the Salinas Valley Ammonia Safety Day.
