Fume Releases\na. In case of a fume release, the first thing that must be done is to identify the source of the fume release.  This must be done under strict directions of the supervisor.  If the Supervisor is not present call either Mike Bocksnick at (832)723-8639, or Erik Pitoniak at (281)839-0861.  If you cannot reach any of these people, hit the Emergency Methanol Shutdown button on the control board and call 911.  Go to step d.\nb. Shut off all air conditioning in the control room and all offices.  No one will leave the control room before there is authorization from the supervisor.\nc. Push the fume release button in the red box outside of the office if there is a major release of fumes.  Notify DuPont via the Yellow phone if there is a minor release.\nd. If there is a small containable fume release, the Supervisor will put on the proper breathing apparatus and identify the source of the leak.  If it can be contained do so quickly.  If it cannot be contained operations will go through a controlled plant shutdown and the leak will be fixed before resuming normal operations.\ne. Evacuate all operations and personnel to either checkpoint 1 (east automatic gate) or checkpoint 2 (west gate) depending on which way the wind direction sock on Prax Airs cooling tower is blowing.  Always move downward and crossway from the direction of the sock.\nf. Take role call.  Make sure all company personnel and contractors are accounted for.\ng. The supervisor will direct the Fire Department to the location and show the SDSs on perceived items in which fumes are being released.  \nh.

Fire Response\na. In case of a fire, the first response is to activate the Emergency Methanol Shutdown button on the control panel.  This will shut the control valve on the Methanol supply line.\nb. Push the button in the Red Fire Box outside of the office.\nc. If it is a small containable fire use fire extinguisher to put out the fire.  Extinguisher spray must be aimed at the base of the fire.  If it is larger than what can be put out by an extinguisher call 911 for the La Porte Fire Department.\nd. The fire monitor will be started if there is reason to believe that the fire can be suppressed with the fire water system.\ne.

The RMP incident investigation results are required to be reviewed with all affected personnel whose job tasks are relevant to the incident findings including contract employees where applicable.\n\nRMP Compliance Audit\nAn RMP Compliance audit is required to be conducted every three years, with the RMP Compliance audit team's findings developed in a report. The RMP compliance audit report is required to be reviewed to promptly determine and document resolution of the audit team's findings. The two most recent RMP compliance audit reports are required to be retained.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nForemark complies with the OSHA Process Safety Management for highly hazardous chemicals standards. The facility has programs in place to ensure proper operation and maintenance of process systems. All operators are properly trained and are knowledgeable in the safe operation of the system. The equipment and piping at this facility has been designed and constructed using good engineering practices and to conform to industry standards. \n\nRMP FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nNo RMP-reportable accidents have occurred at the Foremark facility within the past five years. \n\nEMERGENCY PLANNING AND RESPONSE\nA basic emergency control function is initiating, maintaining, and controlling the communication process.  Communication provides the connection between the Control room and Supervisor in charge with other plant personnel, the community, police & fire department, HAZMAT, and mutual aid.\nCommunication problems are the most common operational breakdown during emergency operations, affecting the plants ability to start, coordinate, and complete effective operations.  Decision-making, assignments, coordination, revision, and the control of overall strategy and management of the action plant hinge on good communications.\n\nCOMMUNICATION DESCRIPTION\n1.

Work practices are underway to ensure ongoing inspection and testing (and resolution of inspection results, as applicable) of various types of process equipment.  Also, quality assurance practices are used, as applicable, to verify their suitability for the process application for which they are used.\n\nSafe Work Practices and Work Permits\nA variety of safe work practices are in place that apply to employees and contractors, as applicable. Examples include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) control of entry into a stationary source site by maintenance, contractor, laboratory or other support personnel; (2) equipment lockout/tagout; (3) opening process equipment or piping; (4) the issuance of hot work permits; and (5) the issuance of entry permits for entry into confined spaces, as applicable.\n\nManagement of Change\nThe management of change procedure is designed to manage various types of changes to process chemicals, process technology, equipment, and procedures and changes to stationary sources that affect a covered process. The procedure is designed to confirm review of the technical basis of the proposed change, the impact of the change on process related safety and health, modifications to operating procedures, the necessary time period for the change, and authorization requirements for the proposed change. The procedure includes a step for informing and training employees involved in operating the process and maintenance and contractor employees whose job tasks will be affected by a change in the process.\n\nIncident Investigation\nIncident investigation procedures are in place for the investigation of RMP incidents that resulted in, or could have reasonably resulted in an RMP incident involving fire, explosion, significant toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury affecting site personnel or the community.

Operating procedures are available to all employees who work in or maintain a process, and the operating procedures are required to be reviewed and certified annually as current and accurate.\n\nOperator Training \nThe operator training program requires operators to complete operator training, including refresher training every three years. New operating employees receive classroom training on basic operating principles and the operating procedures of their assigned process unit. The operator training includes information related to unit specific safety and health hazards, and emergency operating conditions, including shutdown. Operators must complete written and oral tests, as well as field demonstration of skills as part of the qualification training. Operator training is required to be documented.\n\nContractors\nThe contractor safety program includes a contractor selection process and a contract coordinator. The contractor selection process is based on a variety of data, such as contractor provided contractor safety programs and contractor performance information. Contractor safety performance is also part of the weekly safety statistics.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\nA PSSR procedure is in place and requires a PSSR be conducted for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information. In addition, major projects and maintenance turnarounds require a PSSR to be completed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nMechanical integrity procedures related to maintaining the integrity of pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, process controls, pum"
