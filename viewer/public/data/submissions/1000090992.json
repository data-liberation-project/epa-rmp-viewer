Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is performed. The Burley XPS Site has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\nThe emergency response program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Emergency response plans are reviewed with the Burley Fire Department, in the event the need for external services occurs. \r\nThe Burley XPS Site has a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, and government agencies as required, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  The plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\r\nTo ensure proper functioning, quarterly emergency drills are conducted to enhance skills and tactics for responding to emergency situations, which can include chemical spills and releases.  Critiques are held on drills and actual events."

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and are trained to deal with the modification.\r\nPre-startup Reviews - Pre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at the Burley Site. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\r\nCompliance Audits - Self assessments and audits are conducted on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  Audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\r\nIncident Investigation - The Burley XPS Site promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a significant release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\r\nEmployee Participation - The Burley XPS Site believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.
