      "SummaryText": "Introduction\n\nEliokem Inc. has a chemical plant in Akron, Ohio, which is known as the Akron Plant.  The Akron Plant has been successfully manufacturing latex via polymerization since the 1940\u00bfs.  Our primary products include wet latex and resins.  Eliokem Inc. uses substances that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), we have developed  a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  Risk Management Plans are required when a Toxic or Flammable chemical is stored above the EPA threshold.  Under RMP, Eliokem Inc. created a scenario to estimate the potential impact on its community in the unlikely event of an accidental chemical release.  Eliokem, Inc. borders a recreational area. This is Joy Park located on Kelly Avenue. The distance to the park is greater then any of the estimated affected release areas.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\n\nEliokem Inc.\u00bfs  Akron Plant is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas and processes at our plant such as, design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.   Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with the Akron Fire Department.\n\nEliokem Inc. is committed to the princples of Responsible Care and the continuous improvement of safety, health, environmental and security performance.  We have successfully implemented a Responsible Care Management System to assist our implementation and management of safety, health, environmental and security performance goals.\n\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Akron Plant has 2 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances are 1,3-Butadiene and Acrylonitrile.  Both substances are used as raw materials for our latex product and r"

A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The Akron Plant is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.  The following briefly describes the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source. \n\nProcess Safety Information\nEliokem Inc.\u00bfs the Akron Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment design associated with all processes.  \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is HAZOP.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular time period.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis, are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purpose of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, the Akron Plant maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nThe Akron Plant has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMecha"

Process equipment examined by these checks include among others, pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, control and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at the Akron Plant to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in the process are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the change.\n\nPre Startup Reviews\nPre Startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in present processes are conducted as a regular practice.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into service.\n\nCompliance Audits\nThe Akron Plant conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the previsions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nThe Akron Plant promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from re-occurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nOur facility truly believes that pro"

In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility\u00bfs implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\nContractors \nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  The Akron Plant has a strict policy informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor\u00bfs work.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response.  \n\nFive year Accident History\n\nEliokem Inc.\u00bfs the Akron Plant has not had any releases or accidents meeting the Risk Management Plan definition in the last five years.\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nThe Akron Plant carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notifications of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post incident duties.\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes.\nSummit County LEPC is the Local Emergency Planning Committee with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.  \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.
