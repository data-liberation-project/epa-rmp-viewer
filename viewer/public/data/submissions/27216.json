      "SummaryText": "Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws.  If an emergency related to the ammonia storage system were to occur, it is our policy to initiate our on-site emergency response program.\n\nDescription of facility and regulated substances handled:  This facility manufactures silicon carbide wafersand semiconductor devices for the microelectronic and other industries.  Ammonia is used in the amnufacturing process.  Ammonia is stored in two 20,000-pound tanks.\n\nWorst-case release scenario:  The worst-case release scenario is the failure of one 20,000-pound tank resulting in a vapor cloud.  Using RMPCompTM, the distance to the toxic endpoint is 2.63 miles.  Off-site public receptors include a residential population of approximately 5288, and commercial, retail, and light industrial facilities within the Research Triangle Park and the City of Durham.\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:  This facility complies with EPA's accidental prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The facility has developed and implemented the requirements for a OSHA PSM Plan for the facility.\n\nFive-year accident history:  We have never had an accident involving ammonia that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\nEmergency response program:  In the event of an emergency involving our ammonia storage system, it is our policy to impliment our emergency response program.  We have discussed this policy with the fire department and other pertinent officials.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety: This system is new construction, the PHA was performed in order to design a safer system.  Currently, no changes are planned."
