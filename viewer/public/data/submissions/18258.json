It is the policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Allamakee County LEPC and Waukon Fire Department and resopnd to the emergency.\nThe worst-case scenario. \nOur worst-case scenario is failure of one storage tank when filled to  the to the legal capacity, resulting in a vapor cloud floating over the ground until it disperses. According to EPA's RMP Comp tables, the distance to endpoint is 6.9 miles. The total population would be 3352 people involved with a release with businesses, industry,  a school, and parks included in the affected area. \nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specfic prevention steps. \nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed and maintained according to OSHA, federal, state, and local regulations. \nFive-year accident history.\nThe United Cooperative Association has not had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place. \nThe emergency response program. \nIn the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous ammonia storage and transfer system, it is our policy to notify the Waukon Fire Department and the Allamakee LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency. We have discussed this policy with the fire department and local LEPC as to the handling of a leak of anhydrous ammonia and actions to be taken."
