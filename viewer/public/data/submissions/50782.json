This program continues Charlotte-Mecklenburg Utilities' commitment to the protection of its employees and the surrounding community and the control of the potential for such a release.\n\n\nThe Vest WTP currently uses chlorine (delivered in one ton cylinders) as a disinfection agent to meet Safe Drinking Water Act requirements.  As a portion of the RMP/PSM program, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Utilities has developed the following accidental release prevention and emergency response policies for the use of chlorine as a disinfectant:\n\n\n1)  Protection of public health and our employees is Charlotte-Mecklenburg Utilities' highest priority.\n2)  Preventing the release of extremely hazardous substances is a key element of that protection.\n3)  Every appropriate step will be taken to prevent these releases, including management commitment to:\n     A..  Make all important information readily available.\n     B.  Routinely define training to employees.\n     C.  Clearly define roles and responsibilites.\n4)  Fulfilling his or her roll in prevention of these releases is a condition of employment for every employee.\n\n\nIn order to reduce the likelihood of a potential release, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Utilities has incorporated the following general accidental release prevention program and chlorine-specific prevention steps:\n\n1)  Charlotte-Mecklenburg Utilities plant staff shall conduct routine preventative maintenance of key process components.\n2)  Charlotte-Mecklenburg Utilities employees shall conduct all work according to any applicable Lockout/Tagout procedures.\n3)  Charlotte-Mecklenburg Utilities employees shall conduct all work according to any applicable Hot Work Permits.\n4) Charlotte-Mecklenburg Utilities maintains a routine In"
