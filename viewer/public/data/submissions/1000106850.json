(JX NCTI) is committed to operating and maintaining all of its processes (especially those using hazardous substances) in a safe and responsible manner. NCTI uses a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of its employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that NCTI has designed and implemented, including:\n-\tA description of our facility and the storage and transfer of substances regulated by EPA RMP. An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n-\tA five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP\n-\tAn overview of the emergency response program\n-\t An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting employees, the public, or the environment.\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\nNCTI is a chemical manufacturing facility located in Harris County, Texas. The plant consists of reactors, distillation columns, storage tanks and shipping and receiving facilities for bulk tank trucks as well as rail cars. NCTI primarily manufactures chemicals used in the carbonless copy paper, electrical capacitors, heat transfer fluids, and EPDM rubber industries. Some by-products are produced and are sold as fuels and solvents.\n\nThe majority of the chemicals handled at NCTI are non-hazardous. However, NCTI does"

NCTI's management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including: \n\nProcess Safety Information [40 CFR Part 68.65]\nNCTI maintains records  of process safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis [40 CFR Part 68.67]\nComprehensive analyses ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What-if/Checklist and HAZOP. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at least every 5 years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nWritten Operating Procedures [40 CFR Part 68.69]\nTo ensure safe operations, NCTI maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations and normal shutdown. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nEmployee Training [40 CFR Part 68.71]\nNCTI has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating"

Inspected process equipment include pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, pressure relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change [MOC] [40 CFR Part 68.75]\nWritten procedures are in place at NCTI to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures. Facility operators or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification(s).\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review [PSSR] [40 CFR Part 68.77]\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and modifications to existing processes are conducted routinely at NCTI. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits [40 CFR Part 68.79]\nNCTI conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the US EPA RMP and OSHA PSM regulations are being implemented. These audits are conducted at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation [40 CFR Part 68.81]\nNCTI investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.

Employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, NCTI employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP and PSM rules, including information resulting from Process Hazard Analyses in particular.\n\nHot Work Permit [40 CFR Part 68.85]\nNCTI has a hot work permit that requires issuance of a permit for hot work operations conducted on or near the covered process. \n\nContractor Safety Program [40 CFR Part 68.87] \nNCTI occasionally hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities. Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the contractor's safety performance is carried out. NCTI has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards associated with the contractor's work and the corresponding processes. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response in the event of an accidental release of a regulated substance .\n\nThe five-year accident history [40 CFR 68.155(d)]:\nNCTI maintains records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at its facility. There have been no RMP accidents in the past five years.\nThe emergency response program [40 CFR 68.155(e)]:\nNCTI maintains an emergency response and contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.
