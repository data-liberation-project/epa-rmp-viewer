Since the worst-case ammonia release would involve liquid and would come from a pressurized system containing liquid, the released gas should be classified as a dense gas (a result of evaporative cooling).  The ammonia refrigeration document provides calculated endpoint distances for typical meteorological conditions.\r\nThe worst-case release scenario for an anhydrous ammonia release included a release of all the contents of the high-pressure receiver and thermosyphon in a 10-minute period (per EPA guidelines).  This release translates to a release of 33,917 pounds of ammonia in 10 minutes or 3,391.7 lbs/min.  Other assumptions included in the worst-case assessment are: the ammonia is a liquefied gas; the high-pressure receiver and thermosyphon are not diked; the release does not take place indoors; the nearfield dispersion environment is characterized as rural; 10-minute averaging period; the wind speed is 1.5 meters/sec and the atmospheric stability is classified as F (stable).  The results of the worst-case assessment for ammonia show that the plume must travel 3.31 miles (5.30 kilometers) before dispersing to the endpoint concentration of 201 ppm.\r\nThe selected alternative-release scenario for the ammonia systems is a release from a relief valve due to overpressure of a compressor unit.  The largest relief valve in the system was used in this scenario.  The largest relief valve has a relief rate of 489 pounds of air per minute.  As a matter of convention, the specified release rate of any relief valve is always in pounds of air per minute.  The release rate of 489 pounds of air per minute correlates to a release rate of 347 pounds of ammonia vapor per minute.  This release rate was applied to a release from the relief valve on top of the high-pressure receiver.\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration document provides calculated endpoint distances for typical meteorological conditions (3 m/s wind speed, D atmo"

The distance to the endpoint is affected by several factors including molecular weight, volatility, heat of combustion, and physical setting (urban or rural).\r\nThe alternative release scenario must be one that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario and that reaches an endpoint offsite, unless no such scenario exists.  The alternative release scenario is also evaluated to define the distance to the specified endpoint.\r\nUnder 40 CFR 68 Subpart B \u00a768.22(e), the RMP rule identifies surface roughness as a parameter to be used in the hazard assessment to determine the physical setting of the site, urban or rural.  Urban means there are many obstacles in the immediate area; obstacles include buildings or trees.  Rural means there are no buildings in the immediate area and the terrain is generally flat and unobstructed.\r\nDue to the limited presence of trees, hills, and/or other structures in the immediate vicinity of the Amarillo, Texas facility, a rural dispersion environment was assumed.\r\nThe Amarillo, Texas facility has three separate ammonia refrigeration systems: the Processing, Slaughter, and Freezer ammonia refrigeration systems.  The largest ammonia system is in the Slaughter refrigeration system.  The worst-case release area for the Slaughter system would contain the area impacted by the worst-case release for the Processing and Freezer ammonia systems.

(IBP) Amarillo, Texas facility management to implement the requirements of this Risk Management Program (RMP) in accordance with the USEPA regulations under 40 CFR Part 68 and with the corresponding regulations under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material and if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to IBP employees, the public and the environment.  This objective will be accomplished by utilizing general good operating procedures, providing appropriate training to all employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary, with the local emergency response providers. This plan covers all IBP owned activities at this facility.\r\nIBP's management is committed to providing the resources necessary to implement this policy.\r\nFacility Description\r\nIBP operates a cattle slaughter and processing facility and a hides tannery at this location.  Cattle are trucked to the facility, slaughtered and fabricated.  IBP operates rendering systems to produce gel bone, dried blood, high and low protein beef byproducts, tallow, and other rendering products.  Support operations include a wastewater treatment system, truck repair facilities, cold storage, an analytical laboratory, and administrative offices.\r\nTwo chemicals are utilized at the facility in sufficient quantities to be subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.  These chemicals are ammonia and propane.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant in systems located throughout the facility.  Propane is used as a backup fuel supply.\r\nWorst-Case and Alternative-Release Scenarios\r\nRMP regulations require that each facility identify worst-case and alternative case release scenarios.  EPA has defined a worst-case release as the release of the entire contents of the largest vessel that contains a regulated substance"

Based on the release rate of 346.8 lbs/min, the duration for a 500-pound release is 1.4 minutes.  Other assumptions include that no active or passive mitigation measures are currently in place and a rural dispersion environment in the nearfield.  The results of the alternative-release scenario for an ammonia release indicates that the endpoint concentration of 201 ppm is reached at 0.50 mile (843 meters) from the release point.\r\nPropane\r\nThe worst-case release scenario for propane is defined as a release of all the contents the propane storage tank (126,900 pounds).  For the worst-case release of propane, the release rate is not considered.  The total quantity of the propane is assumed to form a vapor cloud.  The entire contents of the cloud is assumed to be within the flammability limits, and the cloud is assumed to explode.  For the worst-case analysis, 10% of the flammable vapor in the cloud is assumed to participate in the explosion (i.e., the yield factor is 0.10).  Consequence algorithms were used to determine the endpoint at an overpressure level of one pound per square inch (psi).  Other assumptions for the worst-case propane analysis include that the propane is a flammable gas; the storage vessel is not diked; no passive mitigation system is in place; the nearfield dispersion environment is characterized as rural; the wind speed is 1.5 meters/sec and the atmospheric stability is classified as F (stable).  The results of the worst-case assessment for propane show that the 1-psi overpressure endpoint occurs at a distance of 0.41 miles (654 meters) from the release point.\r\nThe selected alternative-release scenario for the propane system is a release resulting from a corrosion related hole in the propane vapor line.
