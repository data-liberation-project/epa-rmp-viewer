This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, Exxon BRPO trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nExxonMobil BRPO operates a high density polyethylene production facility in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.  The primary operation of the facility is the production of HDPE at a rate of up to 1.8 billion pounds per year.  Ethylene and comonomers are metered into a recirculating loop reactor.  Polyethylene is produced in small particles and is recirculated as a slurry in the isobutane.  Isobutane, as well as small amount of unreacted ethylene and comonomers, are recovered and recycled back to the reactor.  Polyethylene product is dried and sold as a powder or pellet. ExxonMobil BRPO is permitted to operate a polyproylene unit.  This unit will use processes similar to the existing polyethylene facility. This process will however use propylene as the raw material.  The unit is scheduled to begin operation in early May 2000.   Fuels used at the plant include natural gas, gasoline, and diesel.\n\nExxonMobil BRPO was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Based on process knowledge, ExxonMobil BRPO identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site.  \n\nListed flammable substances which are stored above threshold quantities at ExxonMobil BRPO are isobutane, ethylene/isobutane mixture, hydrogen,"

In addition, ExxonMobil BRPO is subject to OSHA PSM.  Therefore, ExxonMobil BRPO is classified as a Program 3 process under the ARP Program.\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nFlammable Substances - Worst-Case Scenario\n\nThe endpoint for the worst-case release of flammable substances is 1 psi overpressure (i.e., 15.7 psia), resulting from a vapor cloud explosion.  The ARP Program requirement for flammables assumes an instantaneous release and vapor cloud explosion.  A yield factor of 10 percent of the available energy released in the explosion shall be used to determine the distance to the explosion endpoint.  Since the worst-case scenario for a flammable substance is based on the assumption that the entire quantity of the substance forms a vapor cloud, passive mitigation systems are not applicable.  Propylene/propane mixture is the worst-case flammable release with a 0.43-mile distance to the endpoint. \n\nToxic Substances\n\nExxonMobil BRPO does not have any toxic substances held above the threshold quantity; therefore, analysis of one worst-case release scenario for all regulated toxic substances is not required.\n\nFlammable Substances - Alternative-Case Scenario\n\nA single alternative release scenario for all flammable substances is required under the ARP Program.  A hypothetical, but likely to occur, release scenario has been identified for isobutane.  A 2-inch opening at the \"F\" reactor results in a release of 5,917 lbs of isobutane.  The isobutane will vaporize and may ignite in a vapor cloud explosion with an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.  The alternative-case release of isobutane resulted in a 0.15 mile distance to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint.\n\nToxic Substances\n\nExxonMobil BRPO does not have any toxic substances held above the threshold quantity.

Because processes at the plant that are regulated by the EPA's risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the OSHA's PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe ExxonMobil BRPO facility encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation include updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of an incident investigation team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the plant's accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the facility and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the facility has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe ExxonMobil BRPO facility keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within ExxonMobil BRPO are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  A table summarizing the reference documents and"

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, ExxonMobil BRPO has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature level, composition).  ExxonMobil BRPO ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nExxonMobil BRPO also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe ExxonMobil BRPO facility has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure the adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe ExxonMobil BRPO facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.

This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe ExxonMobil BRPO facility maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.

This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, The ExxonMobil BRPO facility has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive job specific basic training in Exxon BRPO operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a qualified operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they are qualified and can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe ExxonMobil BRPO facility uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, Exxon BRPO has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emerge"

In addition, The ExxonMobil BRPO facility evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  ExxonMobil BRPO personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe ExxonMobil BRPO facility conducts a PSSR for any facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe ExxonMobil BRPO facility has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include:  (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.

Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The ExxonMobil BRPO plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe ExxonMobil BRPO facility has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.
