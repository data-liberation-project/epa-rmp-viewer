If an emergency were to occur, it is facility policy to contact the Bethlehem Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nThe facility is a water treatment/filtration plant.  The one ton chlorine containers are used in the process of water treatment.\n\nThe worst case release scenario at the facility is failure of a chlorine storage cylinder when filled to its maximum capacity, resulting in a release of chlorine over a ten minute period.  According to the EPA's look-up tables, the distance to the endpoint is 1.3 miles.  Based on 1990 census data, There is a total population of 811 people within the distance to the endpoint.  \n\nThe facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  \n\nThe facility has not had an incident involving chlorine which caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place in the past five years.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the on-site chlorine system, it is the policy of the Feura Bush Filtration Plant to notify the Bethlehem Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency."
