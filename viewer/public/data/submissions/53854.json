Cherry Growers, Inc has been in\noperation at this facility for 34 years providing quality\nfrozen products and over 170 jobs to the local community.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nCherry Growers, Inc is committed to protecting the health of\nits employees, the surrounding community, and the\nenvironment.  It is Cherry Growers, Inc policy to maintain a\nsafe and healthy workplace protect the environment, and\ncomply with all applicable regulations, including 40 CFR\nand, as applicable, Occupational Safety and Health\nOrganization (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM)\nregulations promulgated as Title 29 of the Code of Federal\nRegulations, Chapter 1910, Section 119 (29 CFR), and OSHA's\nHazardous Operations and Emergency Response regulations (29\nCFR).\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nCherry Growers, Inc operates freezers and coolers for\nproduct and ingredient storage.  Cherry Growers Inc uses\nanhydrous ammonia (the 112? regulated substance) as a\nrefrigerant to maintain the 274,300 ft2 facility within the\nrequired range of operation temperatures and to operate the\nfreezers and coolers.

The worst-case release\nscenario is defined as the release of the entire contents of\nthe largest single vessel over a 10-minute period.  Based on\nCherry Growers, Inc refrigeration system, the worst case\nrelease scenario for anhydrous ammonia is defined as the\nrelease of the entire contents of the largest single vessel\n(a receiver) containing 10,000 pounds of ammonia when filled\nto 90% capacity, the maximum fill capacity allowed by Cherry\nGrowers, Inc operating and engineering controls.  Using the\nEPA's RMP comp program the maximum distance to the specified\n\"endpoint\" (a conservative distance established by EPA at\nwhich it is expected that a person could be exposed to the\nchemical for an hour without suffering irreversible health\neffects) includes offsite receptors.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario was developed following EPA\nregulations and is not considered by Cherry Growers, Inc to\nbe a likely release scenario for the facility.  During\nnormal operations, Cherry Growers, Inc maintains the\nreceivers have the potential to be filled to 90% of\ncapacity.  The receivers are operated in pump-down mode 1%\nof the time during the year.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nA more realistic release scenario (alternative release) was\ndeveloped by Cherry Growers, Inc taking into consideration\nthe 34 year history of operation's experience and the\nhazards identified in the process hazard analyses (PHA's)\nconducted to ensure that Cherry Growers, Inc hazards are\nidentified and minimized.
