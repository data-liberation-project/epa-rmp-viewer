Danisco operates a food additive manufacturing and processing facility in New Century, Kansas.  The New Century facility distills monoglycerides for use in food products.  On site, Danisco has an ammonia refrigeration system which contains anhydrous ammonia, a regulated hazardous substance, for the refrigeration of various food products made at the facility.  The maximum intended inventory of ammonia on site is above the threshold quantity listed in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) ?68.130.\n\n\n\nSince the quantity of ammonia exceeds the threshold quantity, Danisco is required to implement a Risk Management Program (RMP) at the New Century facility which includes three (3) major elements:  hazard assessment, prevention program, and emergency response program.  The submission of the RMPlan presents the details of the RMP compliance measures conducted by Danisco.  The required RMP information was electronically submitted to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) in a timely manner before the deadline of June 21, 1999, and was resubmitted every 5 years.\n\n\n\nDanisco is also subject to OSHAs Process Safety Management Program (PSM).  Based on the information presented in this report, Danisco is subject to Program Level 3 requirements of the RMP regulation.\n\n\n\n1.1    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nDanisco attaches importance to creating and sustaining long-term environmental solutions based on a general environmental policy:\n\n\n\n- Danisco respects the fact that development, production, and trade influence the environment.\n\n- Danisco invests in developing environmentally friendly products and processes by using cleaner technology.\n\n- Danisco will, by making regular technical improvements and providing training an"

Our prevention and emergency response practices are developed to protect the safety and health of the public as well as our own employees.  It is our policy to comply with applicable laws, and to support and work with local emergency response agencies.\n\n1.2    Description of Danisco and the Regulated Substance Handled\n\nDanisco operates a food ingredient manufacturing and processing facility in New Century, Kansas.  The New Century facility produces distilled monoglycerides for use in food products.  The ammonia refrigeration system provides the necessary cooling for the processing of the product.  In addition, the ammonia refrigeration system is utilized to provide cooling for the plant itself. \n\n\n\n1.3    Worst Case Scenario\n\nSection 68.25 of the RMP Regulation defines a worst-case scenario as a release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to a specified endpoint. \n\n\n\nAt Danisco, the worst-case scenario is identified to be the release of the largest vessel containing ammonia.  The largest tank is assumed to instantaneously release the entire contents in a worst-case accidental release scenario.  The ammonia will release into an enclosed building and will then volatilize into the atmosphere.  Modeling of this release was performed using the EPAs dispersion modeling software RMP*Comp and shows that the toxic endpoint will reach an impact distance. This release would affect residential populations and industrial areas. \n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario is based on a 1/4 hole in the process piping.  This failure will conservatively assume that ammonia will release. As stated in Section 1.6 of this document, Danisco is "

Modeling of this release was performed using the EPAs dispersion modeling software RMP*Comp and shows that the toxic endpoint will reach an impact.  This release would also affect industrial areas.  \n\n\n\n1.4    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nDanisco has specific process controls in-place to minimize the risks of spills. Danisco has a preventative maintenance software program in place to address maintenance of all vital parts of the plant's day to day operations.  In addition, there are many safety controls installed within the system.  These include an interlock system, alarms, and ammonia detectors located within the ammonia refrigeration system.  \n\n1.5    Five year Accident History\n\nIn the past five years, there have been no accidental releases of ammonia as outlined in 68.42 of the RMP Regulations.  \n\n1.6    The Emergency Response Program\n\nDanisco maintains a written Emergency Plan to help assure timely, safe, compliant responses in the event of an emergency.  Danisco is classified as a non responding facility as listed in the Emergency Response Plan.  Danisco will ensure the safety of the employees and notify the appropriate responders in the event of a release.  Danisco is coordinated with the local fire department and with the Johnson County LEPC. \n\n\n\n1.7    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nDanisco makes safety a first priority in its every day operations to ensure a safe working environment for all of its employees.  Danisco is committed to continuously improving the facility's safety and working practices through employee involvement and development.  \n\n\n\nA Process Hazard Assessment (PHA) was recently performed at the Danisco facility.  Recommendations from that PHA are being implemented which will improve the safety of the ammonia process as well as reduce the chances and magnitude of any ammonia re"
