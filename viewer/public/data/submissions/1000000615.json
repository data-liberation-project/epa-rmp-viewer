To insure safe operation and release prevention at Tyson Freezer TCCS - Sioux City, Ia., this facility has implemented The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations Chemical Process Safety Management Program 29 CFR 1910.119.  All operators of systems containing the threshold amount of hazardous chemicals will undergo Chemical Process Safety Management training and operator training specific to the system. \nTo insure proper response to emergency situations, Tyson Freezer TCCS -Sioux City, Iowa, has implemented Emergency Action Plans as required by The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations 29 CFR 1910.38(a) and Emergency Response Plans  29 CFR 1910.120. All safety personnel and operators of the process will be trained in these emergency procedures.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n     AT SIOUX CITY, IOWA WE USE ANHYDROUS AMMONIA FOR OUR REFRIGERATION SYSTEM\n     THE MAXIMUM INVENTORY IS 26,357LBS. \n   \n3.  The general accidental release prevention program.\n      This facility complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administrations Chemical Process Safety Management 29 CFR 1910.119 and the Environmental Protection Agencies Risk Management Program 40 CFR Part 68.  For ammonia systems\nTyson Freezer TCCS has adopted the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration guidelines for system operation and maintenance.  Tyson Freezer TCCS uses the IIAR Basic Ammonia Refrigeration Training Series for all operators.  \n \n4.  Five-year accident history. There was (1) reportable accident in the past 5 years.\n                 \n5.   The emergency response program.\nTyson does not have emergency response capability on site to respond to an emergency. It is Tyson's policy to contact off-site emergency responders for assistance in the event of an accidental release of ammonia. \nA written Emergency Response Plan"

This plan includes Pre-Emergency Planning with Outside Agencies, Personnel Roles and Lines of Incident Command Authority, Facility Hazard Analysis and Emergency Prevention, Safe Distances and Places of Refuge, Site Security and Control, Evacuation Routes and Procedures, Decontamination Procedures, provisions for Emergency Medical Treatment, Emergency Notification Procedures, Chemical Response Procedures, Post Incident Critique, and Personal Protective Clothing and Emergency Equipment. \n\nThe training is designed to teach both theory and hands-on training giving the person an overall understanding of the nature of hazardous materials and the ability to assess and safely respond to the incidents in the Incident Command structure.  Technician level  training includes but is not limited to the following:\nA? Knowledge of basic hazards and risk assessment techniques\nA? Proper selection and use of appropriate and required PPE for the chemical hazard\nA? Terminology associated with Hazmat\nA? Advanced site control/security procedures\nA? Advanced Containment/Control/Decon procedures\nA? Use of Atmospheric Monitoring Equipment and Contaminant Test Procedures\nA? Incident Command Structure Roles and Line of Authority\nA? Interaction with Local and State Officials\nA? Standard Operating Procedures for Clean-up and termination \nA? Critique\n\nAll training materials, hands-on drills and response procedures have been developed under the direction of the Corporate Loss Control Department.\n\nAll Team members are taught in Hazard Communication to report any observed chemical leaks/spills and odors to their supervisor or lead person immediately.  Supervisors and Leads are taught to report the above to the Safety or Process Manager immediately for further investigation.  MSDS information books are accessible to all team members for review.\n     \n6.  Planned changes to improve safety.\n     CONTINUED INSPECTION OF EQPT. AND REPLACEMENT WHEN NE"
