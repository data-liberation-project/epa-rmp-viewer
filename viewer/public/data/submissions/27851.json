Facility Policy.\n\n     The owners, management , and employees of Trotter Fertilizer and Grain are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Sherman County LEPC , and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to persons and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information.\n\n     The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop prodcuction. The maximum quantity stored would be 350000 lbs in our 18,000 gallon and two 6,000 gallon tanks.\n\n3. The Worst-Case Release and Alternative Release Senarios.\n\n      a. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as gas over a 10 minute period. The distance to the endpoint would be 3.3 miles.The maximum quantility released would be 78000  lbs. , volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards and administrative controls.\n\n     b. The alternative release scenario: a 1-inch transfer hose is used as an alternate release scenario followed by release of ammonia for two minutes before an automatic excess flow shutdown valve/valves intervenes or remote manual shut-off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia. The maximum quantity released would be 2900           pounds. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm)is .46 miles.\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n     The facility is in compliance with the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia , K-61.1 \", published by The American National Standards Institute, IN,. (ANSI), and the standar"

The OSHA standard is referenced in this RMP Registration Form, see Section 8.3 (b).\n\n5. Five-year Accident History.\n\n     There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the last five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor, to our knowledge, has THERE BEEN ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES resulting in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuation, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program.\n\n     The facility has:\n     a. A written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n     b. Provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right -to -know information as required under SARA Tilte III (EPCRA).\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\n     Safety improvments are an on-going process at this facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance and safe conditions of our equipment. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations at this time.\n\n8.
