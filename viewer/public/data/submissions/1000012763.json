Hempy\n\nFacility Telephone: (740)465-3251\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Protocols:  The owners, management, and employees of the Morral facility are committed to providing a state workplace, free of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Health, safety and environmental compliance are a fundamental part of every employee's job.  It is facility protocol to adhere to applicable Federal, State, and local laws and to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release were to occur, the facility would respond in accordance with its Emergency Action Plan and is prepared to work with the local fire department, the Local Emergency Planning Committee, and other authorities to control and mitigate the release and to minimize the impact of the release to employees, the environment, and the general public.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:  The primary activity at this facility (the stationary source) is the storage, handling, and mixing of fertilizers for direct retail sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, mixed, and distributed for direct application as crop production nutrients.  The maximum stored quantity of anhydrous ammonia at the facility is approximately 140,000 pounds stored in one 30,000 gallon storage tank.  The maximum fill level of the tank is 85% of the total tank capacity.  This facility is loaded by transport truck, therefore the maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled would occur when the on-site storage tank is at the maximum fill level of 85%.\n\n10-34-0 Liquid fertilizer is manufactured by combining anhydrous ammonia, super phosphoric acid, and water in a converter reactor.  The super phosphoric acid is delivered in insulated rail tank cars.  The super phosphoric acid is transferred to the reactor via a flexible hose to the reactor tank.  The anhydrous ammonia"

Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS), equipment specifications, and the codes and standards used to build and operate the process equipment are maintained and updated.\n\n9) Process Hazard Analysis: Management conducts reviews of the hazards associated with the process.  The process hazard analysis reviews identify the opportunity for equipment malfunctions or human errors that could cause an accidental release, the safeguards used to control hazards and prevent releases, and the steps used to detect or monitor releases.  The results of the process hazard analysis reviews are documented and problems identified are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n10) Operating Procedures:  Written operating procedures for the process are readily accessible to workers who operate and maintain the process equipment.  The operating procedures are periodically reviewed and revised as necessary so that they reflect current practices and changes to the process or equipment.\n\n11) Training:  All operators of the process equipment participate in a training program.  Initial training consists of classroom type instruction that covers health and safety hazards, emergency operations and safe work practices.  Refresher training for all employees is conducted at least once every three years.  The training program is reviewed by management on a regular basis and revised as necessary.\n\n12) Mechanical Integrity: A written mechanical integrity program is used to maintain the ongoing integrity of the process equipment.  Each employee involved in maintaining the ongoing integrity of process equipment is trained in an overview of that process and its hazards and in the procedures applicable to the employee's job tasks so that the employee can perform the tasks in a safe manner.

Documentation of each inspection and test on process equipment is maintained in the appropriate format.  Deficiencies in equipment that are outside acceptable limits are corrected before further use or in a safe and timely manner when necessary means are taken for safe operation.  Appropriate checks and inspections are performed so that equipment is installed properly and consistent with design specifications and manufacturer's instructions.\n\n13) Management of Change:  Written procedures are used to manage changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  The written procedures address the following: technical basis of the proposed change; impact of change on safety and health; modifications to operating procedures; necessary time period for change; and authorization requirements for the proposed change.  Employees involved in operating a process and maintenance and contract employees whose job tasks will be affected by a change in the process are trained and informed of the change prior to start-up of the process or affected part of the process.  Safety information and operating procedures are updated accordingly.\n\n14) Pre-Startup Review:  When modification to a new stationary source or modified stationary source is significant enough to require a change in process safety information, a review of pre-startup safety is performed.  The pre-startup safety review includes a review of the following: construction and equipment is in accordance with design specifications; safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate; for a new stationary source, a process hazard analysis has been performed and recommendations have been resolved or implemented before startup; and training of each employee involved in operating a process has been completed."

The investigation will be performed to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as corrective actions to prevent the release from recurring.  Investigation reports will be retained for five years.\n\n17) Employee Participation:  A written plan of action regarding employee participation is readily accessible to workers who operate and maintain the process equipment.

After the heat exchanger, the anhydrous ammonia vapor is mixed with the water and phosphoric acid, which is pumped from the phosphoric acid rail car to the reactor.  The anhydrous ammonia and phosphoric acid react to form ammonium phosphates and heat.  The ammonium phosphates exit the reactor and enter a holding pool where they mix with water to form an ammonium phosphate solution (10-34-0).\n\nThe ammonium phosphate solution is pumped to a heat exchanger that is cooled with a cooling tower.  The cooled solution then returns to the holding pool.\n\nSome of the ammonium phosphate solution in the holding pool is pumped out to the anhydrous ammonia heat exchanger.  The warm ammonium phosphate solution is used to vaporize the anhydrous ammonia liquid from the anhydrous ammonia tank.  The ammonium phosphate solution, which is cooled by the anhydrous ammonia vaporization flows to a storage tank.\n\nNPK (nitrogen - phosphorus - potassium)-grade fertilizers are manufactured by combining anhydrous ammonia, water, and other raw materials to achieve the proper ratios.  During this process the ammonia is added to the water to create an aqueous ammonia solution.  This is the source of nitrogen for the fertilizer.  The other sources of phosphorus and potassium are added to this solution in the amounts desired to achieve the proper NPK ratio, such as 5-10-10, 16-4-4, and 7-22-5.\n\nSlow release fertilizers are manufactured by combining water, anhydrous ammonia, and other raw materials.
