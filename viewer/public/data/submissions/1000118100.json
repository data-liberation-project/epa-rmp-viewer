      "SummaryText": "1.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1.10 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Tillamook Illinois, LLC (DCT) refrigeration system uses pure anhydrous ammonia (a commonly used refrigerant for industrial systems) as the refrigerant.  Given the quantity handled, EPA considers anhydrous ammonia a hazardous substance.  Many of the properties that make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also require precautions and procedures to protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical emergency.  It is the policy of DCT to comply with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.    \n\nSafety at our facility is inherent in the way anhydrous ammonia is handled.  While the design of the facility incorporates a multitude of safety devices, safe handling procedures combined with appropriate training of our personnel are key aspects to maintaining safety at our facility.\n\nWe have a written Process Safety Management (PSM) plan that complies with the regulations stipulated by 29 CFR 1910.119.  A crucial component of this plan is the Emergency Response Plan, developed in compliance with the Emergency Response provisions of 29 CFR 1910.38(a).  The Emergency Response Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties.  This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to deal with unplanned events effectively.  \n\n1.20 Facility Description and Substances Handled\n\nDCT is a manufacturing facility that produces ice cream and other frozen foods.  Production requires the use of a refrigeration system to preserve the integrity of the frozen product.  This refrigeration process uses ammonia as a refrigerant.  Access to the facility is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, and contractors.\n-The regulated substance handled at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.\n-The ammonia refrigeration system's maximum inventory is 19,883 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  There is no standby make-up inventory kept"

Offsite receptors were defined using Esri ArcGIS Pro 3.1  in conjunction with Google Maps, and Census block population data (2020).  Esri data apportionment calculations were used to determine the total population affected by each release scenario. \n\n1.40 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nDCT complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  The design and construction of this facility were by published standards, tests, or recommended methods of trade, industry, or governmental organizations.  \n\nDCT's written PSM plan incorporates many policies and procedures to ensure the safe operation and maintenance of this facility.  Plan elements essential to the safe operation of the refrigeration system include employee participation, process hazard information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, contractor safety, pre-startup safety review, mechanical integrity, management of change, hot-work permits, incident investigation, emergency response and planning, and compliance audits.  This plan will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary by DCT Plant Engineering and the Safety Supervisor. \n\nTraining is provided to ensure that each employee involved in operating a process has been trained in an overview of the process, the operating procedures, and safety considerations.  This training uses guidelines developed by the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) and Refrigeration Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA).  Only qualified maintenance personnel operate and interact with"

Startup, shutdown, and any onstream adjustments are handled by these qualified persons.  \n\n1.50 Five-Year Accident History\n\nDCT promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of anhydrous ammonia. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident, as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from recurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n1.60 Emergency Planning Program\n\nDCT has a written Emergency Action Plan to ensure precautions and procedures are in place to protect employees and public health and safety during a chemical emergency.  It complies with the provisions of OSHA Emergency Action Plan regulations, CFR 1910.38. IL-OSHA EAP requirements follow federal standards for public sector employees. \n\nThe Emergency Action Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties. This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to deal with unplanned events effectively.  This plan has been reviewed with the Decatur Fire Department.\n\nThe approach in developing this plan has been to identify the ammonia emergencies most likely to occur at DCT and establish precautions and procedures to protect life, safety, and health during an emergency.  The refrigeration process has backup prevention systems to keep processing malfunctions from becoming ammonia-release emergencies.  If an emergency does occur, the following response personnel, facilities, and equipment are in place:\n\n- Incident Command Center\n- Emergency Alarm and Communication System\n- Evacuation Plans and Assembly Points\n- Personal Protective Equipment\n\nThe role and procedures for obtaining external emergency assistance have been formally established with the Decatur Fire Department HAZMAT team in Decatur, IL.

All pressure vessels are built according to the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), Section VIII, Division 1, ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code for pressure vessels.
