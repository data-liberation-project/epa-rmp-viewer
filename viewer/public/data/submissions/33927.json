Other\n\ncompanies use TDI in various processes to produce urethane products such\n\nas:\n\n\n\n  u    Furniture and bedding\n\nu    Home Insulation\n\nu    Toys\n\nu    Automotive seats\n\n  u    Carpet padding\n\n\n\nRelease Scenarios\n\n\n\nWorst Case\n\n\n\n  u    Liquid spill and vaporization of Toluene Diisocyanate with off-site\n\n     impacts.\n\n\n\nAlternative\n\n\n\n\n\n  u    Release of Toluene Diisocyanate from a failure of a transfer hose with\n\n     no off-site impacts. Due to the vapor density of TDI, most likely little,\n\n     to no, vapors would escape the area in this scenario.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6/17/04                                                          Page 1 of\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nTo prevent accidental releases, this facility is in compliance with the EPA\n\nRisk Management Program and the American Chemistry Council's Responsible\n\nCare Process Safety Code.\n\n\n\nBASF Livonia uses a variety of safety equipment and procedures to prevent\n\naccidental releases.
