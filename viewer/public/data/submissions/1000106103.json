      "SummaryText": "BLUE RIDGE SOLVENTS & COATINGS is a chemical formulator and distributor that supplies products to municipal and industrial water and wastewater purification facilities in VA and NC.  The Henry facility mixes, formulates, and repackages a variety of chemicals. The company also warehouses many other chemicals that are not transferred on site.  Safe handling and shipment is critical for our employees, our customers, and the surrounding community.  The company has several employees with over thirty years of experience in the safe handling of chemical products. We employ fifteen including five highly trained hazmat drivers.  These drivers also handle chlorine and cylinders for delivery.  This gas, which can be toxic in high concentrations, is critical to providing safe water for many localities in VA and NC. The facility operates approximately 10 hrs. per day and has 24 hr. surveillance The proximity to the HENRY crossroads area requires a level of care even if the risk of off-site effects are extremely unlikely.  In the past twenty-two years there have been no facility accidents involving a reportable release of this chemical.\n\nThe chlorine cylinders are received from the supplier, leak checked, and stored in an isolated, secured storage room  The product is liquefied gas under low pressure (25-125 psi).   The cylinders are DOT specification heavy-walled cylinders that are not opened or modified by Blue Ridge. They are built to withstand normal and accident conditions incident to transportation. Our supplier inspects the cylinders each time they are filled and hydrostatically tests every 5 years to 500 psi.  Chlorine Institute training materials are used and are the source of the written procedures, Safety Data Sheets and Safety checklists that are used by the supplier and Blue Ridge.\n\nSince there is no inter-container transfer, the only threat of release from these robust transportation cylinders would be from a release from the fusible valve plug that activates at 160"

The isolation of the cylinders from flammable materials, inspection of valve seals, and leak check inspections reduce these possibilities.  The facility has not had a site accident with this chemical since start up of the Blue Ridge facility. \n\nAll employees have received training on the standard operating procedure to follow if a chlorine leak were to occur and evacuation drills are held regularly. Coordination and training with the local Fire Department is maintained and is backed up by the Jones Chemical Response team  from Charlotte, NC.  We also provide the Fire Department with Tier II notification of our inventory on a yearly basis. Blue Ridge has a Chlorine Institute Emergency A-Kit on site and has provided safety and emergency response assistance to operators and fire departments in our distribution area. Blue Ridge is also a direct subscriber with CHEMTREC.\n\nNote to EPA:  As the operator we have held that the isolation of the cylinders that contain toxics not flammables and construction of these  DOT cylinders makes these cylinders not subject to the co-located guidance concerns .
