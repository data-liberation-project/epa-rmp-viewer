      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\na.    Equistar is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at Equistar.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are stationed at the plant at all times to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\na.    EquistarA?s primary activity at the Victoria site is the production of high density polyethylene.  High density polyethylene is utilized in making a variety of plastic products such as grocery bags, plastic cups and plastic containers.  We utilize four (4) regulated substances at Equistar:  ethylene, hexane, titanium tetrachloride, and ammonia.  Of these substances, only ethylene exceeds the threshold quantity. \n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario.\na.    Baker-Strehlow-Tang (BST) Explosion Methodology has been employed by Equistar to perform a worst case.  The scenario defined below was extracted from a comprehensive evaluation for facility siting.  The release cases in the evaluation were conservatively assumed to vent horizontally into the most congested and confined areas to maximize the sizes of explosion incidents.  The worst case scenario was selected based upon the energy release from the blast and the pressure contours associated with the incident.  The following paragraph provides details of the chosen scenario:\nb.    Worst case:\ni.    The worst case scenario is a catastrophic failure of the pipeline supplying ethylene to the"

A catastrophic failure of this piping would result in a release of 4,094 lbs of ethylene to the atmosphere.  Utilizing the BST method previously discussed, the maximum distance of 0.071 miles is obtained corresponding to an EPA defined endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Preventions steps:\na.    Equistar has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth under 40 CFR Part 68.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with strict engineering standards and the facility is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.\nb.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program in place at Equistar:\ni.    Process Safety Information\n1.    Equistar maintains a record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the process.\nii.    Process Hazard Analysis\n1.    Equistar conducts studies to ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is referred to as a unit Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering process operations and maintenance.  The PHAA?s are re-validated every 5 years or if a significant change warrants a need.  Findings resulting from the analysis are risk ranked and addressed accordingly as specified in corporate guidelines.\niii.    Operating Procedures\n1.    For the purposes of safely conducting operations activities, Equistar maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary o"

The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\niv.    Training\n1.    Equistar has a training program in place to ensure that employees that are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  At this point the operators undergo testing and are certified on the job.  Refresher training and re-certification is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\nv.    Mechanical Integrity\n1.    Equistar carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper functions.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance is carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner. \nvi.    Management of Change\n1.    Written procedures are in place at Equistar to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and are trained to deal with the modification.\nvii.    Pre-Startup Safety Reviews\n1.    Pre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modification s in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Equistar.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe st"

Equistar conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the applicable regulations are being implemented.  These audits are conducted according to corporate mandated frequencies and corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\nix.    Incident Investigation\n1.    Equistar investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in, an employee injury or a catastrophic release of a hazardous material.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from re-occurring.  Investigation reports are maintained for a minimum of 5 years. \nx.    Employee Participation\n1.    Equistar believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  Equistar is a member of the OSHA Voluntary Protection Program.  As a VPP Star Work Site for over 10 years, this facility has gone above and beyond the normal safety requirements to provide employees with a safe working environment.\nxi.    Contractors\n1.    Equistar hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Equistar has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractorA?s work and the process.  Contractors are also informed of the procedures for emergency response should an event occur while they are on site.\nxii.    Five Year Accident History\n1.
