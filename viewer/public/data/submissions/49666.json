      "SummaryText": "AES Puerto Rico (AESPR) has developed a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for  prevention of risks associated with the storage and use of chlorine at it's facility in Guayama, PR, in compliance with 40 CFR 68 and Puerto Rico Air Pollution Control Regulation Rule 107 (D).  The intention of this RMP registration re-submittal is to remove from the registration two chlorine stations that are being decommissed (one was out of service) and register a new chlorine station-building that will replace the one that was in operation. The objective was to relocate the chlorination system and implement PHA recommendations to reduce risks.\n\nPropane is another chemical listed in the RMP regulations, but due to the fact that it is used as a fuel it is considered as exempt from these requirements.  Ammonia solution 25% is used by Turbine team to treat the steam.  Only 600 gallons are store on-site at any time which is less than 10,000 pounds RMP threshold therefore is not covered under this plan.  Urea is used to prepare a solution that is injected to the inlet and outlet of boiler cyclone to react with NOx and form elementary nitrogen and water.  An incomplete reaction can generate an ammonia slip that is formed in the stack gases.  Ammonia slip emissions are limited and permitted under the Air Construction Permit and PSD Permit of the facility.  Therefore, ammonia slip stack emissions are not covered under this document. \n\nThe process at AESPR uses chlorine gas stored in up to thirteen 1-ton cylinders and four 150-pound cylinders.  Chlorine is used as a disinfectant for bacteria in water, for odor and biological growth control.  This is necessary in order to prevent corrosion, sedimentation and fouling of the cooling water system and the make-up water treatment system.  Chlorine gas is applied directly to the water in the cooling tower basin and to the make-up water treatment system for plant service water and boiler steam and water cycle make-up.  \n\nAESPR provides chlorine treatment to a"

      "SummaryText": "bout 6 million gallons per day of make-up water to a daily average concentration of 20 mg/L. Chlorine is delivered to AESPR via truck in 1-ton (2,000 pounds) containers, which are used onsite as storage vessels.  The maximum intended inventory of chlorine at the Facility is 26,000 pounds, in thirteen 1-ton containers.  At the station three (3) of the 1-ton containers are connected manually with a flexible hose connection and vacuum regulator attached directly to the containers.  The vacuum regulators are designed to act as a safety shutoff in the event of a loss of vacuum due to a piping leak or malfunction of the injector or vacuum pump.  As vacuum decreases, the vacuum regulator closes to reduce or shutoff the flow of chlorine.  \n\nThe potential release of the content of one container would not affect the release of the other containers in the same location.  \nAt the Cooling Tower chlorine gas station, the gas is delivered under vacuum to injectors located in the sump of the cooling tower.  The injectors combine the gaseous chlorine with water.  At the cooling water make-up pond, a Chlor-A-Vac Chemical Induction System has been installed.  Chlorine gas flows from the active 1-ton chlorine container by the action of a submerged vacuum pump, the downward force of the unit?s propeller drives the entrained chemical to the bottom of the lagoon.  There are vacuum regulators installed on the active 1-ton containers.  The submerged vacuum pump unit is mounted approximately three feet from the bottom of the lagoon for proper mixing.    \n\nChlorine leak detectors have been installed in the vecinity of each station to detect possible gas leaks/releases.  These leak detectors monitor ambient air for traces of chlorine.  If detected an audible and visual (red flashing light) alarm will be activated at the Control Room Panel and at the Chlorine Station."
