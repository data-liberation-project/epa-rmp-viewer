As a result of the manufacturing process, the facility stores RMP-regulated chemicals at the facility in quantities that exceed the threshold quantities specified by EPA regulations. The facility has one covered process that requires the facility meet Program 3 requirements of the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation. RMP-regulated chemicals and their quantities are claimed as confidential business information. \n\nDaikin also operates the MDA Manufacturing Inc. (MDA) process and oversees safety, environmental and maintenance for MDA. In an emergency involving either Daikin or MDA, Daikin personnel will be directly involved. Therefore, Daikin is submitting the RMP for the covered process, which includes the MDA operations.\n\nB. Accidental Release Prevention & Emergency Response Policies of Daikin\n\nDaikin is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards. Appropriate responses to releases of regulated chemicals are documented in the Plant Safety Manual. Safety, environmental protection and risk management programs are fully implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response efforts.\n\nC. Release Scenario Discussion\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of the EPA RMP regulations, each owner or operator of a stationary source is required to perform offsite consequence analyses. Daikin has performed this analysis as required. The summary of this analysis is not required to be included with the executive summary.\n\nD. Five-year Accident History\n\nUnder the EPA RMP regulations, an accidental release is defined as a release of a regulated substance that \"\"resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental dam"
