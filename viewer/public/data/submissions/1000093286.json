The company will provide and maintain safe equipment, processes, procedures, safety training, and will comply with safety regulations.\n\n\n\nManagement at PeroxyChem's Tonawanda Plant has authorized specific risk management programs and activities in compliance with EPA's Risk Management Program ruling (40 CFR Part 68) that assesses the hazards of the processes which handle or store more than the threshold quantity of substances regulated by the EPA, prevent accidental releases of these hazardous substances, and effectively respond to emergencies if a release occurs.\n\n\n\nDescription - Peroxychem's Tonawanda Plant produces active oxidant products for shipment to external users. The covered process is the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia (CAS 07664-41-7). The plant also produces peracetic acid (CAS 79-21-0) for shipment to external users, but it is not a covered process since the vapor pressure is less than 10 mm Hg.\n\n\n\nWorst case Scenario - RMP regulations require a consequence analysis for worst case scenario in each regulated process, estimated to present the greatest distance in any direction to a toxic endpoint.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario selected for this process was the complete loss of the contents of one full ammonia railcar of 161,000 pounds within ten (10) minutes. The distance to toxic endpoint (0.14 mg/l) is 6.9 miles. The estimated re"

Rural conditions were deliberately chosen to create a more conservative approach as was the F class stability. Public impact includes, schools, residences, hospitals, recreation areas, and major commercial offices or industrial areas. Environmental impacts include state parks and wildlife sanctuaries, preserves or refuges.\n\n\n\nAlternate Release Scenarios - RMP regulations require that at least one alternate release scenario be identified and analyzed for each regulated toxic chemical present. A scenario that is more realistic than the worst-case scenario was selected as the alternate release case.\n\n\n\nThe alternate release scenario simulates an ammonia railcar transfer line rupture. The event is assumed to release 6,840 pounds of ammonia during a twenty (20) minute period at a rate of 342 pounds per minute. The estimated distance to the toxic endpoint (0.14 mg/l) is 0.3 miles. This scenario was modeled using the RMP*Comp and assumed a complete rupture of the liquid transfer hose during railcar unloading. The loss was assumed to be for a twenty (20) minutes duration with a manual response to close the railcar unloading valve and did not account for the excess flow valve in place on the railcar in order to keep the model conservative. The estimated residential population within the area is ~4300. Public impact includes parks and recreational areas, and major commercial offices and industrial buildings. The institutions, parks, and recreational areas within the 0.3 mile radius from the release source were located using WNY street maps from Map Works, Inc. No environmental contacts were impacted. This scenario did not take into account any of the automatic devices installed in the unloading system and is therefore considered conservative.
