Additionally, the Emergency Response Plans are reviewed annually with the Destin Fire Control District.  \r\n\r\nOn April 117, 2013, Destin Water Users, Inc. conducted a mock accidental chlorine release (a minor release) in conjunction with the Destin Fire Control District.  In-sight gained from the mock drill was incorporated into the Emergency Response Plans.  A mock chlorine release drill will be held during 2014 to simulate a chlorine release.  This drill will include an invitation to participate to the Destin Fire Control District and the local HazMat team.\r\n\r\nIn addition to chlorine safety training, Destin Water Users, Inc. monitors the chlorine storage facility 24 hours per day.  The WRF is a fenced and gated facility.  Chlorine gas detectors and audible alarms are tested monthly.

FRENCH WATER RECLAMATION FACILITY\r\nDESTIN, FL 32541 \r\n\r\nIn accordance with 40 CFR 68, Destin Water Users, Inc. has developed a Risk Management Program for the George F. French Reclamation Facility (WRF).  Destin Water Users, Inc. is the owner and operator of the WRF which includes a stationary source (storage facility) for chlorine.  Chlorine is a regulated substance that is stored at the WRF in excess of the threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds.  The chlorine stored at the WRF is used to disinfect the effluent and reclaimed water produced at the WRF.  The chlorine storage facility also stores chlorine used for the disinfection of water at wells owned by Destin Water Users, Inc.  The Destin Water Users, Inc. WRF is a Program 3\r\nprevention program.\r\n\r\nA. ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nDestin Water Users, Inc. has implemented a Risk Management Program that is designed to prevent or minimize the accidental release of chlorine gas from the WRF and to address the necessary emergency response procedures to prevent or minimize any off-site impacts that result from an accidental release of chlorine gas.\r\n\r\nThe accidental release of chlorine gas is prevented or minimized through chlorine safety training, the use of chlorine safety equipment and the implementation of emergency response plans for chlorine gas release.\r\n\r\nThe Risk Management Program has been developed and implemented in accordance with the regulatory requirements of the U. S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency.\r\n\r\nB. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\r\n\r\nThe stationary source or chlorine storage facility is located at the WRF.  The WRF is located in Destin, Florida.  Chlorine is the regulated substance handled and stored at the WRF.  Chlorine is stored in 150 pound and 2000 pound containers.\r\n\r\nC.
