The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source;\n\nKuehne Chemical has in place three programs designed to address accidental release prevention and emergency response issues.  These programs have been reviewed and approved by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection.  The first program is the Discharge Prevention Containment and Countermeasure Plan.  This plan is designed to ensure Kuehne Chemical has the appropriate precautionary procedures in place to address likely release scenarios.  This plan focuses on release prevention.  Second, Kuehne Chemical has in place a Discharge Cleanup and Removal Plan.  This plan is designed to ensure Kuehne Chemical has the ability to initiate a response to a release.  The DCR plan outlines actions Kuehne Chemical intends to take to mitigate the effects of the release and to minimize off-site impact.  The third plan is Kuehne Chemical's Emergency Response Plan.  This plan provides emergency response information for the most likely emergency incidents and release scenarios.  The plan addresses on-site and off-site response activities for both HAZMAT and medical related incidents.  This plan includes the recommendations established in the Chlorine Institute's Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities\n\nB.

There has never been a failure of this type for a stationary chlorine rail car and this scenario must be considered highly improbable.\n\nAlternate scenario:\nAn alternate scenario for chlorine involves a pipeline leak, which releases one pound per minute of chlorine for a duration of 50 minutes, releasing a total of 50 pounds of material. The RMP*Comp calculation for this scenario shows a distance of less than 0.1 miles to the endpoint.
