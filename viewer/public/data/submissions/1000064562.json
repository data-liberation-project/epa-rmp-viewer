Operation of these processes involves the use or handling of certain listed regulated substances as defined by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Currently, the only regulated substances within a process in an amount above their threshold quantities are butane and isobutane which are stored in a pressurized bullet tank with a maximum rated capacity of 30,000 gallons or 145,800 pounds (lbs). Depending on facility operations, the tank contents are planned to be comprised of either butane or isobutane.   Butane and isobutane are used as seasonal blending components in gasoline.\n\nThe facility is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for the facility's workers, the public, and the environment. \n\n\n\nAs part of this commitment, Murphy Oil USA, Inc. has established systems to ensure safe operation of the facility. The facility maintains a management system and associated policies, procedures, programs, and work practices that are related to RMP Prevention Program elements. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP requirements and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the facility in Meridian, Mississippi.\n\n\n\nThe Executive Summary includes an overview of the following elements:\n\n-    Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies;\n\n-    Facility and regulated substances;\n\n-    Accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps;\n\n-    Five-year accident history;\n\n-    Emergency response program; and \n\n-    Planned changes to improve safety\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nMurphy Oil USA, Inc. views the health and safety of its employees and the community in which it operates as its top priority.

Refer to Section 7 of the RMP submission for a detailed discussion of the facility's OSHA PSM program. \n\n \n\nRMP FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nNo RMP related accidents in the past 5 years. \n\n\n\nRESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe facility maintains a written Facility Response Plan (FRP), which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire and/or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to plant processes.  Any changes are administered through the MOC process, which include informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe facility coordinates activities with the Lauderdale County Emergency Management Agency (EMA).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee with local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.   The facility has around-the-clock communication capabilities with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g.,fire department) to facilitate notification of the public and receive a quick response.  \n\n\n\nTypes of RMP site-specific prevention steps include the following:\n\n-Release detection (e.g., process alarms, LEL monitors); and\n\n-Release containment and control (e.g., pressure relief valves, manual and automatic shutoff systems, grounding equipment, check valves, and interlocks)\n\n\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe facility resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in mod"
