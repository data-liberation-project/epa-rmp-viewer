Whey Plant System\r\n\r\n            This is to inform all interested persons, including employees that Brewster Dairy, Inc. is complying with OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management Standard (called Process Safety Management or PSM), Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, and EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Program regulations (called RM Program), Title 40 CFR Part 68, also Brewster Dairy, Inc. Corporate Safety Policies, to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and processing of hazardous chemicals. In this way we promote overall plant, worker, and public safety. These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical propertydamage.                                                                                                                                                                                    Our safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities. Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.Our safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment. These rules are detailed and improved as necessary. They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\r\n\t     Brewster Dairy, Inc. has two systems that are separated by state route 93. Our Westside system is used for process. We use this to cool product and dehumidify air.  Th"

We have three screw compressors, Receiver, Accumulator, one transfer tank, two evaporator condensers, Plate Heat Exchanger, two 100,000 pound Ice Builders. \r\n\t\tFailure of the high pressure receiver containing 4800 pounds of ammonia with the receiver quantity limited to 34% of the vessel capacity by facility procedures resulting in a ten minute release. Under worst-case weather conditions, ammonia could travel o.9 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public. This scenario is unlikely for the following reasons: worst-case weather conditions are uncommon; the vessel is enclosed in a building that would withstand and help to contain such a release; industry standards for the manufacture and quality control of pressure vessels; ammonia is not corrosive in this service; pressure safety valves limit operating pressure in this vessel; the accident prevention program in place at the facility including the mechanical integrity program for regular maintenance, inspection and testing, and replacement of equipment, if necessary; installed ammonia sensors in the system to warn of leaks; alarms system in place to warn operating personnel of process upsets; and the emergency response plan and equipment in place at the facility. \r\n\r\n              Failure of a transfer hose during unloading resulting in a release of 100 pounds of ammonia over a time period of 10 minutes.

Transfer hose failure was chosen as the alternative release scenario because it is a temporary connection and constructed of materials other than steel.

Ammonia falls under the RMP Program 3 prevention program, which is identical to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program. EPA has said that if the process is in compliance with OSHA PSM, then it is compliance with RMP Program 3.  Thus, the Brewster facility\u00bfs ammonia PSM should meet the requirements for the RMP document.  \r\nThere are several aspects of the prevention program that are key: \r\na.)\tSince most of the pipe work is out of the way of people and the machinery, there is less of a chance of an ammonia release.\r\nb.)\tThe plant maintains good training, certification and employee awareness of operating procedures.\r\nc.)\tThe plant has developed a strong preventive maintenance and inspection program.\r\nD.)      We are now a OSHA Onsite Sharps plant.\r\n\r\n          There was one accidental release of ammonia in the past five years; May 29th of 2006 the amount released was 2700 pounds. The ammonia was contained in the water of the Ice Builder. There were no offsite injuries; there was no reason to evacuate.\r\n          This facility\u00bfs emergency response program is based on the OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120). We have trained employees for emergency response and maintain a written emergency response plan.
