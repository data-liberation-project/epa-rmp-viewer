Facility Policy.\n\nThe owners, management and employees of Kesley Ag Center, Inc. is committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of Anhydrous Ammonia.\nIf an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Butler County LEPC, and other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2.          Facility Information.\n             \nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for resale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed as a nutrient for crop production.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored at the facility storage tanks and nurse tanks.  The maximum quantity stored of anhydrous ammonia is 380,000 pounds.\n\n3.          Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario.\n\n             \na.        The worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage  tank released   as gas over a period of 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 130,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and administrative controls.  The distance to the end point  (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is 1.1 miles.\n\n\nb.      The alternate release scenario: is a release from a break in a transfer hose followed by a release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shut-down valve/valves intervenes or remote manual shut-off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia.  The maximum quantity released would be 2900 pounds.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .22 miles\n\n4.          Accidental Release Prevention Program,\n\nThe facility is in compliance with the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", publishe"

The OSHA standard is referenced in the Registration Form Section 8.3 b.\n\n\n5.           Five-Year Accident History.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases  of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility, nor to our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n6.           Emergency Response.\n\n\nThe facility has:\n\n              a.         a written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n              b.         provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community\n                          right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA), \n\n7.           Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\nSafety improvements is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to asses the maintenance of safe conditions.\n\nThere are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
