      "SummaryText": "FACILITY DESCRIPTION\r\n\r\nThe Phillips 66 Ferndale Refinery is located in Ferndale, Washington, in Whatcom County. It receives crude oil from multiple sources, which it processes into petroleum products, including gasoline, transportation fuels, LPG, and oils. In addition to the flammable materials associated with crude oil processing, the facility uses hydrofluoric acid in the Alkylation Unit, which is a standard refining application. The processing of the crude oil results in the generation of hydrogen sulfide. Sulfur Recovery Units process the hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide to recover sulfur for sale and to limit SO2 and CO2 emissions to atmosphere at quantities below the allowable limits.  \r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe federal Risk Management Program requires the Phillips 66 Ferndale Refinery to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for any processes containing regulated substances above their threshold quantities (TQ) at the Ferndale Refinery. The Ferndale Refinery handles hazardous materials onsite, and recognizes a responsibility to safely operate the facility in order to protect its employees and contractors, the surrounding community, and the environment. The facility has taken a proactive stance to promote the overall safe operation of the processes, with programs to prevent accidents from occurring, to plan for emergencies, and to maintain the equipment needed if an emergency does occur. The RMP summarizes existing programs and procedures so that these programs may be reviewed more efficiently.\r\n\r\nThe Ferndale Refinery processes oil into gasoline and refining products. The facility receives oil from many sources via ship, pipeline, and rail, stores it in tanks onsite, and then processes the oil into products to be shipped elsewhere by pipeline, railcar, barge, or truck. The refining process separates the crude oil into five products: gasoline, diesel fuel, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), heavy fuel oil, and sulfur. All products are stored onsite prior to s"

Revised inventory data based on updated process equipment inventories and lab data compiled in 2017,\r\n2. Eliminated one (1) unit (Unit 7 Minalk) as it has been decommissioned,\r\n3. Revalidated Toxic and Flammable Worst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios with current Maximum Intended Inventories (MII) and census data.\r\n\r\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS \r\n\r\nThe objectives of this hazard assessment are twofold: (1) satisfy the requirements of the RMP regulation and (2) provide Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) information that will help local emergency planning officials improve community emergency response in the event of an accidental release at the refinery.\r\n\r\nThe facility has submitted to the EPA a worst case and alternative release scenario for each regulated toxic substance held in the covered process, and a worst case and alternative release scenario for flammable substances in covered process units.\r\n\r\nThe EPA has provided the levels of concern (LOC) for certain regulated substances that have the potential to be carried offsite during a release. For regulated substances where emergency response planning guidelines (ERPG) values have been established, RMP requires that the ERPG-2 value be used as the toxic endpoint. RMP also requires an offsite consequence analysis for potential releases of flammable materials. In modeling flammable materials, the stationary source is required to present distances to endpoints resulting from any of the following:\r\n- Explosion: Overpressure of 1 psig.\r\n- Radiant Heat/Fire: Radiant heat of 5 kW/m2 for 40 seconds.\r\n- Lower Flammability Limit: a lo"

The alternative release scenarios allow the facility to present scenarios that assume the use of administrative and actual controls in place at the facility. Even the ARSs are rare events. The details of the process release conditions assumed for the hazard scenarios and assumptions made are provided in the Worst and Alternative Case Release Scenarios sections of the 2017 RMP Update Report. \r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe RMP rule requires facilities to compile a 5-Year Accident History for all RMP regulated substances in covered processes at the facility. As part of the ongoing PSM Program, the facility documents and tracks all incidents and near-misses that occur within the facility. This incident database serves as the basis for the five-year accident history.\r\n\r\nRMP requires facilities to report any incident from a covered process involving a regulated substance and resulting in any of the following:\r\n- Onsite deaths, injuries, or significant property damage\r\n- Offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, or environmental damage\r\n\r\nThe Facility had one RMP reportable incident in the last 5 years. While rodding out low point bleeders in the Alkylation Unit, the tool became disconnected releasing a mixture of LPG hydrocarbons that had approximately 1% HF acid mixed within. Phillips 66 promptly initiated its emergency response procedures to minimize the impact of the release. The leak was isolated by an entry team. All Phillips 66 and contractor personnel potentially impacted by the release were transported to the hospital for medical evaluation and treatment as needed.

One of these individuals was a Phillips 66 employee who was coming into work and did report for work later that evening. The other individual received medical treatment for a rash a few days later that she believed was caused by the incident. Following the incident, additional training was conducted, reference material for a safe work practice was updated, and a maintenance and an operating procedure were revised.\r\n\r\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Phillips 66 Ferndale Refinery is committed to the safety of its workers and the public. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources allocated to ensuring the safe design, installation, operation, inspection, and maintenance of our processes and associated equipment. Our approach is to implement reasonable controls to prevent and/or mitigate foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a loss of containment should occur, our emergency response organization will respond to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the refinery. Because processes at the facility regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA/DOSH PSM standard, the accident prevention and risk management plan is organized to be consistent with the PSM regulation requirements. This summary addresses each of the PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program. Each section below contains a brief summary of the prevention program elements and designates the responsible party for each element.\r\n\r\nPP1.

This includes information regarding process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment. Responsibility for specific PSI documents has been assigned to subject matter experts at the refinery. The process development engineer has overall responsibility for the PSI program. \r\n\r\nPP3. Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\r\nThe refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each refinery processing unit is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. The PHA team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures. The team also makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when they believe such measures are necessary. The PSM Lead is responsible for the PHA program.\r\n\r\nThe Phillips 66 risk matrix is used to qualitatively assign a risk ranking to each hazard scenario based on the potential severity and likelihood, given existing control measures. Any recommendations needed to mitigate a hazardous consequence made in the PHA study receive a priority ranking based on the risk ranking for the associated hazard scenario. All PHA recommendations receive a thorough evaluation in a timely manner. In addition, other risk management tools, such as Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA) Quantitative Risk Analysis (QRA) and Safety Integrity Level (SIL) evaluation, are also used to ensure there are adequate safeguards in place and safety systems meet reliability requirements.\r\n\r\nChanges to the refinery, including new refinery units, are evaluated using a PHA (as applicable) with ample time for recommendation implementation prior to the startup of the unit or change.

Incident Investigation\r\n\r\nThe incident investigation program expands beyond what is required for the EPA RMP regulation. In addition to incidents that have the potential to result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance, it also covers all other incidents and near misses that occur at the refinery. Examples include, but are not limited to: process safety incidents, occupational injuries and illness, unit upsets, production loss, property damage or loss, and environmental incidents such as spills or releases. Incident investigation is the responsibility of the PSM Lead.\r\n\r\nThe intent is to ensure that investigations are conducted in a timely, organized, and objective manner. The purpose of an investigation is not to fix blame, but rather to determine the facts surrounding the incident, present the findings and conclusions, and make recommendations for corrective actions that will prevent a similar occurrence in the future. An incident investigation team will investigate all incidents as defined in Section 68.81 of the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions.\r\n\r\nAll near-misses and incidents are reviewed during the 5-year revalidation of the unit PHA studies, to provide the PHA team with insight into hazards that may occur.\r\n\r\nPP12.\tCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Ferndale Refinery periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.\r\n\r\nThis facility verifies RMP compliance every three years with an audit.

The facility is a responsible member of the community by protecting the refinery and neighbors from damaging effects of emergency situations. The facility design, maintenance, operating procedures, and training provide for risk minimization should an accident occur. In spite of all these things, emergencies can arise, sometimes through forces beyond control. The emergency response plan known as the Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP), along with training and drills, is designed to prepare the facility to recognize emergency situations of various types and react promptly and correctly to minimize any ill effects. Local, state, and federal safety rules dictate that the facility study and understand the principles and specifics covered in this preplanning effort and fully understand all roles in the plan.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this emergency plan (ICP) is to provide a cohesive, written procedure for coordinating an effective response by all refinery personnel so that danger to employees, contractors, the general public, and the environment may be lessened in the unlikely event of an emergency. The emergency response procedure covers the entire facility, including refinery units that don't handle or produce regulated substances. It includes, but is not limited to: first-in response, evacuation, emergency shutdown, decontamination and medical response to chemical exposure, agency notification, public notification if potential for impact, personnel accounting, and clean-up.\r\n\r\nTraining for emergency response is handled through the HSE Department, and is conducted frequently with classroom, tabletop, and"
