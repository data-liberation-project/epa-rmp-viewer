The prevention program elements listed below are described in further detail in the Executive Summary:\n\n- Process Safety Information;\n\n- Process Hazard Analysis;\n\n- Operating Procedures;\n\n- Training;\n\n- Mechanical Integrity;\n\n- Management of Change;\n\n- Pre-Startup Review;\n\n- Compliance Audits;\n\n- Incident Investigation;\n\n- Employee Participation;\n\n- Safe Work Practices, including Hot Work Permit;\n\n- Contractors.\n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of Unit 4 FCC is to increases the overall yield from each barrel of crude oil. The FCC unit converts the lower-valued vacuum gas oils to higher valued products using a process combining catalytic reaction, heat and distillation.",

The prevention program elements listed below are described in further detail in the Executive Summary:\n\n- Process Safety Information;\n\n- Process Hazard Analysis;\n\n- Operating Procedures;\n\n- Training;\n\n- Mechanical Integrity;\n\n- Management of Change;\n\n- Pre-Startup Review;\n\n- Compliance Audits;\n\n- Incident Investigation;\n\n- Employee Participation;\n\n- Safe Work Practices, including Hot Work Permit;\n\n- Contractors.\n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of Unit 1 Crude is to separate raw crude oil into fractions or cuts of varying hydrocarbon components. Crude oil entering the refinery is distilled in the Crude Tower. The crude is separated into fractions or products with different boiling ranges. These are then sent to other processing areas where each stream is processed again. This unit includes the straight run gas plant.\n\n",

      "SummaryText": "FACILITY DESCRIPTION\n\n\n\nThe Phillips 66 Ferndale Refinery is located in Ferndale, Washington, in Whatcom County. It receives crude oil from multiple sources, which it processes into petroleum products, including gasoline, transportation fuels, LPG, and oils. In addition to the flammable materials associated with crude oil processing, the facility uses hydrofluoric acid in the Alkylation Unit, which is a standard refining application. The processing of the crude oil results in the generation of hydrogen sulfide. Sulfur Recovery Units process the hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide to recover sulfur for sale and to limit SO2 and CO2 emissions to atmosphere at quantities below the allowable limits.  \n\n\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nThe federal Risk Management Program requires the Phillips 66 Ferndale Refinery to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for any processes containing regulated substances above their threshold quantities (TQ) at the Ferndale Refinery. The Ferndale Refinery handles hazardous materials onsite, and recognizes a responsibility to safely operate the facility in order to protect its employees and contractors, the surrounding community, and the environment. The facility has taken a proactive stance to promote the overall safe operation of the processes, with programs to prevent accidents from occurring, to plan for emergencies, and to maintain the equipment needed if an emergency does occur. The RMP summarizes existing programs and procedures so that these programs may be reviewed more efficiently.\n\n\n\nThe Ferndale Refinery processes oil into gasoline and refining products. The facility receives oil from many sources via ship, pipeline, and rail, stores it in tanks onsite, and then processes the oil into products to be shipped elsewhere by pipeline, railcar, barge, or truck. The refining process separates the crude oil into five products: gasoline, diesel fuel, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), heavy fuel oil, and sulfur. All products are stored onsite prior to s"

For regulated substances where emergency response planning guidelines (ERPG) values have been established, RMP requires that the ERPG-2 value be used as the toxic endpoint. RMP also requires an offsite consequence analysis for potential releases of flammable materials. In modeling flammable materials, the stationary source is required to present distances to endpoints resulting from any of the following:\n\n- Explosion: Overpressure of 1 psig.\n\n- Radiant Heat/Fire: Radiant heat of 5 kW/m2 for 40 seconds.\n\n- Lower Flammability Limit: a lo"

The details of the process release conditions assumed for the hazard scenarios and assumptions made are provided in the Worst and Alternative Case Release Scenarios sections of the 2017 RMP Update Report. \n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe RMP rule requires facilities to compile a 5-Year Accident History for all RMP regulated substances in covered processes at the facility. As part of the ongoing PSM Program, the facility documents and tracks all incidents and near-misses that occur within the facility. This incident database serves as the basis for the five-year accident history.\n\n\n\nRMP requires facilities to report any incident from a covered process involving a regulated substance and resulting in any of the following:\n\n- Onsite deaths, injuries, or significant property damage\n\n- Offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, or environmental damage\n\n\n\nThe Facility had one RMP reportable incident in the last 5 years.

The facility is a responsible member of the community by protecting the refinery and neighbors from damaging effects of emergency situations. The facility design, maintenance, operating procedures, and training provide for risk minimization should an accident occur. In spite of all these things, emergencies can arise, sometimes through forces beyond control. The emergency response plan known as the Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP), along with training and drills, is designed to prepare the facility to recognize emergency situations of various types and react promptly and correctly to minimize any ill effects. Local, state, and federal safety rules dictate that the facility study and understand the principles and specifics covered in this preplanning effort and fully understand all roles in the plan.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this emergency plan (ICP) is to provide a cohesive, written procedure for coordinating an effective response by all refinery personnel so that danger to employees, contractors, the general public, and the environment may be lessened in the unlikely event of an emergency.

It includes, but is not limited to: first-in response, evacuation, emergency shutdown, decontamination and medical response to chemical exposure, agency notification, public notification if potential for impact, personnel accounting, and clean-up.\n\n\n\nTraining for emergency response is handled through the HSE Department, and is conducted frequently with classroom, tabletop, and "
