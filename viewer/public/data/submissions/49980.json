This\ncommitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas\nsuch as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the\nprocesses at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of\nregulated substances. If such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at\nhand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. Although our primary coordination is with the Tioga\nCounty LEPC hazardous materials teams, due to our facility's location, which is on the border of New York and\nPennsylvania state, we also have provided a copy of this plan to Bradford County (Pennsylvania) LEPC.\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activity encompasses Cheese and Whey Manufacturing. The plant is located at 400 Leprino\nAvenue, Waverly, New York. We have one RMP-regulated substance, Anhydrous Ammonia, CAS #7664-41-7,\nat our facility. which is used to provide refrigeration for the manufacturing of cheese. The maximum inventory\nof Anhydrous Ammonia at our facility is approximately 36,287 pounds.\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set\nout under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. The Anhydrous Ammonia refrigeration system is also subject to the\nOSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification\nrequirements. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in\nplace at our stationary source.\nProcess Safety Information\nLeprino Foods Company maintains a detailed "

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If/Checklist. The studies\nare undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are\nrevalidated at a regular interval (five years or when changes dictate). Any findings related to the hazard\nanalysis are addressed in a timely manner.\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Leprino Foods Company\nmaintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial\nstartup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal\nshutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to\noperators involved in the processes.\nTraining\nLeprino Foods Company has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are\noperating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Refresher\ntraining is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed. All training is documented and\nvalidated by employees.\nMechanical Integrity\nLeprino Foods Company carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper\noperations. Process equipment examined by these checks include; pressure vessels, storage receivers, piping\nsystems relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Maintenance operations\nare carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Futhermore, these\npersonnel are offered specialized training as needed.

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by\na modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the\nmodification.\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are\nconducted as a regular practice. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment,\noperating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\nCompliance Audits\nLeprino Foods Company conducts system and program audits of the Ammonia refrigeration system, PSM, and RMP on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. These audits are to be carried out at least every three (3) years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\nIncident Investigation\nLeprino Foods Company promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a\ncatastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation\nleading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccuring. All reports are\nretained for a minimum of five (5) years.\nEmployee Participation\nLeprino Foods Company truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team\neffort.

Emergency Response Plan\nLeprino Foods Company maintains a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of\nhazardous materials. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including first aid and medical\ntreatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as postincident\ndecontamination of affected areas.\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced. In\naddition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that\nwould require a modified emergency response.\nThe Waverly facility coordinates its emergency response plan with the Bradford County LEPC.\n6.
