The condenser is mounted outside on a platform, and all of the evaporators are located in their respective cold storage rooms/areas or roof-top penthouses.\n\nThe refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of high pressure liquid ammonia from the High Pressure Liquid Receiver (HPLR-1) to the High Pressure Recirculator (HPR-1) and the Low Pressure Recirculator (LPR-1).  The High Pressure Liquid Receiver also supplies liquid ammonia for oil cooling to the five compressors (C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4 and C-5), and vapor to the Hot Gas Coils and evaporators for hot gas defrost.  The High Pressure Recirculator pumps liquid ammonia to the Glycol Chiller (HE-1) and the following evaporators:  Shipping Dock Evaporators (D-EV-1 - D-EV-9), 55\u00b0F Produce Evaporators (EV-1 & EV-2), 34\u00b0F Wet Produce Evaporators (EV-3 & EV-4), 34\u00b0F Dry Produce Evaporators (EV-5 & EV-6),  30\u00b0F Packaged Meat Evaporator (EV-7 & EV-8), 34\u00b0F Dairy/Deli Evaporators (EV-9 - EV-16).   The Low Pressure Recirculator (LPR-1) pumps liquid ammonia to the freezer evaporators (EV-17 - EV-22) located in the large and small freezer, and the ice cream freezer.  As heat is absorbed, the ammonia is partially vaporized before it is drawn back to its respective recirculator.  \n\nVapor from the LPR-1 is pulled through  Compressor 2 (C-2), while vapor from the Suction Trap (ST-1) is pulled by Compressor 1 (C-1).  Both C-1 & C-2 discharge to the HPR-1.  Compressor 3 (C-3) is a swing compressor which draws suction from HPR-1, but is also plumbed to pull from the LPR-1 and/or ST-1.  C-3 discharges to the condenser, but is also plumbed to discharge back to the HPR-1.  Compressors 4 & 5 draw suction from HPR-1 and discharge to the condenser.  The condenser converts compressor discharge (hot gas) into high pressure liquid and recycles it to the High Pressure Liquid Receiver.  \n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\n*  Worst Case Release Result Summary\n\nScenario Descriptio"

The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document which is maintained at the facility.

To minimize property damage.\n\nTom Thumb maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations.\n\nTom Thumb has coordinated emergency response efforts with the local fire department. In the case of an ammonia-related emergency, the Tom Thumb Emergency Response Team will assemble and work with the fire department/HazMat Team to respond to the emergency. \n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nConstruction of the ammonia refrigeration system at Tom Thumb was completed in February 2001. The facility serves as a distribution point for chilled goods. The facility is located at 743 Henrietta Creek Road in Roanoke, Texas about 0.5 miles west of Route 377 and 0.5 miles north of Route 170. The immediate area is primarily undeveloped with other warehouse storage facilities.

For example, consider having certain alarms monitored by an outside agency (or security) or consider interlocking the computer alarm system (or key alarms) to an auto-dialer system to notify Refrigeration Technicians.\n\nR15\tConsider having a visual alarm outside the engine room to alert personnel in the event of a leak inside the engine room.\n\nR16\tDetermine whether the liquid pumps will be switched automatically via the computer control system or manually.  If they are switched manually, consider keeping the suction side hand valve closed so that in the event that the check valve fails, there will be no damage to the pump.\n\nR17\tAnnually test high-high level switch(es) to ensure that the compressors will shut down.\n\nR18\tPeriodically check the level in the HPR (LPR) vessels and compare the results to the computer indication to ensure that the level transducer is properly calibrated.\n\nR19\tPrepare an operating procedure for draining oil and use this procedure for on-the-job training.  Document the on-the-job training by having both the employee and the trainer certify that the training was understood and that the employee demonstrated this understanding to the trainer.\n\nR20\tInclude testing of the ammonia detectors in the Mechanical Integrity program which is part of the PSM/RMP books.  This test should include calibration per the manufacturer's recommendations and a test to ensure that the desired response is achieved when activated (a"
