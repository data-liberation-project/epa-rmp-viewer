It is the policy of Pro-Corn, LLC to comply with all Federal, State and Local laws.\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nPro-Corn, LLC operates a fuel ethanol production plant located in Preston, Fillmore County, Minnesota.  The facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn with a process by-product of dry distillers grain with solubles which is used as a livestock feed.  The fuel ethanol production process requires the use of a denaturant, natural gasoline, which is reported to contain 30-40% pentane, an RMP regulated substance.  The maximum amount of natural gasoline stored on-site is estimated to be 90,000 pounds.  The natural gasoline is stored as a liquid and is introduced to the fuel ethanol in the final stage of production.\n\nOff-Site Consequence Analysis\n\nIn addition to identifying and reporting regulated materials at the Pro-Corn facility, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Plan (RMP) program guidance requires companies to share with their communities a look at the worst possible accident that could happen at a facility (as unlikely as that might be) and an alternative, more realistic accident scenario.\n\nRMP*Comp, a software tool developed by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration was used to perform an off-site consequence analysis for the Pro-Corn, LLC facility. The worst case scenario defined by RMP Guidance is a failure of the natural gasoline storage tank resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. The software modeling program considered release of 90,000 pounds of the denaturant (pentane). The analysis projected an off-site endpoint for the release. The alternate case analysis also used RMP*Comp and conside"

The resulting endpoint was off-site from the facility.\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\n\nThrough completion of this RMP, Pro-Corn, LLC has complied with the EPA requirements under 40 CFR Part 68.  Process safety information and operations/maintenance procedures are documented on site.  Periodic functions such as process hazard analysis, training, change management and incident investigation are conducted on a regular basis.  Audits of the overall RMP will be conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA regulations.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nPro-Corn, LLC has not had a natural gasoline accident causing death, injuries, environmental or property damage, evacuations, or in-place sheltering in the last five years at the fuel ethanol production facility.\n\nThe Emergency Response Program\n\nIn the event of an emergency, it is the policy of Pro-Corn, LLC to notify the City of Preston Fire Department and evacuate all employees from the facility."
