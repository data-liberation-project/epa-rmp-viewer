Chlorine (liquid under pressure) is the manufacturing process chemical that is considered a highly hazardous material.  The City of Santa Fe Springs Fire Department recognizes the KIK So Cal facility as a Stationary Source under the Federal regulations and requested this Risk Management Plan (RMP).  KIK So Cal's policy is to adhere to all applicable Federal and State of California rules and regulations.  \r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nKIK International operates a facility in the Los Angeles Metropolitan Area which uses chlorine for the manufacture and packaging of household cleaning products, such as bleach.  \r\n\r\nChlorine Process\r\n\r\nThe chlorine process begins with the unloading of one of two rail cars containing liquid chlorine at ambient temperatures and a gauge pressure ranging from approximately 90 to 150 pounds per square inch.  A moveable building covers the rail car valve compartment to capture any chlorine leaks.  The liquid chlorine flows from the rail car by its own vapor pressure or from pressure supplied by the air padding system.  The sodium hydroxide solution is prepared by diluting 50% sodium hydroxide with water in a blender to form the desired concentration for reaction with liquid chlorine in the reactor (i.e. chlorine bleach plant).  The liquid chlorine is injected into the diluted caustic-filled reactor to form sodium hypochlorite.\r\n\r\nBleach strength is controlled by maintaining the concentration of sodium hydroxide.  The concentration of sodium hydroxide is maintained automatically by ratio flow meters and comparative (flow) monitoring.  If an imbalance is identified, the system will automatically adjust.  The system is designed so that if a controller or comparator-fails, or a signal is not received, the system will automatically shutdown and isol"

      "SummaryText": "ate.  Samples to monitor the concentration and purity of the bleach are taken periodically, with operational adjustments made as necessary.  The bleach product is not considered a regulated substance.  \r\n\r\nNo more than one rail car is connected to the bleach plant at one time.  All materials are at ambient temperatures until combined in the reactor.  At this time the temperature of the bleach solution rises to approximately 125F due to heat release from the chemical reaction.  The chlorine piping at the rail cars can be purged of chlorine prior to disconnection.  The purge line as well as the moveable building's exhaust system are routed to a 500 gallon scrubber tank containing dilute caustic.  The chlorine purged from the line is neutralized by forming bleach.  All chlorine piping is double-walled and can be vented to the scrubber in the event of a leak.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe facility complies with all applicable Federal and State codes and regulations.  The facility conducts safety meetings and trains personnel who operate either the chlorine  system.  \r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThere have been no incidents from April 2014 - April 2019).\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Response Program is based upon the alerting of personnel at the facility to evacuate or shelter-in-place and await the arrival of responders from the City of Santa Fe Springs Fire Department or in-house responders at the assembly location if a release occurs that causes the evacuation or the shelter-in-place to be initiated."
