      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\nStoney Creek Technologies operates internationally with a manufacturing facility located on 14 acres of land in Trainer, PA, along with a sales office in Trainer and Europe.  This manufacturing location was previously owned by Witco Corporation as part of their Performance Chemicals Group (PCG) and was purchased in July, 1998, by a management-led team.  There are currently 38 employees at the Trainer facility.\n\nSCT manufactures and markets world-wide a series of corrosion inhibitors under the tradename SACI (Severe Atmospheric Corrosion Inhibitor).  Additionally, SCT is currently toll-producing oil and fuel additives for Witco Corporation (magnesium and calcium alkylbenzene sulfonates).\n\nSCT operates all processes in an environmentally responsible manner.  SCT subscribes       \nto the CMA Responsible Care Initiatives.\n\nSCT believes that Safety is unequivocally our number one priority.  We have an excellent employee-driven safety program and have an outstanding safety record, with zero (0) loss time injuries and illnesses.\n\nIn the manufacture of SACI and the oil and fuel additives, SCT uses one regulated substance, oleum (fuming sulfuric acid).  This raw material is used in the production of sulfonic acids, which are the basic building block for our products.  \n\nThis chemical is received at Trainer by tankwagon and unloaded/stored in a registered horizontal carbon steel storage tank, with a total capacity of 18,000 gallons.  A dike designed to contain oleum surrounds the storage tank.  SCT written operational procedures prevent more than 10,000 gallons from being stored in this tank.  High-level alarms will be activated if the administrative controls fail and the tank volume reaches 14,700 gallons.\n\nSCT has developed a worst case and an alternate case scenario for the accidental release of oleum from the Trainer plant.  The worst case scenario would be the rupture of the storage tank and the release of its entire contents (163,300 lbs.) in less th"

This scenario is an highly unlikely event.\n\nControls now in place to limit the quantity released include the following: \n* Administrative controls to limit the quantity in the storage tank \n* High level alarms with interlock shut off switches\n* A concrete retention wall (dike) \n* Fixed white oil system (for vapor suppression)\n* HM200 HAZMAT foam nozzles (for vapor suppression)\nExecutive Summary - Page 2 of 3\n\n* Tankwagon unloading basin with Automatic shut-off and depressurization switch; \n* Remote emergency shut-off switch\n* Fixed water monitors for vapor suppression.    \n\nThe alternate case scenario would involve a line leak during the unloading of a tank-\nwagon of oleum due to the failure of a check valve.  This incident would occur for not more than 10 minutes.  This scenario is considered to be a more likely occurrence.  If such an incident occurred, there would be no off-site impact.\n\nControls in place to mitigate the effects of this alternate case scenario are the same as indicated above for the worst case scenario.\n\nSCT has a documented spill prevention program.  Practices which are part of our operational SOP and accidental release prevention program include numerous technological systems, i.e., backup systems and redundancies, and procedural and\nmanagerial practices, including PM and employee training in how to prevent accidental releases and how to respond should one occur.\n\nSCT has an Emergence Action Plan in place as described in our Spill Prevention and Contingency Plan.  SCT has trained and equipped HAZMAT technicians on-site to deal with emergencies.  A foam-proportioning Pumper fire truck is also available on-site, along with a trained Fire Brigade.  SCT also maintains HAZMAT mitigation equipment on-site.\n\nThe SCT emergency response program includes\n* Direct communication with the local FireBoard and LEPC via portable and mobile two-way radios.\n* A plant alarm system.\n* All telephones in"

Recommendations from this audit are currently being evaluated.\n\nExecutive Summary - Page 3of 3\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety at SCT include:\n* A redundancy of high level switches on the Oleum storage tank\n* Interlocks between the Oleum tank truck unloading switch and a blower failure in the vent system.\n* Area vapor monitors with alarms."
