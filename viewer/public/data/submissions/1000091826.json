Aspen Road\n\nAdams, NE 68301\n\n\n\nE Energy Adams, LLC (EEA) is a locally owned company consisting of nearly 800 investor owners. EEA was organized in 2005 for the purpose of developing, building, and operating an ethanol plant in southeast Nebraska (Adams Facility). Operation of the Adams Facility began in 2007 and this production plant has been steadily enhanced to keep pace with advances in the ethanol and related product industry.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\nThe Adams Facility is located near Adams, Gage County, Nebraska.  The facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol and related products such as distiller's grains, advanced protein products, and distillers oil.  Corn purchased from the surrounding community is the primary feedstock. \n\n\n\nTo support production operations, the Adams Facility has an anhydrous ammonia storage tank which exceeds the 10,000-pound on-site storage threshold established in Code of Federal Regulations Title 40 (40 CFR) Part 68 and Code of Federal Regulations Title 29 Subtitle B Chapter XVII Part 1910 (29 CFR 1910).  EEA has therefore established a Risk Management Plan (RMP) and associated systems, programs, and assessments specified in 40 CFR ?68.12(d) and 29 CFR 1910, as well as voluntary measures to assess and mitigate potential hazards from this ammonia storage.\n\n\n\nIn its original RMP, EEA also reported natural gasoline (used as a denaturant) as an RMP regulated flammable mixture. However, because the natural gasoline used at the Adams Facility does not have an National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) flammability hazard rating of 4 (it has an NFPA rating of 3), as documented by the Safety Data Sheet, the substance is exempt from being considered in the threshold applicability determination, as found in 40 CFR ?68.115(b)(2). As such, natural gasoline is not being reporte"

This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as employee training, as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the Adams Facility.  EEA's policy is to implement controls to prevent releases of regulated substances backed up by trained plant personnel who will respond in the event of a release.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\n\n\nEEA has a robust prevention program which implements the elements of both the RMP and the Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations. EEA has developed multiple Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) to identify and address potential hazards that could result in a release, such as overfilling or over-pressurization of the anhydrous ammonia tank, fire, equipment failure, etc. In addition to pressure relief valves, EEA's system incorporates process controls, such as check valves, manual and automatic shutoffs, grounding equipment, and a purge system based upon the PHA.\n\n\n\nOther elements of EEA's prevention program include: the establishment of standard operating procedures for the anhydrous ammonia system, a training program, a management of change program, and a mechanical integrity program.\n\n\n\nEEA's Process Safety Management Mechanical Integrity Program has been developed to ensure that the proper maintenance is being performed on the ammonia system to include Preventative Maintenance (PM) procedures. PM's have been developed based on manufacturers' recommendations or best management practices to ensure the equipment is maintained for optimal performance. Operators of the ammonia system have been given specific training on the relevant Standard Operating Procedures to ensure proper operations of said system. All operators and mechanics have also been given training on t"

The last analysis was completed by Z2 Safety Solutions on December 16, 2016, using a HAZOP approach, in accordance with 29 CFR ?1910.119.  This analysis directly covered the anhydrous ammonia storage tank and associated slurry line.  Based upon this PHA, EEA has made minor alterations to ammonia lines and check valves to improve process safety. \n\n\n\nRMP/PSM Audits:\n\n\n\nEEA conducts independent third-party compliance audits of the RMP and PSM programs.  The last audit was conducted by Air Regulations Consulting, LLC in September of 2020.  This audit did not find any deficiencies with the policies in place or the application of these policies.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\n\n\nThere have been no ammonia releases at the Adams Facility for the previous five years, and the facility has never had an ammonia release which impacted an off-site receptor.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program Information:\n\n\n\nEEA has numerous accidental release programs that incorporate emergency response: Spill Pollution Controls and Countermeasures Plan (SPCC); Facility Response Plan (FRP); HAZWOPER Training; and an Emergency Action Plan. All of these programs are designed to train and give direction to employees in the event of a release of a hazardous chemical.\n\nThe Adams Facility also conducts employee training as part of facility activities. EEA's corporate policy places the utmost importance on worker, public, and environmental safety, which is reflected in facility plans and training activities.\n\nEEA meets regularly with local emergency responders to communicate any changes or issues that may affect their response to an accidental release.\n\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis:\n\n\n\nIn accordance with 40 CFR ?68.25 and ?68.28, EEA develops conservative Offsite Consequence "

EEA has already made all changes recommended by the most recent PHA, and therefore does not have any immediate physical or mechanical changes planned.  EEA will also continue with regular review and analysis to improve plant safety going forward.\n\n"
