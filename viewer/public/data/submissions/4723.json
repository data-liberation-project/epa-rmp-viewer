      "SummaryText": "The Mankato Water Treatment Plant has developed this Risk Management Plan because of the amount of chlorine, a drinking water disinfectant, that is kept on-site.  Chlorine is used in one-ton cylinders, and up to 4 cylinders may be present on site at any time.  A Risk Management Plan is required by EPA rules (40 CFR 68) when a facilty stores greater than 2,500 pounds of chlorine at any one time.\n\nAn analysis of a worst case release scenario, as defined by the EPA rules, and a more likely alternate release scenario, selected from trade association guidance, was conducted and is documented in this plan.  The alternate case release scenario indicates that a radius of less than one half mile would be included in the distance to toxic endpoint.  In reality, an actual release would most likely affect even a much smaller radius, due to passive mitigation, such as the building enclosure, which was not included in the release scenario.\n\nThe Water Treatment Plant operates and maintains the chlorination system under its Process Safety Management (PSM) program, which was developed several years ago to comply with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.119.  The PSM program is designed to operate and maintain the system and the equipment in a manner that will reduce the possibility of a chlorine release.\n\nIn the event of a chlorine release, the plant has coordinated emergency response efforts with the Mankato Department of Public Safety."
