There may be, at certain times during the year no longer than 15 days, anhydrous ammonia on the property used to manufacture other forms of liquid fertilizers. Anhydrous  ammonia is a regulated toxic substance by the EPA. We do not store anhydrous ammonia on the property, as it is only transferred from railroad and truck vessels to a manufacturing unit.\n\nE observe all necessary safety precautions in handling anhydrous ammonia to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own health as well as the health of nearby members of the community. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations.\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is liquid fertilizer storage. There is no pressurized storage of anhydrous ammonia on the property. The only time we will have anhydrous ammonia on the property is when we are converting it through a manufacturing unit that produces a liquid fertilizer. During this manufacturing process we will receive anhydrous ammonia by railcar or truck. Access to the process is restricted to authorized employees and contractors. The maximum amount of exposure is the greatest transport vessel in use at one time. This is equivalent to one railcar equaling approximately less than 160,000 lbs.\n\nThe worst case release scenario is the failure of one 160,00 lb railcar resulting in total release. The distance to the endpoint of 140 ppm is 1.95 miles, based on the RMP-Comp model of gas dispersion. This distance extends beyond the facility boundary and there is estimated to be less than 8,000 residents, including commercial and industrial properties.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is a failure of a 12 ft long x 4 in diameter hose. The operator observes the leak and isolates the hose by closing the shut-off valves. Th"

This distance extends beyond the facility boundary and there are very limited, light commercial and industrial properties within this distance. There are no residences within this distance\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rules and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.\n\nFive year accident history: There has never been and accident that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering.\n\nEmergency Response Plan: It is our company policy for each of our facilities to maintain an Emergency Response Plan. This plan addresses instructions for notifying emergency response agencies and evacuation procedures. This plan is reviewed on a regular basis. In the event of an emergency, it is our policy to notify the local emergency response agency and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety: We will continue to implement our safety program to guarantee that our facility is operated in a safe and reliable manner and to ensure the safety of our employees and the surrounding community."
