The plantA?s products are used in a variety of different industries for laboratory testing and pharmaceutical and electronic components manufacturing.  \n\nTwo of the materials used by the facility are chloroform and ethyl ether, which are on the RMP Rule's list of regulated substances.  Honeywell Muskegon's storage and use of chloroform and ethyl ether exceeds the specified thresholds of 20,000 lbs. and 10,000 lbs. respectively, as defined by the EPAA?s RMP Rule.  \n\nIn accordance with the requirements of the RMP Rule, a description of the following six elements is provided for Honeywell Muskegon: \n\n1)    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies: \n\nIt is the policy of Honeywell Muskegon to operate a safe and environmentally sound facility by identifying and controlling health, safety, or environmental risks related to its operations; by designing its processes to protect people, property and the environment; by conducting and continually reviewing and improving programs for safety, health and environmental excellence; and by establishing processes to ensure that all laws and regulations applicable to its operations and products are known and observed. The accidental release prevention and emergency response policy associated specifically with the plant's use of chloroform and ethyl ether involves the integration of safety devices and technologies inherent in the design of the processes, safe operational procedures and management practices, operator training, emergency response plans, maintenance of emergency response equipment, coordination with local emergency response services, and communicating with the community. \n\n2)    Description of the Facility and the Regulated Substance Handled: \n\nHoneywell Muskego"

The Plan has been coordinated with the Muskegon Fire Department who would direct all community response activities in conjunction with the siteA?s Incident Commander.  During an emergency company personnel would serve as technical resources to public emergency responders as well as coordinate safe evacuation of onsite personnel, recovery and start-up operations.  The company organizes and conducts plant emergency drills and exercises, both internally and jointly with public emergency responders.  Plant tours are conducted for public emergency responders to familiarize them with the facility layout, potential hazards and emergency response plans.\n\n6)    Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nProcess hazard analyses (PHAs) of Honeywell MuskegonA?s stationary sources of chloroform and ethyl ether were completed in July and September 2007, respectively.  The purpose of these systematic safety reviews, is to identify opportunities to improve upon the existing safeguards of the covered source and to further reduce the potential for accidental release. The process hazard analysis for the chloroform and ethyl ether stationary sources will be reviewed and revalidated at least every five years and resulting improvements made as appropriate.\n\n\n\nRichard C.
