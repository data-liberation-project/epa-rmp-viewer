      "SummaryText": "The 4.5-mgd Williams Street Water Treatment Facility provides potable water to residents of Newton County.  The plant consists of raw water intake pumps, settling basins, duel media filters, a chlorination system for disinfection, a clearwell and distribution pumps.  The plant began operations in 1948 and was expanded in 1973.  The facility is leased by Newton County and operated by the City of Covington.\n\nChemical Safety\nThe City of Covington complies with the Hazardous Communications standard set forth by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Compliance is accomplished by compiling a hazardous chemical list, using Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS's), ensuring that containers are labeled, and providing employee training.  The purpose of the program is to alert and educate employees about chemicals in the workplace by giving them greater access to information on the physical and health hazards of chemicals, safe handling and storage precautions and emergency first aid procedures.  It applies to all employees who may be exposed to hazardous substances during the scope of their employment.\nThe Safety/Risk Manager has overall responsibility for the program and provides reviews and updates as needed.  Copies of the written program can be obtained from the Safety/Risk Manager.\nEach department head maintains a list of all hazardous chemicals used by their departments These lists are updated as necessary.  Each foreman or employee in charge has available a list of chemicals applicable to their area of employment.  The Safety/Risk Manager maintains a master list of all the chemicals.\nMaterial Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) provide specific information on chemicals used.  Each department head maintains a binder containing all MSDS for every chemical substance used by employees in their department.  A binder containing all MSDS on every chemical substance purchased and used by the city is available to all employees.  Aside from the main MSDS binder, department heads "

It should be noted that LandView III uses 1990 census data and the current population will most likely be greater than indicated.\nThe worst case release scenario is the failure of a one-ton cylinder, yielding a release of 2,000 lbs of chlorine to the atmosphere over a period of 10 minutes.  Using the EPA tables, the distance to the endpoint for urban conditions is 1.3 miles.\nThe alternative or more likely release scenario is a leak in one of the ton vessels.  For this analysis it has been assumed chlorine  will be released through a <-in. diameter hole.  Exhibit 4-13 in the EPA Guidance Document indicates a release rate of 150 lbs/min and a distance to the endpoint of 0.2 miles for urban conditions.\n\nAccident Release Prevention Program\nActive environmental, health and safety programs with regards to the safe handling of chlorine and chlorination equipment are in place at the plant.  The following are excerpts from the City of Covingtons Safety Policies and Procedures Manual\nHandling:\n7 All operators are trained in safe handling of chlorine.\n7 A self-contained breathing apparatus must be used, when connecting or disconnecting chlorine cylinders.  Self-contained breathing equipment are available wherever gas or liquid chlorine is in use.  These units are approved by the National Institute of Occupational Safety an Health (NIOSH).\n7 The two-man rule is used. for all connecting and disconnecting of chlorine cylinders (two men present, one in SCBA the other on standby).\n7 Adequate ventilation shall be provided at all times.\n7 It is optional to use the chlorine detectors (detects chlorine concentrations so small that they are impossible to smell).  A chorine detector can"

      "SummaryText": " give early warning, so a small leak can be stopped before it becomes larger).\n\nOne Ton Chlorine Cylinder Storage:\n7 Cool, clean, dry place with adequate ventilation.\n7 Away from other chemicals and equipment.\n7 Always use lifting clamps or cradles - do not use ropes, cables or chains when moving.\n7 Keep the protective cap on the cylinder when it is not in use.\n7 Mark empty containers and store them aside from full containers\n\nFirst Aid:\n7 First aid for eyes exposed to chlorine is immediate irrigation with flowing water for at least 15 minutes, and contact a physician immediately\n.7 If skin is exposed to liquid chlorine, it can cause bums.  The skin should be washed with flowing water for 30 minutes.  If the skin is burned, contact a physician immediately.  Chlorine gas can become trapped in the clothing and react with body moisture to from hydrochloric acid which could burn the skin. Remove the clothing of the victim and wash the body down with water.\n7 In case of inhalation, remove the victim to fresh air, administer oxygen if available, call a physician or transport the injured person to a medical facility.\n\nWarning:\n7 When entering a room that may contain chlorine gas, open the door slightly and check for the smell of chlorine.  NEVER go into a room containing chlorine gas with harmful concentration in the air without a self-contained air supply, protective clothing and help standing by.\n\nIn addition to the above, the City of Covingtons Safety Policies and Procedures Manual has specific sections on Accident Reporting, Personal Protective Equipment, and Respirator Programs.\n\nAccident History\nBecause of the in-place policies, an accidental release of chlorine has not occurred at the Williams Street Water Treatment Facility within the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThe Williams Street Water Treatment Facility is included in the communitys emergency response plan.  Response to incidents are handled by the Covington Fire Department.\n\nPlanned Safety Ch"
