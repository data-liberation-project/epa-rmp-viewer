      "SummaryText": "The Princeton Wastewater Treatment Facility uses chlorine and sulfur dioxide in the treatment of domestic sewage.  The plant personnel are trained, in the safe handling of these chemicals and the emergency repair of the ton cylinders the chemicals are stored in, through seminars sponsored by the chemical suppliers. The plant personnel are trained in the use of SCBA by the Princeton Fire Department. We have procedures to follow for the delivery and off loading of these chemicals from the delivery truck. The chlorine and Sulphur Dioxide are delivered in one ton cylinders. We inspect each cylinder for damage or corrosion. As the cylinder is lifted, we observe how the cylinder is balanced. If the cylinder tilts to one end, this indicates sediment in the bottom of the cylinder and won't be off loaded. Each time a new cylinder is connected to the feeder, the connection is tested for leaks. The connection is retested later the same day. After a new cylinder is connected tothe feeder, the feeder is performanced checked. The chemical room is equiped with two exhaust fans with ducting at floor level. These fans are automatically operated when the chemical room doors are opened. There are two SCBA wall mounted outside the chemical room. There is a chlorine and sulphur dioxide repair kit in the same location. The chemical feeder systems are vacuum operated. Should a leak occur in the feed line, the loss of vacuum would shut off the vacuum regulator at the cylinder. All chemical feeders are rebuilt by the manufacturer. We have had no accidental chemical release during the past five years. Should a worst case accidental chemical release occur, plant personnel would contact the Princeton Fire Department for assistance. Also, the Mercer County LEPC would be notified. In the future, we intend to eliminate these chemicals from our process with alternative methods. Until these chemicals are eliminated, we are looking into the addition of a chemical monitoring system to work with our e"
