Facility Policy:  The owners, management and employees of Essex Elevator, Inc. (the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accident should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any releases and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage and sale of anhydrous ammonia fertilizer to local area farmers as a crop production nutrient. The maximum quantity stored would be about 227,630 pounds in one (1) - 12,000 gallon steel, pressurized storage tank (about 52,530 pounds) and fourty (40) - 1,000 gallon steel, pressurized nurse tanks (about 175,100 pounds).\n\n3. Worst Case & Alternate Case Release Scenarios: A) The Worst Case Scenario would be the release of the total contents of the largest storage tank as a gas over a period of ten (10) minutes. The maximum quantity released is estimated to be about 52,530 pounds which represents the largest storage tank at 85 % capacity as limited by design standrads. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is estimated to be about 0.8 miles. B) The Alternate Case Release Scenario, based on the Five Year Accident History, or the most likely potential incident, would be the release from a break in a transfer hose. This is estimated to about 26,640 pounds from a 25' length of 3 hose over a period of two (2) minutes until an automatic or manual shut-off intervenes to stop the flow of gas. The distance to the endpoint is estimated to be about 0.5 miles.\n\n4. Accidental release Prevention Program:  The facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling"

(ANSI) and the standards of the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\n5. Five Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five (5) years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage. Nor, to the best of our knowledge, resulted in any off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program: The facility has: A) a written Emergency Action Plan (EAP) prepared in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and B) provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety:  Safety improvement is an ongoing process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific changes in safety procedures recommended for implementation at this time."
