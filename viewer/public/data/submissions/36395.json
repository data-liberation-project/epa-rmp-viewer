Facility Policy.\n\n     The owners, management and employees of Farmers Coop Association (Libertyville) are committed to providing a safe workplace free of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.   Health, safety, and environmental compliance are a fundamental part of every employee's job.  It is facility protocol to adhere to applicable Federal, State, and local laws and to implement     appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia and propane.  If an accidental release were to occur, the facility would respond in accordance with its Emergency Action Plan and is prepared to work with local fire department, the Local Emergency Planning Committee and other authorities to control and mitigate the release and minimize the impact of the release to employees, the environment, and the general public.\n\n2.  Facility Information.\n\n     The primary activity at the facility is the storage and handling of fertilizers for the direct sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in two storage tanks of 26,000 gal and 30,000 gal.  These tanks are located at the far West of the plant.  Anhydrous ammonia is also stored in six 1450 gal wagons and thirty-five 1000 gal wagons.  These wagons are stored next to the storage tanks.  The maximum quantity of Anhydrous ammonia would be 437,000 pounds.   \n                                                                                                                                                 \n3.  Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario.\n\n     a.     The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage\n              tank released as gas over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quanity released \n              would be 127,500 pounds, which"

The distance to the end \n              point (point of dispersion to  200 parts per million, or ppm) is 2.6 miles.\n\n     b.     The alternate release scenario, based on the five-year accident history (or the most\n             likely potential incident), is as follows:  The alternate release scenario is a release \n             from a break in a 3 - inch transfer hose followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes \n             before an automatic or manual shut-off intervenes and stops the flow of ammonia.  The\n             maximum quantity released would be 69 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint (point\n             of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.56 miles.\n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program.     \n   \n     1) Safety Information: The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with applicable\n     Federal and State of Iowa regulations.  All plans and procedures maintained at the facility are\n     periodically reviewed by facility management for safety updates and changes.  Material Safety\n     Data Sheets, equipment specifications and the codes and standards used to build and operate\n     the anhydrous ammonia and propane equipment are maintained at the facility.\n\n     2) Hazard Review: Facility management conducts reviews of the hazards associated with the\n     handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia and propane.  The reviews identify the opportunity\n     for equipment malfunctions or human errors that could cause an accidental release, the safeguards\n     used to control hazards and prevent releases, and the steps used to detect or monitor releases.\n     The results of the reviews are documented and problems identified are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n     3) Operating Procedures: The facility maintains written procedures for the handling and storage of\n     anhydrous ammonia and propane.  The procedures generally follow the pr"

Training for all employees consists of classroom type instruction (e.g. reading safety\n     information, operating procedures, response measures followed by a written test.) and on-the-job\n     supervision.  All employees are trained annually.  The training program is reviewed by facility\n     management on a regular basis and revised as necessary.  \n\n     5) Maintenance: The facility maintains written equipment inspection and maintenance procedures.\n     Storage and transfer/process equipment inspections are preformed by qualified personnel on\n     an annual basis and are documented.  Equipment maintenance procedures follow either instructions\n     furnished by the equipment vendors, Federal or State regulations, or Industry Codes.

The audit will be documented and conducted by a person knowledgeable\n     in the safe handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia and propane.  Corrective actions required\n     as a result of each compliance audit will be performed and documented.\n\n     7) Incident Investigation: Facility management will investigate each incident that results, or could have\n     reasonably resulted in a catastrophic release of anhydrous ammonia.
