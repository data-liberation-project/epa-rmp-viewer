      "SummaryText": "The Air Liquide Advanced Materials (ALAM), facility in Upper Mt. Bethel (UMB), Pennsylvania produces specialty materials for the semiconductor and photovoltaic industries.  \r\n\r\nA. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nIt is the intent of ALAM to provide a safe work environment for every employee, and to protect them from injury and illness resulting from unsafe acts or conditions during hours of employment. ALAM complies with all Federal, State, and local laws. The Site Leader has the responsibility for leadership of the safety and health program, for its effectiveness and improvement, and for providing the safeguards required to ensure safe conditions.\r\n\r\nALAM takes many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases. These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions such as pressure increase that could cause a system failure, a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the ongoing integrity of the systems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel, and emergency response procedures which enable trained personnel to respond quickly to system upsets.\r\n\r\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\nThe ALAM-UMB, Pennsylvania facility utilizes silane, which is stored on site in 20-foot tube trailers and potentially in 40-foot tube trailers. Silane is the only regulated substance handled at the UMB facility above threshold quantities. \r\n\r\nC. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nAs the silane operation is a Program 1 covered process, a documented prevention program is not required.  However, the UMB facility has implemented programs to prevent accidental releases, such as Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Reviews, Hazards Analysis, Mechanical Integrity Program, Operating Procedures and Training, Incident Reporti"

      "SummaryText": "ng and Investigation, Program Reviews and Audit to identify improvement opportunities.\r\n \r\nD. Five-Year Accident History\r\nIn the last five years, there have been no accidental releases of a regulated substance that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off site deaths, injuries evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\r\n\r\nE. Emergency Response Program\r\nALAM's facility emergency response plan complies with the OSHA requirements (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.120).  This plan contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to fires, accidental releases and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures. The plan is coordinated with the local community response plan and is available to those responding agencies.  Emergency planning and Community Right-To-Know information as required under SARA Title III has been provided to the PA State Emergency Response Commission, Northampton County Local Emergency Planning Committee, and other appropriate agencies, such as the local fire department, Upper Mt. Bethel Fire Department.  The facility interacts with various local agencies in its emergency planning such as the Local Emergency Planning Committee, fire departments, law enforcement agencies, and hospitals.  Employees receive annual training in the response plan and in the competencies relative to their required roles in the plan.  Periodic drills are conducted at the facility and may include participation by outside responding agencies.\r\n\r\nF. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nSafety improvements are a continual and ongoing process at the plant.  Review of process hazards is constant through programs such as management of change procedures, operator training, incident investigation, and mechanical integrity programs.  As a result, changes relevant to safety occur as needs are identified through these procedures and policies."
