Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Eveready Products Corporation are strongly committed to employee, public and \nenvironmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental \nrelease prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, \nmaintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy \nto implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Contract manufacturer of aerosol products.  We have \n4 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Isobutane  [Propane, 2-\nmethyl], Methyl ether  [Methane, oxybis-], Propane and Difluoroethane  [Ethane, 1,1-difluoro-].  \nIsobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl] is used for an aerosol propellant.  Methyl ether  [Methane, \noxybis-] is used for an aerosol propellant.  Propane is used for an aerosol propellant.  \nDifluoroethane  [Ethane, 1,1-difluoro-] is used for an aerosol propellant.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl] that is expected to be present in this \nfacility based on process/operational  requirements is 21161.68 lb. while Methyl ether  [Methane, \noxybis-], Propane and Difluoroethane  [Ethane, 1,1-difluoro-] are expected to be present at our \nfacility in quantities of 13546.84 lb., 13427.65 lb. and 11083.82 lb. respectively.\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release \n\nScenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to \nlimit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's \nOCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the \nchosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case rel"

In this scenario 8300 lb. of \nFlammable Mixture: Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl], Propane is released. It is assumed that the \nentire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the \nreleased quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, \nthe calculated distance of 0.16 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi \noverpressure.\n\nOne alternative release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances involves a \nrelease from A75, Tanks 15 and 16.  The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud \nExplosion.  The scenario involves the release of 8300 lb. of Flammable Mixture: Isobutane  \n[Propane, 2-methyl], Propane in 10 minutes. The release is also controlled by active mitigation \nmeasures that include Fire Water Monitors.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum \ndistance to the flammable endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 0.08 miles.\n\nAnother alternative release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances \ninvolves a release from DME/152a, Tanks 11 and 12.  The release is assumed to result in a \nVapor Cloud Explosion.  The scenario involves the release of 12000 lb. of Flammable Mixture: \nMethyl ether  [Methane, oxybis-], Difluoroethane  [Ethane, 1,1-difluoro-] in 10 minutes. The \nrelease is also controlled by active mitigation measures that include Fire Water Monitors.  Under \nneutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 psi \noverpressure is 0.07 miles.\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-\nSpecific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention \nrequirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and \nconstructed in accordance with NFPA-58 "

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is  \nHAZOP.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in \nengineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of five years.  Any \nfindings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent \nPHA/update was performed on 06/11/1999.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Eveready Products \nCorporation maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of \noperation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, \nemergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is \nregularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\n\nEveready Products Corporation has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that \nemployees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated \nwith these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more \nfrequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nEveready Products Corporation carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process \nequipment to ensure proper operations.
