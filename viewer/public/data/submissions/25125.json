      "SummaryText": "The Aurora Cooperative Elevator Company's accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  The Aurora Cooperative emergency response plan involves the response services available in the community.  Aurora Cooperative bulk anhydrous ammonia facilities have been strategically located to proved a local retail facility for this form of affordable nitrogen fertililzer for agriculture.  This location in Carleton, Nebraska is made up of two (2) 30,000 gallon pressurized storage vessels, related piping, and storage for up to seventy-two (72) 1000 and/or 1500 gallon nurse tanks.  It serves primarily the Nuckolls and Thayer County Nebraska area.  This facility is normally manned.  The offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two anhydrous ammonia release scenarios, identified as \"worst case release\" and \"alternate scenario\".  The first scenario is defined by EPA which states \"owner or operator shall assume that the...maximum quantity of the largest vessel...is released as a gas over a 10 minute period, due to an unspecified failure\".  The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst case scenario\".  Atmospheric dispersion modeling has to be performed to determine the distance traveled by the anhydrous ammonia released before it's concentration is decreased to a \"non-toxic\" level.  For this purpose, Aurora Cooperative has chosen to use RMP-Comp Version 1.05 to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint (.14mg/l or 200 ppm).  To determine the population affected by a potential release we used maps extracted from Landview 3 software.  The worst case release for Aurora Cooperative - Carleton involves failure of one of the 30,000 gallon pressurized storage vessels while it contains 85% (maximum allowed) of it's capacity.  The alternative release scenario is based on the failure of a three inch transfer hose, assuming complete failure of the in-line check "
