This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processing plants.  \n\nOur policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain and control the release.\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Beaver Gas Plant is located approximately 7.8 miles southwest of the town of Turpin, Oklahoma.  \n\nThe plant operates a low temperature, liquid separation process for the production of \u00bfY grade\u00bf natural gas liquids (NGLs).  These liquids are made up of propanes, butanes, and heavier hydrocarbons.\n\nAdditionally, dehydrated natural gas (methane, ethane) is produced at the facility.  All of these substances are regulated substances for purposes of risk management planning.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThe Beaver Gas Plant has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past five (5) years.  There have been no onsite or offsite accidents, as defined by EPA\u00bfs General Guidance on Risk Management Programs. \n\n\nEmergency Response Program Information\n\nThe Beaver Gas Plant maintains a written Emergency Response Plan, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address the aspects of emergency response including first aid, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergen"
