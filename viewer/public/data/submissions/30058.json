      "SummaryText": "    Introduction\n\nUSEPA's RMP rule (40 CFR 68), published in the Federal Register on June 20, 1996, and as amended by Final Rule on April 9, 2004, was developed to assist facilities in preventing accidental releases of highly toxic or flammable chemicals.  The RMP rule applies to an owner or operator of a stationary source that has more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance in a process, as determined under ?68.115.\n\nThe USEPA has established three tiers of requirements to reduce the level of effort for facilities with a lower risk of offsite impacts.  These tiers are known as Programs 1, 2, and 3.  Program 1 applies to any process that has not had an accidental release with prescribed offsite consequences for five years and has no public receptors impacted by a worst-case release.  Program 3 applies to processes in specified industries, and to all processes subject to the OSHA PSM standard, unless the process is eligible for Program 1.  Program 2 applies to processes not covered by Programs 1 or 3.\n\nThe South Bend Water Works Pinhook Filtration Plant and Well Field utilizes more than the threshold quantity of chlorine (2,500 pounds) in their process.  Therefore, this facility is required to resubmit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) as defined in ?68.150 by June 21, 2004 (five years after the initial submission).  Since public employees are covered under the state-delegated OSHA program, the Pinhook Filtration Plant and Well Field is subject to the OSHA PSM standard and is therefore subject to Program 3 requirements.\n\nUSEPA's RMP rule requires that covered facilities prepare an executive summary.  The following pages represent the executive summary, summarizing the items required as described in ?68.155 (a) through (f).\n\n    ?68.155(a) Accidental Release and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIn order to ensure the safety of the South Bend Water Works chlorination systems, the South Bend Water Works depends on the commitment and team effort of their employees and suppl"

      "SummaryText": "iers.  The top management at the City of South Bend supports this commitment and team effort.\n\nThe South Bend Water works has established a Prevention Program to ensure the integrity of the chlorination systems and minimize the potential for releases.  The Prevention Plan contains safety information relating to chlorine and the chlorination system and establishes standard protocols for items such as system operations, maintenance, system changes, contractor safety, and incident investigation.  The Prevention Plan also describes training for employees on the safe operation of the chlorination systems.  In addition, at least once a year, South Bend Water Works chlorine provider sponsors a training seminar on safety and handling of chlorine, which is attended by both South Bend Water Works and South Bend Fire Department employees.  \n\nThe South Bend Water Works has established emergency response procedures, which are documented in the South Bend Water Works Distribution Department Emergency Response Plan.  South Bend Water Works facilities containing chlorine are equipped with ambient chlorine detectors (inside the chlorine ton container rooms), ambient level displays (outside the chlorine ton container rooms), and audible alarms (outside the chlorine ton container rooms).  \n\nThe ton cylinders are equipped with vacuum regulators, through which chlorine gas flows to the injector under vacuum.  Loss of vacuum causes the vacuum-regulating valve to automatically shut off the gas supply at the source.  A scrubber is present at this facility that is capable of mitigating the release of chlorine from one of the 1-ton containers.  The South Bend Fire Department, whose members are aware of the presence of chlorine at the facilities and trained to respond to such emergencies, will respond to all potential releases from South Bend Water Works facilities.\n\n    ?68.155(b) Stationary Source and Substance Handled\n\nThe stationary source subject to 40 CFR Part 68 is the Pinhook Filtration "

      "SummaryText": "Plant and Well Field facility.  This location is a 14.6-mgd facility consisting of four wells with pumping capacities of 3.7-mgd, 3.5-mgd, 3.7-mgd, and 3.7-mgd.  Water from these wells is treated by the following sequence of processes: pre-aeration chlorination, aeration, pre-filtration chlorination, filtration, high service pumping, fluoride addition, and final chlorination.  The groundwater is then pumped into the South Bend Water Works distribution system by three of the four high service discharge pumps.  Each high service discharge pump has a capacity of 4-mgd; however one pump always remains on standby.  The resulting distribution capacity of the facility is 12-mgd.\n\nThe Pinhook Filtration Plant and Well Field facility uses two 1-ton chlorine containers connected in parallel to supply chlorine to the pumped water.  These containers are located inside of a building.  A vacuum automatic transfer valve isolates one container.  An additional five 1-ton containers, which may be empty or full, can be stored inside the building in the same room as the two in-use containers.\n\nA vacuum draws gaseous chlorine from the 1-ton containers to a chlorinator located inside the building.  In the chlorinator, the gaseous chlorine is mixed with treated water (pumped to provide a higher pressure for injection) to form a chlorine solution.  The chlorine solution is then injected at one of three locations: 1) at a pit, for pre-aeration chlorination; 2) into the aeration basin, for pre-filtration chlorination; and 3) at an outside pit into the high service main, for final chlorination.  The filtered, chlorinated water is then distributed to South Bend Water Works customers.\n\n    ?68.155(c) Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe Prevention Plan describes measures taken at the South Bend Water Works facilities to prevent releases.  The South Bend Water Works has a Prevention Program for the chlorine systems, which is documented in the Prevention Plan.  These prevention measures includ"

The Prevention Plan also indicates that the South Bend Water Works performs regular maintenance activities on the chlorination system as established in a documented maintenance schedule.  The South Bend Water Works has performed a process hazard analysis of the chlorination systems to identify potential release scenarios and potential system improvements.\n\n    ?68.155(d) Five-Year Accident History\n\nThe Pinhook Filtration Plant and Well Field has had no accidental releases of chlorine in the last five years that have resulted in on-site injuries or off-site injuries or other off-site impacts.\n\n    ?68.155(e) Emergency Response Program\n\nSouth Bend Water Works employees would coordinate with the South Bend Fire Department if a release were to occur at the Pinhook Filtration Plant and Well Field.  The emergency response procedures are outlined in the South Bend Water Works Distribution Department Emergency Response Plan.  South Bend Water Works facilities containing chlorine are equipped with chlorine detectors with audible alarms.  The chlorine processes are equipped with vacuum regulators, which terminate flow if a release occurs.  A SCADA system sends an alarm signal via computer and telephone to the South Bend Water Works office and on-call personnel.\n\n    ?68.155(f) Safety Improvements\n\nThe most recent Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), during which recommendations for safety improvements were considered, was completed per OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119(e) in March of 2004."
