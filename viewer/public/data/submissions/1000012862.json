Worthington Cylinders, Inc.(WCI), owned by Worthington Industries, Inc., has instituted Accidental Release Prevention policy utilizing an integrated procedural, technological and managerial plan.  That plan incorporates the following points;\ni. Full incorporation of Process Safety Management principals for the handling and storage of regulated materials.  \nii. Utilization of a well trained unloading crew or personnel.\niii. Utilization of a safe, well maintained unloading facility, ongoing management of interest, involvement, oversight and process support.\n\nWCI's Emergency Response policy, based on an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) approach has been compiled.  The ICP method incorporates various response scenarios.  The specific scenarios detail appropriate response activities and agency or service contacts that may or are required during incident responses and subsequent follow up actions.  The ICP also designates a command and control structure for ensuring clear communications between responding personnel and local, state or federal agencies. Implementation of all applied procedures (or suggested practices) of the Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program (RMP has been included).\n\nB. WCI manufactures small, (@ 14 oz.) flammable-gas filled, steel canisters.  The canisters are normally utilized as Propylene or Propane gas-operated, homeowner torches.  Bulk delivery, of the gases, occurs by either commercial truck or tanker rail car90s).  The gases are transferred to bulk storage (a tank farm) prior to the manufacturing bottle filling process.  Packaged bulk storage (after bottling, before shipping) occurs within an on-site warehouse.  Typically, the total amount of any one gas on-site is between 25,000-500,000 pounds.\n\nC. The Offsite Consequence Analysis includes consideration of both a Worst Case release and an Alternative release scenario for all regulated materials.  The Worst Case release scenario has been de"

      "SummaryText": "fined by the EPA as owner or operator shall assume that the maximum quantity of product, from the largest storage vessel, is released in its normal state over a 10 minute period.  In the case of liquefied gases, the normal state would be primarily a vapor state.  The Alternative  release scenario has been defined as the case more likely to occur than a worst Case scenario.\n\n\n\n\nLiquefied Petroleum Gas\n\nThe Worst Case scenario would entail the rupture of a storage tank suddenly releasing approximately 108000 pounds of PROPANE gas. By company specified, operational policy, this amount represents 85% of the storage tanks capacity.  The release will be assumed to occur over 10 minutes.\n\nUsing a Vapor Cloud explosion model, OCA Section 5.1, the Endpoint distance, the distance required to reach the specified 1 PSI Overpressure limit, may be found by either utilizing the EPA OCA Reference Tables or by direct calculation employing Equation C-1.\n\nThe Alternative Case scenario would be the rupture or breakage of an unloading hose or transfer pipeline releasing less than 100 pounds of PROPANE gas.  Certified piping and tank installations, utilizing excess flow, spring-loaded emergency shutoff, check and glove valves would limit any gas release to the contents of the unloading hose or transfer pipelines.  Again, any release would be limited to maximum 10-minute duration.\n\nFor the Alternative Case scenario, the Endpoint LFL distance 9the distance to which radiant heat effects of a vapor cloud fire would have serious consequences) may be derived utilizing for guidance, OCA Section 12.1. Section 12.1 discusses the impact distance resulting from vapor cloud detonation issuing from an evaporating pool of flammable liquid.\n\nUsing OCA Table 21, the resulting estimated vapor cloud detonation endpoint distance is <0.06 miles.\n\nD. The WCI accidental release prevention program is based on the following parameters:\ni. Compliance with the OSHA mandated PSM rule\nii. Use of cl"
