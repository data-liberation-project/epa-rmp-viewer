      "SummaryText": "ty is set aside as a wildlife habitat and location of the employee recreation area. We manufacture titanium dioxide (TiO2), under the trade name TiPure as our primary product.  Titanium dioxide is manufactured via the chloride process in which titanium dioxide ore is chlorinated to titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4); the TiCl4 is subsequently re-oxidized to refined TiO2. A small amount of TiCl4 is further processed for sale as a by product. Sodium Chloride (salt) is also produced as a by product from the TiO2 manufacturing process.   The RMP covered chemicals we handle are detailed in the following:\nTOXIC-USE AT JOHNSONVILLE\nChlorine-Produce Titanium Tetrachloride\nTitanium Tetrachloride-Intermediate used in the manufacture of TiO2\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nIn the past five years, we have had four (4) accidental releases that resulted in (4) OSHA recordable injuries. Our on site medical department or first aid responders treated the injured and all returned to work. We conduct formal incident investigations to identify and correct the root cause for all safety incidents.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nJohnsonville's emergency response program is contained in our Emergency Manual.
