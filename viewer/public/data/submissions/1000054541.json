The tank contains more than 10,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, therefore it is considered a level 3 program. \n\n\n\nACT believes that the health, safety, and preservation of our environment are critical to business success. We are committed to:\n\n\n\nProviding a safe work environment for employees and visitors.\n\nConducting business with respect to the community.\n\nMeeting or exceeding environmental health & safety laws and regulations.\n\nTraining employees on how to perform their jobs in a safe manner.\n\n\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia is stored in a pressure vessel on the property. The ammonia tank is equipped with safety relief valves that are designed to release pressure if the tank becomes over pressurized. The tank is also equipped with excessive flow valves that are designed to shut down the flow of ammonia if a sudden release should occur. The tank and the distribution system are equipped with appropriate pressure relief devices which are routed to a scrubber to minimize emissions to the atmosphere. \n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for the tank was calculated using RMP-Comp. An alternative release scenario for the tank was calculated using RMP-Comp that involved a pipe leak. This would be quickly detected by operating personnel and quickly controlled by a combination of operating procedures and excess flow valves. \n\n\n\nIn the event of a release that could impact the community, ACT advises those in the area to shelter in place until the plume dissipates. This involves shutting the windows and turning off the air conditioning and other ventilation systems. Employees on site at ACT are instructed to follow the evacuation procedures outlined in the emergency action plan. \n\n\n\nNo reportable accidents have occurred at this site within the last 5 years. \n\n\n\nEmployees involved with the process are trained in proper handling procedures for anhy"
