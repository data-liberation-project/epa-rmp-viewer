We have made the commitment to knowingly engage or participate in no activity that may jeopardize public health or the environment. ProCaribe will conduct its operations in an environmentally prudent manner in order to protect public health, public safety, employee health, employee safety, willife and the environment. All of our employees will perform their duties in accordance to local and Federal Environmental Laws and in accordance to Company Policies.\n\nBusiness Activities:\nProCaribe is a fully refrigerated propane marine terminal. We have a refrigerated storage capacity of 250,000 BBLS in three refrigerated storage tanks, an additional 120,000 gallons are stored in four pressurized bullets. We are engaged in the wholesale business, our primary customers are LPG distributors. We also serve as back up fuel supply to a 500 MW Power Generating Plant.\n\nPrevention Program:\nWe are covered by OSHA 29 CFR 1910 9 (PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT). Since the the nature of the business is to handle and maintain propane inventories, everything is covered by PSM except the waste water handling activities.  The most important element of our prevention program is the computerized preventive maintenance system.The reliability and integrity of the plant is assured, leaving little margin for error. Our Training Program in the other hand closes the error margin, it allows our personnel to complement the maintenance program with their input in maintenance and operational issues.\n\nAccident History:\nIn the History of the Terminal no accidental release of propane has ever resulted offsite and in plant nor deaths or injuries. No environmental restoration activity has ever been conducted as a result of an accidental release of propane.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nThe Emergency Response Plan h"

Personnel are trained in the following manner, refresher training and drills are performed with the participation of local response groups.\n\nPlans to Improve Safety:\nOur goal is to continuously upgrade and improve the quality of safety.   Improvements are generated by adding new technologies, emergency response equipment, providing response training and making critical systems redundant as additional back-up to help respond to emergencies.  We have a capital investment budget dedicated to the implementation of new technologies and  the resolution of safety and environmental concerns raised by the 2 years internal Safety Audits or by the 5 year HAZOP reviews. At ProCaribe there are no compromises when it comes to Safety."
