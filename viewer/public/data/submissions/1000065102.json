If an accidental release would occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and all other fire response agencies.  \n\n\n\nFacility information: The primary activity for this Propane tank at this facility is for the storage and shipment of Propane to it's producers.  The maximum quantity stored for Propane is 107,355 pounds.\n\n\n\nWorst Case and Alternative Release Scenario: The alternative release scenario for propane is based on the failure of a 30,000 gallon (107,355 pound) tank resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  According to EPA Look-Up Tables, based on less vapor being involved in the explosion (.67 factor multiplied by the .43 endpoint) the end point would be .29 miles.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program: The Propane Tank is designed, installed and maintained according to NFPA-58, State and Local lawns.  This facility is inspected on a monthly basis.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program: The facility has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38, provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right to know information required under SARA Title III (EPCRA): and have coordinated with emergency responders.\n\n\n\nAaron Guggisberg - Safety Director "
