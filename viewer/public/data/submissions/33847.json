      "SummaryText": "California Portland Cement Company is in the process of installing an Ammonia Injection System at its Colton Plant to denox the effluents of its fluidized bed power plant.  Aqueous ammonia plays an important role in reducing the emissions from the plant.  Given the quantity of aqueous ammonia and that no threshold concentration is specified in the current version of the regulations, the Colton Plant should comply with California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) regulation.  Based on worst case release calculations, it has been concluded that Colton Plant may comply with program level 1 of CalARP.\n\nCalifornia Portland Cement has established a comprehensive safety and emergency response programs to minimize the likelihood and severity of all potential accidental mishaps at the plant including release of aqueous ammonia from the Ammonia Injection System.  Colton Plant staff is highly trained and utilizes modern equipment to monitor plant operations..\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nCalifornia Portland Cement has adopted and implemented safety and emergency response policies.  The policies are designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nThe implementation plan for the emergency response and safety policies include specific steps that Colton Plant management expect its employees to take to protect their own and of other employees and community health and safety.  \n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe Ammonia Injection System at Colton Plant is used for reducing emissions of harmful gases from the boilers used to provide steam to the plant and a 40 mW electric power plant.  Ammonia is stored in a 10,000 gallon storage tank, which is designed, constructed and installed according to latest vessel codes and standards.  The tanks is located inside a secondary containment, that can easily contain the entire "

      "SummaryText": "contents of the tank.  \n\nAqueous ammonia is pumped from the storage tank using two centrifugal pumps into injection manifolds.  From the manifold, aqueous ammonia is injected into boiler effluent cyclones where it reacts with effluent gases.  \n\nThe storage tank of the system is located next to the fluidized bed boiler and its associated cyclones.  The pumps are located within the secondary containment.  Therefore, any leaks from the pumps or associated piping or valves will be confined to the secondary containment.  The pipes that carry aqueous ammonia to the injection manifolds are routed via dedicated pipe racks next to the cyclone.  The piping are protected by the cyclones from exposure to any external forces.  In fact the entire system is located at an isolated area of the plant and is not exposed to any vehicle traffic or other external sources of potential harm. \n\n\nHazard Assessment Summary\n\nA worst case release analysis was conducted using Federal EPAs recommended assumptions and methodology for dispersion analysis.  The entire contents of the storage tank (i.e., 10,000 gallons) was assumed to be spilled into the diked area at 77oF (for an average ambient condition) and 110oF (modeling worst possible condition of the liquid itself that may never take place).  Using the methodologies prescribed by Federal EPA for aqueous ammonia evaporation from a pool and dispersion downwind (assuming F stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed), it was concluded that for both temperature levels, ammonia vapors will not reach an offsite receptor above the threshold concentration (i.e., 200 ppm) specified in the regulations.  \n\nFrom this analysis it was concluded that the Ammonia Injection System at Colton Plant may comply with program level 1 of CalARP.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nCalifornia Portland Cement has established a strict safety policy and implementation program.  As part of this program, the potential hazards of the aqueou"

      "SummaryText": "s ammonia is recognized and the proper handling of that substance is expected of the employees.  The instructions provided in Material Safety Data Sheet of aqueous ammonia is followed.  All employees have been made aware of the hazards of aqueous ammonia.\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nSince the Ammonia Injection System is a newly installed system, there have been no reportable releases of aqueous ammonia at Colton Plant in the past 5 years.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nCalifornia Portland Cement has an emergency response plan in effect for the Colton Plant to handle potential emergency situations at this facility.  Key elements of the Emergency Response Plan include specific steps that Colton Plant management expect  its employees to take to protect health of the employees and the community.  The plan includes key phone numbers and contact points, vicinity and evacuation maps, plans for evacuation, fire, injury, earthquake, chemical spill, and health hazards.  The plan includes requirements for conducting exercises and training sessions to ensure that all employees of the plant are knowledgeable about the emergency response plan.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Ammonia Injection System has been designed according to the latest industry codes, standards and practices.  To minimize the possibility of any unconfined spill the storage tank, pumps, valves and truck unloading connection points are installed inside a diked area.  As mentioned above the storage tank, pumps, valves and piping are located in an area of the plant that is isolated from other activities and therefore the system is not exposed to any external sources of harm.  The system will be operated by qualified personnel using established practices.  System design was reviewed for risk of upsets for worst cases release scenarios.  No additional risk reduction measures could be identified."
