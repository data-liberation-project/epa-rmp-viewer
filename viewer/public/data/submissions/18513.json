Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nIn this wastewater treatment facility, we use chlorine and sulfur dioxide, which are both considered hazardous by EPA. The same properties that make these chemicals valuable as commodities also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling them to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as that of our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine and sulfur dioxide, the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the training of our personnel. \n\nOur emergency response program is based upon the Chlorine Institute's Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities. The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors. \n\n\n2.     The stationary source and regulated substances handled \n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to treat domestic and industrial wastewater for the protection of human health and the environment. Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are received in ton containers. It is then used in the wastewater disinfection process. This facility has equipment for unloading ton containers and equipment to utilize chlorine and sulfur dioxide in our process. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors. The regulated substances handled at this distribution facility are chlorine and sulfur dioxide. The total inventory of chlorine stored at this plant is 16,000 pounds. The total inventory of sulfur dioxide stored at this plant is 12,000 pounds. \n\n\n\n3.    The worst-case release scenarios and the alternative release scen"

The distance to the endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L (3 ppm) is calculated as 0.9 miles. \n\nAlternative Release Scenario, chlorine - A chlorine gas feed pipe fails, releasing gas into a closed room.
