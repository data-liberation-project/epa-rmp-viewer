      "SummaryText": "The Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (PRASA) has developed a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for management and prevention of risks associated with the storage and use of chlorine, a regulated toxic substance, at the Canovanas Nueva Water Filtration Plant. The RMP was prepared in compliance with 40 CFR Part 68 and Clean Air Act (CAA) Section 112  ( r ) ( 1 ). The Prevention Program elements build upon the facility's Process Safety Management (PSM) system prepared in compliance with 29 CFR Part 11910.119. .                                                                                                                                                                            Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies: It is  PRASA's policy to comply with applicable Federal and State requirements. The disinfection process at the Canovanas Nueva Water Filtration Plant uses chlorine, a hazardous toxic substance regulated by EPA, OSHA, and PROSHO. Due to the hazardous characteristics of chlorine, the Canovanas Nueva Water Filtration Plant observes various safety precautions in the storage, conveyance and use of chlorine. The safety precautions are necessary to protect employees, contractors, and visitors at the Canovanas Nueva Water Filtration Plant and immediately surrounding areas. Safety precautions include procedures and equipment to minimize the potential for accidental release, as well as a written emergency respose program for response to any chlorine release that may occur.                                                   .

      "SummaryText": " is delivered to the facility  via truck in ton containers. The storage building has space for up to twenty full containers, a total of 40,000 pounds of chlorine. Chlorine containers are connected to vaccum chlorinators. The chlorinators regulate chlorine use. From the chlorinators, chlorine gas is distributed under vaccum to injector. The injectors combine the gaseous chlorine with water. The chlorinated water is mixed with the water plant flow for disinfection. .                                                                                                                                                                                     Worst-case and Alternative Release Scenarios: The worst-case release scenario was determined following EPA's Risk Management Program Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance. The worts-case scenarion is a vapor release of the entire contens of a ton container over a ten minute period (200 pounds of clorine per minute). Other worst-case assumptions required by EPA include a low wind speed (1.5 meters per second), stable atmosphere (Class F), urban topography, and no active mitigation of the release. EPA requires the detremination of the area (zone of vulnerability) which may exposed to a chorine concentration of 3 ppm or greater. According the American Industrial Hygine Association, 3 ppm is the maximun concentration of chlorine in air below which nearly all people could be exposed for one hour without serios health effects. Based on the worst-case assumptions, the zone of vulnerability was determined to extend 1.3 miles from the chlorine storage area. The following are known to be within the zone of vulnerability for the worst-case release scenarion: residences, shool, religious institution, recleational areas and major commercial, office or industrial areas. Approximately 7,004 residents are located within a 1.3 radius of the storage area. Many of these residents would not actually be impacted in even a worst-case release, as the "

No known environmental receptors (such as state parks or officially designated wildlife preserves) are located within the zone of vulnerability.                                                                                                        The conditions and parameters for the worst-case scenario are specified by EPA. A more realistic alternative release scenario was examined, also following EPA's Risk Management Program Consequence Analysis Guidance. The alternative release scenario is a vapor release of the entire contents of a ton container through a broken 3/8 inch flexible connector tube. If the container was not shut off, the contens would release at rate 21 pounds of chlorine per minute over a 95 minute period. More typical weather conditions used  (wind speed of 3.0 metewrs per second, atmospheric stability Class D).

The zone of vulnerability for the alternative release scenarion is determined to extend 0.1 miles from the chlorine storage area. Approximately 41 residents are located within a 0.1 mile radius of the chlorine storage area.

Planned Changes to Improve Safety: PRASA uses Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) to identify and recommend changes to ensure a high level of safety. Issues identified from PHA are then addressed in PRASA's PreventionProgram. Recommendations from the most recent PHA include more frequent training in operating and maintenace procedures, and an improved preventive maintenance program. An audit of the RMP and PSM programs will be conducted within three years to verify effectiveness of program."
