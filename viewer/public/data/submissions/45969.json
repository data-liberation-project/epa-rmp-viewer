Kayem Foods' products include hot dogs, traditional Italian sausages, deli meats, pizza and even fresh gourmet chicken sausage. Some of our well known brands include: Kayem Old Tyme Hot Dogs, Genoa Sausage, Triple M Spiral Hams and Al Fresco Pizza and Chicken Sausage.  Kayem Foods has been in operation at this facility for over 90 years providing quality Frankfurt and Deli Processed Meat products and over 500 jobs to the local community.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nKayem Foods is committed to protecting the health of its employees, the surrounding community, and the environment.  It is Kayem Foods' policy to maintain a safe and healthy workplace, protect the environment, and comply with all applicable regulations, including 40 CFR 68 and, as applicable, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations promulgated as Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 1910, Section 119 (29 CFR 1910.119), and OSHA's Hazardous Operations and Emergency Response regulations (29 CFR 1910.120). \n\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nKayem Foods is required to maintain low temperatures in the food processing and distribution areas of the plant that are within standards required by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [Federal Department of Agriculture (FDA)] to ensure quality in the final products.  Kayem Foods also operates freezers and coolers for product storage.  Kayem Foods uses anhydrous ammonia (the 112? regulated substance) as a refrigerant to maintain the 200,000 sq-ft facility within the required range of operating temperatures and to operate the freezers and coolers.  Anhydrous ammonia is an industry-standard refr"

Kayem Foods' refrigeration system, consisting of receivers, compressors, evaporators, condensers, and piping, and currently contains approximately 24,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario\n\nAs required by 40 CFR 68 Subpart B, Kayem Foods has evaluated a worst-case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia using the parameters specified by the EPA.  The worst-case release scenario is defined as the release of the entire contents of the largest single vessel over a 10-minute period.  Using the EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Reference Tables or Equations, the maximum distance to the specified \"endpoint\" (a conservative distance established by EPA at which it is expected that a person could be exposed to the chemical for an hour without suffering irreversible health effects) includes schools, hospitals, churches, personal residences, and various commercial areas.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario was developed following EPA regulations and is not considered by Kayem Foods to be a likely release scenario for the facility.\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nA more realistic release scenario (alternative release) was developed by Kayem Foods, Inc. taking into consideration the operating experience and the hazards identified in the process hazard analyses (PHAs) conducted to ensure that Kayem Foods' hazards are identified and minimized.  These analyses were conducted in accordance to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations promulgated as Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations Chapter 1910, Section 119 (29 CFR 1910.119).  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nTo prevent and mitigate accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia, Kayem Foods has implemented several precautionary measures that include process/equipment controls, procedures, preventive-maintenance programs, employee training, and audit programs.   In addition, the ammonia refrigeration "

Some of the controls installed to prevent catastrophic releases of ammonia are process equipment (pressure relief valves, backup pumps, and manual shutoffs) and automated controls (automatic shut-offs, ammonia leak detection system.\n\nKayem Foods has developed standard operating procedures for all employees and contractors that have contact with the ammonia refrigeration system that incorporate safety measures into the procedures.  These safety procedures were developed by refrigeration system operators and are reviewed at least annually by means of SOP review session(s).  Process safety information for the refrigeration system is reviewed periodically as well.  Kayem Foods also encourages employee participation in development of the control measures used at the plant.  Pursuant to written management of change procedures established by Kayem Foods, any changes to the operating procedures are to be communicated to affected employees.\n\nKayem Foods understands that maintaining the refrigeration system in good working order is essential to preventing accidental releases; therefore Kayem Foods has implemented a preventative maintenance program.  The preventative maintenance program is scheduled, documented and managed by the maintenance department.\n\nTo ensure that Kayem Foods' control measures are effective in maintaining the safe operation of the plant, regularly scheduled audits are performed on the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nIn accordance with the PSM and RM Plan regulations, Kayem Foods conducts detailed compliance audits every three years.

This program is described in a document entitled KAYEM FOODS, INC. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN (ERP) in order to facilitate response efforts in the event of an off-site anhydrous ammonia release.  Included in the plan are measures to be taken internally by Kayem Foods to evacuate the facility and interact with off-site response agencies.\n \nKayem Foods possesses trained Emergency Response Team personnel.  These personnel are trained in accordance with their duties and function as identified in the ERP.  These personnel receive initial training and refresher training thereafter, as needed, based on their duties and functions.  Kayem conducts emergency evacuation drills annually to test the plan's effectiveness.\n \nTo assure that the local governmental response agencies are familiar with Kayem Foods' emergency response procedures, Kayem Foods has submitted copies of their ERP to the local agencies. \n \nTo plan for an ammonia release with off-site effects, Kayem Food's ERP includes procedures to evacuate the facility, procedures to inform local response agencies, and evacuation route maps.\n\nIn the event of an anhydrous ammonia release with off-site effects, the general public will be warned and evacuated by the Eme"
