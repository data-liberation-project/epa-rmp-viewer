Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nWe at Fareway Stores, Inc. are committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our facility is completely coordinated with Boone Fire Department which provide emergency response expertise.\r\n\r\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOur facility's primary activities revolve around the storage and distribution of products.  \r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance present at our facility.  The entire ammonia inventory is attributed to its use as a refrigerant.\r\n\r\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), \r\nTo evaluate the worst case and alternative release scenarios for ammonia we have used the methodology given in the Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration by SAIC.  A description of the scenarios is located within the Risk Management Program located on site.\r\n\r\nOne alternative release scenario has been submitted for the toxic substance present in the Program 3 process.\r\n\r\n 4.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  In addition, our facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.

The analyses are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered process, Fareway Stores, Inc. maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the process.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nFareway Stores, Inc. has a training program in place to train employees and contract employees who are operating the process or are associated with the process.  Refresher training is provided at least every three (3) years and more frequently as needed.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nFareway Stores, Inc. carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and compressors.  Maintenance procedures are carried out by qualified personnel with a background in maintenance practices.  Training is provided to the personnel as needed.

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nFareway Stores, Inc. conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP Rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nFareway Stores, Inc. promptly investigates any incident that could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nFareway Stores, Inc. believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.

Contractors are also informed of all applicable procedures for emergency response to an accidental release of a regulated substance.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.  Five-year Accident History\r\nFareway Stores, Inc. has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases, at all of our facilities, over the last 5 years.  In 2011, we had a water main break which caused a minor release, and allowed us to work closely with emergency responders and determined our planning for events was very valuable. This was the last incident at this location.\r\n\r\n6.  Emergency Response Plan\r\nFareway Stores, Inc. has a written emergency action plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of reporting emergencies evacuations and notification of local emergency response agencies.\r\nBoone County LEPC is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified. We continue to work closely with them to ensure all parties are educated and involved in all processes.\r\n\r\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  Continued training, and program reviews are some of the major steps we want to take to improve safety at our facility.  These changes are expected to be implemented in a timely manner."
