      "SummaryText": "BP Whiting Polybutene Chemical Plant\nEPA Risk Management Plan - Executive Summary\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe BP Whiting, Indiana Chemical plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our plant adheres to process safety policies, guidelines, and best practices that have been developed based on company and industry experience over the years.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the incident.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe BP Whiting Polybutene Chemical plant is located at 2357 Standard Avenue, Whiting, Indiana.  The plant is owned by BP Corporation.  Various grades of polybutene are processed to produce materials for use in the following products:\n\n\u00b7\tAdhesives\n\u00b7\tCaulk & Sealants\n\u00b7\tCling Films\n\u00b7\tCoatings\n\u00b7\tResin Plasticizer\n\u00b7\tAsphalt & Rubber Modifier\n\u00b7\tElectrical Insulation\n\u00b7\tMotor Oils & Lubricants\n\u00b7\tRolling & Drawing Oils\n\u00b7\tLeather Impregnants\n\u00b7\tSoap-based gels/greases\n\n \nRegulated substances at the plant in excess of the threshold quantity are:\n\nChemical                                                 \tCAS No.\n2-Methylpropene  [1-Propene, 2-methyl-]    \t115-11-7\n1-Pentene                                               \t109-67-1\nIsopentane  [Butane, 2-methyl-]                  \t78-78-4\n2-Butene-cis                                            \t590-18-1\n2-Butene-trans  [2-Butene, (E)]                  \t624-64-6\nButane                                                    \t106-97-8                                               \nIsobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl]                   \t75-28-5\nPropylene  [1-Propene]                             \t115-07-1\nProp"

The WCS endpoint is based on the instantaneous release of the entire contents of the Butane-Butylene (BB) Storage Sphere, resulting in a VCE.  The effects of administrative controls, mitigation systems, and safety systems are not included in determining the effects of a VCE.  Distances to the endpoint were calculated using the methodology outlined in EPA\u00bfs RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  Nearby public receptors could be affected by this type of release.  Specific information on this release is presented in more detail in the plan.  The toxic WCS is not applicable to this plant.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios \n\nThe alternative release scenario for flammable substances at the plant is a VCE resulting from the release of a BB mixture from a flange leak.  The release is expected to be isolated by operators within 10-15 minutes. Specific information on this release is presented in more detail in the plan.  An alternative release scenario for toxic substances is not pertinent to this plant.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the BP Whiting Polybutene Chemical plant.  Because processes at the plant that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary also addresses the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe BP Whiting Polybutene Chemical plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of pr"

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the plant prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the prevention program are documented in the employee participation plan that addresses each prevention program element.  In addition the plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and personal safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operation, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.  Examples of these teams are the Plant Fire, Safety & CAER Committee, Union/Management Health & Safety Committee, Departmental Safety Teams, and HAZOP Teams.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe BP Whiting Polybutene Chemical plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Each process has documentation available showing the location of this information to help employees and visitors locate any necessary process safety information. \n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known exposure concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  An example of this is the plant\u00bfs Hazard Communication Program and Procedure document.  For process a"

The plant assures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (i.e. automated shutdown systems).  In addition, information is available summarizing the consequences of deviation from these limits and the corrective actions to take.\n\nThe plant also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical ratings of equipment, piping and instrument drawings, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe BP Whiting Polybutene Chemical plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe BP Whiting Polybutene Chemical plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures"

These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the BP Whiting Polybutene Chemical plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in chemical plant operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After the new operator demonstrates (i.e. through tests, skills demonstration, etc.) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every three years.  All of this training is documented, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe BP Whiting Polybutene Chemical plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.  The system ensures that all documentation is updated and training completed prior to the commissioning of the change.\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe BP Whiting Polybutene Chemical plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.   Our incident investigation system is based on total employee involvement.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings."
