The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant to maintain the proper temperature of cultured dairy products within the facility.  Anhydrous ammonia is an effective refrigerant that has been used for many years by this food processing facility.  Ammonia is normally a gas at ambient temperatures but is handled as a gas liquefied under pressure.  The refrigeration system consists of a vessel, evaporators, compressors, piping, and valves.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:  Fairmont Products is committed to promoting safety for the plant, its employees and the surrounding area.  The facility is complying with OSHA Process Safety Management Standard (PSM), Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, and EPA?s Risk Management Program regulations (RMP), Title 40 CFR Part 68.  The purpose of these programs is to ensure that the refrigeration system is operated safely in order to prevent releases of ammonia from the system.  In addition, these programs serve to develop procedures to minimize releases in the event that they do occur and to outline appropriate emergency response steps to take in the event of a release.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:  As a part of its PSM Program, Fairmont Products has established numerous programs that serve to prevent accidental releases of ammonia.  \nThese programs include:\nProcess Safety Information\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOperating Procedures\nTraining\nMechanical Integrity\nManagement of Change\nPre-Startup Review\nCompliance Audits\nIncident Investigations\nEmployee Participation\nHot Work Permits\nContractor Safety\n\nEmergency Response Information:  As a part of the PSM Program, the facility maintains an Emergency Response Plan that was prepared in order to improve responsiveness to an eme"

In addition, the Mifflin County LEPC has included Fairmont Products in its local emergency response planning.\n\nFive Year Accident History:  Fairmont Products has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.  In addition, the facility will continue to operate and maintain the system in accordance with IIAR Guidance and will continue to implement its OSHA PSM Program in conjunction with the Risk Management Program.  \n\nFAIRMONT PRODUCTS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY."
