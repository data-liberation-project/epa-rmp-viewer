We have built an addition to our 300 Moore Road facility.\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees that Golden County Foods, Inc. is complying with OSHA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119, EPA?s Risk Management Program (RMP) 40 CFR Part 68 and DHS 6 CFR 27.400 ?Top Screen?, to deal with risks involved with the storage and handling, and the hazardous chemicals.  In this way we promote overall plant, worker and public safety.  The programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases pf toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, our programs intent is to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nOur safety programs focus on the rules, procedures and practices which govern our processes, activities and pieces of equipment.  The rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are communicated to all employees at this facility.\n\nOur addition contains another production line which will operate with anhydrous ammonia.  With the current anhydrous ammonia (Line #1) and this addition (Line #2) the total amount of ammonia on site will exceed the TPL of 10,000 pounds.  Golden County Food facility is a quality food products processing facility, providing customers with a selection of appetizers, entrees and sides for retail, foodservice and private label.  The facility operates two (2) ammonia refrigeration systems Line #1 and Line #2, to provide cooling and freezing capabilities.  Each ammonia refrigeration system operates independently.  They are two-stage refrigeration systems.  A Process Safety Management Program (PSM) was developed in conjunction with the addition to our facility.  \n\nFailure of the largest vessel, Intercooler #2 (IC-2), was selected as the worst case scenario.

      "SummaryText": " the Maximum Intended Inventory amount, it was determined the total quantity released would be 4,128 pounds over a 10 minute period.  This scenario is unlikely as the vessel is in an enclosed building that would help contain such release; there are pressure relief valves installed on the vessel limiting the pressure in the vessel; there are industry standards for the manufacture and quality control of pressure vessels; there is an accident prevention program in place along with a mechanical integrity program for regular maintenance, inspection and testing; there are ammonia sensors in the system to warn of leaks; alarms in place for notification of leaks; and an emergency response plan in place at this facility.\n\nFailure of a hot gas defrost piping on the roof was selected as an alternative release scenario.  A 1/2\" diameter pipe was selected with 290 pounds of ammonia vapor being released over a period of 10 minutes.  This particular scenario is unlikely as; there are regular rounds made on the roof by the operators; there is a mechanical integrity program for regular maintenance, inspection and testing; and an emergency response plan in place at this facility.\nThis facility has a good working relationship with the local Fire Department and conducts regular emergency evacuation training, drills and alert systems for its employees.  The written emergency plan is maintained and is coordinated with the LEPC and local Fire Department.\n \nShould you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me at 715-496-4975.\n\nSincerely,\n\nTony Polacek\nEngineering Manager"
