Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Action Policy:\nBecause of the hazardous nature of NH3 and in compliance with Section 112(r) of the Clean Air\nAct, we have accidental release prevention programs and emergency response policies. \nEmployees are trained in proper standard operating procedures, including filling no more than 85%\nlevels to insure no over pressurization; proper use of personal protective equipment, including\nneoprene gloves, goggles and proper clothing when in the vicinity of NH3.  Our safety policy firmly\nstates that employees must not handle NH3 without adhering to these rules. There are emergency\nshut off and relief valves on all storage tanks, safety pop-off valves on nurse tanks, and nurse tank\nfilling stations are equipped with breakaway couplers.\n\nII.  Regulated Substance Handled at this Facility:\nPercival Farm Service, Inc. is a retailer of anhydrous ammonia.  The NH3 facility is a 30,000\ngallon storage facility  with the latest safety equipment located in a rural area to ensure public\nsafety.\n\nIII.  Worst Case Scenario  vs. Alternate Release Scenario:\nThe worst case scenario that we were required to develop for this Risk Management Plan involved\na total release of product from the largest storage tanks at this facility. No mitigation available in\nworst case. The more common release, failure of a transfer hose, is the one we used as an\nalternate release scenario.  Transfer hoses are checked annually, and replaced if necessary. \nMitigation measures for alternate release are emergency shutoffs and breakaway excess flow\nvalves.\n\nIV:  Employee Training, Equipment Inspection, Maintenance Program, Documentation:\nNH3 standard operating procedures are documented and are a part of training procedure.\n\nV:  Five Year Accident History:\nWe have had no releases during the past five years.\n\nVI:  Emergency Response Program:\nWe are in contact with our local fire and rescue department and the Local Emergency Response\nCommission regarding our operation"

We will continue training for all new and current employees to insure their\nsafety and the safe operation of our facility. We comply with external agencies safety inspections."
