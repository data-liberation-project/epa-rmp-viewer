Introduction:\n\nThe City of Milton Wastewater Treatment Plant, located in Milton, Florida, stores and uses two regulated toxic chemicals in processes as defined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) chemical accident prevention standard, commonly referred to as the USEPA Risk Management Program (RMP).  According to the RMP standard, facilities that use or store a covered substance at or above the threshold quantity are required to comply with the requirements of the rule. \n\nChlorine is utilized at the Milton WWTP for the disinfection of treated wastewater.  Typically, two full and one partial one-ton cylinders are stored for this purpose.  The City also stores up to six full and empty 150 pound cylinders for use as disinfectant in their potable water system.  The maximum possible stockpile of chlorine, based on the conservative assumption that all vessels are full, would be 6,900lbs.  The EPA RMP threshold quantity for chlorine is 2,500lbs, which is exceeded by the maximum storage capacity of the Milton WWTP.\n\nSulfur dioxide is used to dechlorinate treated wastewater prior to discharge to surface waters.  Typically, two full and one partial one-ton cylinders are stored for this purpose.  The maximum possible stockpile of sulfur dioxide, based on the conservative assumption that all vessels are full, would be 6,000lbs.

Provide a description of your facility, processes, products, and regulated substances: \n\nThe City of Milton Wastewater Treatment Plant was constructed to provide centralized treatment of wastewater that is collected from the Milton wastewater service area.  Treated wastewater is first chlorinated for disinfection, and then dechlorinated (by the addition of sulfur dioxide) to make benign the treated wastewater that is discharged to the Blackwater River, in accordance with rules detailed in the Florida Administrative Code, and enforced by FDEP. \n\nChlorine is utilized at the Milton WWTP for the disinfection of treated wastewater"

The chlorination system is located within the Chlorine Building, an all-metal building constructed on a raised foundation with vented enclosing walls on three sides, which contains two interconnected one-ton liquid chlorine containers, a chlorinator, and various safety equipment.\n\nWhile the plant is manned sixteen hours each day, the chemical treatment building is normally unmanned.  Wastewater treatment operators visit the building several times daily, and respond to any trouble alarms that may occur.\n\nTypically, two full and one partial one-ton cylinders are stored for chlorination of treated wastewater.  The City also stores up to six full and empty 150 pound cylinders for use as disinfectant in their potable water system.

According to the RMP standard, facilities that use or store a covered substance at or above the threshold quantity are required to comply with the requirements of the rule. \n\nIn addition to the RMP standard, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) is intended to prevent the release of hazardous chemicals that could result in on-site consequences involving employees.  The Florida Division of Safety adopted the PSM standard as 38I-20 of the Florida Administrative Code (FAC), which includes the public sector such as municipally owned water and wastewater treatment facilities.\nSince the Facility stores chlorine and sulfur dioxide in quantities that exceed the threshold quantities for both the RMP and PSM standards, the Facility is subject to the requirements of the RMP and PSM standards for both chemical stockpiles.\n\nFlorida is a \"Federal OSHA State\" as the OSHA PSM has been adopted into Florida rules.  Since Florida does not have a delegated OSHA program, regulated processes involving regulated toxic substances, such as the use of chlorine and sulfur dioxide, are subject to the Program 3 conditions of the RMP.\n\nIn order to fulfill the Program 3 requirements of the RMP, a Prevention Program must be prepared in accordance with 40 CFR 68, Subpart D, and therefore must include:\n\nA?X    Process safety information\nA?X    Process hazard analysis\nA?X    Operating procedures\nA?X    Training\nA?X    Mechanical integrity\nA?X    Management of change\nA?X    Pre-startup safety review\nA?X    Compliance audits\nA?X    Incident investigation\nA?X    Empl"

The Milton WWTP uses accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators, and performs hazard reviews of equipment and procedures, and has implemented an auditing and inspection program.\n\nChemical-specific prevention steps include availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), worn by the operators during connection/disconnection of chlorine or sulfur dioxide supply, awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine and sulfur dioxide, and the presence of chlorine and sulfur dioxide detectors.\n\n6.  Describe the five-year accident history:\n\nIn the last 5 years, one minor accident occurred with a regulated process in September 2006.  This event did not result in any offsite consequences due to the small quantity (<1lb) of sulfur dioxide released.  Two staff members received medical treatment for inhalation, but did not require hospitalization.  \n\nThe challenge of this event was met by plant staff with revisions to standard procedures for handling the regulated chemical, and training for staff was revised to clearly detail how to avoid a similar accident in the future.\n\n7.
