This policy sates:  \n\n\n\n?    Work is never so urgent or important that we cannot take time to do it safely and correctly.\n\n?    All accidents are preventable.\n\n?    All employees and contractors have a responsibility to work safely and to not endanger others by their acts or omissions.\n\n?    All employees and contractors have a responsibility to ensure the safety of their co-workers and stop any work which does not comply with facility rules and the tenets of operation\n\n?    Management and supervisors have overall accountability for the safety of all persons in the work place.\n\n?    Safety is a condition of employment. All employees and contractors will be held accountable for their own safety performance.\n\n\n\nThe Refinery has various policies and procedures in place which are focused on the prevention of accidents.  However, should a release occur, the refinery has trained on-site emergency response personnel and equipment capable of responding to control and contain a release.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nThe Chevron Hawaii Refinery is located on the island of Oahu, Hawaii.

Processes at the refinery that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard. This summary describes each RMP Program 3 Prevention Program in place at the refinery, which are aligned with the OSHA PSM elements. The objective of the RMP prevention programs and the PSM system is to reduce the consequences and/or likelihood of potential accidents at the refinery.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation \n\n\n\nEmployees are actively involved in each element of the RMP prevention program at the refinery.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents, operating & maintenance procedures, and chemical information, to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information generated from the refinery accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees are involved in the accident prevention programs are documented in an employee participation policy that is maintained at the refinery.  In addition, the refinery has a number of initiatives that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives often include forming committees to address process and personal safety. The committees typically have members from various workgroups, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the cause(s) and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to Refinery management for review and approval. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with employees and contractors who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHA studies.  Management reviews are regularly performed to ensure the quality of investigation program.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information \n\n\n\nThe refinery maintains a variety of procedures, drawings and technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents contain safety related information on topics such as process operation, process equipment, chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, and equipment design basis.  The documents which are categorized as process safety information are defined in a policy maintained at the refinery.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe primary technique used to perform process hazard evaluations (PHA) is known as the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analysis is conducted by a team of people with expertise in process operations, engineering, reliability and maintenance.  The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures based on a risk criteria.  The teams recommendations are reviewed with the appropriate management representatives and after concurrence, the recommendation list is distributed for follow-up and communicated to all affected employees. A copy of the final report is maintained in the refinery main library and is available to all employees. \n\n\n\nThe PHA team's recommendations are assigned to individuals to develop action plans for resolution. The action plans are tracked to ensure that all items are completed in a timely manner.  Actions taken to resolve recommendations are reviewed and approved by management, and documented in a system maintained at the refinery.  PHA's are revalidated at least every five years.  The revalidation includes a review of the changes (design, regulatory, etc.) that have taken place in the process since the last HAZOP analysis, as well as incidents in the process unit and in other similar units in the refining industry.

The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change (MOC) process\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New operators must first successfully complete a comprehensive series of classroom training sessions on refinery operations.  The new operators are then paired up with more experienced operator to learn process specific procedures, duties and tasks.  After the new operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) they have an adequate knowledge to perform the plant operating duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  The operator is then fully qualified upon completion of the Formal Operating Training Program requirements. In addition, operations personnel receive refresher training on operating procedures at least every 3 years to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained.  All training is documented and kept on record in the Refinery's Training and Development Department.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe Chevron Hawaii Refinery uses contract personnel to supplement our workforce, primarily to perform maintenance work, including during shutdowns and construction projects.

Contractors working in the refinery operating areas must attend a lengthier classroom training session that covers the same categories of topics but is geared towards hazards associated with work on or around the process equipment.  In addition, the classroom training covers specific refinery safe work practices (e.g. permit to work, hot work, equipment isolation) and other related process hazards. \n\n\n\nThe refinery also requires contractors to participate in key activates, such as tailgate meetings, safety and environmental audits, and work audits.  Requirements for each contractor are monitored by refinery personnel who oversee each contracting company.  The refinery has established a Contractor Safety Council to help review and improve the safety performance of contractors and refinery work processes.  Representatives from all contract companies are encouraged to participate.  \n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\n\n\nThe refinery conducts a PSSR on new facilities and facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, such as, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  The change passes through several phases of review with an emphasis placed on the type of change and the impact of that change.  The MOC requests are tracked, and once all the required reviews are completed the MOC is given an \"authorization to implement and start up the change\".  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. Training about the change is provided to affected personnel.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nPeriodic compliance audits are conducted at the refinery to help ensure procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are effectively implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years with an audit team composed of various subject matter experts from within the company who are not employed by the refinery.
