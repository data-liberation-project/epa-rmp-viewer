We will make, design, use, transport, and dispose of our materials in a responsible manner, assessing the impacts and benefits at each step in the product life cycle. We will monitor the latest research, examine advances in science and technology, and work closely with stakeholders to enhance today\u0092s essential chemistry and develop new, innovative, and responsible solutions to global challenges. \" On Responsible Manufacturing in Every Community: \"At Chemours, the safety of ourselves, our communities and everyone our chemistry touches are the basis for all we do. We will operate our manufacturing facilities with a strong \nfocus on process safety, always striving for better performance. We will continue to invest in robust emergency preparedness and response to ensure we are ready if an emergency occurs. We will work to identify and minimize risks to our stakeholders, promoting product safety throughout our products\u0092 lifecycle. As we invest in innovation, we will assess alternatives and apply risk reduction measures, including replacement or elimination of hazardous substances.\"\nOn Unshakeable Integrity and Environmental Leadership: \"We will create a culture of environmental awareness, and continuously work to either improve our efficiency or reduce \nour use of natural resources and energy.

We will develop and promote technologies and products that enable us to manage and reduce our impacts from waste and air and water emissions. We will continue our environmental stewardship through remediation projects and environmental initiatives that protect people and the environment. We will follow all applicable environmental, health, safety, and security laws, regulations, and voluntary commitments.\"\n\n(b) The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n\nThe Chemours Plant at DeLisle, Mississippi is located on the north shore of the Bay of St. Louis about 15 miles west of Gulfport, Mississippi.  The plant is located on a 2,417-acre site; however, only about 348 acres are developed.  The Delisle Plant manufactures a single product, Titanium Dioxide (TiO2), under the trade name TiPure(TM).  Titanium dioxide is manufactured via the chloride-ilmenite process in which naturally-occurring ilmenite (TiO2) is directly chlorinated to make Titanium Tetrachloride (TiCl4); the TiCl4 is subsequently re-oxidized to yield pure TiO2. \n\nThe DeLisle Plant has two production lines.  Both were constructed prior to the date of applicability of OSHA PSM regulations (29 CFR 1910.119) on March 26, 1992.  Line I started operations in September, 1979 and Line 2 in March, 1991.  \n\nEPA RMP regulations came into effect on June 21, 1999.  The Titanium Dioxide process is the only process on site.  \n\nAs required by 40 CFR 68.10(d)(1), the DeLisle Site has implemented a Program 3 Accidental Release Prevention Program. \n\nThe RMP covered chemicals pursuant to 40 CFR 68.115 - Threshold, and 68.130 - List of substances, at this facility are Chlorine and Titanium Tetrachloride.  RMP applicability is limited to the following process segments at the DeLisle Plant: 1) Reaction Area (except Coke and Ore Unloading and Storage), Oxidation, Purification, and Power (Ton Cl2 containers for water treatment).

This document is Confidential Business Information, but it is available at the site upon request.  \n\n(c) General Accidental Release Prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\n\nDeLisle Site RMP Program 3 Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe Plant Manager is the top position on this site, and has responsibility for staffing the position of site Process Safety Lead, and a Process Safety Committee comprised of a site leader for each of the elements of the Program 3 Prevention Program.  The Process Safety lead and the Process Safety Committee meet regularly and participate in a Corporate network of Process Safety leaders from other plants in the company to discuss best practices.  Process Safety information and internal metrics are discussed once a month by the site Process Safety lead at a meeting with the Plant Manager and site leaders.  At this monthly meeting, the results of internal audits on each Program 3 component is presented at least once a year.  The purpose of these audits is to check compliance against regulatory requirements and relevant internal standards and procedures. The site Process Safety leader holds an annual review with the Plant Manager, the Process Safety Committee and other plant leaders to assess the effectiveness of the Program 3 Prevention Program.\n\nThe site has identified which process segments are subject to RMP regulations, and is in compliance with the requirements of all the elements of a Process 3 Prevention Program:  40 CFR 68.65 (Process Safety Information), 68.67 (Process Hazards Analysis). 68.69 (Operating Procedures), 68.71 (Training), 68.73 (Mechanical Integrity), 68.75 (Management of Change), 68.77 (Pre-Startup Review), 68.79 (Compliance Audits), 68.81 (Incident Investigation), 68.83 (Employee Participation), 68.85 (Hot"

Site policy is to investigate all small leaks of Chlorine and Titanium Tetrachloride to continuously eliminate the root causes as an effective way of preventing the occurrence of larger leaks.  \n\n(e) Emergency response program \n\nThe site is a responding site that maintains its own emergency response organization with the capacity to mitigate releases of regulated substances.  The site is in compliance with Emergency Response requirements:  68.95 (Emergency response program), 68.96 (Emergency response exercises).\n\n(f) Planned changes to improve safety\n\nImprove modeling of off-site consequences for worse-case scenarios to reflect how existing barriers restrict the flow of chlorine outside plant boundaries and reflect how removal of chlorine being removed from the cloud by reaction with soil and vegetation.\nPurchase portable equipment for monitoring of Chlorine and HCl concentrations for the site emergency response organization."
