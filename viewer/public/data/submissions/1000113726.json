This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with Springfield FIRE DEPARTMENT which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facilityA\u00bfs primary activities encompass Distribution of chemical products.
