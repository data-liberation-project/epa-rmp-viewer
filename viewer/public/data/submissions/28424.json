A maximum of 75,158 pounds of ammonia will be stored at the facility at any given time.\n\nEcoEl\u00e9ctrica uses anhydrous ammonia for the control of NOx emissions generated during the combustion processes.  Ammonia is stored within the EcoEl\u00e9ctrica premises.   EcoEl\u00e9ctrica has the capacity to store  ammonia (anhydrous) over the RMP threshold quantities (10,000 lbs).\n\nWorst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios for Ammonia\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia is assumed to be the release of the entire contents of the 15,000 gallon storage tank, over a period of ten (10) minutes, due to a tank rupture.  The largest amount of anhydrous ammonia in a tank at any given time is 75,158 pounds.\n\nThe analysis for anhydrous ammonia was made taking into consideration the topograhy, which was determined to be rural and any passive mitigation, such as dikes or enclosures.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for anhydrous ammonia is assumed to be the release of anhydrous ammonia through a safety valve that due to overpressure of the 2 inch internal diameter pipe used to fill the anhydrous ammonia container, relieases anhydrous ammonia for a period of 10 minutes, over rural topograhpy.  The topography determination was based on the few buildings and other obstructions (e.g. trees) in the area where the ammonia process is located.\n\nThe ammonia system is currently in the process of installation and commisioning.  Due to the actual conditions of the facility, the information required on sections 7.4c and 7.7-7.15 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) are based on a HAZOP study\n\nThe EcoEl\u00e9ctrica accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n-High level of training of the operators.\n-Preventive maintenance program.\n-Use of state of the art process and safety equipment.\n-Use of the accurate and effective operating procedures written with the participation of the operators.\n-Performance of hazard review of equipmen"

Therefore no accident history is available for the chlorine or ammonia processes.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe EcoEl\u00e9ctrica facility is included in the community emergency response plan prepared by the local emergency planning committee under 303 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act (LEPC 5 - Environmental Quality Board - Ponce).  EcoEl\u00e9ctrica will rely on the local emergency response agencies for responding to a release of one the regulated substances.  It has prepared an Emergency Response Plan as per Rule 107 (C) of the Regulation for the Control of Atmospheric Pollution (RCAP) and a Contingency Plan which include the following tasks.\n\n1.  Recognize the existence of an emergency condition.\n2.  Notify appropriate plant personnel and off-site authorities of the existence of an emergency condition.\n3.  Take corrective actions to alleviate the severity of the emergency.\n4.  Request additional support as deemed necessary.\n5.  Establish and maintain effective communications within the Plant and with off-site response groups.\n6.  Continuously assess the status of the emergency situation and communicate that status to the  appropriate groups and agencies.\n7.  Provide timely and accurate information to the public through the media in conjunction with local officials, if required.\n8.  Take protective measures on-site for employees and property.\n9.  Notify appropriate Plant personnel and off-site authorities of the return to normal conditions."

EcoEl\u00e9ctrica employees must conduct Company operations in compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations.  Environmental laws either prohibit or severely restrict the release of pollutants to the air, land, surface water, and groundwater.  The Company is committed the environmental protection, and it expects employees to abide by the letter and the spirit of these laws.\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Sustances Handled\n\nEcoEl\u00e9ctrica, L.P. owns and operates a liquefied natural gas (LNG)  marine unloading and storage terminal and a 507 MW combined cycle power plant.  The EcoEl\u00e9ctrica facility is located in the Municipality of Pe\u00f1uelas, Puerto Rico.  It provides additional electric power to Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA).  Other facility processes are a closed cooling water system; a demineralization plant to produce water for steam production and boiler water for the Costa Sur Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority; and a remineralization plant to produce potable water for the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (PRASA).\n\nThe LNG stored at the terminal is vaporized to form natural gas which is combusted in the power plant combustion turbines.  Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) is an alternate fuel, and low sulfur No. 2 distillate oil  serves as a startup fuel and as an emergency backup fuel, in the event that LNG or LPG are not available.  The power plant consists of a combined cycle generating module which includes two combustion turbines/generators exhausting into separate heat recovery steam generators (HRSGs).  The HRSGs produce steam is routed to a steam turbine/generator and to a desalination plant capable of producing fresh water from sea water.\n\nAmmonia is stored at the facil"
