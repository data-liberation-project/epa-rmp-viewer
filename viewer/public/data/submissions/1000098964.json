The guidelines also describe senior management's commitment to safety. The safety guidelines assign the responsibility and authority to the management team at each facility for conducting an effective safety program. \n\n \n\nPanama City Mill Policy- \n\n\n\nJanuary 12, 2022:  Update to RMP Plan for removal of chlorine as a covered chemical.  Water disinfection chemical was changed to sodium hypochlorite in December 2021.  Below summary updated to remove mention of chlorine.\n\n \n\nIt is the policy of WestRock Panama City Mill to conduct its business to insure the likelihood of a release of chlorine dioxide is reduced and if there is a release, the offsite consequence will be minimized. The chlorine dioxide system is maintained according to good engineering and maintenance practices. Our operating and maintenance employees utilizing the chlorine dioxide system have been trained in the safe handling and use of chlorine dioxide.\n\n \n\nIt is the policy of WestRock to promote employee participation in all programs, including the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) and OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program.\n\n \n\nDescription of Panama City Operations\n\n \n\nWestRock's Panama City facility is an integrated pulp and paper mill that produces Kraft linerboard and Bleached Market Pulp. Finished products are shipped via rail, truck and ship to customers all over the world. \n\n \n\nDescription of RMP-Covered Processes\n\n \n\nChlorine Dioxide - Bleaching\n\n \n\nChlorine dioxide is generated on site in a process using sodium chlorate and methanol in a strong sulfuric acid solution. Chlorine dioxide is removed, as generated, by vacuum and absorbed in cold water (38-40 F) to a concentration of 9 to 10 grams/liter.  The chlorine dioxide solution is stored for use in several bleaching stages throughout the Bleac"

Each employee working with chlorine dioxide has experience and training in the hazards associated with this chemical.   The chlorine dioxide generator system is manned 24 hours a day by experienced operators that are knowledgeable in the emergency shut down procedures necessary to mitigate releases to the environment.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe mill has a trained Emergency Response Team that is qualified at the Haz-Mat Technician level.  These employees will respond to an emergency release of chlorine dioxide. Annual confined space rescue and Haz-Mat training for the Emergency Response Team was last conducted in August 2021.\n\n\n\nIn the event of  possible offsite consequence from the release of chlorine dioxide, the Bay County Emergency Management Center will be notified by calling 911. Bay County Emergency Management Agency has been informed of the use of a 244,000-gallon tank of a water solution of chlorine dioxide.\n\n \n\nInitial response to a 911 call will come from the City of Springfield Fire Department.

An incident investigation team comprised of Safety Department personnel, production management and hourly operators will be formed.  All findings and recommendations of the investigative team will be presented to facility management and promptly addressed.\n\n \n\nThe Bay County Emergency Management Agency and local responding Fire Department are given the opportunity to inspect the site and make recommendations for inclusion in the Risk Management Program development. These agencies are invited to familiarize their teams with the facility on an annual basis.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThe recent change to sodium hypochlorite from gaseous chlorine in the raw water disinfection process is a major improvement for the safety of both our employees and the surrounding community.\n\n\n\nThe WestRock Company's Safety Code of Conduct states, in part, \"We hold safety and health as our highest core value.\" The Panama City mill is constantly improving upon its safety program. A monthly Safety and Housekeeping Calendar ensures all safety systems are maintained in the highest level of effectiveness and preparedness.  We have instituted Safety Thursdays where all maintenance work is aimed at safety work orders in a particular department. We have also added personnel from the hourly ranks as Safety Advocates in a full-time position.  We have added another safety professional to our Safety Department to assist with the daily management of our safety programs.  As process and systems change, so does our methodology for protecting our employees. The safety of our employees is our number one priority.
