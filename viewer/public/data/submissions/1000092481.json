The GGS uses aqueous ammonia in its selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOX) to the atmosphere, as well as for condensate hydrogen ion content (pH) control. As the company responsible for operating GGS, PG&E takes its safety obligations in storing and using aqueous ammonia seriously. The following document describes what could happen if there were to be an accident, the steps PG&E takes every day to ensure a safely operating plant, and what to do in the event of an emergency.\n\n\n\n1.2    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nPG&E's vision is to be the leading utility in the United States; to that effect, PG&E's values are presented below:\n\n-    We act with integrity and communicate honestly and openly.\n\n-    We are passionate about meeting our customers' needs and delivering for our shareholders.\n\n-    We are accountable for all of our own actions; these include safety, protecting the environment, and supporting our communities.\n\n-    We work together as a team and are committed to excellence and innovation.\n\n-    We respect each other and celebrate our diversity.\n\n\n\nThe GGS accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, staff training on operation and maintenance practices, and tested management system practices. All applicable procedures of the State of California and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulatory programs are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.\n\n\n\nAs a supplier of energy to approximately 5 percent of Americans and more than 40 percent of Californians, we recognize that the choices we make about the way we produce and del"

Manuals and procedures are available to employees at all times. The environmental, health, and safety program manuals at the GGS include the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program RMP.\n\n\n\nThis document complies with the EPA Risk Management Program under Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990, Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68, and the CalARP Program under Title 19 of the California Code of Regulations (CCR), Division 2, Chapter 4.5.

Highway 4 and the Antioch Bridge are just east of the site. Immediately south and west of the site are existing industrial facilities. The river borders the north side, while a recreational marina, open space, and additional industrial land uses are present east of the site.\n\n\n\nThe GGS combined cycle power unit consists of two natural gas-fired combustion turbine generators, two heat recovery steam generators (HRSGs), and one steam turbine generator. In the combined cycle process, electricity is generated from the combustion turbines and the steam turbine. Each combustion turbine generator converts the thermal energy of the natural gas fuel to mechanical energy, which drives the electrical generator. At the same time, the thermal energy from the exhaust flue gas off the combustion turbines is directed to the HRSG to convert pressurized water into steam, which turns the steam turbine to drive the electricity generator. The facility also includes two 195-foot-tall exhaust stacks on the HRSGs, one air-cooled condenser system, a wet surface air cooler, storage tanks, a control building, electrical power transformers, and transmission facilities to interconnect the generated electricity to the power grid.\n\n\n\nAqueous ammonia is used in the GGS's SCR system to reduce NOX emissions and for condensate pH control. Up to 18,020 gallons of 29.4 percent aqueous ammonia solution (39,628 pounds of ammonia in solution) are present in the process at any given time.\n\n\n\nThe maximum quantity of aqueous ammonia stored and handled at the GGS exceeds the Risk Management Program and CalARP Program threshold quantities, but not the Process Safety Management (PSM) threshold quantities. Therefore, the aqueous ammonia process is subject to Risk Management Program and CalARP Program regulations, but not PSM re"

Risk Management Program regulations require that an Emergency Action Plan be prepared for facilities that are not responding facilities. The plan must be prepared in accordance with the provisions of 8 CCR Section 3220. The Emergency Action Plan described in this section is for facilities with employees who are not responders to emergency situations. \n\n\n\nGGS's Emergency Action Plan is submitted with the revised CalARP RMP to Contra Costa Health Services (CCHS) for review and comment to ensure that it is consistent with the Contra Costa County Emergency Response Area Plan. Changes to this plan, including updated emergency contact information, are otherwise coordinated with CCHS and the Contra Costa County Fire Protection District at least once per year. The names and contact information of individuals involved in the coordination activities, as well as the date and a description of coordination activities, are documented.\n\n\n\nThe Contra Costa Hazardous Materials Programs (CCHMP) Incident Response Team is the designated primary response agency for the GGS. PG&E has ongoing emergency response coordination activities with the following agencies:\n\n-    CCHMP\n\n-    Contra Costa County Fire Protection District\n\n-    Contra Costa County Sheriff's Department\n\n-    Sutter Delta Medical Center\n\n\n\nPG&E has a signed agreement with Sutter Delta Medical Center and Contra Costa County Fire Protection District to receive customary and appropriate emergency assistance in the event of emergency.\n\n\n\nPG&E conducted an ammonia release response drill with the Contra Costa County Fire Protection District, CCHMP, Airgas, and neighboring facility (NRG) on December 14, 2010. PG&E also conducted a Table Top Ammonia Emergency Response Exercise with CCHS on December 3, 2014. Beginning in 2024, GGS will also begin conducting annual exercises of its emergency notification procedures.\n\n\n\n"

The most recent HR of the aqueous ammonia process was conducted in October 2017. A seismic assessment was also conducted in October 2017.\n\n\n\nDuring these studies and inspections, no risk reduction measures were recommended because existing safeguards were thought to adequately mitigate risk associated with potential accident"

      "SummaryText": "al releases of aqueous ammonia. However, recommendations were made for correcting several inconsistencies in how the design and operation of the aqueous ammonia system are documented. Those recommendations are currently being assessed by GGS personnel for implementation, as appropriate. No additional changes are currently planned to improve safety of the aqueous ammonia system.\n\n\n\nDetails of the recommendations from the most recent HR, as mentioned above, can be found in the action item tables attached with Section 6, Hazard Review, of this RMP. The GGS uses the action item tables developed for the HR to track progress and timely closure of action items from technical studies. The GGS also reports the number of recommended action items, the number of action items completed, and the number of action items in progress. Eighteen items were recommended for follow-up as a result of the most recent HR; GGS is in the process of determining and implementing resolutions to each of these recommended action items, as discussed with CCHS during a September 2020 audit.\n\n\n\nIn assessing action items/planned activities for resolution, GGS prioritizes their implementation by applying the policy of protecting firstly the personnel, secondly the environment, and thirdly the properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
