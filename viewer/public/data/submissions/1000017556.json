With the exception of a small residential subdivision to the southwest of the plant, the area is undeveloped.  This facility manufactures phosphate fertilizer used primarily for agricultural food crops.  The facility employs 230 full time staff and operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  Simplot Phosphates LLC is a solid and responsible member of the local community.  The Company and its employees strive to contribute and improve the community they work and live in through their involvement, volunteerism and support of local programs.  \r\n\r\nSimplot Phosphates is committed to protecting the environment and preserving natural resources through the elimination or reduction of toxic substance use, pollution prevention at the source and responsible recycling, treatment and disposal of waste materials. This October 2010 resubmission is due to the elimination of gaseous chlorine from the Rock Springs facility. \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\r\n\r\nSimplot Phosphates LLC, Rock Springs Phosphate Fertilizer Plant near Rock Springs, Wyoming, is committed to being a responsible community partner. Emergency response planning and training of all employees is current and on going.  The company fully supports an emergency rescue team, whose members receive more advanced training.

It is Simplots policy to fully cooperate with all inspections and requests for information from all regulatory agencies.\r\n\r\nRegulated Substances Processed, Stored, or Used: \r\n\r\nSimplots Rock Springs Plant manufactures phosphate fertilizer products and industrial chemicals. In the past, these processes required the use of two substances currently listed in the RMP rule.  These substances are anhydrous ammonia used to manufacture fertilizers and gaseous chlorine that had been used strictly for water treatment.  As of October 1, 2010, the Rock Springs facility has eliminated the usage of gaseous chlorine.  \r\n\r\nThe Rock Springs plant transfers, stores, and processes anhydrous ammonia in quantities exceeding the rule applicability threshold limits, therefore requiring the facility to develop a Risk Management Program and submit an associated plan.  Because anhydrous ammonia and associated processes is also subject to the OSHA-PSM standard and is not eligible for Program 1, the processes that contain this substance will be regulated as a program 3 process under the RMP rule.  Anhydorus ammonia is regulated as a toxic substance under the rule.  \r\n\r\nThere are no regulated flammable substances above their respective threshold quantities at this facility. \r\n\t\t\r\nWorst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios:\r\n\t\r\n\tThe RMP rule requires facilities containing Program 3 processes to provide a hazard assessment of the potential worst-case and alternative release scenarios involving the regulated substances.  The rule requires that a worst-case scenario representative of all toxic substances and an alternative release scenario for each toxic substance be evaluated and reported in the RMP.  Simplot has evaluated a worst-case scenario involving the largest vessel of anhydrous ammonia and has determined that the worst-case scenario is dictate"

This hypothetical release dictated by the rule involves the sudden failure and subsequent release of the contents of one tank, administratively controlled to 161.5 tons over a 10 minute time span.  This release is assumed to occur during worst-case release conditions of low wind speed, stable atmospheric conditions and maximum ambient temperature.  Assuming these conditions, the release was evaluated with the publicly available model DEGADIS, which has been demonstrated to provide reasonable estimates of concentrations and distances associated with that type of release.  The modeled results indicate that the impact from this hypothetical release will extend offsite, and under certain wind directions, can encompass public receptors.  In addition to the extremely unlikely probability of such a hypothetical scenario occurring, Simplot has numerous prevention and safety features including elevation of the storage tanks, concrete barriers around all storage tanks, a comprehensive inspection program, pressure relief and emergency shutoff valves and water fog nozzles in place in order to reduce the potential for this scenario. \r\n\r\nAlternative release scenarios should be modeled and be representative of scenarios that may have occurred or are more likely to occur.  The anhydrous ammonica processe regulated under this rule has not had any previous accidental releases in the 25 year history of the facility, therefore the alternative release scenario for this chemical is also based on a hypothetical, although more likely potential scenario.\r\n\r\nThe hypothetical anhydrous ammonia alternative release scenario consists of an accidental rupture of an 8-inch diameter overhead transfer pipe due to an impact from a mobile crane.  The scenario assumes that the pipe is completely severed, releasing anhydrous ammonia liquefied by pressure for approximately two minutes before the automatic shutoff valves cut off"

A total quantity of over 45,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia is estimated to be released.  This scenario was also modeled using the DEGADIS model assuming typical meteorological conditions as recorded at the Rock Springs Airport and, conservatively, as a ground level release.  The impact of this scenario is predicted to extend offsite and under certain wind conditions, could potentially impact public receptors.  This release is highly unlikely to occur due to the general facility accident prevention program requiring all employees to be aware of potential dangers and other prevention steps in-place, such as signs and markings clearly indicating the location of the pipes and warning crane operators of potential danger.  \r\n\r\nAlthough both the worst-case and alternative release scenarios are hypothetical and unlikely to occur, Simplot is prepared to respond to any release at the facility through the implementation of its Emergency Response and Crisis Management Plan and deployment of the emergency response team and local response agencies, thus minimizing the impact of any release.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps:\r\n\r\nThe processes and substances regulated by the RMP rule have also been subject to the OSHA-Process Safety Management (PSM) standard for many years.

Simplot developed and implemented the prevention program in accordance with the OSHA-PSM requirements well before the RMP required them to do so.
