      "SummaryText": "This Risk Management Plan (RMP) updates the 1999 RMP for the Heber 1 and Heber 2 facilities, two geothermal electrical generating plants, both operated by Ormat Nevada Inc. and located near Heber, California.  The Heber 1 facility was formerly known as the Heber Geothermal Company project, and the Heber 2 facility was formerly knows as the Second Imperial Geothermal Company project.  Heber 1 and Heber 2 each have processes that contain greater amounts of chlorine than the threshold quantities listed for this toxic substance in Section 112(r) of the federal Clean Air Act and established under Article 2, Chapter 6.95 of the California Health and Safety Code.  The Heber 2 facility also has processes that contain greater amounts of isopentane than the state and federal threshold planning quantities established under these codes for this flammable substance.  The chlorine process at Heber 1 and Heber 2 and the isopentane process at Heber 2 are subject to the Program 3 requirements for the RMP.     \n\nThe updated RMP meets the requirements of the federal Risk Management Program contained in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68 and the requirements of the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program contained in Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5 of the CFR.  The amount of the two regulated substances handled at the facilities also exceeds the threshold quantities in the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) process safety management regulations in 29 CFR 1910.119 and require a hazard assessment under that program.  \n\nBoth Heber 1 and Heber 2 use chlorine for the control of microbiological growth in the cooling towers.  The chlorine is delivered in Department of Transportation (DOT)-approved  containers, stored in secure areas with leak detectors, held in place by seismic straps, and manually activated by trained operators.  The RMP describes the processes and equipment used to handle the delivery, storage, monitoring, detection, and injec"

The plan provides details on the changes to these systems that have been implemented at these facilities in the past five years and includes the plans for additional safety measures in the event of an accidental rupture of flexible lines, a failure of the leak detection equipment, or a cooling tower fire.\n\nThe Heber 2 facility uses isopentane as the working fluid in the Rankine cycles for the modular Ormat Integrated Two-Level Units (ITLUs).  The isopentane is delivered by qualified suppliers, stored in a secure area designed for seismic loads, pumped to the individual units, and circulated and recovered through a closed-loop system.  The plant has leak detection monitors and fire protection equipment installed through the area.  The RMP describes the current methods of delivery, storage, transfer, use, and recovery of this flammable substance at the geothermal facility and includes a description of the new vapor recovery unit installed at Heber 2.  The RMP includes additional safety measures to reduce the risk of damage from release of this flammable substance.  \n\nThe RMP includes the detailed specifications for the safe handling of both regulated substances and describes the training programs for employees, operators, emergency responders, and contractors on site.  It summarizes the inspection and preventive maintenance programs for the chlorine delivery, storage, and chlorination systems and describes the incident investigations, compliance audits, management of change procedures, and pre-startup reviews for these regulated substances.  \nWith the implementation of these procedures and safety equipment, there have been no reportable accidents at Heber 1 or Heber 2 in the five years since the last RMP was prepared.   No releases of chlorine or isopentane at the facilities have resulted in death, injury, or substantial damage to onsite facilities nor have any releases of chlorine or isopentane ca"
