The Facility Policy for Sharpsville (Tipton Satellite) Agronomy\nThe owners, management, and employees of Co-Alliance, LLP are committed to prevention of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the various fire departments or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n2. Facility Information.\n     A.  The primary activity at the facility is the storage of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\n\n     B.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application.\n\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario And The Alternative Release Scenario. \n\n     A.  The Worst Case Release Scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 140,000 lbs. from the storage tank.  The distance to the endpoint (using RMP Comp) is 6.9 miles.  This release would have off-site impact.\n\n     B.  The alternative release scenario based on the five year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the end point (using RMP Comp)is 1.2 miles.  This release would have off-site impact\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K61.1\", published by The American National Standards institute, inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\". This facility has also complied with the Ammonia Law regulated by the Office of the State Chemist.\n\n5. The five-year Accident History \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that Have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant properly damage at the facility; n"

Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right to know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n     C.  A written emergency response program. In accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7. Planned Changes To Improve Safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
