The facility is situated in the Northeastern portion of Sumter County. The facility consists of two main manufacturing buildings whIch are used for pipe forming and welding activities, a covered and contained pickling building and a wastewater treatment plant.\n\nOSPI manufactures pipe diameters of 0.840\" OD through 6.625\" OD in the South Plant and 5.625\" OD through 84.000\"OD in the North Plant with wall thickness ranging from 0.049\" through 2.000\". The pipe is formed from both coil stock and plate. The activities involved in manufacturing pipe include forming, welding, annealing with water quench, sizing, straightening and cutting to length. Final cleaning of maunfactured pipe with pickling acid and inspection follow the manufacturing process.\n\nThe acid pickling process uses a substance regulated under section 112A? of the clean air act. The substance is Hydrofluoric Acid @ 70% concentration. The hydrofluoric acid is used in the pickling process to remove oxides from the surface of annealed pipe. At any one time, this substance may be stored in a quantity above the threshold quantity listed in 40 CFR 96, Subpart F.\n\nThe accidental release program in place at OSPI consists of the elements required by the EPA Risk Management Program, a site specific Emergency Response Plan and a weekly scheduled inspection procedure. OSPI is committed to preventing accidental releases by providing and maintaining the highest practically achievable standards of occupational health, safety and workplace environment. OSPI's goal is to discover, correct and address conditions which may result in personal illness, injury, offsite consequences or property damage. Health, safety, protection of the environment and surrounding property have equal status with other primary business objectives, and are an integral part of planning a"

In addition, OSPI adheres to all applicable OSHA, FDEP and EPA regulations and continually reviews the regulations for any applicable changes or additions to the rules. OSPI also has an ISO14001:96 (International Standards Organization) plan in place and has received official certification for the plan. This plan places additional requirements above and beyond regulatory requirements for Company environmental and safety performance. This plan requires additional procedures for inspection, maintenance and record keeping. The plan also requires constant auditing of the systems from both internal and external sources.\n\nHealth, safety and the protection of the environment and surrounding areas are the direct responsibility of OSPI management. Management and supervision take initiative as an intigral part of their duties to ensure that safe working procedures and practices are employed to eliminate the risks of accidents and health hazards. A continual alertness to identify and correct unsafe work practices or hazardous work conditions is paramount. Information and training is provided to maintain an awareness of safety and the working environment.\n\nOSPI's Emergency Response Plan (ERP) consists of a description of activities and provisions for inspection and prevention procedures, emergency notification, site control zones, personal protective equipment, decontamination and clean up, emergency respose and communications equipment, identification of potential spill sources, evacuation plan, arrangements with local authorities,clean up and post emergency response review. All pertinant personnel attend annual emergency response/hazardous materials training classes. These classes review the plan and mitigation procedures. The hazardous materials on site are studied for familiarity and the regulatory requirements for EPA and OSHA are outlined. Up-dated copies of the ERP are provided to the LEPC, SERC, FDEP,Marion Count"

The Sumter County Fire Rescue and the Marion County HAZMAT Team are brought on site periodically to review OSPI's ERP and to become visually familiar with the tank locations and plant surroundings.\n\nProcess controls for the hydrofluoric acid system include vents, monitors, scrubbers, manual shut off and antisiphon valves, a diluge system and supplied air for respirators. The steel acid tank was replaced by a doubled walled poly tank making annual ultrasonic wall thickness testing obsolete. Weekly inspections of the storage vessel and associated pumps, piping and valves identify any safety or environmental hazards quickly and further reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. The storage system sits in a 22,000 gallon containment dike which is more than sufficient to contain the entire contents of the tank and enough water to reduce the concentration below fuming levels. There will also be room for a hydrated lime addition to raise the pH prior to pumping to the wastewater treatment plant for final treatment and disposal. \n\nThere was one release in the last five years and the volume was less than one gallon. The release was due to an error made by a contractors employee. The systems in use have proven to be effective in the past and will be kept in a continuous state of improvement. OSPI will continue to improve safety by; Holding employee safety meetings, continuously inspecting and correcting findings, ensuring that the safety committee stays active, conducting safety training and auditing the systems in place."
