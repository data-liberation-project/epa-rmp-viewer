      "SummaryText": "1.  Overview\n\nThis plan was developed to meet the EPA Requirements contained in 40 CFR, part 68 for International Flavors and Fragrances (IFF) facility located in Augusta, GA.  The IFF facility is 8 years old and began production in 1996.  This facility is in the fragrance ingredients business and processes raw materials into base products that are later used in blending perfumes, house hold products, and a multitude of other products requiring a scent or fragrance.  This facility is ISO certified and operates under the guidelines identified in OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.119 (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals) due to the flammability and toxicity of some raw materials used in the processes.\n\n2.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\n\nIn this production facility, flammable raw materials in excess of 10,000 pounds (Acetaldehyde) and Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) (a listed hazardous chemical) are used on a regular basis.  Precautions in the handling of these materials are necessary to prevent unnecessary human exposures and reduce the exposure threat to the employees and nearby members of the community.  Safety was emphasized in the design of this facility and specific operating/maintenance procedures are in place to minimize the risk to personnel from the materials used in the processes.  Training of personnel working in the process area is accomplished on a continuing basis.  It is our policy to comply with all Federal, State, and Local rules and regulations.\n\nThe emergency response program has been developed and coordinated with local emergency response agencies.  The emergency response plan (revision 12 dated 8/10/03) is also tested on a regular basis.  The emergency response plan includes procedure for the notification of local fire and rescue authorities as well as procedures to notify any potentially affected neighbors in the event of a spill or other incidents at the facility.\n\n3.  The Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe primary purpo"

      "SummaryText": "se of this facility is to manufacture fragrance ingredients for use in the fragrance industry.  The facility currently uses two raw materials that fall under OSHA's process safety and EPA's risk management programs (SO2 and Acetaldehyde).  SO2 is received at the facility by rail car and the facility is equipped to transfer material from this rail car into process equipment.  Acetaldehyde is received by tanker truck and rail car and is then transferred into a storage tank considered part of the process equipment.  Finished product is loaded and shipped from the facility in drums and by tanker trailer.  DOT containers are used to both receive raw materials and ship finished products.\n\n4.  Worst-Case Release and Alternative-Case Release Scenarios\n\nSee modeling results for worst-case release and alternative-case release scenarios.  Modeling results also indicate all public receptor areas that must be addressed by our emergency response procedures.\n\n5.  Five-year Accident History\n\nThis facility is eight years old.  There have been no reportable release from this facility since it began operations in 1996.\n\n6.  The Emergency Response Program\n\nThis facility's emergency response plan has been coordinated with the Richmond County Emergency Management Agency and the Richmond County Fire Department.  Facility employees regularly attend local meetings involving local industry and local emergency response agencies.  The facility will not respond to releases of sulfur dioxide or acetaldehyde, instead the facility would utilize emergency response contractors.  The local fire department visited the facility in 1996 and again in 2003.\n\n7.  Hazard Review\n\nThe facility has completed process hazard analyses for the regulated processes.  The processes were both reviewed and revalidated in June 2004.  All recommendations are scheduled to be complete by July 2004.\n\nMajor hazards identified that apply to his facility include:  fire, explosion, overfilling, and potential equipment failures."
