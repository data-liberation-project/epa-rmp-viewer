Facility Policy for Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\n\nSunray Coop Directors, Management, and employees have a strong commitment to providing a safe and healthful workplace and business for all employees, customers, owners, and to the community.  These policies are set forth in a policy manual and are provided and explained to each employee prior to an initial assignment.   The policies are reviewed periodically and revised and updated as necessary to reflect changes in policy, facilities, processes, regulations, safety requirements, or as new information becomes available.\n\nThe Coop is committed to the prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia and other hazardous chemicals.  In the event that an accidental release does occur, the company has selected and trained certain key employees in the Hazwoper requirements and are prepared to work with the local fire department and/or designated contractors and local authorities to mitigate the release and minimize the impact of the release on the facilities, personnel, and to the community and environment.\n\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity of Sunray Coop is the purchase, receipt, storage, and sale of grains.  Secondary activities include the storage, sale, and application of some farm inputs and supplies, which include: fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides, equipment, fuel, and other farm supplies.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received by transport truck, unloaded into storage tank(s), then distributed seasonally to farm wagons for sale and delivery to local farmers, where it is used as fertilizer to crops such as wheat, corn, and milo.\n\nThe maximum quantity stored at Sunray Coop?s Gruver, Texas, branch is 145,041 lbs. in a 30,000 gal. capacity storage tank.  The maximum quantity handled at any one time would be the unloading of a transport truck holding 50,000 lbs. to a storage tank.\n\n\n3. The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of ?Safet"
