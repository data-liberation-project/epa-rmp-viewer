As a result of a Hazard Review at this plant, recommendations were developed to install or upgrade some safety items. \nFive Year Accident History\nThe Water Treatment Plant has never had a significant release of a hazardous substance as defined by this Rule.\nEmergency Response Program\nThis Plant has an Emergency Response Program that is coordinated with the community plan.\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nThe following recommendations were made as a result of the Water Treatment Plant RMP. Some of the recommendations are currently being implemented. Others are being prioritized and budgeted accordingly.\nAn emergency scrubbing system will be constructed as part of the next plant expansion project.  The design of the plant expansion project will be completed in early 2000, and construction begun by mid 2000.  In the meantime, the following steps will be taken based on the results of a detailed hazard review at the plant.\n' We have updated our operating and maintenance (O&M) procedures, and have elaborated on procedures more prone to human error.\n' We will require each operator to be trained on the plant's  O&M.\n' We will endeavor to develop and implement a chlorine supplier audit program.  For example, do they have emergency container repair kits? Do they maintain their equipment?  What is their pre-shipment inspection procedure?\n' We will procure and maintain an inventory of spare parts that are prone to failure, and replace such parts as part of a regular maintenance cycle, despite the existence or absence of apparent wear.  \n' We will ensure each maintenance technician receives all appropriate training toward his or her duties.\n' We have developed an Emergency Response Program in conjunction with the City of Cedar Park Hazardous Materials (HazMat) Response Team, Fire Department, and the Fire Marshal."

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\nIt is the policy of the City of Cedar Park, Texas, to operate safe water and wastewater treatment facilities, reducing to the greatest extent possible any hazards associated with our processes, and reducing any subsequent risk to the surrounding community, our employees, and the environment. It is also our policy to work with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies, and promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork, to orchestrate an effective contingency plan in the unlikely event that a process incident occurs at one of our plants.\nPrimary Activity\nThe primary activity at the Cedar Park Water Treatment Plant is municipal drinking water treatment.\nUse of Regulated Substances\nChlorine is used primarily as a disinfectant and protectant for water introduced into the drinking water supply.\nQuantities Handled or Stored\nChlorine: Up to 18,000 pounds\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\nThe EPA-defined worst case scenario is a failure of a 2,000-pound container full of chlorine. The 10-minute release is mitigated by a factor of 0.55 because a building encloses the process.  This is the equivalent of 1,100 pounds of chlorine being released. Under worst case weather, chlorine could travel 1.55 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.\nAlternative Release Scenarios (ARS)\nA more conceivable release, although still remote, is a failure of a flexible connection at the ton container. The release would be mitigated by an enclosure, resulting in a release rate of 5.8 pounds per minute and a distance from the Plant of 0.26 miles.  This is about the most realistic release that would ever be expected to occur.  However, the plant policy is to replace the flexible connections at prescribed intervals.\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe Cedar Park Water Treatment Plant is in compliance with the RMP Rule, 40 CFR 68. Plant and City personnel have conducted a comprehensive review o"
