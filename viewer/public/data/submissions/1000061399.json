This OSHA PSM / EPA RMP program summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to site personnel, contractors, visitors, and the community and environment at large of hazardous chemical releases. The OSHA PSM / EPA RMP program is organized to correspond with specific EPARMP, Program 3 requirements.  \r\nII.\tBaxter Healthcare Policies To Protect Health, Environment, and Safety\r\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at Baxter. Baxter is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and to the environment. It is Baxter's policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations.\r\n\r\nBaxter's OSHA PSM / EPA RMP program  has identified potential hazards related to our ethylene oxide process and has taken steps to design and maintain a safe facility in order to prevent releases, and minimize the consequences of accidental releases, which could occur. OSHA PSM / EPA RMP addresses potentially catastrophic chemical releases that could result in immediate harm and acute health effects to offsite receptors (public and environmental). Baxter has developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that contains procedures designed to maximize the safety of all employees, contractors, and visitors in the event of an emergency and also guard against environmental consequences.\r\n\r\nIII.\tFacility Identification\r\nThe Baxter facility is located at 1900 Highway 201 N in Mountain H"

      "SummaryText": "ome, Arkansas. Baxter is a hospital products and pharmaceutical manufacturer specializing in IV solutions and premixed drugs, IV infusion pumps and administration sets, parenteral nutrition, etc.\r\n\r\nThe NAICS code for the facility is 325412. The facility uses ethylene oxide for product sterilization, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. \r\n\r\n400 pound cylinders of ethylene oxide are used for each sterilization vessel. There are a total of seven (7) sterilization vessels used at one time, resulting in 2800 pounds of ethylene oxide \"on-line\" at any given time. However, the sterilization lines are individually piped to each sterilization vessel. Therefore, a release of one (1) ethylene oxide cylinder is not expected to result in a release to the other cylinders. \r\n\r\nAn aerial map identifying the site location is included as Appendix A. \r\n\r\nIV.\tHazard Assessment - Worse Case Scenarios (WCS)\r\nAppendix B consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the worst-case scenario. Appendix C consists of the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the worse case release scenario. \r\n\r\nV.\tHazard Assessment - Alternative Release Scenarios (ARS)\r\nAppendix B consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the alternative release scenario. Appendix D consists of the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the alternative release scenario. \r\n\r\nVI.\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and the EPA Risk Management Program.   \r\n\r\nThis prevention program covers those processes that utilize ethylene oxide above the threshold quantity for both PSM and RMP rules. \r\n\r\nVII.\tFive-Year Accident History\r\nThe Baxter facility has not experienced an accidental ethylene oxide release, which resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant pr"

This coordination effort includes providing the agency with a copy of our EAP, and providing a site diagram and hazardous material information, meeting with Mountain Home Fire Department personnel to discuss the facility's operations/processes, and encouraging periodic on-site inspections and coordination with Mountain Home Fire Department personnel.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Baxter does not have designated personnel as members of a hazardous materials response team. The facility will rely on response by the Mountain Home Fire Department and HAZMAT Team, in the event of a ethylene oxide release.\r\n\r\nThe facility utilizes a windsock onsite to determine wind direction in the event of an ethylene oxide release and evacuation of the building.  The windsock is located on the EO Shed. \r\n\r\nThe current Safety Data Sheet (SDS) for ethylene oxide is included in Appendix E. \r\n\r\nIX.\tEmergency Communications\r\nThe telephone numbers of agencies and plant personnel that may be contacted in case of an emergency are available onsite.\r\n\r\nX.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nChemical safety is an important part of Baxter's operations.
