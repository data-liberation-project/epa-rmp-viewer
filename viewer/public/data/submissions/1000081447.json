This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, training, quality assurance, and the consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent releases of regulated substances. \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nSalt Creek owns and operates a natural gas processing facility, Salt Creek Midstream Pecos Plant, in Reeves County, Texas. There are two Cryogenic plants designed to process 200 MMSCFD of natural gas each, both utilize the Cryogenic Process to recover natural gas liquids.  Regulated Flammable Substances recovered by or involved in the process include:\n\n\n\n1.    Flammable NGL (Y-Grade) composed of:\n\na.    Methane\n\nb.    Ethane\n\nc.    Propane\n\nd.    Butane\n\ne.    Isobutane\n\nf.    Pentane\n\n\n\n2.    Propane, used as a refrigerant\n\n\n\nResidue gas removed from the process is shipped out via a residue gas pipeline.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nSalt Creek encourages employees to participate in all aspects of Process Safety Management (PSM) and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the facility and addresses each accident prevention program element. Refer to Salt Creek Midstream PSM/RMP Manual- Section 1.\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Salt Creek Midstream Pecos Plant maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of "

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.\n\n\n\nFor specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g. temperature, level, and composition). The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g. automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nThe facility also maintains documentation that provides information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as evaluating proposed changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised. Refer to Salt Creek Midstream PSM/RMP Manual- Section 2.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nSalt Creek has implemented a comprehensive program to identify and control hazards associated with the PSM/RMP covered process. Process Hazard Analysis Studies (PHAs) are conducted using the HAZOP methodology, with a team of Salt Creek employees who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. The team identifies and evaluates potential hazards and makes recommendations to mitigate the risk.  The final recommendations are tracked to closure, and resolution of each finding is documented and retained."

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are also documented and retained.  Refer to Salt Creek Midstream PSM/RMP Manual- Section 3.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Salt Creek Midstream Pecos Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for the training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed to maintain correctness and annually certified as current and accurate.  These procedures are readily available in the facility for operators and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job task.  Refer to Salt Creek Midstream PSM/RMP Manual- Section 4.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nSalt Creek has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the covered process. New employees receive basic training in process operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator learns process-specific duties and tasks. A performance review is administered and must be successfully completed during this training period.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every three years, or more frequently if requested. All training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify and demonstrate skills.
