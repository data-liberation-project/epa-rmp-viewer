This facility complies with NFPA-58 requirements for LP-Gas storage, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable state, federal and local laws.  We also comply with the State Railroad Commision on the safe handling and distribution of Anhydrous Ammonia and Propane.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Lipscomb County Sheriff's Department and request them to respond.                                                                               We are an agricultural  based business, and we sell Anhydrous Ammonia to farmers for fertilizer, for crops like wheat, milo, corn, etc.  We also sell propane to local residents, farmers, and businesses.            We have one 11,000 gallon Anhydrous Ammonia tank and its associated piping, valves, etc.  When filled to 85% the worst case scenario would be a tank failure, resulting in a gas release.  According to our guide distance to endpoint if 1.02 miles.  Esimated population 375 people, a school, residences, recreation areas, a small commercial business district and several churches.  This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes, and regulations.  The Anhydrous Ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance  with the State Railroad Commision and State law.        There are three propane tanks, each holding 6000 gallons, and associated piping, valves, etc. The worst case scenario would be a failure of one of these 6000 gallon tanks, when filled at 88% capacity @ 60F, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  According to EPA's look-up tables, the distance to endpoint is 0.4 miles.  There are homes, and a cemetary in this area, with an estimated population of 10 people.  The propane facility is designed and maintained in accordance with the State Railroad Commision and any and all state laws.                                                                 "

We have discussed this policy with the volunteer fire department and the Sheriff's Department and have had them inspect our propane and Anhydrous Ammonia systems.  We are happy to report that we have had no accidents at this facility, in the past five years, and hope to constantly update and review our safetly programs and procedures, to maintain our good standing."
