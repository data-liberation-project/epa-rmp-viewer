Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Triangle Agronomy Services, LLC are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental\nsafety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release prevention\nprogram that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and\nemployee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement\nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a\nrelease does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the\neffects of the release.    We are also coordinated with the Mahnomen Fire Department which\nprovides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n  2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities includes support services  for crop production.  We have Anhydrous\nAmmonia  stored in one 30,000 gallon tank located at our facility in Mahnomen, MN (Figure 1). \nThe maximum amount stored is 25,800 gallons (132,767 lbs.) at the maximum fill capacity of 86%.\n\n  3. The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenarios\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we utilized RMP Comp \nprovided by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The following paragraphs provide details\nof the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the\nanhydrous ammonia storage tank (132,767 lbs.) in gaseous form over 10 minutes.   At Class F\natmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s windspeed  and urban topography, the maximum distance of 5.2 miles\nis obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L (Figure 2).\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a release from a anhy"
