(PFI), Lost Hills Facility (Facility) at 13646 Highway 33, Lost Hills, CA 93249 are committed to preventing the accidental release of any regulated substance.  If an accidental release should occur, the Facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to employees, people, and the environment.  An emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release of any regulated substance covered by this plan.\r\n\r\n2.\tDescription of the Stationary Source\r\nThe pistachio processing operations at the Facility consists of multiple hulling and drying operations, over 100 drying and storage silos, and various classifying, roasting and packaging operations.  The almond processing operations includes  grading and color sorting lines, hand sorting lines, blanching operations, sterilization equipment, flavoring equipment, roasting equipment, and packaging lines.  A water treatment plant at the Facility provides process water for the pistachio processing operations, the almond blanching operations, the boilers, and a state certified potable water plant that serves the Facility.\r\n\r\nSupply water for the water treatment plant is stored in a freshwater reservoir located approximately 650 yards east of the Facility.  Water is piped from the freshwater reservoir through the adjacent sand filtration equipment and the subject chlorination plant where it is injected with gaseous chlorine.  The water then travels through approximately 1 mile of piping to storage tanks located next to the water treatment plant.  Gaseous chlorine is utilized in the initial disinfection, primarily bacterial and viral destruction, of the process water.  The initial disinfection of the process water is achieved by withdrawing a metered volume of gaseous"

Normally, two one-ton cylinders are connected to the chlorine injection system; however, the operational design of the system allows only one cylinder to be in service at a time.  Typically, two additional one-ton cylinders, disconnected from the chlorine injection system, are stored at the chlorination plant.\r\n\r\nThe integral components of the chlorine injection system are two automatic switchover vacuum regulators (one on each cylinder connected to the chlorine injection system), a stand-by pressure release (vent) valve, a manual adjusting valve with flow rate indicator, and a chlorine ejector assembly.  The one-ton cylinders are the only pressurized components of the system.  The vacuum actuated regulator, connected to the active cylinder, withdraws and dispenses gaseous chlorine to the ejector valve.  Adjustment of chlorine dose is accomplished with a manual adjusting valve connected to the system.  The ejector valve component serves two functions, the first being vacuum production, the second is mixing of gaseous chlorine with raw filtered water.\r\n\r\nAdditional regulated substances are handled at the Facility; however, all regulated substances are handled in quantities below federal threshold planning quantity and all regulated substances, but Anhydrous Ammonia, are handled in quantities below state threshold planning quantity. (See Ammonia Processes described in CalARP November 2017 report)\r\n\r\n3.\tChemicals Subject to EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\nWPA uses chlorine at the Facility in quantities large enough to trigger both California's Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP) and the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Program.  Chlorine is transported to the Facility by truck, stored onsite in one-ton cylinders, and used for water disinfection.  \r\n\r\n4.\tRisk Management Plan (RMP) Worst-Case Scenarios and Alternate Releas"

      "SummaryText": "e Scenarios\r\n\r\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\r\nAnhydrous liquid chlorine (chlorine gas that is stored as a liquid under pressure) is imported to the site by truck and stored in one-ton cylinders.  The worst-case release scenario assumes that the entire contents of a one-ton cylinder is emitted as a gas cloud in 10 minutes, during a period of calm winds and stagnant atmospheric conditions (1.5 meters/second wind speed and F atmospheric stability).  The Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA) modeling program was used to estimate the downwind impacts for a one-ton chlorine release.  Rural surface roughness conditions were utilized to account for the relatively open land in the vicinity of the Facility.  According to the American Industrial Hygiene Association's Emergency Response Planning Guidelines and Workplace Environmental Exposure Level Guides Handbook, the toxic endpoint for chlorine is 3 ppm (0.0087 mg/L).  \r\nAlternate Release Scenario\r\nThe PHA team selected the following hypothetical situation as the alternate release scenario: during cylinder change-out or while in operation, the valve connection between the cylinder and vacuum regulator begins to leak.  The Handbook of Chlorination states that a chlorine withdrawal rate in excess 0.28 lb/min (400 lb/day) for a one-ton cylinder at 68 oF will lead to a cooling of the system and potential freezing of the cylinder.  However, for the purpose of this evaluation, a release rate of 0.6 lb/min was utilized.  It was also assumed that the leak would be repaired within 60 minutes.\r\n\r\nEPA's suggested alternative release scenario parameters of 3.0 meters/second wind speed and D atmospheric stability were utilized to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint associated with this release rate.  \r\n\r\n5.\tProcess Safety Management Accident Prevention Program\r\nThe chlorination plant at the Facility is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations for all equipment and operations associated with chlorine"
