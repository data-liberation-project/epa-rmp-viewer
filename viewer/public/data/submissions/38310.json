To accomplish this we integrate health, safety, and environmental planning into all business activities.  This includes complying with applicable laws, responsibly managing risks, and working collaboratively with others in addressing health safety, and environmental issues.\n\nIn the Borden Chemical, Inc. Safety Manual, the Safety Policy Statement clearly states that safety will not be compromised to achieve any other operational or business objective.  This manual defines requirements and guidelines developed to prevent injuries and accidental releases. \n\nIncluded in the Safety Manual is Emergency Response Polices that states that safety is the top priority in all emergency response situations.  This policy refers to the plant's Emergency Response Plan for specific procedures for handling releases of hazardous materials. \n\n2. Stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\nThis plant is a fully integrated facility which makes phenol-formaldehyde resins, urea-formaldehyde resins, formaldehyde solutions, and petroleum wax emulsions.  Formaldehyde has a wide variety of uses as a feedstock for many chemical products as well as the resins that we produce onsite.  The resins are primarily used in manufacture of forest products such as particleboard, medium density fiberboard, plywood and oriented strand board.  Other resin uses include other building products such as fiberglass roofing shingles and fiberglass insulation.\n\n3. Accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps\n\nThis plant has a comprehensive process safety management program that is in compliance with the EPA Accidental Release Prevention Rule, the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, and all applicable state codes and regulati"

This management system includes the Safety Manual, a list of site safety responsibilities, a file system to maintain records of compliance, and monthly Health, Safety, & Environmental Steering Committee meetings, where a management control checksheet is used to verify that tasks were completed on schedule.  The Plant Manager has overall responsibility for this program.\n\nProcess Stewards are assigned to maintain and improve the safety of their units.  Their duties include keeping operation procedures up-to-date; training operating technicians so they can safely follow theses procedures; assuring that the plant is run safely on a daily basis; and, when necessary, investigating incidents in their unit. All employees participate in the safety program to improve safety and plant operation.\n\nEach Process Steward maintains an Operating Guide that includes process safety information, operating procedures, equipment information, process safety information, mechanical integrity information, and a training certification program. Operating technicians use this Operating Guide as a training tool and for reference. By applying the information it contains their actions prevent accidental releases.\n\nProcess hazard analyses are conducted to identify hazards and recommend safeguards that prevent a release. As a result of initial process hazard reviews, a significant investment was made in process control systems.  Several control interlocks are installed to insure safety, including an automatic deluge system for phenolic resin production. Should a batch become unstable, this system floods the reactor with water, diluting the reactants while removing excess heat.  It operates either automatically based on control system monitoring of the process, or manually by the technician.\n\nTwo methods are used to assure that changes to plant equipment, procedures, or processes do not cause accidents.

This review may include a process hazard analysis or other safety reviews.  \n\nChanges to product formulations initiate a review by a regulatory affairs specialist, a formulation chemist, a process engineer, and the plant manager. Training is then performed as needed to assure that those affected by the change understand its impact. In addition, Pre-Start-up Safety Reviews are performed to assure that the plant can be started up and operated safely after a significant change is made.\n\nA preventive maintenance program maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment. A computer database is used to manage the preventive maintenance schedule.  Periodically, scheduled equipment inspections, tests, or servicing are performed. The schedule is based on plant experience to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release caused by equipment failure, and may include weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly inspections and maintenance.\n\nThe requirements in the Safety Manual include safe work practices which prevent accidental releases. One important section describes safety measures for welding or other \"hot\" work, which includes a Hot Work Permit system to reduce the risk of \nfire. The Safety Manual also includes requirements for locking out and tagging out equipment for maintenance. These procedures \nreduce the likelihood that a valving error will lead to a release.\n\nContractors who perform work in the plant are given safety orientations on plant hazards and safety practices. Contractor \nsafety programs and performance are evaluated prior to their selection for jobs that impact process safety using the Contractor Screening Form.\n\nIncidents that cause or could have caused a release are investigated and their root cause determined.

Emergency response program\n\nThe plant operating staff is trained in Hazard Communication, First Aid, and fire prevention as a part of Borden's Safety Program.  In addition, Borden has a contractual agreement with Cusa Environmental, Inc., to provide a well-trained and equipped Emergency Response Team should an upset condition exceed the capabilities of plant personnel. This team is available on a 24 hour, seven day a week basis.\n\n6.  Planned changes to improve safety\n\nNo changes are planned at this time."
