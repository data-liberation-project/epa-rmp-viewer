In the power generation process, isopentane is used as the binary working fluid.  Due to the chemical characteristics of isopentane and the quantities stored and used on site, it qualifies as a regulated substance under the provisions of Title 40, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 - Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions and the establishment of a Risk Management Plan or RMP.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this RMP is to assist Thermo No. 1 with preventing or minimizing the consequences of accidental releases of vapors, flammable, or explosive substances that could cause harm to the surrounding public and/or the environment.  This RMP update qualifies as the required five (5) year update to the original RMP submitted in Jan. 2013.  \n\n\n\nThis RMP update has been developed by Industrial Health & Safety Technologies, LLC on behalf of Thermo No. 1 to meet the requirements of 40 CFR 68, furthermore called the \"Rule\".  The format of this RMP update will also follow a similar format to the original submittal in 2013 for ease of employee and operator understanding and use.  In some chapters and sections, complete new and additional material has been added to increase awareness or better meet program requirements.  Additional material meeting this criterion shall be labeled: (NEW).\n\n\n\nThis RMP update is comprised of five chapters.  Chapter 1 is the executive summary of the RMP plan and process description.  Chapters 2 through 4 include a discussion of requirements for registration of the plan with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), plan certification, and an offsite hazard assessment, respectively.  Chapter 5 discusses other plan requirements set forth in the Rule.  Figures and Appendices are found at the end of each chapter in which they occur.\n\n\n\n\n\n(NEW)  P"

      "SummaryText": "rocess Description\n\n\n\nThermo No. 1 utilizes geothermal production wells to deliver heated well water to the vaporizer and then a pre-heater.  Here the well water temperature is slightly increased before it enters the heat exchangers.  The heat exchangers utilize a binary system where the well water doesn't actually come in contact with a separately contained working fluid (isopentane).  Because isopentane's boiling point is much lower than water the fluid vaporizes quickly creating enough pressure to spin the turbines.  The spinning turbine then spins the generator and electricity is produced.  The isopentane and the well water remain in their own separate closed loop systems.\n\n\n\nThe isopentane vapor then moves from the turbines into the condensers.  Here the isopentane vapor is condensed back into a liquid as water from an adjacent cooling tower circulates through the condenser tubes, thus dropping the temperature and condensing the vapor.  Once the isopentane is back in a liquid form, it is pressurized and re-circulated through the heat exchangers and the whole closed loop process continues.\n\n\n\nThe facility currently generates approximately 12 MW gross of \"green\" electricity.\n\n\n\nThe entire isopentane closed loop system involving the heat exchangers, vaporizers and condensers along with the adjacent storage tank containing the isopentane will be considered as the \"process\" throughout this manual and update.\n\n\n\nIsopentane is the regulated substance above the threshold quantity listed in the Rule, thus requiring the facility to register this chemical and follow the requirements of an RMP.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2   LOCATION AND SITE DESCRIPTION\n\n\n\nThermo No. 1 is situated in the remote desert region of Utah approximately 17 miles west of the town of Minersville and approximately 1.0 mile north of the Beaver County/Iron County line (see Figure 1.1 - Site & Facility Location Map).   The entire site consists of approximately 1,120 acres of land with the facility and production/injectio"

Topography at the site slopes gently to the northwest at a slope of approximately 50 vertical feet per mile.  Thermo Hot Springs are located approximately 1.0 mile northwest of the facility in the center of the valley between the Black and Shauntie Mountain ranges.\n\n\n\n(NEW)  The actual facility with the power generation equipment, support equipment, offices and substation occupy approximately 8 acres on the site.  The entire facility area is fenced with the front main office as the security point of check in for all contractors, visitors and/or vendors.\n\n\n\n1.3   APPLICABILITY\n\n\n\nThe Thermo No. 1 facility is no longer in the planning, design and construction phases of their power generation facility and therefore has all process units and storage vessels identified on site.  \n\n\n\n(NEW) The working fluid used in the Thermo No. 1 geothermal power generation process is isopentane (CAS No. 78-78-4).  The Safety Data Sheet listing all the chemical and physical properties for isopentane is found in Appendix A - (NEW) Conoco/Phillips SDS for Isopentane.   \n\nIn the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions Rule, certain toxic and/or flammable substances are regulated under the Rule.  These regulated substances and their threshold quantities are listed in Tables 1, 2, 3, and 4 of 40 CFR 68.130.  If a facility has a regulated substance greater than the listed threshold quantity contained in the process, then the substance and the facility must meet the requirements of the Rule.  Isopentane is found in Table 3, with a threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.\n\nAt the Thermo No. 1 site, exact quantities used in the process and their storage locations can be found in Table 1-1 - Isopentane Quantity and Storage Locations.\n\n\n\nTable 1-1 - Isopentane Quantity and Storage Locations\n\n\n\nLevel 2\n\nHeat Exchangers/Vaporizers/Condensers    16,500 gal.       16,500 gal.\n\n"

      "SummaryText": "\n\n\n\nThe total volume of isopentane in use and contained in the Level 2 process at the Thermo No. 1 site is 16,500 gallons or 85,372 lbs. @ a bulk density of 5.174 lbs./gal.  This volume and weight exceeds the 10,000 lb. threshold in the Level 2 process, therefore isopentane and the Thermo No. 1 facility is required to comply with the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions standard (40 CFR 68), and establish a Risk Management Plan or RMP.\n\nUnder the Rule, facilities are also required to determine their level of compliance and registration, dependent upon whether Program 1, 2, or 3 criterion is met (see 40 CFR 68.10(b)).  During the past five years (2013-2018) the Thermo No. 1 facility continues to meet the eligibility requirements of a Program 1 certification.  A facility is eligible for Program 1 certification provided it meets the following requirements:\n\nFor the five years prior to the submission of an RMP, and the five years since, the process has not had an accidental release of the regulated substance (isopentane) where exposure to the substance, its reaction products, overpressure generated by an explosion involving the substance, or radiant heat generated by a fire involving the substance led to any of the following offsite consequences:\n\n(i) Death;\n\n(ii) Injury; or\n\n(iii) Response or restoration activities for an exposure of an environmental receptor\n\n\n\nThis Plan is written to meet the requirements established in the Rule under Program 1 certification, and continues to certify that no additional measures are necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accidental releases (see Chapter 3).\n\n"
