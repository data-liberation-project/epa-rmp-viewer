All applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to.  \n\nThe Goldschmidt Chemical Corporation Hopewell plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in safety and environmental protection, employee safety training and safety in the design installation, operation and maintenance of plant equipment.  GCC has implemented reasonable controls to prevent and mitigate probable releases of highly hazardous chemicals.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nGoldschmidt Chemical Corporation?s Hopewell plant is specialty chemicals production facility located at 914 E. Randolph Road in Hopewell, Virginia.  The plant is situated on approximately 40 acres on the east side of Hopewell in the industrial section of the city.  \n\nOrganic surfactants and esters have been manufactured at the GCC Hopewell site since 1982, with an organo-modified silicones production facility added in 1991.  The Hopewell Polyether Plant (HPE-1) produces specialty polyethers began operation in 2004.  The plant employs approximately 125 employees at the Randolph Road site and is operated 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\nGoldschmidt Chemical Corporation produces organic surfactants, organo-modified silicones and polyethers at the Hopewell, Virginia facility.  As defined by the regulations, the Hopewell facility stores the following Highly Hazardous Chemicals (HHC?s) in excess of the threshold quantities: \n? Ethylene Oxide (CAS # 75-21-8), Maximum storage capacity = 174,488 pounds\n? Propylene Oxide (CAS # 75-56-9), Maximum storage capacity = 177,399 pounds\n? Allyl Alcohol (CAS # 107-18-6), Maximum storag"

      "FacilityID": 42512,
      "SummaryText": "e capacity = 83,704 pounds  \n\nThe HHC?s are utilized in the HPE-1 production facility to produce specialty polyethers that are used primarily as a raw material in the production of organo-modified silicones.\n\n\nWORST-CASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO\nThe Risk Management Program (RMP) rule requires the development of accidental release scenarios and off-site consequence analysis for the toxic chemicals at our site.\n\nA worst-case scenario and alternate release scenario are designed to evaluate the potential impact to the surrounding community.  EPA defines the worst-case scenario as the complete release of the largest inventory of a chemical over ten minutes under weather conditions that would allow the chemical to travel the farthest distance at ground level.  It assumes that none of the facility?s controls or safety systems is functional.  A worst-case scenario is a highly unlikely event.  \n\nThe worst-case toxic release for the Hopewell plant would be the catastrophic failure of the ethylene oxide storage tank.
