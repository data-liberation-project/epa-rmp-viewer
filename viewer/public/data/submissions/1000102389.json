In the event of a significant release of propane that involve off site populations, these populations will be notified through the LEPC.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety: \n\nRailcar storage at this facility was initiated in August of 2017.  Compliance with Kiros environmental, health and safety standards and expectations forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.  \n\nSpecific actions that will be taken in the future to improve the level of safety at the facility include:\n \n--Compliance audits will be conducted to evaluate compliance with the CAP provisions and to evaluate improvement opportunities.\n--Coordination with the Fort Edward Fire Department will continue to ensure a constant state of readiness to respond to any potential emergencies.\n--Additional improvements will be implemented as a result of FSA and hazard review recommendations. \n\nRegistration: \n\nThis registration includes the required information referenced in 40 CFR \u00a768.160(b)(1) through (20) to be reported for a Program 2 process. \n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis: \n\nAs a Program 2 process with a regulated flammable substance, an offsite consequence analysis (OCA) has been performed for at least one worst-case release scenario and at least one alternative release scenario.
