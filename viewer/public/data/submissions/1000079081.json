      "SummaryText": "This facility was constructed in 1969 and is used to distribute pre-packaged industrial chemicals and packaging chlorine from railcar into ton and 150 pound cylinders.  Access to the site is restricted to Harcros employees, and authorized contractors and visitors.  The resubmittal of the RMP is for the packaging and storage of chlorine plus the storage of sulfur dioxide in ton and 150 pound cylinders.  The same properties that make chlorine and sulfur dioxide valuable as commodity chemicals also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as that of our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  Harcros has a long standing commitment to safety and protection of the environment where we take a systematic proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.   We are proud not to have an RMP reportable incident in the last 5-years.  As members of the National Association of Chemical Distributors we adhere to the principals of Responsible Distribution and are committed to continuous improvement.  Harcros is also a member of The Chlorine Institute, which this facility's emergency response program is based upon their Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities.  We work closely with our suppliers, customers, responders, and The Chlorine Institute to continuously improve our emergency response capabilities.  \r\nAs part of continuous improvement culture, Harcros recently upgrading the chlorine deck roof and electrical at the facility.  In addition, Harcros is in process of installing new secondary containment for the tank farm and upgrading the testing and reconditioning of cylinders."
