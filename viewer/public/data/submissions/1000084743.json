Facility construction was completed in 2002 and packaging operations commenced immediately afterwards.  The facility is situated on approximately 20 acres located at 3950 Highway 30 South, St. Gabriel, Louisiana 70776.\r\n\r\nThe site is located in Iberville Parish.  The property is bound on the north side by Highway 30\r\nSouth, on the west side by Harcros Chemicals and on the east side by Hydro-Chem. On the North side of the facility, across Hwy 30, is a truck stop.  The area is heavily industrial primarily related to chemical manufacturing and transportation.\r\n\r\n1.2\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICES\r\nDCS - St. Gabriel is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process at our facility.   It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\r\n\r\n1.3\tTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\r\nThe DCS - St. Gabriel facility's primary activities are repackaging and warehousing of chemicals. DCS - St. Gabriel either repackages or warehouses regulated substances at this facility.  The regulated substances are listed below.  DCS - St. Gabriel receives the regulated substances in bulk and packages the products for customer distribution.   Packaged products are then warehoused or shipped depending on customer specifications.  Inventory is dependent upon customer orders and not all regulated substances a"

DCS - St. Gabriel is a Program 2 level facility.\r\nTo evaluate the worst case and alternative scenarios, EPA's RMP*Comp&trade; program was used to evaluate off-site consequences.  RMP*Comp&trade; is based on the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario for the regulated chemicals involves the catastrophic failure of the largest vessel containing the regulated substance at the facility and is either a rail car (est. 20,600 gallons) or a tanker truck (est. 6,000 gallons), depending on the regulated chemical, but for conservatism all worst-case scenarios assume catastrophic failure of a rail car.  Worst-case scenarios for the regulated chemicals were run at the highest daily maximum temperature ever recorded in the St. Gabriel area, 104 degrees Fahrenheit (\u00b0F), according to the National Weather Service.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenarios include:\r\n\u00bf\t3 hose with 1 puncture while filling at 90\u00b0F that leaks for 15 minutes.  \r\n\u00bf\t3 hose separation flange at 90\u00b0F that leaks for 15 minutes.  \r\n\u00bf\tdrum punctured in warehouse that releases all contents within three minutes at 90\u00b0F.\r\n\u00bf\tfour drums falling off the loading dock and contents leaking within one minute at 100\u00b0F.  \r\n\u00bf\toverfilling of a drum at the"

DCS - St. Gabriel is subject to EPCRA Section 302 and 313 notification requirements.  The following sections briefly describe elements of the release prevention program that is in place at the stationary source.  Each of these elements are discussed in more detail later in this RMP.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nDCS - St. Gabriel maintains a record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the process. \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within the covered process, DCS - St. Gabriel maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after maintenance. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nDCS - St. Gabriel has a training program in place to ensure that employees are competent in the operating procedures associated with those processes. New employees receive training before starting work. Operating procedures are reviewed annually or more frequently as needed. \r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity \r\nDCS - St. Gabriel carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.

Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. These personnel receive specialized on the job training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a timely manner. \r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\nWritten procedures are in place at DCS - St. Gabriel to manage changes in chemicals being packaged, technology, equipment and procedures. Process operators and maintenance personnel whose job tasks are affected by a change or modification of process conditions are made aware of the changes. \r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nDCS - St. Gabriel conducts compliance audits to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. These audits will be carried out annually or whenever there is a change in the process.  Any corrective actions identified as a result of the audits will be undertaken promptly. \r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nDCS - St. Gabriel promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the root cause of the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the incident from recurring. Reports are retained in the DCS intraweb-based Compliance Management System (CMS).  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nDCS - St. Gabriel believes that incident prevention is a team effort and involves employees in the incident prevention process.
