This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, Henry Complex trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the Henry Complex, and/or notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\t \n\nThe Henry Complex consists of two facilities (the Henry Gas Processing / Natural Gas Liquid (NGL) Fractionation Plant and the Sea Robin Gas Processing Plant) - located across the street from each other, and operated under the same management structure.  These facilities are located at 5624 Aristide Road near Henry, Louisiana.  \n\nThere are three processes located within this Henry Complex.  Those processes include (1) the Sea Robin Processing Area, (2) the Henry Processing / NGL Fractionation Area, and (3) the Henry Product Storage Area.  \n\nIt should be noted that the Henry Product Storage Area is no longer being used for product storage and the Henry Processing / NGL Fractionation Area is no longer processing gas and/or NGL fractionation.  It should also be noted that there are no immediate plans to return either of these processes to their original operational service.  In its current state, the Henry Processing / NGL Fractionation Area provides (1) condensate/free liquid removal and dehydration of natural gas prior to re-delivery to transmission pipeline systems, and (2) Y-grade NGL product handling and delivery services into NGL transmission pipel"

However, for the purpose of this RMPlan submittal, the inventory calculations and the off-site consequence analyses were based on the entire Henry Complex being in full operational service.  \n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) for the Henry Complex is a vapor cloud explosion involving the largest inventory of a flammable mixture (predominately consisting of Normal Butane) contained in a single pressurized storage vessel.  The maximum quantity possible contained within this storage vessel is 1,500,000 pounds.  Although administrative controls are in place to limit this quantity, those controls were not considered in calculating this maximum quantity determination.  The entire inventory of the storage tank is assumed to release, forming a vapor cloud, igniting and exploding - creating a Vapor Cloud Explosion (VCE).  Using RMP*CompTM, the maximum distance to the 1-psig overpressure endpoint is 0.9 miles. Although there are numerous controls to prevent such releases, and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) that is used as a planning case at the Henry Complex is a 1\" nozzle on a propane storage tank detaching, and causing a release of pressurized propane liquid to the atmosphere at a rate of 475 pounds per minute.  This particular ARS is assumed to last for 10 minutes before operation of isolation valves, pumps, fire monitor cooling water and/or other mitigating actions can be utilized to mitigate the release.  Under this ARS, the released propane vapor is accidentally ignited - causing a vapor cloud fire (VCF).  Using RMP*CompTM, the maximum distance to the Lower Flammability Limit endpoint for this ARS is 0.1 mile.  With a radius of 0.1 miles, this ARS would extend outsid"

This event was selected as being a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response..\n\n GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \n \n  The following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Henry Complex.  The above referenced processes at the Henry Complex are regulated by both the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) rule and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard.  Because RMP accident prevention requirements for these processes are essentially the same as PSM, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program at the Henry Complex.\n \n Employee Participation\n \n The Henry Complex encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention, including process hazard analyses, incident investigations, and the development of operating and maintenance procedures. Employees also participate in safety meetings, resolving certain safety concerns, and updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information pertaining to the process and critical equipment.  \n \n Employees have access to all information created as part of the Henry Complex's accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in a written employee participation plan that is maintained at the Henry Complex.  This employee participation plan addresses each accident prevention program element.  \n \n In addition, the Henry Complex has a number of initiatives under way which address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the Henry Complex, incl"

This PHA team identifies and evaluates potential hazards of the process, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and then makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures. \n \n The PHA team recommendations are forwarded to local management for resolution. Implementation of additional prevention and/or mitigation options in response to PHA recommendations is based on a relative priority ranking assigned by the PHA team.  The approved mitigation options in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.\n \n The Henry Complex periodically revalidates these PHAs.
