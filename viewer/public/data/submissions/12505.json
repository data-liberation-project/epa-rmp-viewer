(GPRI), a wholly owned subsidiary of Georgia-Pacific Corporation, owns and operates a synthetic resin manufacturing facility in Elk Grove, CA.  The resin plant was originally constructed in 1967 by Union Carbide and it was subsequently purchased by GPRI in 1982.  Overall, the facility employs 31 full-time employees.\n\nGPRI is committed to operating the Elk Grove, CA plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, GPRI  has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Elk Grove Plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMP Plan) describing the risk management program at the Elk Grove Plant. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Elk Grove Plant.\n\nThe risk management program at the Elk Grove Plant consists of the following three elements:\n\n7 a hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances).\n \n7 a prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes).\n \n7 an emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMP Plan.\n\nAlt"

      "SummaryText": "hough the risk management program at the Elk Grove Plant helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the safety program at the Elk Grove Plant.  In fact, the Elk Grove Plant has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance and injuries and damage from a release of a hazardous substance.\n\nGPRI limits the use of hazardous substances.  Before using a hazardous substance at the Elk Grove Plant, less hazardous alternatives are considered. When a hazardous substance is used at the Elk Grove Plant, GPRI considers the potential for this substance to adversely affect plant workers, the public, and the environment and takes steps to prevent any such effects.\n\nGPRI prevents releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  When a hazardous substance is used at the Elk Grove Plant, the equipment is carefully designed, built and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment. \n\n                            8-1\n\n\n\n \n\n8.  FEDERAL MANDATED RMP SUBMISSION (Con't)\n\nGPRI limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  GPRI trains its workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  In addition, GPRI works with the local fire department and with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to help prevent injuries and/or environmental damage if a release does occur.\n\nThe safety program at the Elk Grove Plant consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the  RMP rule. This RMP Plan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at the Elk Grove Plant that are required by the RMP rule.\n\n8.1.a Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nGPRI is committed to the safety of workers and the public, and the prese"

GPRI implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These controls include training programs for personnel, programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes at the Elk Grove Plant; and programs to evaluate the hazards at the plant.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the Elk Grove Plant controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will prevent injury to the public and the environment.  GPRI provides response training to its personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local fire department.  Response activities have also been discussed with the LEPC.  \n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, GPRI established a management system headed by the Divisional Safety Manager to oversee safety-related activities.\n\n 8.1.b Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Elk Grove Plant handles one regulated substance in sufficient quantity to be covered by the RMP rule, as shown in the following list of RMP-covered Program Level 3 processes at the plant.\n\n Regulated Substance    Process    Process Quantity*, lbs    RMP Threshold, lbs*\nFormaldehyde Solution (50%)    Storage in Unpressurized, Heated Tanks    192,000    15,000\n\n* Process and threshold quantity is the quantity of \"pure\" chemical, not of the solution\n\n\n\n\n8-2\n\n\n\n\n\n8.

An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1)might occur at a facility like the Elk Grove Plant and (2) would result in the greatest potential offsite consequences if the release occurred.\n\nThe main objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).  The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less.\n\nWhen considering the release of a toxic substance, most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are possible.  Some people who are particularly susceptible to the substance released could be incapacitated.\n\nThe RMP rule includes specific requirements for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by GPRI.  These requirements are:\n\n7 one worst-case release scenario for the class of toxic substances in Program 3 processes\n \n7 one alternative release scenario for each of the toxic substances in a Program 3 process\n \nThe following information summarizes the offsite consequence analysis performed by the Elk Grove Plant:\n\n8.1.c.1. The \"worst-case release scenario\" for a 50% solution of formaldehyde is the release of the entire contents of a 40,000 gallon (192,000 lbs of pure formaldehyde) storage tank.

The plant maintains a standard operating procedure for this tank which requires the operator to manually verify the level of solution in the tank before it is filled with additional raw material.  In this way, the tank should not be overfilled.
