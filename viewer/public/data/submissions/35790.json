      "SummaryText": "\nThe Anne Arundel County Broadwater Water Reclamation Facility (BWWRF) located in Churchton, Maryland is designed to treat up to 2 million gallons per day of domestic wastewater.  The BWWRF treats wastewater from over 10,000 people in Anne Arundel County.   The facility is designed to remove pollutants from wastewater before discharging the reclaimed water into the Chesapeake Bay.  As part of this treatment system, chlorine and sulfur dioxide are used for disinfection and dechlorination, respectively.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are stored at the facility in one-ton cylinders.  Disinfection and dechlorination are common processes used by many wastewater treatment plants in the United States.\n\nAnne Arundel County Department of Public Works personnel have designed and implemented a Process Safety Management (PSM) program to ensure safe operation of the disinfection and dechlorination processes.  As part of the PSM program, a process hazards analysis has been conducted to evaluate the safety of each of these processes.  The minimum amount of chemicals required to meet the facility's discharge permit parameters is stored in enclosed brick buildings.  Standard operating procedures have been written for the safe handling of chlorine and sulfur dioxide cylinders.  Annual training is provided to facility personnel in safe handling and use of chlorine and sulfur dioxide, and a strict preventative maintenance program has been implemented for each process.  Monitors are installed in each enclosed chemical building to detect any leaks.  If a leak is detected, building ventilation systems shut off automatically preventing any chemical from escaping from the storage buildings.  In the event of a leak, Anne Arundel County Fire Department Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) unit is contacted and, if necessary, they will slowly and safely mitigate the situation under controlled conditions.  No releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide have occurred at the facility resulting in any off-site i"

The interagency relationship between the HAZMAT unit and the BWWRF personnel has fostered open communication and coordination of emergency response procedures and the safe handling and storage practices for chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  Through  this cooperative effort and the ongoing process safety management procedures at the facility, Anne Arundel County will continue to operate the Broadwater Water Reclamation Facility in an environmentally safe manner."
