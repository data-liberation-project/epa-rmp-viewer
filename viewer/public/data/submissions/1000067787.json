(MarkWest), owner and operator of the Hidalgo Gas Plant, has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Hidalgo Gas Plant processes raw gas from a field gathering system.  Produced natural gas is brought into the plant via the inlet slug catcher which separates condensate from the natural gas stream. The gas stream is then compressed, dehydrated to remove any water, and is then sent to a turbo-expander where the temperature is reduced. Ethane and heavier liquids are separated from the methane gas stream. The liquids are then stabilized using a de-methanizer to remove any methane entrained.  The methane is then sent to a sales pipeline and the NGLs are pumped into a product pipeline for sales.\n\n\n\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n\n\nThe worst-case accident scenario was determined by looking at several scenarios and determining which would have the greatest off-site impact.  Modeling using the RMP-COMP model shows the worst-case scenario is the release from a 30,000 gallon NGL product surge tank.  \n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario was considered to be a release from a propane transfer hose when filling the propane storage tank.  One thousand gallons is conservatively used to represent the amount that would be released prior to the truck driver responding and shutting off the valve.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of th"

Because the processes at the facility that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nMarkWest keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The reference documents are maintained on file at the facility to provide open access.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For the process, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in key process parameter documents.  The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \n\n\n\nMarkWest will use one or more of the following techniques to identify hazards: what-if, checklist, what-if/checklist, hazard and operability (HAZOP), failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA), or fault tree analysis (FTA).  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques and will be utilized for each major process change or renovation.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nEach PHA will address the following:\n\na)    hazards of the process,\n\nb)    previous incidents with likely potential for catastrophic consequences,\n\nc)    consequences of failure of engineering and administrative controls,\n\nd)    engineering and administrative control applicable to the hazards and their inter-relationships,\n\ne)    facility siting issues,\n\nf)    human factors.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are compiled in a written report and are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operative.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.  \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nMarkWest maintains written procedures that address various modes of operations, such as: unit startup; normal operations; temporary operations; emergency shutdown; normal shutdown; emergency operations, and initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.

Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the facility.\n\n\n\nHot Work Permit\n\n\n\nMarkWest uses a hot work permit for hot work operations including grinding, welding, and spark producing activities conducted on or near a covered process.  The hot work permit documents the fire prevention and protection requirements prior to beginning hot work operations. The permit indicates the days on which hot work may be performed and the object upon which hot work is to be performed. Hot work permits are kept in a place that is easily accessible for the workers and on file at the office until the completion of hot work operations.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe Hidalgo Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors: perform their work in a safe manner; have the appropriate knowledge and skills; are aware of the hazards in their workplace; understand what they should do in event of an emergency; understand and follow site safety rules; and inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with: a process overview; information about potential fire, explosion, or toxic release hazards; emergency response plan requirements; and safe work prac"

In addition, the Hidalgo Gas Plant will only select contractors who submit certification that employees are trained in specifics and safe work practices associated with their job, and that provide safety performance documentation from the previous three years.  Finally, facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe processes at the Hidalgo Gas Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.  \n\n\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\n\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-covered processes at the Hidalgo Gas Plant.  Collectively, these prevention program activities prevent or mitigate potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\n\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\n\n\nThe Hidalgo Gas Plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered process: \n\nRelease Detection\n\n\n\n1. Hand-held hydrocarbon detectors operated by facility personnel.  Personnel are on site 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\n  \n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n\n\n1.  Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases.\n\n\n\n2.  Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual and automated).\n\n\n\n3.  Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature)\n\n\n\n4.  Curbing or dyking to contain liquid releases.\n\n\n\n5.  Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system).\n\n\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n\n\n1.  Trained emergenc"

Personal protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing).\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe Hidalgo Gas Plant has had no accidents within the past 5 years.    \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe Hidalgo Gas Plant is a Non-Responding Facility as per 48 CFR 68.90(b). The facility maintains a written emergency action plan, which is in place to help protect employees and public safety as well as the environment. The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including: evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, and notification of company staff, local emergency response agencies, and the public if a release occurs. However, facility personnel are not trained to be first responders to large fires and should a release occur from one of the vessels the Hidalgo Gas Plant would rely on the local fire department to respond. Employees receive training in the procedures to be followed when certain employees must remain to operate critical process operations before they evacuate. The Hidalgo Gas Plant has around the clock communications capability with appropriate emergency response organizations (Fire Department, LEPC, and Sheriff's Office). This interface provides the means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Hidalgo Gas Plant is coordinated with the Eddy County Emergency Management Association (EMA).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Hidalgo Gas plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate EMA officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incide"

In addition to periodic EMA meetings, Hidalgo Gas Plant conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the EMA and emergency response organizations, and the facility provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the facility.  \n\n\n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\n\n\nThe PSM Coordinator has overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the RMP. Specific responsibilities are summarized in the supporting documentation associated with this RMP.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Hidalgo Gas Plant resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.  At this time there are no findings to report.\n\n\n\nDOCUMENTATION OF CALCULATION TO DETERMINE QUANTITY OF REGULATED SUBSTANCE AT THE HIDALGO GAS PLANT\n\n\n\nDocumentation of calculations to determine quantity of regulated substance is available upon request.\n\n"
