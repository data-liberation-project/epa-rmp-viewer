The facility has two ammonia systems (Degreening and Cold Storage). The Degreening\n\nSystem provides refrigeration capacity to one (1) plate and frame heat exchanger that is used to chill glycol. The Cold Storage System provides refrigeration capacity to three (3) cold storage\n\nrooms and one (1) loading dock. The cold storage rooms and loading dock both utilize ceiling suspended evaporator coils that contain chilled liquid ammonia. A computer system provides\n\nsubstantial control and alarm capability.\n\n\n\nBoth the Degreening and Cold Storage Systems are pumped overfeed systems and operate as follows: high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped through a series of liquid feed\n\nsolenoid valves, an expansion valve, and into a liquid recirculator. From there, low pressure liquid is pumped to each evaporator, where it passes through a solenoid valve, hand expansion valve\n\nand into evaporator. Low temperature liquid circulates through the evaporator. Low pressure and temperature gas and overfeed liquid passes through an isolation valve and is returned to the\n\nliquid recirculator. The residual liquid is separated from the gas in the recirculator and the suction gas is piped to screw compressor"

The\n\nhigh pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to a water cooled evaporative condenser where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquified and returned to a thermosyphon vessel, and\n\nfrom the thermosyphon vessel it returns to the high pressure receiver. High pressure liquid from the thermosyphon vessel is supplied to the oil coolers on each screw compressor. High\n\ntemperature liquid is evaporated in the oil cooler and a combination of high temperature gas and liquid is returned to the thermosyphon vessel by thermosyphon action.\n\n\n\nThe Paramount Citrus D1 facility was originally built in the 1998 by California Controlled Atmosphere and has been added to since that time. Most recently the following projects have occurred:\n\n2012/2013 - American Incorporated renovated the computer control system (Cold Storage System and Degreening System)\n\n2012 - American Incorporated installed new evaporative condensers on both systems.\n\n2012 - American Incorporated installed a new high pressure receiver, screw compressor, cold box, and loading dock (Cold Storage System)\n\n\n\nThe facility was designed and installed by professional refrigeration engineers in accordance with industry standards at the time. It was also built in compliance with the Uniform Mechanical Code\n\nand Uniform Building Code applicable at the time of construction. The system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures\n\nexceed or drop below established limits, and safety relief valves which vent ammonia gas to the atmosphere if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point. Lastly, each system has an\n\nemergency \"dump box\" that contains switches and valves to turn off equipment and vent ammonia if necessary.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia systems at Paramount Citrus D1 consist of vessels which are interconnected, or which are co-located such that a release of ammonia could impact the ability to operate ve"

Therefore, each system is treated as a single process.\n\n\n\n1.3 GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE & CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\n1.3.1 GENERAL\n\n\n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss\n\npreventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nParamount Citrus - Delano (D1) Facility has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for\n\nthe purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in the body of the program.\n\n\n\n1.3.2 ANHYDROUS AMMONIA\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Paramount Citrus - Delano (D1) Facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this\n\nprocess is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked\n\nfrequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment.\n\n\n\n1.4 FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nParamount Citrus - Delano (D1) Facility has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n\n\n1.5 EMERGENCY ACTION AND RESPONSE PLAN\n\n\n\nParamount Citrus - Delano (D1) Facility's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n\n? California \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 8 CCR ?3220\n\n? Federal \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 29 "

Federal \"Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response\" (HAZWOPER) - Title 29 CFR ?1910.120(q)\n\n\n\nStrategically, we will respond \"minimally\" to a release. Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the\n\nLocal Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team.\n\n\n\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\n\n\n\n1.6 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nOur company has an outstanding safety record, one that we are quite proud of. Many policies and procedures have been implemented to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.\n\nNevertheless, Paramount Citrus - Delano (D1) Facility continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\n\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Paramount Citrus - Delano (D1) Facility's ability to\n\ncommunicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Paramount Citrus - Delano (D1) Facility's management team\n\ncan ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\n\n\nParamount Citrus - Delano (D1) Facility has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection,\n\nprocess hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action\n\nitem has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMW"

A copy of Resource Compliance's service agreement has been included in this program with the support material.\n\n\n\nFor the future, Paramount Citrus - Delano (D1) Facility now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Paramount Citrus -\n\nDelano (D1) Facility employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement.
