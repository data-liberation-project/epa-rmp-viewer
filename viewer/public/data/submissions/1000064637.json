The facility is co-located with INEOS Battleground Manufacturing with which it shares support personnel and systems. The facility has a program to support the safe operation of the process at this facility. One component of this program is a Risk Management Program (RMP) which helps manage the risks and which complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's Regulation 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements (the RMP rule). This plan summary is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP Rule (40 CFR 68.150 through 40 CFR 68.185). \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \n\n\n\nGemini is committed to the welfare of the workers, the public, and to the preservation of the environment. Gemini employs reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. In the event of an accidental release, the facility will conduct emergency response action to help prevent or minimize injury to the public and the environment. \n\n\n\nFacility Process and Regulated Substances \n\n\n\nThe facility manufactures polyethylene for a wide variety of industrial and consumer applications. The manufacturing process uses ethylene as the basic building block for producing polyethylene. This material goes into a wide range of consumer materials including piping and water bottles. Ziegler catalyst is used for the polyethylene reaction, with isobutane as the hydrocarbon carrier or liquid carrier solvent. The regulated substances above the threshold quantity within the facility are isobutane and propylene. \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program \n\n\n\n1.    Process Safety Information - the facility maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to ensure safe operations of the covered processes. Safety Data Sheets (SDS) document the physical properties of all"

The engineering design documents include the operating parameters, the design basis and configuration of the equipment of the covered process, and references to applicable codes and standards. \n\n2.    Process Hazard Analysis - the facility performs and periodically updates risk assessments of the covered processes to ensure systematic identification and control of process hazards. Procedures used for conducting PHAs and the qualitative assessment of risk include consideration of off-site consequences and harm to the environment or the public. \n\n3.    Operating Procedures - the facility maintains its operating procedures under an ISO9000 program. As such, it is required to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operation should be performed. The operating procedures are used to train employees and contractors and serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets. \n\n4.    Training - To complement the written procedures for process operations, a comprehensive training program has been implemented for all workers involved in operating the process. The training program includes initial training, on-the-job training and classroom training. A unit walkthrough test and final peer review panel ensure a required level of practical knowledge by operators. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every three years. All of this training is documented, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training. \n\n5.    Mechanical Integrity - Well-established practices and procedures are used to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.

In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment. \n\n6.    Management of Change - A change management tool is utilized to ensure the proper reviews are conducted, hazards assessed, and a safe operation is maintained during and after a permanent or temporary change is implemented to the process.&#8239; Each MOC includes a risk assessment to identify the potential hazards of the change as well as a review of the supplemental checklist which is used to identify additional documentation and communication requirements and to raise questions that may not surface during the risk assessment.&#8239; Approval and action items are tracked in the MOC database. \n\n7.    Pre-Startup Safety Review -- PSSRs are performed whenever the process is modified in a manner which requires updating of process safety information. This review confirms (1) proper equipment was used, (2) safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are updated, (3) a risk assessment has been conducted, and (4) training has been implemented. \n\n8.    Compliance Audits - PSM and RMP compliance audits are performed at least every three years. Audits targeting specific regulatory element requirements may be performed more frequent through the Operational Audit process, if needed. Since this is a newly-constructed facility, the initial PSM and RMP compliance audits have not yet been performed.\n\n9.    Incident Investigation - All incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release are investigated. The incident investigation procedure requires an investigation team to be assembled and that the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident. The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are "

Employee Participation - Worker participation is promoted via a Process Safety Committee (PSC), which manages the elements of the PSM and RMP program at the site and includes hourly personnel. \n\n11.    Hot Work Permits - Hot work hazards are identified and mitigated using a Safe Work Permitting process.\n\n12.    Contractors - The facility maintains a program for the safety oversight of contractors.  This includes the review of all contractors prior to working on or near the covered process. The contractor must submit information that indicates the work can be performed competently and safely. The company will provide information on the hazards of the process and the safety practices in place. Documents are kept to confirm that the information was received and understood. In addition, procedures are in place which require the entrance, presence, and exit of contractors to be controlled. \n\n13.    Chemical-specific Prevention Steps - In addition to engineering review and hazard analysis previously mentioned, workers who perform operations involving covered chemicals receive training emphasizing safe handling procedures. In addition, several equipment safeguards are in place such as hydrocarbon detection, automated deluge systems, related piping and vessel periodic inspection and maintenance, and continuous process monitoring for operations. \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program \n\n\n\nAn established written emergency response plan that complies with the RMP rule and other federal contingency plans is in effect at the facility. This plan has been communicated to local emergency response officials through the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). Regular dialogue is maintained between the facility and the local response personnel.
