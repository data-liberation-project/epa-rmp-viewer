      "SummaryText": "Associated Wholesale Grocers, Inc. began operating this facility on August 23, 2003.  The facilitity is a food distribution warehouse that contains both dry grocery and refrigerated areas for perishable items.  The refrigerated areas of the warehouse are cooled by an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.  The properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions while operating the refrigeration system to prevent employee exposure, and to reduce the threat of exposure to nearby members of the community.\n\nAssociated Wholesale Grocers has chosen to follow the EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Rule, Program Level 3, to prevent a release of ammonia from the refrigeration system.  The amount of ammonia estimated to be contained inside the refrigeration system is 13,000 pounds.\n\nAssociated Wholesale Grocers complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, and applicable state codes and regulations to prevent a catastrophic release of ammonia.  The ammonia refrigeration system was constructed according to the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration guidelines (IIAR).  The system is maintained by trained operators and process controls are checked and inspected frequently to ensure proper operation.  Refrigeration operators are required to complete a training and certification program to operate the ammonia refrigeration system.  Other employees receive overview training related to the ammonia system and emergency evacuation instructions.\n\nA Chemical Accident Prevention Program has been developed to help prevent an accidental release.  An offsite consequence analysis was completed using a computer model to simulate a release of the ammonia from the refrigeration system.\n\nAssociated Wholesale Grocers has an established Emergency Response Plan to respond to emergencies.  The plan was developed in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120 HAZWOPER Emergency Response Plan.  The plan requires employees to evacuate to designated grouping areas in t"

Emergency agencies will be notified of the emergency and these agencies will notify any potentially affected neighbors as warranted.  Maintenance employees will be available as a resource during an ammonia release emergency. \n\nThis location has not experienced any significant ammonia releases that could have resulted in a catastrophic release in the past 5 years.\n\nThe potential failure of the refrigeration system and safeguards to prevent a catastrophic release of ammonia have been evaluated.  An updated Process Hazard Analysis was completed on the refrigeration system on July 10-11, 2000.  Planned changes to improve safety resulting from this analysis are documented in the Process Hazard Analysis report in the Accidental Chemical Accident Prevention Program.  Also, the guidelines from the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) will be followed where applicable, to manage the refrigeration system."
