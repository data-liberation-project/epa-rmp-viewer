The Company endeavors to execute this policy through the daily implementation of its Safety Programs. Company safety programs include but are not limited to a comprehensive & Process Safety Management Program (PSM), which is an integrated approach to Accidental Release Prevention & the safe operation of processes using Regulated Substances. The PSM Program is specifically designed and intended to prevent accidental releases, and to deal safely with emergencies if and when they do happen. It is the goal of the company to protect its employees, visitors and neighbors from harm due to Company operations.\n\n\n\nA \"Non Responding Facility\" policy has been adopted; however the Company recognizes the need to be prepared to safely deal with emergencies. A Hazardous Material Business Plan consistent with Emergency Action Plan requirements has been developed and includes emergency procedures, requirements, and information necessary to notify public response agencies and technical resources; the Staff communicate to the Fire Department and evacuate (or shelter-in-place) if there is a release situation or fire. Managers and employees would also shepherd visitors (truck drivers receiving product or delivering product). By effectiv"

These personnel are available to support Oxnard Fire/CUPA and the facility in the event of an emergency, and staff are on-call 24/7/365. Written procedures that include ammonia specific emergency pre-planning have been developed within the WPS \"Thirty Minute Plan\". Ammonia-specific emergency equipment is maintained in WPS Refrigerating Technician's service vehicles. The company strives to execute its accidental release prevention & emergency response policies through appropriately skilled employees that are provided with adequate equipment and training.\n\n\n\nA relationship with Oxnard Fire/CUPA has been established. Emergency response pre-planning is coordinated via regular site visits/inspections and submittal of appropriate EPCRA and other compliance reports.

Cutting-edge safety controls are engineered directly into the plant including but not limited to the Ammonia Control, Monitoring, Detection and Alarm System; and new Fire Suppression System including sprinkled building space. The Mountain View Division is 100% owned by Western Precooling Systems. The Mountain View Division manages pre-cooling and refrigerated storage; Western Precooling Systems supervises & maintains the refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nThe facility provides refrigeration effect for the removal of field heat from freshly harvested fruit (pre-cooling strawberries, blueberries, raspberries and blackberries) and then subsequent short-term refrigerated storage prior to shipping. The berries are on site generally from 1-4 days from harvesting depending on market demand. The facility is seasonally operated with product harvest periods picking up in the month of November and finishing in July. The remaining months see little fresh product, however the refrigeration equipment is still operative. Major maintenance is performed in the off-season. Operational maintenance is performed on a year-round basis. Company policy requires appropriately pre-qualified personnel to perform maintenance tasks.\n\n\n\nThe Regulated Substance in use is Anhydrous Ammonia, CAS #7664-41-7, which is used in a single closed-loop mechanical refrigeration system.

Special self-closing valves are now installed as a permissive for oil drain flow. If a release were to develop during the oil-draining task, the mechanic simply releases the handle of the self-closing valve and flow is terminated.
