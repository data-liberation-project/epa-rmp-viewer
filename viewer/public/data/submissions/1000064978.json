The framework to effectively manage and operate highly hazardous operations safely has been incorporated into the elements of the Risk Management program. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Elements that are included within the management system are provided below: \n\n1.    Management System \n\n2.    Process Safety Information \n\n3.    Process Hazard Analysis \n\n4.    Management System to Address Action Items \n\n5.    Process Hazard Analysis Review \n\n6.

Compliance Audits \n\n\n\nA Compliance Guidelines document is available for each of the elements, outlining the key requirements within that aspect of the RMP program. The Compliance Guidelines can be utilized as a tool within the company to assess potential implementation of certain elements. To support the Compliance Guidelines, specific written procedures detailing the method to meet the element requirements have been developed. In addition, the procedures will clearly define responsibilities for element compliance. Implementation of a specific element requires adherence to the corresponding written procedure. \n\nFor any program to be successful, senior leadership is paramount. Leadership alone can make Process Safety a key business goal and provide the necessary resources to achieve both RMP and PSM objectives. Employees within every organization take their cues from administrators, managers and supervisors. If leadership consistently treats Process Safety as a priority, so will the rest of the work-group. At a minimum management commitment to Process Safety must include the following actions: \n\n\n\n1.    Visibly demonstrate leadership commitment to Process Safety \n\n2.    Clearly assign and communicate Process Safety responsibilities to all affected employees \n\n3.    Ensure leadership is aware of relevant Process Safety incidents \n\n4.    Implement system for ensuring Process Safety responsibilities are met \n\n5.    Integrate Process Safety into planning processes \n\n6.    Establish Process Safety goals and metrics for the covered process area(s) \n\n\n\nCape Cod Ice has developed various mechanisms to document, implement, maintain and continually improve the Risk Management and Process Safety Management Systems to reduce process risks associated with critical operations. \n\nThe primary objective of the RMP Program is proper oversight of the use of highly hazardous chemicals within The Cape Cod Ice Company to prevent unwanted releases especially into locations which could expose employees or the public to serious hazards. The RMP Program can also include critical operations identified by the organization through a risk assessment process. \n\nThe framework to effectively manage and operate highly hazardous operations safely is incorporated into all Elements of the RMP program. \n\n\n\n",

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\n1.1 STATIONARY SOURCE DESCRIPTION\n\nThe Cape Cod Ice East Providence facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia refrigeration to manufacture ice that is distributed throughout Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and parts of New Hampshire.  The facility also stores cranberries during the winter months.\n\n \n\nCape Cod Ice's facility is located at 1 Noyes Avenue, East Providence, Rhode Island (East Providence facility). The refrigeration system is located throughout the warehouse building of the East Providence facility with the piping located on the roof.\n\n\n\n1.2 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nCape Cod Ice relies on written procedures and training to minimize accidental releases.  Every employee must complete awareness training and operating and maintenance training for their particular duties and responsibilities prior to working on any assignment. If any processes change, employees are retrained in the new process before working on an assignment.\n\n\n\nContractors are required to be properly trained in the safety programs before doing any work at\n\nthe facility.\n\n\n\nAll employees who operate, service, or maintain the ammonia refrigeration systems are trained to understand the safety and health hazards of the refrigerant and the refrigeration system at the facility. This knowledge is necessary for the protection of the individual, the other employees, and the community. All involved employees are trained in the following general topics:\n\n\n\nUnderstanding how to read SDS forms,\n\nKnowing and understanding first aid for ammonia exposure,\n\nLocation and use of emergency equipment (eyewash, showers, and PPE),\n\nRoutine refrigeration system operation,\n\nEmergency refrigeration system operation,\n\nEmergency and normal refrigeration safety procedures, and\n\nIndividual's role in the emergency response plan.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Policy\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency, Cape Cod Ice personnel are expected to cooperate with fellow employe"

The supervisor is\n\nresponsible for contacting the Primary Emergency Response Coordinator.
