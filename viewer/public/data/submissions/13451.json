      "SummaryText": "General Executive Summary for Manufacturing Facilities\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Follmer Development Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental \nsafety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention \nprogram that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and \nemployee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement \nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass this facilities primary activity is the filling of aerosol \nproducts.  We have 2 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include \nIsobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl] and Propane.  Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl] is used for a \npropellant for aerosol products.  Propane is used for a propellant for aerosol products.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl] that is expected to be present in this \nfacility based on process/operational  requirements 10747.80 lb. while Propane is expected to be \npresent at our facility in a maximum quantity of 7972.20 lb..\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release \nScenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to \nlimit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's \nOCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the \nchosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances as a class \ninvolves a catastrophic release from A70/A55.  In this scenario, 18000 lb. of Flammable \nMixture: Propane, Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl] is released. It is assumed that the entire \nquantity is released as a vapor, which finds an "

Under worst case weather conditions, the \ncalculated distance of 0.21 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.\n\nOne alternative release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances involves a \nrelease from A70/A55.  The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Explosion.  The \nscenario involves the release of 18000 lb. of Flammable Mixture: Propane, Isobutane  [Propane, \n2-methyl] in 10 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the \nflammable endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 0.13 miles.\n\nAnother alternative release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances \ninvolves a release from Warehouse.  The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud \nExplosion.  The scenario involves the release of 720 lb. of Flammable Mixture: Propane, \nIsobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl] in 10 minutes. The release is also controlled by active mitigation \nmeasures that include sprinkler system(s).  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum \ndistance to the flammable endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 0.04 miles.\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-\nSpecific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention \nrequirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and \nconstructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.    The following sections \nbriefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary \nsource.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nFollmer Development Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the \nchemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated w"

The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in \nengineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of five years.  Any \nfindings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent \nPHA/update was performed on 03/18/1999.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Follmer \nDevelopment Inc. maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various \nmodes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency \nshutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The \ninformation is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\n\nFollmer Development Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that \nemployees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated \nwith these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more \nfrequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nFollmer Development Inc. carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process \nequipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes \namong others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, \nemergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by \nqualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these \npersonnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by \nthe maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Follmer Development Inc. to manage changes in process \nchemicals, technology, equipme"
