Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Browns Valley Community Elevator in Browns Valley are strongly committed to employee,\npublic, and environmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive\naccidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating\nprocedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is\nour policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. \nIf such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and\nmitigate the effects of the release.  We also coordinate our response efforts with the Browns Valley\nFire Department, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\nammonia stored in a 12,000-gallon tank at our facility in Browns Valley (Figure 1).  The maximum\namount stored is 10,200 gallons (52,489.2 pounds) at the maximum fill capacity of 85%.\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\nWe utilized RMP PRO for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite\nconsequence analysis for our facility.  The following details these scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the\nanhydrous ammonia storage tank (52,489.2 pounds) in gaseous form over a 10-minute period.  At\nClass F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, and a urban topography, the maximum distance\nto a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L is 3.4 miles (Figure 2).\n\nThe alternativ"

General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention\nrequirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements\nof the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\nBrowns Valley Community Elevator maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes\nthe chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes\n(Appendix E).\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are\nidentified and controlled effectively.  Any findings from the hazard analysis are addressed in a\ntimely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nBrowns Valley Community Elevator maintains written operating procedures to ensure that activities\nwithin our covered processes are conducted safely.  These procedures address various modes of\noperation; the information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in\nthe processes (Appendix B).\n\nTraining\nBrowns Valley Community Elevator has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that\nemployees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with\nthese processes (Appendix C).\n\nMechanical Integrity\nBrowns Valley Community Elevator conducts documented maintenance checks on process\nequipment to ensure proper operation.

Any equipment deficiencies identified by the\nmaintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner (Appendix D).\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Browns Valley Community Elevator to manage changes in\nprocess chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance\npersonnel or other employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions\nare promptly notified of the modification and offered training to deal with it.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nBrowns Valley Community Elevator routinely conducts pre-startup safety reviews related to new\nprocesses and modifications in established processes.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that\nconstruction, equipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior\nto placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nBrowns Valley Community Elevator conducts compliance audits on a regular basis to determine\nwhether the plan's provisions, set out under the 40 CFR part 68, are being implemented.  Any non-\ncompliance issue discovered during the audit is promptly corrected.\n\nEmployee Participation\nBrowns Valley Community Elevator truly believes that process safety management and accident\nprevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views\nconcerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees\nhave access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP,\nparticularly information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\n  5. Five-year Accident History\nBrowns Valley Community Elevator has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases\nover the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, no accidental release has\noccurred during this period."
