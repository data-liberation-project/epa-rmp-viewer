If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to persons and the environment.\n2.Facility Information. \nTrotter Fertilizer is a small independent retail facility whose primary acitivity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for the sale to farmers. \nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.\n3.The worst-case release and alternative release scenarios.\na.The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank over a 10 minute period. The distance to the endpoint would be  4.4 miles\nb.The alternative release scenario based on five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint is .3 miles.\n4.Accidental Release Prevention Program. \nThis facility has implemented the provisions of OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.1200, Hazard Communication.\n5.Five-year Accident History.\nThere have been no reportable accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the last five years.\n6.Emergency Response Program. \nThe \"Emergency Action Plan\" of Trotter Fertilizer describes procedures to minimize hazards to human health and to the environment from sudden releases and non-sudden releases of chemicals. Copies of the well organized easy to use color codes \"plan\" have been distributed to the Local Emergency Planning Committee, Fire Department, and two strategic locations at the facility. Our employees are aware of the provisions of the emergency action plan and each one's role in carring out the plan. An ongoing safety training  and accident prevention programs is our first line of defense.\n7.Planned Cha"
