In addition, the company produces pilot-scale quantities of various catalyst, flame retardant and pharmaceutical products.  Albemarle is committed to the safety of the surrounding community, as well as protection of the environment.  With a strong Process Safety Management program in place, Albemarle combines both passive and active mitigation systems to prevent offsite consequences in the event of a spill of bromine.  In addition, our highly trained Emergency Response team is always available to respond to any incident, and bring it quickly under control.\n\nAlbemarle employs the latest technology in its process controls, and monitoring and mitigation systems. \n\nA thorough Risk Management Program Hazard Analysis was performed, showing the following worst-case scenario: \n\nComplete rupture of the 3,000 gallon bromine storage tank, causing an immediate pooling of bromine in the curbed concrete containment area.  At an evaporation rate of 125 pounds per minute, with a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second, an offsite impact distance of 4.1 miles is seen.  Approximately 1,000 persons live in residential areas within the impact distance, which also includes one or more hospitals, schools and recreation areas.\n\nFurther analysis of the most credible scenarios for releases of bromine gave the following scenario:\n\nIn the bromine storage and transfer area are two large, water-filled, underground sumps, which have sufficient capacity to hold the entire contents of the storage tank.  In the event of a spill or even a tank rupture, the bulk of the spilled bromine would enter the sumps and sink below the water, thereby preventing evaporation and minimizing any offsite impact.  The most credible scenario for such an incident has shown that only 65 pounds of bromine would be relea"

      "SummaryText": "sed offsite, given a wind speed of 3.0 m/s, producing an impact distance of only 0.34 mile, or 1,800 feet.  Approximately 142 persons live in residential areas within the impact distance.  There are no hospitals, schools or recreation areas within the impact distance.\n\nAlbemarle has an excellent bromine accidental release prevention program.  The five year history shows no releases of bromine.\n\nA second toxic, ammonia, is stored on-site in more than a threshold quantity.  Analysis of the most credible scenario for releases of ammonia gave the following scenario:\n\nA release of 100 lb of ammonia gas from the storage vessel over a period of 10 minutes.  Given a wind speed of 3.0 m/s, an impact distance of 0.03 mile, or 160 feet, resulted.  There are no residential areas, hospitals, schools, or recreational areas within this impact distance.\n\nAlbemarle employs various processes which use isopentane as a solvent.  A thorough Risk Management Program Hazard Analysis showed the following worst-case scenario:\n\nA rupture of the isopentane storage tank, releasing 25,800 pounds of material which then ignites to produce a vapor cloud explosion.  Under this scenario, the distance to a 1 psi overpressure is 0.23 mile.  There are no residential areas within this impact distance, nor are there hospitals, schools or recreational areas.\n\nFurther analysis of the most credible scenarios for releases of isopentane gave the following scenario:\n\nA leak from a transfer line during transfer of isopentane from the storage tank, releasing 500 pounds which then ignites in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under this scenario, the distance to a 1 psi overpressure is 0.07 mile, or 370 feet.  There are no residential areas, hospitals, schools or recreational areas within this impact distance."
