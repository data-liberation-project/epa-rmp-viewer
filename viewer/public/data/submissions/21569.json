The Facility Policy\nThe owners, members, and employees of Dorman Brothers, L.L.C. (the facility) are committed to the prevention of accidental release of anydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and other agencies to mitgate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n-This facility was purchased in June, 2000 and the most current safety measures where added at that time. \n-The primary activity at this facility is the storage of fertilizer for sale to farmers.\n-Anyhdrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application.\n-The maximum quantity stored would be 52, 530 pounds of anyhdrous ammonia in one fixed-site storage tank.  The ammonia is delivered in by truck.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternate release scenario:\n-The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank, released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 52,530 pounds, which represents 85% of the capacity of the tank as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint is 4 miles.\n-The alternate release scenario, based on the most likely potential incident, is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to endpoint is .8 miles.\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n-This facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia K-61-1, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the standards of the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration, 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\n5.

The Emergency Response Program\n-The facility has:\n-A written emergency action plan in accordance with 29 CFR 1910-38 (OSHA).\n-Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n-A written emergency response program, in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120 (OSHA) including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n-Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic inspections are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implemntation at this time."
