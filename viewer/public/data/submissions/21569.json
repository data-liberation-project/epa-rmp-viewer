Facility Information\n-This facility was purchased in June, 2000 and the most current safety measures where added at that time. \n-The primary activity at this facility is the storage of fertilizer for sale to farmers.\n-Anyhdrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application.\n-The maximum quantity stored would be 52, 530 pounds of anyhdrous ammonia in one fixed-site storage tank.  The ammonia is delivered in by truck.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternate release scenario:\n-The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank, released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 52,530 pounds, which represents 85% of the capacity of the tank as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint is 4 miles.\n-The alternate release scenario, based on the most likely potential incident, is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to endpoint is .8 miles.\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n-This facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia K-61-1, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the standards of the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration, 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\n5.
