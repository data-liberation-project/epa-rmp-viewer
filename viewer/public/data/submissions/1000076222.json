We have completed this report under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) risk management program (RMP) to communicate our efforts to achieve a safe workplace.  \n\n\n\nThe brewery uses ammonia as a key part of the cooling system that maintains beer at the proper temperature during certain stages of the brewing process.  Ammonia is one of the materials covered under the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management standard (PSM) and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program regulations.  The brewery follows these regulations, as well as others, to ensure that it safely handles, uses, and stores ammonia and other potentially hazardous chemicals safely.  The brewery has had no releases of ammonia that resulted in injuries to people, harm to property, or damage to the environment since it opened in 1970.\n\n\n\nOur global environmental, health, and safety (EHS) policy and requirements promote the overall safety of this brewery, employees, and the public.  This policy includes risk reduction programs that provide assurance for the safe management of process risks to prevent environmental, health and safety incidents and to protect the workplace, the community and the environment. These programs enable the brewery to prevent the occurrence, or minimize the consequences of, significant releases of ammonia.  \n\n \n\nIt is Anheuser-Busch's policy to conduct our business in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations, and permits and to promote a safe workplace and a quality environment.  Each employee is trained and required to comply strictly with this policy.  We do not allow production goals or financial objectives to over-ride safety and environmental concerns.  \n\n \n\nAlso, it is Anheuser-Busch's policy to lea"

      "SummaryText": "d by example so that other companies, including vendors and suppliers, are similarly interested in protecting the health and safety of employees and safeguarding the environment.  We are committed to the spirit as well as the letter of our EHS policy and promote, throughout the organization, responsibility and accountability for strict compliance with that policy.  Anheuser-Busch employees whose actions in the performance of their duties may affect the environment and/or public health are trained sufficiently to permit them to comply strictly with our EHS policy. \n\n\n\nIn conducting our businesses, we continue to seek and implement cost effective methods to reduce the EHS impact of our operations.  We integrate EHS considerations into our business planning and decision-making processes, including product research and development, packaging, and new manufacturing methods.  Our continuous EHS improvement goals include pollution prevention and resource conservation.  We ask our contractors to adopt EHS standards, ethics, and policies similar to our own and we will give preference to suppliers that do so.\n\n \n\nWe encourage our employees, customers, and the public to share with us their EHS concerns.  We continually talk with local authorities in communities in which we operate to share ideas about preventing incidents with materials we use or store.\n\n \n\nAmmonia System\n\n \n\nAmmonia is used in the refrigeration system of the brewery.  As part of the brewing process, the beer is cooled to ensure its consistency, flavor and overall quality.  The beer packaged in kegs is stored in a refrigerated area in our facility until it's shipped.  Because of the characteristics of ammonia, our employees observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human and environmental exposure, both within the brewery and in the surrounding community.\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\n\n\nAs required by the EPA's Risk Management regulations, we have identified an extremely unlikely \"worst-case\""

      "SummaryText": " scenario in which an ammonia to glycol shell and tube heat exchanger located outside of process buildings fails and releases 100% of its capacity of 1969.6 gallons (10,675 pounds) of anhydrous ammonia(5.42 lbs/gal @ 32 psig, 18.6 deg F). Under worst-case weather conditions and with no mitigating actions, ammonia could travel 1.8 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a threat to the public.\n\n\n\nThis scenario is unlikely to occur at the Merrimack brewery for a number of reasons:\n\n?    Brewery piping and vessels that contain ammonia meet or exceed industry manufacturing and quality control standards;\n\n?    Ammonia is not corrosive in the form in which it is used at the brewery;\n\n?    Pressure relief safety valves limit operating pressures so the chance of a large-scale release is minimal;\n\n?    Manual safety valves allow the immediate shut-off of the ammonia system;\n\n?    Equipment is inspected and kept in proper working order and replaced when necessary;\n\n?    The brewery has an emergency response plan and equipment in place (see description below).\n\n \n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\n\n\nWe have also identified an \"alternative release\" scenario involving the release of 2,840 pounds of anhydrous ammonia due to the opening of a pressure safety relief valve, which itself is a system safety device designed to relieve pressure to avoid a more serious release. This release scenario is based upon historical release data for Anheuser-Busch breweries. Under common weather conditions, this amount of ammonia could travel 0.30 miles and remain mostly on brewery property before dispersing enough to no longer pose a threat to the public.    \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\n \n\nAnheuser-Busch has years of experience operating ammonia-based refrigeration systems at its breweries.  This experience has helped bring about designs and operating plans that produce a safe system.  No ammonia releases from any of the company's breweries have ever resulted in consequences off brewery property"

Standard operating procedures that all operators of the refrigeration system must follow;\n\n?    Formal operator training;\n\n?    Preventative maintenance to ensure that the entire refrigeration system is mechanically sound;\n\n?

A work permit system that ensures all welding work is conducted safely;\n\n?    Process safety information; and \n\n?    Emergency planning and response.\n\n \n\nThe brewery additionally complies with the requirements of the OSHA PSM standard (40 CFR 1910.119), the EPA RMP rules (40 CFR 68), and applicable Recognized and Generally Accepted Refrigeration System Practices for Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigerating Systems.\n\n \n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n  \n\nThe brewery has had no releases that have caused onsite or offsite injuries, or damage to property or the environment.  In fact, the brewery has never had releases with these impacts since it began operation in 1970.\n\n \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n \n\nThe Merrimack brewery has in place a variety of emergency response procedures in the event of an incident involving ammonia.  The emergency response program is based on OSHA's requirements for emergency action plans (29 CFR 1910.38) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120).  We have trained employees for emergency response and maintain a plan titled ES Incident Plan (HAZWOPER Plan) which has been supplied to,"

We conduct annual drills with local agencies to help us remain prepared to implement the ES Incident Plan (HAZWOPER Plan) at the brewery. \n\n \n\nBrewery personnel notify local agencies when emergency response is needed.  Local agencies determine if the public needs to be notified.  If it is determined that the public needs to be notified, the local agencies perform the notification task.\n\n \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n \n\nAnheuser-Busch's Merrimack brewery ammonia refrigeration system is periodically modified to improve safety.  In 2018/2019 a continuous ammonia monitoring/detection system was installed in the machine room (Powerhouse). Upon detection of a high ammonia concentration, the system will alarm and automatically shut down all boilers, ammonia compressors, and other electrical equipment in addition to activating the exhaust ventilation fans in the machine room.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nAnheuser-Busch is pleased to share its record of safe operations with the citizens of Merrimack.  We believe the Risk Management Plan under which we are providing this information is an important tool for encouraging communications with our neighbors.  Although we are confident the \"worst case\" and \"alternative\" scenarios presented in this report are highly unlikely, we want you ,our neighbors, to know we are prepared to respond quickly and effectively should one ever occur.  Anheuser-Busch has worked hard over the years to ensure the highest standard of safety.  Our goal is to continue the excellent and safe track record."
