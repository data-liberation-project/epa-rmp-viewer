Therefore, creating a safe work environment is extremely important. The corporate core values championed by our President, embraced by our Senior Leadership Team, encouraged by our Managers/Supervisors and pledged to our associates are: a) Caring Relationships, b) Entrepreneurial Spirit, c) Strategic Foresight, and d) High Performance. These 4 core values support our Safety and Health philosophy and management efforts. Interpersonal communications, problem solving, planning, and safety achievement have a direct relationship with the core values when applied to safety training, hazard assessment/investigation, post accident/incident recovery and generating solutions to potential risk exposures. U.S. Venture integrates Safety expectations as a part of Manager/Supervisors' responsibilities in order to create a meaningful daily presence during all work activity. Providing a safe work environment, reinforcing safe behaviors, and achieving meaningful safety results is a shared responsibility. Safety improvements, communication and recommendations from associates are critical to the productivity and success of U.S. Venture.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Venture, Inc. - U.S. Oil Madison South Terminal (facility) is a bulk petroleum terminal that stores and distributes millions of gallons of refined petroleum products, including gasoline, diesel oil, denatured ethanol, biodiesel and fuel additives annually.  Recently, three 30 thousand-gallon butane storage vessels, butane blending equipment, and a rail butane delivering system was installed so that butane could be blended into gasoline.  The quantity of butane that is stored onsite exceeds the 10,000 pound threshold quantity, thus subjecting the facility to RMP requirements. \r\n\r\nThe facility complies with the National Fire Protection Association (NFP"

If a fire emergency were to occur, it is the facility's policy to notify the McFarland Fire Department by calling 911, (distance to closest fire station from terminal is 1.5 miles by road) which may trigger involvement by Dane County Emergency Management, Wisconsin Emergency Management and/or City of Madison Hazardous Materials Team, as necessary.  Each of these Emergency Respnse Departments have and will continue to participate in informative tours at the facility that include an overview of the regulated process, the hazards of butane, and the safety systems that are in place. All facility personnel are 40-hour HAZWOPER certified and receive annual refresher hazardous materials training.\r\n\r\nDane County Emergency Management, in the event of a butane related emergency, will activate their Emergency Telephone Notification System. An authorized operator with the County can identify the affected neighborhood or region of the County and record a message that describes the situation and recommends the protective actions residents should take. The Emergency Telephone Notification system will automatically call out to all phone numbers in the County's database within the geographic area and deliver the recorded message.  If phone lines are busy, the system will attempt to redial those numbers a predetermined number of times to make contact.  If an answering machine picks up the call, the emergency message will be left on the machine.\r\n\r\nThe Risk Management Program (RMP) covers the butane blending system, including the associated piping, three storage vessels and butane rail cars.
