KHLP?s management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.\n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the facility and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Medford Fractionator is one of many facilities operated by KHLP.  Natural gas liquids (demethanized raw feed) are received at the site from natural gas facilities as feedstock totaling 180,000 barrels per day (bpd).  The liquid feed to the facility is split into five product streams in a series of fractionator columns:  E-P Mix, Propane, Isobutane, Normal Butane, and Natural Gasoline.  These five product streams are further purified to remove contaminants such as water, carbon dioxide, and to convert mercaptans to disulfides.  The purity products are stored and distributed to various customers via pipeline.  The facility is also equipped with three truck loading docks which allow purity products to be loaded or unloaded.\n\nMethane, Ethane, Propane, Butane, Isobutane, Pentane, and Ethyl Mercaptan are the RMP flammable substances stored or processed at the facility.  There are no toxic substances present at the plant in amounts greater than "

The facility is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by KHLP.  These high standards include:\n\n?Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations. \n?Operating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\n?Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\n?Correcting non-compliance found by regular audits of the facility.\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Medford Fractionator is operating under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.    Part of the RMP/PSM Prevention Program involves identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n?Providing overpressure relief valves on all pressurized vessels.  Additionally, level transmitters and alarms are present on all vessels in order to prevent overfilling.\n?Providing a Raw Feed Diversion to reduce potential incidents.\nPreventive maintenance and testing of vessels through the Mechanical Integrity program helps to ensure that structural failures do not occur in process equipment.\n?Minimizing the possibility of an interruption in the combustion of hydrocarbon vapors by having a continuous flare. \n?Providing containment berms around all aboveground storage tanks.\n?Installing hydrocarbon gas detectors throughout the facility.\n?Minimizing the possibility of fire by providing a fire water system throughout the facility.\n?Minimizing the possibility of emergencies by manning the facility continuously.\n?Providing an evacuation alarm system in order t"

      "SummaryText": "o safely evacuate the facility during emergency situations. \n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe Medford Fractionator has had one incident occur during the last five years that is reportable in the five-year accident history maintained under the RMP regulations.  In September 2002, a flash fire occurred during maintenance activities being conducted on a process vessel.  Four contractors were injured.  One later died due to complications from those injuries.  The facility and contractor representatives conducted an investigation and root cause analysis and implemented revised procedures to prevent future incidents.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe facility will continue to conduct emergency response preparedness activities and coordinate any emergency response actions necessary for the Medford Fractionator with the Pond Creek and the Medford Volunteer Fire Departments.  Also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the Grant County Sheriff and St. Mary?s Hospital in Enid.  The Medford Fractionator Facility Manager is responsible for coordinating the emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials.  The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program, coupled with the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.  Some of the key components of the safety program are:\n\n?The Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures are considered.\n?The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards.\n?Th"

The facility coordinates its response capabilities and personnel with those of the county on an ongoing basis."
