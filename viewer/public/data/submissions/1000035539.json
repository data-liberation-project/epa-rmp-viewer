Greenwood Resources / Boardman Tree Farm management is extremely cautious in the handling of all chemicals and is very diligent about safety for its employees and surrounding occupancies.\n\n\n\nGreenwood Resources / Boardman Tree Farm policy is to conduct all operations in a safe and conscientious manner to prevent accidental releases of any hazardous material, including substances regulated through the Federal RMP Program, i.e., chlorine.  Greenwood Resources / Boardman Tree Farm trains its employees to properly handle and store hazardous materials, to minimize the possibility of adversely affecting its worker's health, the workplace, the public, and the environment.  The Greenwood Resources / Boardman Tree Farm Accidental Release Prevention policy is implemented through the management system contained in its RMP.\n\n\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\n\n\nThis report addresses the Chlorination Systems located at the Boardman Tree Farm that are used for disinfecting water used in the irrigation system.  Chlorine is delivered to each site in one ton containers.  The number of containers at each site varies.  \n\n\n\nSystem piping diagrams are provided in Appendix A.  Chlorine, in its gaseous form, is transferred from the one ton containers to the injectors entirely under vacuum.  The motive power for this transfer is provided by the venturi effect of the injectors.  Water flow through the injectors creates a pressure drop in the chlorine line attached to the venturi.  The vacuum regulator, attached to the chlorine container would allow chlorine flow only when downstream pressure is in vacuum.  \n\n\n\nSystem flow rate is controlled by the chlorinator, which is set by the Chlorination System Operators.  In case of loss of vacuum (e.g., a break in piping integrity) a diaphragm in the vacuum regul"

This is an important safety feature, which minimizes the likelihood of a release.  \n\n\n\nChlorination Systems operate at their set flow rate continuously and under normal conditions there is little need for operator intervention.  Operators, however, check the system periodically and provide the needed tests, inspections and maintenance activities.  All elements of the systems are subjected to a periodic inspection, testing, and preventive maintenance program.  \n\n\n\nChlorination is needed only eight months in a typical year.  The chlorine containers are removed from the sites when chlorination is not needed.  Fresh containers are brought in at the beginning of chlorination season. \n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nGreenwood Resources / Boardman Tree Farm has an RMP program in place to manage the handling of chlorine.  The program includes strict requirements for written operating procedures, personnel training, equipment maintenance, incident investigation, process hazard analysis, management of change and periodic review or audit of program elements.
