      "SummaryText": "NTTC Corry Station is located in Escambia County, Florida. The base is situated 5 miles west of downtown Pensacola and can be accessed from New Warrington Road, which is a major north-south roadway. The southern boundary of NTTC Corry Station is defined by U.S. Highway 98 and by Navy Boulevard. NTTC Corry Station covers approximately 430 acres and shares the base with the Naval Hospital, Family Housing, and the Navy Shopping Mall.\n\nNAS Pensacola is the host activity at Corry Station. It was established in 1961 following the decommissioning of Corry Station as an auxiliary air field in 1958. The command was redesignated as the Naval Technical Training Center in 1973. Electronic warfare training and the Naval School of Photography were added to the command's assigned mission.\n\nNTTC-Corry is deeply committed to chemical safety. This commitment is exemplified by a full time safety staff, regular inspections of all facilities within the station, and strict adherence to applicable federal, state, and local laws regarding the storage, handling and use of chemicals. In addition, all activities at Corry are required to abide by stringent regulations (NAVOSH) adopted and enforced by the Navy.\n\nPer Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act, NTTC-Corry Station is submitting this Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the chlorination process at the Water Treatment Plant (WTP). The maximum intended inventory of chlorine stored at the plant is 4,000 pounds. The plant supplies water to the station as well as a small portion of the surrounding community. Chlorine is used to disinfect the water supply.\n\nAs mandated by EPA, the worst-case release scenario (WRS) involves the catastrophic failure of one of the chlorine containers at the WTP. The resultant gas cloud is predicted to have offsite impacts. A catastrophic failure of a container is extremely unlikely due to the rigid DOT-mandated construction specifications of the container, and the Chlorine Institute requirements covering the refilling a"

Further, the Emergency Action Plan (EAP) in place at the station provides protection from an external event which could lead to a catastrophic failure (i.e. fire). \n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) involves the release of a much smaller quantity of chlorine through a failure of the container valve. No public receptors were identified within the offsite vulnerable zone of the alternative release.\n\nThere have been no reportable accidents within the past five years at the plant.\n\nThe process is subject to OSHA Process Safety Management Standard (29 CFR 1910.119), which mandates a specific and detailed program to ensure the safe handling of hazardous substances. All operators are trained in the safe handling of chlorine, chemical safety is discussed at weekly safety meetings, the process equipment is inspected on a daily basis, and a preventative maintenance program is in place. The system is equipped with alarms to monitor for leaks and alert plant personnel to take corrective action. The system is also equipped with vacuum regulators, which would stop the supply of chemical at the container, thereby limiting the chemical release to a very small amount.\n\nNTTC-Corry has an EPA-approved Facility Response Plan (FRP) which contains a section addressing emergencies associated with the WTP. The plant EAP outlines procedures for the mitigation of minor leaks, and details a notification process for emergency responders and the public. Fire department personnel are trained in responding to chemical emergencies and have the specialized equipment to repair a leaking container. The station has mutual aid agreements with the surrounding community emergency departments and is included in the Community Emergency Response Plan (CERP), which is coordinated through the Escambia County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\nNTTC-Corry Station is in the process of instituting several enhancements"
