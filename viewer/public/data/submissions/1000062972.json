(ORM)\r\nSTATELINE COMPLEX\r\n\r\n1.0\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nThe Stateline Complex (Facility/Plant) has a commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, gas plant trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. ONEOK Rockies Midstream (ORM) believes in maintaining a safe working environment for all employees. Our equipment and personnel reflect this belief, and our prime objective is to ensure the personal safety of every employee on the job-site and to safe guard company property through preventative measures. Employees of ORM are expected to be familiar with all company safety policies. Through continuing education, in-house training and management support, we will provide a safe and professional working environment for our employees as well as those whose lives and safety have been entrusted to us.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.0\tDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Stateline Complex, located near Williston, North Dakota, uses mechanical refrigeration, cryogenic extraction and fractionation to process wellhead gas into marketable natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL). As a result of this operation, several EPA regulated flammable substances are processed, recovered, and stored at the facility (e.g., methane, ethane, propane, butane, pentane, gas condensate).  There are two 60,200 gal (198,151 lbs), eight 45,000 gal (178,165 lbs), eight 30,100 gal (141,964 lbs), and ten 19,100 gal (68,854 lbs) flammable mixture storage tanks. The Stateline Complex does not use or store any regulated toxic substances above the EPA set threshold levels.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.0\tO"

Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for administrative controls, or active or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS. The maximum distance to the L-psi endpoint for this WCS was determined by RMP*Comp at 0.50 miles. One (1) public and zero environmental receptors were identified within the 0.50 mile radius. That one public receptor is a commercial business. The most likely alternate release scenario (ARS) for a flammable substance includes transfer hose failures, valve/flange failures, vessel overfilling, and seal leaks. The ARS assumed a 15,000 pound release of propane liquid/vapor over a period of 10 minutes, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion (VCE). The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this event was determined by RMP*Comp at 0.30 mile. One (1) public and zero environmental receptors were identified within the 0.30 mile radius.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.0\tGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nStateline Complex is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program regulation and also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.0\tCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe processes at the Stateline Complex have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\r\n\r\nUniversal Prevention Activities\r\n\r\nThe accidental release prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-covered"

Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\r\n\r\nSpecialized Safety Features\r\n\r\nThe Stateline Complex has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\r\n\u00bf\tRelease Detection, \r\n\u00bf\tDaily Operator Inspection, \r\n\u00bf\tMonthly Valve, Seal, and Flange Inspections, \r\n\u00bf\tRelease Containment/Control, \r\n\u00bf\tProcess Relief Valves that prevent vessel over pressurization, \r\n\u00bf\tValves to Permit Isolation of the Process (manual or automated), \r\n\u00bf\tAutomated Shutdown Systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature), \r\n\u00bf\tCurbing or Diking to contain liquid releases, \r\n\u00bf\tRedundant Equipment and Instrumentation (e.g., emergency power supply, backup pumps, etc.), \r\n\u00bf\tRelease Mitigation,  and \r\n\u00bf\tPersonal protective equipment (e.g., hard hat, safety glasses, protective clothing, FR clothing, etc.).\r\n\r\n\r\n6.0\tFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe Stateline Complex experienced no reportable accidents in the last five (5) years. Releases that did occur, at the facility involving a regulated substance were quickly contained and resulted in no deaths, injuries, significant property damage, evacuations, or shelter in place. \r\n\r\n\r\n7.0\tEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\n\r\nThe Stateline Complex maintains a written emergency response plan (ERP), which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The plan consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address or reference all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and account"

In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties, and participate in annual plant emergency drills to ensure emergency shutdown system (ESD) integrity and reinforce proper employee response. The ERP is updated when necessary based on modifications made to gas plant process or other ONEOK Rockies Midstream facilities. The ERP program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes. The overall emergency response plan for the Stateline Complex is coordinated with the Williams County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) which is responsible for preparing the community's emergency response plan. The local responders for plant emergencies are the Williston, ND Fire Department and the Williams County sheriff's department. The Stateline Complex has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department, sheriff's office). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\r\n \r\n\r\n8.0\tPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe Stateline Complex will resolve all findings from PHAs.  Safety training will be continued for all employees."
