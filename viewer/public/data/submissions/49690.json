The facility changed ownership on 12/31/2004 to Arr Maz Custom Chemicals.  The submittal contains updated information on the maximum amount of Oleum retained on-site.  We no longer retain Ethylenediamine (99% solution) on site.\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nArr Maz Custom Chemicals is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment continues to be demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  \n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass High Technology Chemical Manufacturing.  We have 5 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Oleum (Fuming Sulfuric acid), Methyl chloroformate, Formaldehyde,  Ammonia, and Ethyl Chloride.  These regulated substances at our facility are involved in several uses.  Oleum (65% solution) and Formaldehyde (37% solution) are used to manufacture a water based additive.  Methyl chloroformate (97% solution) is used for manufacturing Herbicides.  Ammonia (29% solution) is used both for Herbicide and Dye & Pigment manufacturing.  Ethyl Chloride (30% solution) is a recycle stream generated by one of the Herbicide processes.\n\nThe maximum expected inventory for each chemical contained on-site is listed as part of the data package.\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario("

For alternative release scenario analysis, we have also used the RMP Pro-98 Program incorproating the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario and alternate release senario(s) for each toxic substance are part of the data package. \n\nOne alternative release scenario has been submitted for each toxic substance present in Program 2 and Program 3 processes cumulatively.\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nArr Maz Custom Chemicals maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses are the \"HAZOP\" and the \"What If/Check List\".  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering "

Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  \n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purpose of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Arr Maz Custom Chemicals maintains written operating procedures.
