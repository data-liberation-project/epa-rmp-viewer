FACILITY INFORMATION:  The facility is a country grain elevator which buys, stores and sells grain and provides inputs (fertilizer, seed, etc.) to local farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient. It is stored in two steel storage tanks, one 26,000 gallons and one 12,000 gallons, plus numerous nurse tanks of various sizes.  The maximum quantity stored on site would be about 440,000 pounds.\n\n3. WORST CASE AND ALTERNATE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS:  The worse case and alternate case release scenarios are not listed in the executive summary for security reasons. \n\n4. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:  The facility has been reviewed for general compliance with applicable standards for storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia. Those standards include: the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc.
