The updated schedule and a list of situations that require an updated RMP are provided at 40 CFR 68.190.  These generally include added amounts of a currently or newly regulated substance, changes to the process that require a revised process hazard analysis or hazard review, or changes to the process that require a revised offsite consequence analysis.  \r\n\r\nIf the facility is no longer subject to the RMP program, the facility submits a de-registration request to EPA within six months of the change.  In addition, corrections are required whenever there is a change in the five-year accident history (within six months of the accident) and when emergency contact information is changed (within one month of the changes becoming effective).\r\n\r\n3.3 Recordkeeping\r\n\r\nRecords supporting the implementation of the elements found in this RMP are maintained for at least five years unless a longer period is specified for PSM standard records.\r\n\r\nAn EPA inspection of the facility may occur at any time.

If the alarm conditions continue to exist after an hour, the autodialer again starts calling operators.  All alarms and the autodialer are on batteries, uninterruptible power supplies and a backup electrical generator.\r\n\r\n1.4 Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nEPA has determined that the TMWTP is subject to the RMP Level 3 Prevention Program.  This prevention program is specifically intended for facilities with the NAICS codes listed at 40 CFR 68.10(d)(1), or those processes subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard found at 29 CFR 1910.119.  The NAICS for water supply and irrigation systems is not listed.  The staff at TMWTP comprises municipal government employees, who are not subject to OHSA rules.  However, the potentially large amount of chlorine on site makes the Level 3/PSM standard an appropriate prevention program for TMWTP.\r\n\r\nThe safe handling of chlorine is accomplished by maintaining the system under negative atmospheric pressure and by allowing only well trained operators to work with the chlorine handling system.  Cylinders with exceptionally difficult or tight valves are rejected and returned to the supplier.  Regular maintenance is performed on all chlorination equipment (CPRVs, lines, and feeders) and safety equipment (i.e., self-contained breathing apparatus) in accordance with computer-generated work orders.\r\n\r\nSelf-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) and air tanks are kept in a separate adjacent room along with emergency oxygen.  These items are wall-mounted with quick release brackets.\r\n\r\nOperators are trained in proper leak detection and correction.  It is standard operating procedure to have two operators present for tank changes, repairs, and any work on the CPRVs.  A third operator is notified of any leaks and told to notify emergency responders if communication is lost for more than 20 minut"

As determined by the RMP program, during this period, there have been no recordable accidental releases of chlorine that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site or any know offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.  Safety practices and operating procedures in place at TMWTP have produced this enviable safety record.\r\n\r\n1.6 Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nTMWTP uses the procedures in the Site Emergency Action Plan Ten Mile Water Treatment Plant (EAP) for general emergency responses.  The plan addresses many different emergency situations and includes procedures for general hazardous materials incidents.  The manual was written specifically for the plant in 1994, is reviewed annually, and is updated as required to reflect any pertinent changes that would require a modified emergency response.  The most recent revisions were made in 2005.  \r\n\r\nTo ensure proper functioning, emergency response equipment is inspected and serviced as necessary.  \r\n\r\n1.7 Planned Changes to Improve Chlorine Handling Safety\r\n\r\nTMWTP maintains an ongoing safety program to minimize accidental releases of chlorine. This program includes employee training, preventive maintenance, lockout/tagout procedures, vessel entry procedures, respirator training, and safe handling/operational procedures for the chlorine handling system.

The extremely hazardous substances subject to regulation by the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions and the preparation of an RMP are listed with their threshold quantities in Tables 1 through 4 in 40 CFR 68.130.  These substances are divided into toxic substances and flammable substances.  \r\n\r\nA careful review of the regulated substances on site at TMWTP found that chlorine is the only listed hazardous substance with the potential to be present in an amount exceeding the threshold quantity (2,500 pounds for chlorine).  The maximum potential chlorine inventory is approximately 16,000 pounds.  The single largest vessel is a one-ton pressurized cylinder.  There are no flammable substances present at TMWTP in excess of the threshold quantities.\r\n\r\nOnce it has been determined that the stationary source must prepare an RMP for the substance that is regulated, the next step is to determine the appropriate prevention program level for the process in which that substance is found.  Three prevention program levels are specified in the rule.\r\n\r\nProgram Level 1:  Processes with no accidents with specific offsite consequences within the past five years, with no public receptors within the distance to the endpoint from a worst-case release, and where emergency response procedures have been coordinated between the source and the local emergency planning and response organizations are eligible for Level 1.  This level imposes minimal reporting and safety requirements \r\n\r\nProgram Level 2:  Processes that are not eligible for either Program Level 1 or Program Level 3 are subject to Program Level 2, which is a streamlined prevention program."

The total annual gallonage from all sources for 2012 was 2.2 billion gallons with a peak day of 14.5 million gallons.  One source of this water supply is the Ten Mile Water Treatment Plant (TMWTP) west of Helena at 1115 Rimini Road.  TMWTP is in operation year-round.  Other water treatment facilities operate only during the summer months for peak demands and include the Missouri River Water Treatment Plant (MRWTP) and the Eureka well and pump station.  TMWTP is maintained, evaluated and upgraded to stay abreast of advancements in technology, health science and governmental regulations.\r\n\r\nThe Helena water distribution system consists of seven finished water storage reservoirs (Malben, Winne, Hale, Upper Hale, Woolston, Knob Hill and West Side Tank) and five pumping stations (Forest Estates, Hale, Eureka, Dahlhausen, Reeders Village, and Knob Hill) linked together with 185 miles of water transmission and distribution pipelines.  The Chessman (530 MG) and the Scott (195 MG) reservoirs in the Ten Mile Watershed also provide additional water for TMWTP during low flows.  These reservoirs are filled with spring run-off water.\r\n\r\nIn 2005 and 2006, a security improvement project was completed, with fencing, alarm, and access entry systems. In 2013 additional security such as cameras, motions sensors, and entry alarms were added to provide better protection to the water supply and treatment infrastructure. Negotiation and renewal of a 40-year contract with the US Bureau of Reclamation for purchase of Missouri River water from the Canyon Ferry Reservoir was finalized assuring an adequate supply of raw water thro"

Also, the City completed a comprehensive Water Facilities Plan Update that defines needed improvements and capital expenditures for the next several years. \r\n\r\nIn 2007, the City completed a major upgrade to the Missouri River Treatment Plant to improve reliability, maintain regulatory compliance and meet future growth needs. As part of that upgrade, MRWTP was converted to use bleach as the disinfecting agent in place of chlorine.  As a result, MRWTP was delisted from the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions and the Risk Management program in May of 2008.  \r\n\r\n1.2 Facility and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nTMWTP is a local government owned and operated facility for the production of potable water for the City of Helena.  The only regulated substance present in reportable quantities under the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions found at Title 40 Part 68 of the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR 68) is chlorine.  Two to six one ton cylinders of chlorine are stored at this facility in one-ton cylinders for a total of 12,000 pounds.  The cylinders contain liquid chlorine under pressure.  No more than two one-ton cylinders are on line at any one time.  One cylinder is in actual use and the other is in standby mode.  \r\n\r\n1.3 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe on-line tanks have tank-mounted isolated regulators called Chlorine Pressure Reducing Valves (CPRVs) that reduce the chlorine pressure to a vacuum state. Chlorine feed lines supply chlorine below atmospheric pressure.  Should a leak develop, the feeders would be unable to supply enough vacuum to continue the release of chlorine and the feed would stop at the CPRV attached to the tank.  No flammable substances or other restricted items are stored in the chlorine tank room.  The room has a chlorine detector connected to an alarm panel, annunciator horn, computer, and autodialer.  All unacknowledged alarms initiate the autod"

As shown in Table 2, it was assumed that one ton of liquid chlorine escaped from the damaged cylinder in 10 minutes under conditions of low wind speed (1.5 m/s) and stable atmospheric conditions (Class F). This scenario considered that there were no prevention or mitigation techniques, responses or control devices applied to the release or that they failed.  \r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario assumed that a valve failure or a leak developed while a one-ton tank was being worked on.  This scenario could be a CPRV failure, CPRV-to-tank connection leak, or a tank valve leak. At this point in the process, the chlorine is no longer a liquid, but is in gaseous form.  Some level of mitigation would be likely in such an instance.  It is assumed that the operator would adjust valves to stop the leak or at least control 10 percent of the leak immediately, continuing to reduce the flow to a manageable level allowing for repairs.  This leak was assumed to release gaseous chlorine from either the chlorine storage room or the chlorinator room. Based on the assumptions shown above, RMP*Comp calculated a release rate of 4.44 lbs/minute and an estimated total release of 66.6 pounds.  This scenario is much more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario.  However, due to the safety engineering and administrative controls in place at TMWTP, it is still very unlikely.  \r\n\r\nTable 2.\tOffsite Consequence Analyses Parameters\r\n\r\nParameter\r\nWorst-case Scenario\r\nAlternate Scenario\r\nSubstance/End Point\r\nLiquid chlorine/0.0087 mg/L\r\nGaseous chlorine/0.0087 mg/L\r\nLargest Vessel\r\nOne-ton cylinder\r\nOne-ton cylinder\r\nWind Speed/Stability\r\n1.5 meters/sec; stability class F\r\n3meters/sec; stability class D\r\nAmbient Temperature/Humidity\r\n77\u00b0F; 50 percent humidity \r\n77\u00b0F; 50 percent humidity\r\nHeigh"

Offsite impacts to population and to the environment are included.  \r\n\r\nThe offsite consequence analysis must be reviewed and updated at least once every five years and more frequently if changes at the stationary source are expected to alter the distance to the endpoint.  Such update must be completed and the revised RMP submitted within six months of the change.\r\n\r\nThe five-year accident history is also part of the hazard assessment.\r\n\r\n4.1 Offsite Consequence Analysis\r\n\r\n4.1.1 Endpoints\r\n\r\nAs provided in Appendix A to 40 CFR 68, the endpoint for chlorine is 0.0087 milligrams per liter (mg/L), which is based on the Emergency Response Planning Guideline level 2 (ERPG-2) from the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA).  The ERPG values are intended to provide estimates of concentration ranges above which one could reasonably anticipate observing some adverse effects as described as a consequence of exposure to a specific substance.  ERPG-2 is defined as the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms that could impair their abilities to take protective action.  Both the worst-case scenario and the alternate scenario involve the release of pure chlorine. There are no regulated flammable substances on-site in threshold planning quantities.  \r\n\r\nRMP*Comp, the software provided by EPA was used to conduct the offsite consequence analyses.  The parameters shown in Table 2 were input to RMP*Comp to conduct the analyses.
