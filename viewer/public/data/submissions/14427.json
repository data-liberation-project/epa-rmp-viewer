The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of WOODSBORO FARMERS COOP are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n7 The primary activity at the facility is the storage of liquid fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n7 Anhydrous ammonia is ship to this location by another company and converted to liquid fertilizer by a third company. \n7 This facility does not have any permant anhydrous storage facilities.  The anhydrous ammonia is held in a rail car on the rail siding to make liquid fertilizer, the rail car holds 170,000 pounds.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\na. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be  170,000  pounds, which represents the volume of the largest rail car tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.75 miles.\nb. The alternative release scenario based on the  most likely potential incident  is a release from a break in a liquid valve.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .83 miles.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program\n\nThe accidental release prevention program for the facility is to contact local emergency personnel and the shipper of the product.  Federal DOT regulations prevents the facility from making repairs to this rail car.\n\n5. The Five-year Accident History \n\na. There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia i"
