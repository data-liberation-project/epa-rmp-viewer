In addition, there have been no incidents at the facility in the last five years that resulted in a release of more than the Federal Reportable Quantity (100 pounds).\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nPictsweet has developed an Emergency Response Plan (ERP) for the purpose of protecting employees and the surrounding community.  The ERP covers procedures for: 1) evacuating and accounting for visitors and employees, 2) the onsite Emergency Response Team responding to an ammonia release and other foreseeable emergencies that could occur onsite, 3) notifying external agencies and additional emergency response personnel, and 4) administering first aid measures for ammonia exposure.  Members on the team are trained on their responsibilities. Employees are informed of the elements of the ERP.  In the event of an ammonia release, employees will evacuate or shelter-in-place, depending on the nature of the release. If additional assistance is needed, the facility will contact the refrigeration contractor (C.I.M. Electric, 805-928-8605) and the fire department (Santa Barbara County Fire Department, 805-934-6292, and City of Santa Maria Fire Department, 805-925-0951).\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nProcess Hazard Analyses and Compliance Audits have been performed on the ammonia refrigeration system, and these studies have resulted in action items to improve safety at the facility.  The recommendations mainly consist of formalizing procedures, implementing practices consistent with industry standards, and performing inspections and tests to maintain the integrity of the equipment.  Pictsweet has implemented several of these action items and is moving forward with completing the remaining outstanding recommendations. In addition, the facility plans to continue providing employees with a safe wo"

At the condensers, the vapor is condensed back into liquid, which then drains to the receivers to be re-used in the refrigeration cycle.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nPictsweet has developed an accidental release prevention program for compliance with the OSHA's PSM, EPA's RMP, and the OES CalARP regulations.  The program includes, but is not limited to, the following elements:\n\n1.\tSafety information regarding the chemical hazards, and operating and technical specifications for the equipment;\n2.\tWritten procedures for operating and maintaining the processes;\n3.\tTraining for personnel involved with system operations and maintenance;\n4.\tWritten procedures for managing system changes and startup of a modified process;\n5.\tInvestigating releases and near misses and implementing measures to prevent recurrence; \n6.\tAudit procedures for ensuring that the programs are being implemented in accordance to the regulations;\n7.\tWritten procedures for conducting hot work on or near the regulated processes;\n8.\tContractor management policies to ensure contract employee safety while on facility premises; and\n9.\tEmployee involvement in program development and implementation.\n\nIn addition, engineering controls have been implemented to reduce the chance of an accidental release to the environment.  These are comprised of equipment monitoring systems and safety cutouts to shut off the equipment when operating parameters exceed safe operating limits.  Relief valves on pressurized ammonia vessels prevent equipment rupture in the event of over-pressurization.  Regular inspections and tests are performed to ensure these controls are in good working order.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nA review of the facility's five year accident history showed that there have been no incidents at the facility that meet the RMP criteria for a re"

This commitment is reflected in the safety and environmental programs that are implemented at the facility.  For example, written procedures have been created for operating the ammonia refrigeration system.  Only trained operators are permitted to perform system operations.  Pictsweet has also developed a robust maintenance program to ensure the equipment is in good operating condition.  All of these programs are geared towards the prevention of an accidental release at the facility.  In addition, these programs incorporate emergency procedures to mitigate the effects of a release if it does occur.  At such an event, emergency coordinators will assess the situation and notify outside responding agencies as necessary.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nPictsweet is located at 732 S. Hanson Way in Santa Maria, California.  Ammonia is used in the facility's refrigeration system to provide cooling for the storage of vegetables.  The system uses a maximum of 80,000 pounds of ammonia.  A description of how the process operates is presented below:  \n\nLiquid ammonia in the high pressure receivers is fed to the intercoolers, the surge drums associated with the water chillers, and the flash cooler. They also provide liquid to the compressors for oil cooling.  The intercoolers and flash cooler provide liquid to the recirculators.  Pumps at the recirculators provide liquid to the freezer evaporators, plate freezers, IQF tunnels, and spiral freezers. At the evaporators/tunnels/freezers, air is drawn over the coils by the fans.  The ammonia flowing inside the coils is partially vaporized as it absorbs heat from the surrounding air.  The partially vaporized ammonia is returned to the associated recirculator, where the liquid settles"
