      "SummaryText": "The Sheldon United Terminal Facility is located in Fairfield, California, approximately 9 miles east of Travis Air Force Base. \n\n\n\nThe facility has developed a Risk Management Program to address California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program requirements (California Code of Regulations, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, Sections 2735-2785), and Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Plan requirements (Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40, Chapter 1, Part 68). The facility is extremely diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community. The facility staff is highly trained and utilizes log sheets and employee rounds to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while effectively and safely using propane.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe facility has a long standing commitment to its workers and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the propane system. The facility's policy is to implement reasonable standard operating procedures and maintenance tasks to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nPropane is received, stored, and distributed from the Sheldon United Terminal Facility as a fuel source. \n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario Results Summary\n\nScenario Description: Per CalARP/EPA RMP regulations a worst-case analysis has been defined for the propane system. The meteorological conditions consistent with regulatory requirements for worst-case scenarios- were inputted into RMP*Comp, along with the theory behind the CAMEO Evaporation Calculator for propane. The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment Tab in the Co"

      "SummaryText": "mpliance Workbook. The worst-case release scenarios are highly unlikely to occur because of active and passive mitigation measures that are available and used, and weather conditions that are unlikely as well.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary\n\nScenario Description: A more realistic alternative release scenario was modeled for the CalARP/EPA RMP Program 3 substance: propane. The meteorological conditions consistent with regulatory requirements for alternative release scenarios were used. RMP*Comp was used to determine the maximum downwind endpoint distances for the propane scenario. The theory behind the CAMEO Evaporation Calculator was also used for the propane alternative scenario. The downwind distance for the alternative release scenario is significantly less than that for the worst-case scenario. The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment Tab in the Compliance Workbook.\n\n\n\nRisk Considerations\n\nAlthough the storage and use of propane has inherent potential risks and worst-case release scenario can potentially reach the community; the facility has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst-case type of event non-credible. In addition to the safety practices of the facility and facility personnel that make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event (e.g., In the event of a release, sudden rupture and flashing of propane would be highly turbulent. Turbulence causes entrainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly than is shown in the model). In addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks a"
