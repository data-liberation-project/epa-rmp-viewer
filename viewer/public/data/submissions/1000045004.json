The facility maintains an ongoing emergency response program that prepares for safe evacuation and timely response by trained personnel.  The plant program complies with all applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) 40 CFR-68 Prevention Program under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.\r\n\r\n1.2.\tMANAGEMENT SYSTEM (A) (1)\r\nMontco has a management system in place which is lead by the Vice President .

These are detailed in the Process and Instrument Drawings (P&ID) which are part of the plant Process Safety Information (PSI).  All drawings are maintained in the plants RMP Process Safety Information.\r\n\r\n1.6.\tMONTCO RESEARCH PRODUCTS AND ANHYDROUS HYDROGEN CHLORIDE\r\nMontco uses hydrogen chloride gas in a reaction/distillation process in order to produce 1-Chloromethylnapthalene and Ethyl Benzyl Chloride.  A maximum quantity of 42,000 lbs. of anhydrous hydrogen chloride is stored on site in two compressed gas tube trailers.  Each trailer contains up to seven tubes with a capacity of 3,000 pounds of hydrogen chloride each.  A Risk Management Plan has been developed as required and is maintained in order to reduce the possibility of an accidental release of hydrogen chloride gas from the system.\r\n\r\n2.\tHAZARD ASSESSMENT\r\nA hazard assessment was performed to determine the effects a release would have on the environment, the public and th"

In addition, an estimate of the population that could be affected by a release of hydrogen chloride was determined, and sensitive receptors such as residences were identified.  The hazard assessment considers two release scenarios-a worst case and an alternative case.  The five-year EPA accident history for the hydrogen chloride system was included in the hazards assessment.  (Zero EPA accidents to date.)\r\nThe worst case release scenario is defined by EPA, which states that the operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over 10 minutes due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario.  Montco staff based this alternate case on the findings of the Process Hazards Analysis.\r\n\r\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling was performed to determine the distance traveled by the hydrogen chloride released before its concentration decreases to the toxic endpoint.  The EPA specified endpoint for hydrogen chloride is 0.030 mg/l.  The endpoint is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.  The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance was defined.  The 2010 census data was used to estimate the population potentially affected.\r\n\r\n2.1.\tWORST CASE   (C) (1)\r\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling for the worst case scenario was performed using the EPA assumptions and EPA's RMP Comp Program.

See the Emergency Response Program book. \r\nSpecific training in the properties, hazards, handling requirements, and leak repair for hydrogen chloride is conducted annually. \r\nFinally, the details of both facility and equipment design are key to the safe operations of the hydrogen chloride system.\r\n\r\n3.2.3.\tFacility Design\r\nThe hydrogen chloride storage area is located in an open area northeast of the plant operating area.

      "SummaryText": "ydrogen chloride storage area and feed control meet and exceed design codes standards and good engineering practices.  The storage and control area has an open air natural ventilation system.  The reaction emissions vent water tank scrubber which is capable of neutralizing over 3,000 pounds of hydrogen chloride.  This is followed by a dual packed columns vent scrubber.  A caustic solution is circulated over the column packing and neutralizes any hydrogen chloride gases.\r\n\r\n3.2.4.\tEquipment Design\r\nThere two hydrogen chloride pipe systems, both are under pressure.  The hydrogen chloride piping system is made of hydrogen chloride compatible stainless steel pipes, stainless steel tubes or equipment.  These materials include compatible non-metallic compound (not corroded by hydrogen chloride) rated to 1,000 psig.  The maximum pressure of the hydrogen chloride in the high pressure system is 650 psig. There are six or seven 3,000 pound tube containers on each tube trailer.  One tube is in service and the other five or six are on valved off, ie in standby. \r\nThe system has a nitrogen purge system for both pressure testing and clearing the hydrogen chloride lines to and from the tube trailer to the reactors.\r\nThe reactors operate under negative pressure and as discussed above vent to multiple a scrubber system. \r\n\r\n4.\tFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY (E)\r\nThe plant has been hydrogen chloride reportable and release free since 1992 to the present, 22 years.  There have been no EPA accidental releases of anhydrous hydrogen chloride at Montco Research Products in the last ten years.\r\n\r\n5.\tEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM (F)\r\nEmergency response procedures are contained in the Plant Emergency Response Policy that is coordinated with the City of Palatka, Putnam County Contingency Plan (Emergency Response Plan).  The plan includes an emergency response decision tree and a notification plan.  Emergency response drills including evacuations are conducted by Montco staff.  Emergency operation"
