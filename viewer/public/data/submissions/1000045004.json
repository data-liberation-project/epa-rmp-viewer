EXECUTIVE SUMMARY INTRODUCTION 68.155                                                                        \n\nMontco Research Products, Inc. (Montco) operates its plant at 209 Janice Drive, P.O. Box 235, Hollister, FL  32147.  The plant has quantities of a regulated hazardous chemical, anhydrous hydrogen chloride (CAS # 7647-01-0), above the 6,000 pound EPA and OSHA threshold.  Montco has a unified Risk Management Program (RMP) as it is also subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM).  \n\n\n\n1.1.    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION/EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES     (A)\n\nMontco  prevents accidental releases through classroom and on the job training of operating personnel and ongoing inspection and maintenance of the hydrogen chloride gas storage transfer and injection system.  The facility maintains an ongoing emergency response program that prepares for safe evacuation and timely response by trained personnel.  The plant program complies with all applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) 40 CFR-68 Prevention Program under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.\n\n\n\n1.2.    MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (A) (1)\n\nMontco has a management system in place which is lead by the Vice President .  The Vice President oversees the implementation and on-going use of the RMP elements.  This program, along with other plant-specific policies, eliminates and/or reduces the likelihood of a hazardous chemical release at the plant.  An organizational chart defining the lines of authority and responsible staff is included in the plants RMP Process Safety Information.\n\n\n\n1.3.    PREVENTION PROGRAM LEVEL 3 (A) (2)\n\nMontco maintains policies, procedures and systems as part of their prevention program. The program addresses each of the EPA Program Level 3-listed 12 elements, as well as RMP elements, needed to implement the program"

STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED AT MONTCO RESEARCH PRODUCTS INC., FLORIDA SITE (B)  \n\nMontco employs 10 full-time and one part time employee engaged in plant operations.  Hydrogen chloride is a raw ingredient used as part of the chemical manufacturing process.\n\n\n\n1.5.    SITE DESCRIPTION (B) (1)    \n\nThe site is owned and operated by Montco and is managed by Montco staff.  The site is located at 209 Janice Drive, P.O. Box 235, Hollister, Putnam County, Florida.   The 100-acre site is located at the end of Janice Drive.\n\nThe Plant includes a separate anhydrous hydrogen chloride storage area.  Up to two tube trailers can be stored at one time.\n\n\n\nThe boundaries of the hydrogen chloride system subject to the RMP, and like PSM, regulation include the Bulk Hydrogen Chloride Storage, Feed Control system, associated vent makeup, exhaust systems, and the hydrogen chloride system units.  These are detailed in the Process and Instrument Drawings (P&ID) which are part of the plant Process Safety Information (PSI).  All drawings are maintained in the plants RMP Process Safety Information.\n\n\n\n1.6.    MONTCO RESEARCH PRODUCTS AND ANHYDROUS HYDROGEN CHLORIDE\n\nMontco uses hydrogen chloride gas in a reaction/distillation process in order to produce 1-Chloromethylnapthalene and Ethyl Benzyl Chloride.  A maximum quantity of 42,000 lbs. of anhydrous hydrogen chloride is stored on site in two compressed gas tube trailers.  Each trailer contains up to seven tubes with a capacity of 3,000 pounds of hydrogen chloride each.  A Risk Management Plan has been developed as required and is maintained in order to reduce the possibility of an accidental release of hydrogen chloride gas from the system.\n\n\n\n2.

      "SummaryText": "e Montco staff and equipment.  The distance to a hydrogen chloride endpoint concentration of the gas was determined.  In addition, an estimate of the population that could be affected by a release of hydrogen chloride was determined, and sensitive receptors such as residences were identified.  The hazard assessment considers two release scenarios-a \"worst case\" and an \"alternative case\".  The five-year EPA accident history for the hydrogen chloride system was included in the hazards assessment.  (Zero EPA accidents to date.)\n\nThe \"worst case release\" scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \"the operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over 10 minutes\" due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario\".  Montco staff based this alternate case on the findings of the Process Hazards Analysis.\n\n\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling was performed to determine the distance traveled by the hydrogen chloride released before its concentration decreases to the \"toxic endpoint.\"  The EPA specified endpoint for hydrogen chloride is 0.030 mg/l.  The endpoint is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the \"maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\"  The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance was defined.  The 2010 census data was used \"to estimate the population potentially affected.\"\n\n\n\n2.1.

ALTERNATIVE CASE   (C) (2)\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the failure of the regulator of the pressure system or the tubing/valves connected to one of the 3,000 pound tube containers.  This failure was defined during the recent Process Hazards Analysis.  This failure is equal to creating a 0.03 square inch hole in the tube, a pipe, or even the container itself.  Modeling using the EPA/RMP Comp guidance demonstrated the rate of hydrogen chloride release is 100.0 lb. /minutes for a period of 30 minutes releasing a total of 3,000 pounds of hydrogen chloride.  (Release data is kept on site in the  Process Safety Information)\n\n\n\n3.    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM (D)\n\nMontco's accidental release prevention program is based on OSHA's PSM program and EPA's RMP Level 3 prevention program.  The PSM  and RMP programs have been in place and effectively used for many years.  It is part of the plants operating culture.  There are two parts to the program.  The first is the general overall plant-wide program and the site-specific PSM/RMP program.  The second is the hydrogen chloride specific actions within the site program.  This is coordinated with the Palatka Fire Rescue/HazMat Team and Putnam County's Fire/Rescue Department and the Regional LEPC.\n\n\n\n3.1.    GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM   (D) (1)\n\nPlant-wide, many elements of the prevention program are used for all operations.  An overview of the generally written programs is listed below:\n\nMontco has detailed process safety information on each of its operations. \n\nThe document maintenance system is integral to the management of change for all operations on site control.  \n\nTraining is the backbone of employee knowledge, job operations and is ongoing in each area.

      "SummaryText": "2009 and 2014 (recommended actions) were identified in the internal and subsequent  audit and the PHA , tour, and audit of the RMP program to meet requirements of the Risk Management Prevention Program.  These recommended actions have now been evaluated and implemented.  An Audit was conducted to review the PSM and RMP program.  The key safety action items were completed.  See the \"Update\" Section 6 of the Audit Report.  Montco continually reviews implemented operating procedures for potential safety improvements for all of its operations.  Currently, the plant management team and process safety team are reviewing potential replacement of anhydrous hydrogen chloride with liquid hydroc;hloric acid to make the system even safer and to prevent a gas release and minimize consequences in the event of a release.\n\n"
