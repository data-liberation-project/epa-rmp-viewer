If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and law enforcement personnel to mitigate any releases to residents and the environment of our community.\n\n2.  Facility Information:  This facility is located approximately 7 miles east of Bruning, NE and 4 miles south of Ohiowa, NE.  The primary activity at the facility is the wholesaling of grains and the opertion of a country grain elevator.  Bruning Grain & Feed has operated this facility for over 19 years.  The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia stored at this location is 197,243 pounds within all permanent storage and nurse tanks.\n\n3.  Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario:\n\n    A.  The worst-case release scenario would be the total release of the anhydrous ammonia from our major storage tank.  We rely on EPA's  RMP Comp to determine distances to end point, etc. and have maps, population estimates, etc. available to our Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) for their consideration and planning.  \n\n    B.  The alternative release scenario is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  We have similar information for this type fo release readily available to our LEPC. \n\n    C.  Administrative controls are through our operating procedures, training, maintenance and audit programs.\n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program:  The facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc.  During periods of non operation local law enforcement personnel and our personnel make unscheduled inspections of the facility.  Anything out of the ordinary is reported to our 24 hour number and appropriate action is taken.\n\n5.  Fire Year Accident History:  There have"
