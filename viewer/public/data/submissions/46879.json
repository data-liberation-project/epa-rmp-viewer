Donald Broz - General Manager\n573/929-3222\n\n1)  Facility Policy.\n\nThe owners, management and employees of Service and Supply Cooperative Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Montgomery County LEPC, and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2)  Facility Information.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a nutrIent for crop productions.  The maximum quantity stored would be 204,000 pounds in storage tanks and nurse tanks.\n\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\n    a.  The worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as gas over a period of 10 minutes.    The maximum quantity released woud be 48,000 lbs., which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capiacity as limited by design standards and administrative controls.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is .65 mile.\n    \n    b.  The alternate release scenario: a 1\" transfer hose failure is used as an alternate release scenario followed by a release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shut-down valve intervenes or manual shut-off is closed an stops the flow of ammonia.  The maximum quantity released would be 2,900#'s.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200ppm) is .22 mile.\n\n4.    Accidental Release Prevention Program \n         The faciity is in compliance with the provisions fo \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by  Th"

Five-year Accident History\nSERVICE AND SUPPLY COOPERATIVE INC. has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\n\n6.     Emergency Response Plan\n\n         The facility has:\n             a.   A written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n             b.   Provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know  information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n\n7.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\n     Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the conditions of the facility.  There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementations at this time.\n\n8.
