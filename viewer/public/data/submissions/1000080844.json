      "SummaryText": "The City of Cedar Rapids Water Division is responsible for providing safe, high quality drinking water to meet residential, commercial, industrial, and fire protection needs of the community.  The J Avenue NE water treatment plant is located on approximately five acres in the northeastern quadrant of Cedar Rapids.  Administration, operations, and maintenance buildings provide the day to day operations, system control, and analytic services for the required treatment processes.  The original 1929 plant design capacity of 12 million gallons per day has increased to 40 million gallons per day at present.\r\n\r\nThis public water system is permitted through the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, permit number 5715093.  Operating parameters defined in the permit comply with the Safe Drinking Water Act and Iowa State Code.  Although the raw water source is considered Ground Water-Under the Influence of Surface Water, operational requirements for this system must meet the Surface Water Treatment rules and regulations.  Disinfection treatment is one of an array of treatment methods specifically listed in the permit.  Cedar Rapids Water Division employs a multi-barrier approach incorporating chloramine disinfection along with ultra violet disinfection.  Ultra violet disinfection is a supplementary treatment method used to satisfy rules and regulations related to pathogen sequestration.  Chloramine disinfection is considered the primary treatment method.\r\nChlorine, packaged in ton containers, is the chemical of choice, used to introduce gaseous chlorine, intermixed with solution water, at points of injection midway through the treatment process.\r\nQuantities of chlorine stored and used on site is approximately 44 tons (22 ton containers) at maximum capacity.  Chlorine ton container storage room accommodates a total of 13 ton containers.  Overflow staging of ton containers (full or empty) occurs outdoors, adjacent to the chlorine storage and feed rooms.  All ton containers store"

Coordination with Cedar Rapids Fire Department and HAZMAT response team includes review of emergency action plan, review of off-site consequence analysis, and site visits by police, fire fighter and HAZMAT response teams.  Cedar Rapids Fire Department is a member of the Linn County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC)."
