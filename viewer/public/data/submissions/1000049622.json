      "SummaryText": "Shell Puget Sound Refinery has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nShell Puget Sound Refinery, located in Anacortes, Washington, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., propane, butane, gasoline, jet fuel, diesel) from raw crude oil.  The refinery has several regulated flammables, such as propane, butane, etc.  In addition, the refinery uses and/or processes ammonia and hydrogen sulfide, which are also regulated substances.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nShell Puget Sound Refinery has not had an RMP-related accident over the past 5 years.  However, Shell has an incident investigation program to determine the causes of accidents to determine ways to help prevent similar accidents from occurring. \r\n \r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at Shell Puget Sound Refinery.  Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nShell Puget Sound Refinery encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard"

Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the refinery and addresses each PSM program element.  In addition, the refinery has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues. Through the BEST (Behavioral Education for a Safer Today) Program, employees have designed and implemented a behavior based safety program which encourages modifications to behavior to work safer.  This program utilizes peer observations of work practices and participation on safety teams.  The program has the stated goal that \"We all return home healthy and safe.\" The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nShell Puget Sound Refinery keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response / exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns.  The refinery process uses controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). \r\n\r\nThe refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to recognize hazards and to verify that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\nShell Puget Sound Refinery primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as a systematic and thorough hazard evaluation technique.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to a variety of departments for consideration and resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and that documentation is retained.  It is Shell Puget Sound Refinery's policy to resolve all open findings in a timely manner.  The time necessary to resolve a finding varies, depending on the nature of the finding and circumstances.  For example, as a general rule, high risk findings are resolved within one year or less, unless the resolution of t"

Medium risk findings are completed at the next convenient opportunity and low risk items are evaluated and proceed at the discretion of refinery management.\r\n\r\nShell Puget Sound Refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. An electronic tracking system is used to manage and document the results and findings from these updates. The team findings are forwarded to various departments for consideration and resolution. \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nShell Puget Sound Refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  \r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Shell Puget Sound Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  There is a training program that is designed to provide new operators with basic training in refinery operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After attending the training program, new operators are paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.

This refresher training is conducted at least every three years.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nShell Puget Sound Refinery uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has procedures in place so that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform refinery personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, Shell Puget Sound Refinery evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Refinery personnel periodically monitor various contractor safety performance to confirm that such contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\r\n\r\nShell Puget Sound Refinery conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.
