The accidental release program integrates management practices, safety procedures, employee participation, process safety, operating information, process hazard analysis, compliance auditing, system startup reviews, mechanical integrity checks, management of change procedures, incident investigation procedures, emergency planning and response, and regular updating of practices and procedures. All applicable requirements of a Program 3 risk management program are adhered to. This emergency response program is designed to work with the available emergency response agencies and the Coshocton County LEPC. It includes emergency response procedures as well as site evacuation procedures.\n\nThe chlorination system at the Coshocton Water Treatment Plant provides disinfection for the drinking water treated there. This treated water is supplied to the residents and businesses in and around the city. The chlorination facility includes storage for six one-ton containers, the necessary container handling equipment, a chlorinator room with two chlorinators and various safety devices and controls. \n\nThe containers in service and in standby are connected to the process piping through vacuum regulators that are designed to only allow chlorine gas to leave the containers under vacuum conditions. The containers in service and standby are controlled automatically using a vacuum switchover device that only allows one container to be drawn from at any time. The treatment plant operators check the operation of the chlorination system regularly on their shifts and respond immediately to problems.\n\nThe offsite consequence analyses consider two chlorine "

      "SummaryText": "release scenarios. They are identified as a worst case scenario and an alternate release scenario. Predictive release consequences were obtained using the EPA RMP Comp model program to identify the distance affected by each release scenario. The worst case scenario involves the rupture of a full one-ton container allowing its entire contents to be released within 10-minutes. The distance to the endpoint of such a release is estimated to be 1.3-miles from the chlorine facilities assuming a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second (approximately 3.5 MPH) with Class F atmospheric stability. This scenario takes into account the moderating effect of the storage room ventilation system on the rate of release of the gas to the atmosphere. The potential population affected is estimated to be approximately 8,000 people.\n\nThe offsite consequences of an alternate release scenario involves a potential puncture of the container or failure of a fuse plug allowing liquid to be released first followed by gas for a period of 30-minutes and assumes the entire contents of a full container will be released. The distance to the endpoint was estimated to be 0.3-miles from the chlorine facilities assuming a wind speed of 3 meters per second (approximately 7 MPH) with Class D atmospheric conditions. This scenario takes into account the moderating effect of the storage room ventilation system on the rate of release of the gas to the atmosphere. The potential population affected is estimated to be approximately 5,000 people.\n\nThese scenarios were considered because the chlorine feed system is designed to only operate under vacuum conditions making a leak of serious consequence from the piping extremely unlikely. The tank mounted regulators are designed to prevent the flow of gas from the containers unless a vacuum is present at their outlet.\n\nActivation of the chlorine gas detectors is considered a means of active mitigation.\n\nThe City of Coshocton Water Treatment Plant Risk Management Program  h"
