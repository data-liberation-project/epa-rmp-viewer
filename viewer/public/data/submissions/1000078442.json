In this way we promote overall plant, worker, and public safety.  These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosion, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\n\n\nOur safety program is applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, handling or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities.\n\n\n\nAny group of vessels which are interconnected and separated vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.\n\n\n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\n\n\nThe plant's process entails processing of raw meat products is such a way as to prepare pre-formed and uncooked meat products for the fast food industry.  Meat products require refrigeration and freezing to preserve the products against spoilage during manufacturing, transportation and in retail stores.\n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are found in the process safety management program.

Training procedures are in place to insure that all maintenance employees responsible for maintaining the system receive recertification training every three years and any new employee receives training before conducting operations on the ammonia system.\n\n\n\nControls and equipment go through an intense check list to insure safe operation of the equipment by qualified maintenance engineers on a daily basis.  The system is maintained 24 hours a day seven days a week by qualified maintenance engineers.\n\n\n\nThe emergency action plan utilized is OSHA's regulation 29 CFR 1910.38.  This plan is in place for the safe evacuation of employees.  Training is given to all affected employees annually and before their duty assignment begins.  Evacuation exercises are conducted as needed to promote training and additional understanding of the program.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response team is designated to the Oklahoma City Fire Department.  The Oklahoma City Fire Department participates in the overall program and coordinates with management in areas of planning for emergencies and emergency operations.\n\n\n\nUnder the emergency planning and community right to know act (EPCRA) and under section 303 of EPCRA, local emergency planning committees (LEPCs) must prepare an emergency response plan for facilities in their planning district having toxic substance listed under EPCRA section 302 in excess of the threshold planning quantity established under that section.\n\n\n\nThe Oklahoma City LEPC has been furnished a copy of this company's \"Emergency Action Plan.\"  This plan includes toxic end points of the worst case scenario for this facility.
