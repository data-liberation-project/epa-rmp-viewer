Our objective is to continuously improve our safety, health and environmental \nperformance.  The Company operates, maintains and designs improvements to the Delaware \nCity Refinery to minimize environmental impact and to protect employees, contractors and the \npublic from injury and illness.  Safety, health and environmental performance are key factors in \nselecting and periodically evaluating contractors. The Company audits safety, health and \nenvironmental performance to assure compliance and improvement.  The Company is prepared \nto respond quickly and effectively to any incidents involving the refinery, its equipment or products \nunder its control.  The refinery has had an active process safety management (PSM) program \nsince 1989.\n\nEmployee participation is important in PSM.  Refinery operators participate in every process \nhazards analysis (PHA) and PSM self-audit, contribute experience to updating procedures, \nevaluate jobs for hot work permits, and participate on incident investigation and emergency \nresponse teams.  The refinery has two Health & Safety Representatives from the bargaining unit \nwho contribute to PSM decisions.  In addition, they coordinate the Triangle of Prevention (TOP) \nincident investigation program which investigates every incident with trained investigators from \nboth the bargaining unit and management.  Recommendations from investigations are tracked in \na computer database that reminds people weekly about their assigned work in resolving \nrecommendations.  This data tracking system is also used to follow up management of change \n(MOC) and recommendations from PHA, internal and external audits, incident investigations and \nmechanical inspections.\n\nRefi"
