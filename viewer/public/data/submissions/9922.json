The Facility Policy\n\n      The owners, management, and employees of Farmers Cooperative Elevator Company are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia and propane.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n      The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizer and propane for sale to farmers and home owners.\n\n      Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.\n\n      The maximum quantity stored at this facility would be 175,000 pounds (34,000 gallons) in our 18,000  gallon and our two 11,000 gallon storage tanks. The maxium quantity handled would be the unloading of a transport truck holding 46,000 pounds (8,930 gallons).\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario\n\n      a. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 79,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest tank at 85 % (percent) capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the end point (point if dispersion to 220 ppm) is 1.89 miles.  \n\n      b. The alternative release scenario based on the five year accident history  ( or the most likely potential incident ) is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint ( point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .47 miles.  \n\n      Propane is received, stored and distributed for home heating & irrigation fuel.\n      \n      a.

The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history ( or the most likely potential incident ) is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint is .10 miles.\n                                            \n \n   \n4. The accidental release prevention program\n\n      The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards fo the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111. \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\", The National Fire Protection Association \"NFPA 58\", and \"The Kansas State Fire Marshal Fire prevention Handbook\".\n\n\n5. The Five-year Accident History\n\n      a. There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or propane in the past five years that:\n\n            -have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damages at the facility; nor\n\n\n\n            - to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damage,\n              or environmental damage.\n\n6. The emergency response program\n\n      The facility has:\n\n      a. A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38.\n\n      b. Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information\n          as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n      c. A written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120,\n          including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7.
