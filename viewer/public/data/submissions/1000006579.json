This commitment is integrated into our design standards, equipment installation and maintenance practices, operating procedures and training programs.\n\nHydrite Chemical has developed and trained written emergency response procedures in the event of an accidental release from any of our processes.  These written plans have been provided to the local emergency response agencies including local emergency response personnel, hospitals, state and federal agencies.\n\nRegulated materials are received from various suppliers in containers.  These containers meet DOT specifications.  All storage and ancillary equipment is designed to comply with National Standards including the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), the Fertilizer Institute, National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) and OSHA.\n\nHydrite Chemical has multiple release prevention programs integrated into all phases of operation from design through maintenance.  Each chemical is reviewed for physical hazards, health hazards, environmental hazards and process hazards.  All processes are subject to the OSHA PSM program and as such, undergo a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  Written operating procedures have been developed and are reviewed on a regular basis.  Employee training procedures have been developed and are implemented ensuring the employees understand the hazards of the chemical, know how to operate the equipment, know how to shut down the process and how to respond to a release.  Pre-start up safety reviews are performed prior to operation of new equip"
