The PSM program outlines start-up and shutdown procedures for safe operation of the ammonia freezing system.  The PSM program procedures are followed to prevent the accidental release of ammonia from the freeing system.  The ammonia system was designed and built with multiple safety features and redundancy as added precaution.  Emergency procedures for shutdown and isolation of an ammonia leak are explained and practiced in the PSM program.  \r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information (PSI) is available for all employees.
