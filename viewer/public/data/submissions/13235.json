BASF also believes in being a responsible corporate citizen and maintaining open, constructive dialogue with our neighbors.  These principles are an integral part of our corporate vision statement and values.  We believe that sharing this information with our neighbors makes good sense.  By doing so, we believe the community will better understand how safe and ecologically sound BASF operations are.\n\nPolicies\n\nBASF Corporation has the following Corporate Guidelines related to environmental, health and safety:\n\n7 We produce products that are safe to manufacture, use and dispose of.\n7 We assist our customers to use our products safely and in an environmentally sound manner.  We provide them with information on correct handling of our products.\n7 We minimize the impact on mankind and the environment during production, storage, transportation, marketing and use of our products.\n7 Economic considerations do not take priority over environmental protection, health and safety.\n7 An important contribution to \"Sustainable Development\" is our involvement in the \"Responsible Care\" initiative worldwide.  This applies to our products and services in all our businesses and affiliates.\n7 We are committed to making continuous improvements in safety, health and environmental protection.  We do this acting on our own initiative and in consultation with recognized regulatory authorities.  We take any action judged to be necessary, whether or not dictated by statutory obligation or official regulations.\n7 We encourage safety, environmental and health awareness among employees.\n7 We regard it as an important corporate duty to advance science and technology in order to improve saf"

Our goals are to promote and strengthen mutual understanding and deepen trust in what we do.\n\nThe BASF Corporation, Wyandotte Site implements these policies through site-specific programs and procedures.\n Facility Description\n\nThe BASF Corporation Wyandotte Site uses the following RMP regulated substances - Butane, Ethylene Oxide, Propylene Oxide, Acrylonitrile, Toluene Di-isocyanate, and Anhydrous Hydrochloric Acid.  These chemicals are used to manufacture Expanded Polyolefins (EPO) foam beads, Polyols, and Vitamins. These products are used in the manufacture of protective packaging for electronics and other consumer products, seat cushions, picnic coolers, and Vitamin A and E for both human and animal nutritional markets.\n\nSome examples of companies using the products are Centrum Vitamins., Campbell Soup., Shedd's Margarine., Goodyear., Delco., General Motor cars., Chrysler Cars. and Ford Windstar Vans. to name a few. \n\nRelease Scenarios\n\nWorst Case - Toxic\n\n7 Release of Ethylene Oxide (EO) from a storage tank with off-site impact. Administrative controls are in place to limit the amount of ethylene oxide that can be stored. The dike around the tank would act as passive mitigation by limiting the surface area available for evaporation.  \n\nWorst Case - Flammable\n\n7 Instantaneous release of Butane resulting in a vapor cloud explosion with off-site impacts. \n\nAlternative Scenarios - Toxic\n\n7 Release of Ethylene Oxide from a bleed valve during material transfer with off-site impact. \n\n7 Release of Acrylonitrile from a bleed valve during material transfer with off-site impact. \n\n7 The release of the contents of one tube of Anhydrous HCl due to the shearing of the outlet pipe.\n\n7 Release of Propylene"

It is coordinated with the plan that exists within the Local Emergency Planning Committee at Metro Airport, and it is tested annually during the site-wide drill. A community alert broadcast system is in place, \"Sammy the Siren\", which would be used to warn local residents to either 'shelter in place' or evacuate the area in the event of a release. The siren is tested once per month, and detailed shelter in place information was provided to local residents. \n\nEach operations employee receives annual training in emergency response actions. This training outlines what individual actions would be required in the event of a release to stop or significantly reduce the potential for off-site exposure to a chemical release. The site also has several members of a highly trained response team, called the TRACER team, and will be available to assist both on-site and off-site emergencies involving the accidental release of chemicals.\n\nThis facility has an emergency response plan that is coordinated with the community plan.  HAZMAT team members are trained and participate in drills annually.\n\nPla"
