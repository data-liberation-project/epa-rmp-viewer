Paso) uses anhydrous ammonia to limit nitrous oxides in the stack emissions as required by their APCD operating permit.  Ammonia is a regulated substance under the Clean Air Act (CAA) which requires facilities storing or handling regulated substances in threshold amounts  to prepare a Risk Management Plan (RMP) and to implement an effective accidental release prevention program. Mt. Paso has a Risk Management Plan and an accidental release prevention program in place meeting the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions and Title 19, Chapter 4.5, California Accidental Release Prevention program (CalARP). Ammonia is also a regulated substance under the Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard thus requiring Mt. Paso to comply with Cal-OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program.\n\n\n\n\n\nII.   ACCIDENTAL RELEASE  PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY  RESPONSE  POLICIES\n\nMt. Poso Cogeneration Company is committed is to conduct business in a manner that is lawful, compatible with the environment and conductive to the health and safety of employees, contractors, facilities and the community.   They will conduct operations in compliance with applicable industry standards, OSHA's PSM Standard, EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, and the California Accidental Release Prevention requirements.\n\n\n\nMt. Paso Cogeneration Company will conduct business consistent with the EH&S Policy and the following EH&S Principles:\n\n\n\n?    Activities will be conducted in compliance with applicable laws, regulations, industry standards and guidelines.\n\n?  Activities will be managed  to protect people and property and to control Mt. Paso\n\nCogeneration Company's liabilities.\n\n?    All Mt. Paso Cogeneration Company's employees will be individually and collectively accountable for the execution of the EH&S Policy.\n\n?

Paso has a twelve-year history of operating in compliance with the California Risk Management Prevention Plan (RMPP), California Accidental Release Program (CalARP), and the Cal-OSHA PSM program.  Compliance with these accident prevention programs and the company's EH&S principles will continue to ensure an incident free operation.\n\n\n\n\n\nIll.  FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nMt. Paso operates a nominally rated 49.9 megawatt, biomass-fired, circulating fluidized bed, cogeneration facility, in Kern County.   Mt. Paso began operation in 1989.  Mt. Paso operations personnel, under an Operation and Maintenance Agreement, perform the day- to-day operation. Mt. Paso provides steam for enhanced recovery of crude oil.\n\n\n\nAmmonia is used to reduce the nitrogen oxide emissions from the Mt. Poso exhaust stacks, which improves air quality. The emissions control operations include storage and handling of up to 21,250 gallons of anhydrous ammonia, a substance that the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has identified as an acutely hazardous material.  The USEPA and California have established complementary programs for reducing the hazards associated with the storage and handling of such hazardous materials.  The program was initiated by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, Title Ill,\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 112(r) and codified in 40 CFR Part 68.    The California Accidental Release Program (CalARP) pursuant to Sections 25531 through 25543.3 of the Health and Safety Code has additional regulations.  To comply with both state and federal requirements, Mt. Paso is required to prepare a joint Risk Management Plan (RMP) and an accidental release prevention program for its anhydrous ammonia storage and handling facilities.\n\n\n\nThe maximum capacity of the ammonia storage tank is 25,000 gallons.  Written operating procedures and a high-level alarm limit the maximum working capacity of the tank to 21,250 gallons, or 8"

Paso facility as required by the PSM/RMP/CalARP regulations. The PHA is a systematic review of design, equipment, safety, and operating procedures.   In November 2012, a PHA revalidation was conducted for the ammonia deNOx process, using the \"Checklist\" methodology.  This PHA updated included extended review of External Events and Human Factors that could result in a release of ammonia.  The most likely events that could lead to potential off-site impacts are corrosion failure, an external event, and on-site accidents.   The output of the revalidation was a schedule for implementation of recommendations developed in the PHA update analysis and approved by Mt. Poso Cogeneration management for implementation. \n\n\n\nEngineering   controls   and   mitigation   systems   in place at Mt. Poso Cogeneratoin include  equipment   compatible  with anhydrous   ammonia,  ammonia  sensors,  relief  valves,  check  valves,  manual  and automatic shutoffs, interlocks, alarms and procedures, emergency air supply, emergency power, and grounding equipment.\n\n\n\nAdministrative controls include: health, safety and process training for all employees, contractors and visitors; procedures for different aspects of operation and record keeping; proper  installation of equipment;  regular inspection; ammonia truck off-loading procedures; storage tank/system operation procedures; ammonia injection procedures; and repair and maintenance for all equipment anhydrous ammonia process.  Plant personnel supervise the deliver and off-loading of ammonia.\n\n\n\n\n\nV.   ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe PSM/RMP Program has been established by Mt. Paso to protect company and contract personnel, the surrounding community, and property by preventing or minimizing the consequences of catastrophic releases of anhydrous ammonia.  The program co"
