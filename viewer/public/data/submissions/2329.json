This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The City of Benton Water Treatment Plant implements reasonable controls, such as training of personnel and the safe design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to make every effort to prevent the release of hazardous substance but in the event of a release, our trained personnel and local emergency response agencies will respond to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injuries to the public or the environment.\n\n\n2.0    Description of the City of Benton Water Treatment     Plant and Regulated Substances\n\n\nThe City of Benton Water Treatment Plant is located within the city limits of Benton, Arkansas, a city with a population of over 23,000 residents.  The facility treats approximately 12 million gallons of water per day.  The City of Benton Water Treatment Plant handles one substance regulated by the Risk Management Program Rule (RMP Rule) rule in quantities above the Threshold Quantity.  This substance is:\n\n* Chlorine - stored in 1 ton cylinders and used for the disinfection of water treated and distributed to our customers.\n \n \n 3.0    Hazard Assessment\n \n \n The RMP Rule requires The City of Benton Water Treatment Plant to perform a Hazard Assessment of the chlorine stored and used in the chlorination process at the facility.  This Hazard Assessment includes an offsite consequence analysis for the following scenarios:\n \n* One worst-case and one alternative release scenario for the toxic substance chlorine for the chlorination process unit at the facility.\n\nThe following information summarizes these offsite consequence analyses.\n\n\n3.1    Chlorination Process\n\nThe worst-case scen"

The toxic cloud formed by the evaporating chlorine would reach offsite endpoints and public receptors.\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine is a cylinder valve sticking in the open position allowing a sixty minute release of chlorine gas.  The toxic cloud formed by the escaping gas would reach offsite endpoints and public receptors.\n\n\n4.0    Accidental Release Prevention Program and\n    Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\nThe RMP Rule requires that a prevention program be established for the City of Benton Water Treatment Plant chlorination process.  The following details the prevention program elements at the City of Benton Water Treatment Plant that apply to these processes.\n\n4.1    Safety Information\n\nThe City of Benton Water Treatment Plant maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of the City of Benton Water Treatment Plant processes.  Material safety data sheets (MSDSs) document the physical and chemical properties of hazardous substances handled at the City of Benton Water Treatment Plant, including the chlorine in the covered processes.  The engineering design documents include the operating parameters, the design basis and configuration of the equipment in each covered process, and references to applicable codes and standards.\n\n4.2    Hazard Review\n\nThe City of Benton Water Treatment Plant performs and periodically updates hazard reviews of the covered processes to help identify and control process hazards.  Checklists are used to guide the hazard review.  These checklists include items to help ensure the City of Benton Water Treatment Plant operates and maintains the equipment in a manner consistent with the applicable design specifications, codes, standards, and regulations.\n\n4.3    Operating Procedures\n\nThe City of Benton Water Treatment Plant develops and maintains operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operation"

The operating procedures are used to:\n\n1. train employees and contractors, and\n2. serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal and abnormal process conditions.\n4.4    Training\n\nThe City of Benton Water Treatment Plant trains personnel in the operating procedures to help ensure safe and effective performance of their assigned tasks. A record of all training is maintained to help ensure new and refresher training is provided on a timely basis.\n\n4.5    Maintenance\n\nThe City of Benton Water Treatment Plant properly maintains the equipment in our processes.  The City of Benton Water Treatment Plant maintenance program includes:\n\n1. procedures to safely guide workers in their maintenance tasks,\n2. worker training in the maintenance procedures, and\n3. an inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before equipment fails.\n\n4.6    Compliance Audits\n\nThe City of Benton Water Treatment Plant performs periodic (at least every three years) audits of covered processes to verify the processes are operating in compliance with the requirements of the RMP Rule.  A compliance audit report is prepared after each audit, and any deficiencies noted by the audit are corrected in a timely manner.\n\n4.7    Incident Investigations\n\nThe City of Benton Water Treatment Plant investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment.  The City of Benton Water Treatment Plant trains employees to identify and report any and all incidents requiring investigation.  An investigation team is assembled and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.\n\n4.8    Chemical-specific Prevention Steps - Chlorine\n\nIndustry standards are followed at The City of Benton Water Treatment Plant to help ensure safe handling"
