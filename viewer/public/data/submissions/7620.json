We at Hydrite Chemical are strongly committed to employee and public safety and environmental responsibility.  It is our policy to control our processes to prevent the accidental release of harmful or noxious materials that could endanger or irritate our employees, plant visitors, or neighbors.  This commitment is integrated into our design standards, equipment installation and maintenance practices, operating procedures and training programs.\n\nHydrite Chemical has developed and trained written emergency response procedures in the event of an accidental release from any of our processes.  These written plans have been provided to the local emergency response agencies including local emergency response personnel, hospitals, state and federal agencies.\n\nHydrite warehouses two chemical regulated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Program and the Environmental Protection Agency Risk Management Program.  These chemicals are an anhydrous form of chlorine and aqueous ammonia.  Chlorine is received in compressed gas cylinders ranging from 105 lbs. to 2,000 lbs. And is stored as a liquid under pressure.  Aqua ammonia is received in bulk via truck and stored on-site in an outdoor storage tank.  We have on-site storage of 7,500 pounds of chlorine and 82,300 pounds of aqueous ammonia.  All storage containers are designed to comply with National Standards including the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), OSHA, and the Chlorine Institute.\n\nWorst case scenario for regulated toxic gases is based on the total loss of the maximum quantity stored in each container.  Release is assumed to occur over a 10 minute period with weather conditions as defined by EPA in the Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  Passive mitigation for "

      "SummaryText": "enclosures is included as all material is received and stored within a building.  Hydrite has elected to use the ALOHA modeling package to keep our scenarios comparable with the local emergency response providers.  Worst case release for chlorine has the greatest distance to the endpoint and does have off-site impact.\n\nAlternate scenario for chlorine was based on a fuseable plug failure on a ton container allowing the quantity in the container to be released through the 3/8\" opening for 15 minutes.  Weather conditions used were as specified in the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  Modeling was conducted using ALOHA.  The alternate scenario for aqueous ammonia was based on a total tank failure with the contents released into a dike.  The release is assumed to occur over a 60 minute period with the entire contents of the tank released.  Due to ALOHA's inability to model aqueous solutions, Hydrite used RMP*Comp for modeling the aqueous ammonia scenarios.  Both alternate scenarios have off-site impacts. \n\nHydrite Chemical has multiple release prevention programs integrated into all phases of operation from design through maintenance.  Each chemical is reviewed for physical hazards, health hazards, environmental hazards and process hazards.  Chlorine process is subject to OSHA PSM and both processes are subject to EPA's RMP program.  As required by those programs, these processes undergo a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  Written operating procedures have been developed and are reviewed on a regular basis.  Employee training procedures have been developed and are implemented ensuring the employees understand the hazards of the chemicals, know how to operate the equipment, know how to shut down the process and how to respond to a release.  Pre-start up safety reviews are performed prior to operation of new equipment or receipt of new chemicals.  Equipment maintenance procedures have been developed and implemented, including routine inspections and scheduled maint"

This plan includes\n     7 individual assignments in case of an emergency for on-scene control of the situation, \n     7 response personnel, \n     7 appropriate response actions, \n     7 resources available at the plant for use in responding such as \n     7 self-contained breathing apparatus, \n     7 two way radios for communication, \n     7 repair kits for leaking cylinders and tanks.  \n\nHydrite Chemical is strongly committed to employee and public safety and environmental responsibility and continually works to improve processes or procedure that advance our goal of zero releases."
