Ammonia is one of the ten hazardous chemicals most commonly involved in a release. To prevent and mitigate an Ammonia release, to improve facility safety, and benefit the community and the environment, Shamrock Foods Company has developed policies and programs to prevent an accidental release.  They include management commitment to safety, risk management plans, standard operating procedures, safety programs, preventative maintenance programs, contractor safety, and training. The most common causes of an Ammonia release are related to Operations and Maintenance failures, Equipment Failures and/or Process Failures; consequently Shamrock Foods Company has emphad preventative maintenance, scheduling replacement of parts such as valves and gaskets, and training of maintenance employees in safe operations.\n\n\n\nAn Emergency Action Plan has been submitted to the Maricopa County Local Emergency Planning Committee.  All employees are trained on relevant response procedures.  There are written procedures for the use, inspection, maintenance and testing of emergency response equipment.  The plan also includes evacuation routes, protective actions for uninvolved employees, a method of accounting for employees, and a list of personal protective equipment for response and mitigation equipment. The Emergency Action Plan also includes a procedure for informing the public and emergency response agencies in case of a release.   \n\n\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n\n\n\nThe Shamrock Foods Arizona Distribution Center is located at 2929 West Virginia Phoenix, Arizona, \n\n\n\nThe regulated substance handled at this distribution facility is anhydrous ammonia.

The release would extend beyond the property boundary.\n\n\n\nAlternative Scenario - The RMP regulations require that an alternate scenario be determined that is more likely to occur than the worst case scenario.  The alternate release is also required to reach an endpoint offsite, unless no such scenario exists. Shamrock Foods Company, in the HazOp study conducted to satisfy the Risk Management and Prevention Program, identified a \"most likely\" scenario as a 3,960 lbs released from a ruptured, leaking, or vandalized pipe over 10 minutes.  This release scenario satisfies the criteria for the Alternate Toxic Gas Release.\n\n\n\nThe distance to the endpoint of 200 ppm ERPG-2 Type for the alternate case scenario is 0.2 miles.  This release would extend beyond the facility boundary.\n\n\n\nAll employees are trained on relevant response procedures.  There are written procedures for the use, inspection, maintenance and testing of emergency response equipment.  The plan also includes evacuation routes, protective actions for uninvolved employees, a method of accounting for employees, and a list of personal protective equipment for response and mitigation equipment.\n\n\n\n4.The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps.\n\n\n\nThis accidental release prevention program uses recommended guidelines of the International Institute of Ammonia , applicabl"

The Ammonia accident involved Hansen Type HS4A automatic control valve suffering a fracture at a factory weld associated with a stainless solenoid bonnet.  The incident occurred on March 27, 2011 at 8:30am.  Approximately 217 lbs were release over the 65 minute duration of the accident before being controlled by the ammonia system maintenance technician.\n\n\n\n6.The emergency response program.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the Emergency Action Plan described in paragraph 1, plans for evacuation to ensure that the evacuation procedure is adequately addressed and the needs for drills will be assessed. This emergency response program was established in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.38(a) and includes procedures for handling small releases. \n\n\n\n7.Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n\n\nThis facility is in the process of conducting an independent audit to ensure that all elements of the program are being met as required and documented."
