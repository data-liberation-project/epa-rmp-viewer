Regular inspections and maintenance are required on all storage facilities, loading and unloading facilities, application equipment and portable tanks.  Employees who handle anhydrous ammonia are required to attend bi-annual training which emphasize the properties of anhydrous ammonia, the effects of anhydrous ammonia on the human body, operating procedures, emergency procedures, and emergency first aid.  PPE, including gloves, goggles, hard hats, emergency water, and sturdy work clothes & shoes are required whenever handling anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, this facility is prepared to work with local fire departments, LEPC, law enforcement, or other authorities to mitigate the impact of the release to people and the environment.  \n\n\n\nFACILITY INFORMATION:\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received by truck and kept in storage tanks until distributed to customers in mobile nurse tanks for use as a nitrogen fertilizer.  The storage tanks, several anhydrous ammonia nurse tanks, risers for filling the nurse tanks, pumps and controls, lighting and safety equipment are all part of the facilities anhydrous ammonia operation.  The facility is staffed during seasonal operating hours and is secured when not in operation.  Security includes area lighting, closing and locking the main valve (belly valve) from the storage tank(s), locking out power to pumps, closing fill hose end valves and locking them in a box that prevents unauthorized access to them, locking nurse tank unloading valves, and walk-thru inspections.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\n\nThis facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., the standards of the U.S. Occupation"
