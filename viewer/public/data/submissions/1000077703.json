This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our objective is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control, contain and mitigate the release.\r\n\r\nAnchorage Chemical Terminal (ACT), a chemical terminal for the storage and distribution of chemicals products, is owned by Exxon Mobil Corporation (ExxonMobil) and operated by Intercontinental Terminals Company, LLC (ITC).  ACT follows ExxonMobil's structured safety management system entitled Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS).\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Anchorage Chemical Terminal employs 30 associates who live and work in the Port Allen, LA and surrounding areas.  In business at the same location since 1977, the company is a bulk storage/distribution facility for LPG-like chemicals.  Butadiene is shipped to companies around the United States, who in turn use the chemical to manufacture products like tires, automotive parts, roofing materials, wire and cable coating, etc.  Propylene, which is shipped primarily to local users, is a key ingredient to produce plastic and rubber products.  \r\n\r\nACT is a storage and shipping/receiving facility.  The chemicals typically stored or handled onsite on a day to day basis exceeding the ARP threshold quantities include 1,3-Butadiene, Crude Butadiene, Chemical Grade Propylene, and Dilute Propylene.  ACT occasionally handles Isobutylene in quantities that ex"

ACT contains a total of 5 covered processes for the purposes of this plan.\r\n\r\nACT receives chemicals via ship, barge, tank car, tank truck, or pipeline and are transferred to commerce via ship, barge, tank car, tank truck, or pipeline.  Isobutylene in quantities exceeding threshold is occasionally off-loaded directly from ships to tank cars.  1,3-Butadiene (stabilized), BRCP Offspec Green Oil, Mixed Butylenes, and Crude Isoprene are on site occasionally and are unloaded from tank cars into the Crude Butadiene storage unit (Sphere 697) and transferred out via pipeline as a Crude Butadiene mixture.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Anchorage Chemical Terminal.  EPA's Program 3 prevention requirements were implemented because the covered process at the terminal meet Program 3 criteria and are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  In addition, Anchorage Chemical Terminal has implemented Operations Integrity Management Systems (OIMS) that includes the aspects of EPA's prevention program.  Further, OIMS has been attested as equivalent to ISO 14001 as a valid management system to oversee the implementation of the risk management activities.\r\n\r\nAdditional details are included in the Data Element section of the RMP plan. Due to the ongoing nature of our safety program, the dates associated with the various activities in our accident prevention program are constantly changing.  We selected March 1, 2019 as the benchmark for last activity conducted.  Consequently, most of the reviews/updates conducted after that date are not reflected in the Data Element information.\r\n\r\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\r\n\r\nThe Anchorage Chemical Terminal encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling operating"

Employees have access to all information created as part of the terminal accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the terminal and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the terminal has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the site, including operations, maintenance, Safety, Health, Environmental, and Security staff, and plant management.\r\n\r\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\r\nThe Anchorage Chemical Terminal keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific individuals within the terminal are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  Process safety reference documents and their location are readily available as part of the OIMS information documentation to help employees locate any necessary information.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDS).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns.

The terminal ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems, alarm systems).\r\n\r\nThe terminal also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nThe Anchorage Chemical Terminal has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nThe Anchorage Chemical Terminal primarily uses the Knowledge Based Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study that is an adaptation by ExxonMobil Research and Engineering and ExxonMobil Chemical of widely used industry methodologies to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating experience and engineering expertise on the process to be evaluated.  This PHA team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when appropriate.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution.

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years for the life of the process.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  The team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nOPERATING PROCEDURES AND SAFE WORK PRACTICES\r\n\r\nThe Anchorage Chemical Terminal maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) startup, (2) shutdown, (3) normal and (4) emergency operations.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a consistent basis for training of new operators.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.\r\n\r\nThe terminal has identified Consequences of Deviation; i.e. documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters such as temperature, pressure, and level.

New employees receive basic training in terminal operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with an experienced operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After employees demonstrate (e.g. through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operations personnel periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTRACTORS\r\n\r\nThe Anchorage Chemical Terminal uses contractors to supplement its workforce.   Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the terminal has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5)"

This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Anchorage Chemical Terminal evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Terminal personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\r\nPRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEWS (PSSR'S)\r\n\r\nThe Anchorage Chemical Terminal conducts a PSSR for any facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information and therefore, is controlled by management of change (MOC).  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\r\n\r\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\r\n\r\nThe Anchorage Chemical Terminal has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.

Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g. adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or an MOC team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\r\n\r\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Anchorage Chemical Terminal incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHot Work\r\n\r\nThe Anchorage Chemical Terminal has a work permit system in place to protect personnel, site facilities, and the surrounding community.  The purpose of the work permit system is to ensure that jobs are planned, equipment is prepared, personnel are informed of hazards and procedures, precautions are taken, and work is executed in a manner to protect safety, health, and the environment.  The permit system covers hot work and other categories of work such as opening equipment, excavation, lifting and confined spaces.\r\n\r\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\r\n\r\nThe Anchorage Chemical Terminal has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.

Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training before the change is implemented.\r\n\r\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\r\n\r\nThe Anchorage Chemical Terminal promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to terminal management for resolution.  The resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHA's or PHA revalidations.\r\n\r\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Anchorage Chemical Terminal periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.

The resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe processes at the Anchorage Chemical Terminal have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all covered processes at the Anchorage Chemical Terminal.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) equipment failures and (2) human errors.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, the Anchorage Chemical Terminal has safety features to help (1) quickly detect a release, (2) contain/control a release and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used:\r\n\r\n\r\nRELEASE DETECTION\r\n\r\n1.\tHydrocarbon detectors with alarms\r\n2.\tClosed circuit TV surveillance cameras\r\n\r\nRELEASE CONTAINMENT/CONTROL\r\n1. Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\r\n2.\tValves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\r\n3.\tAutomated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high level, high temperature)\r\n4.\tCurbing or diking to contain liquid releases\r\n5.\tRedundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g. backup firewater pump)\r\n6.\tAtmospheric relief devices\r\n\r\nRELEASE MITIGATION\r\n1.\tFire suppression and extinguishing systems\r\n2.\tDeluge system for specific equipment\r\n3.\tTrained emergency response personnel\r\n4.\tPersonal protective equipment (e.g., protective clothing, self-contained  breathing apparatus)\r\n5.\tBlast-resistant buildings to help protect personnel\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nThe Anchorage Chemical Terminal has a very good record of safe operations.

The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the Anchorage Chemical Terminal has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated based on modifications made to terminal facilities.  The emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response program for the Anchorage Chemical Terminal is coordinated with ExxonMobil's ELIRT team and the West Baton Rouge Parish Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Anchorage Chemical Terminal has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., Port Allen Fire and Sheriff's Departments).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident as well as facilitating"
