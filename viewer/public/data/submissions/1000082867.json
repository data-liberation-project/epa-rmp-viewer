The owners, management and employees of Acme Supply Company are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Saline County LEPC and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the public and the environment.\n\n\n\n2.    Facility information. The primary activity at the facility is the storage and distribution of products to farmers. The fertilizer product, anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and is distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production.

Emergency Response Program. The facility has a written Emergency Action Plan in accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38. We do not plan to have our employees respond to a major release. If a large release of anhydrous ammonia takes place at our facility, the response action is to evacuate the area of the spill and call 933 and all applicable emergency response numbers listed in our Emergency Action Plan.\n\n\n\n6.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety. Safety improvement is an on-going process at this facility. Periodic evaluati"
