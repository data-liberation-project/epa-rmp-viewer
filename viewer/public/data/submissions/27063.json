Our business was consolidated May 29, 1999 with a major world known company United Agri Products.  While Anhydrous Ammonia is recognized to have dangerous characteristics, we have chosen a contractor to handle the product that is an expert in managing this product.  Our community may be subject to some exposure under a total catastrophic release, but the danger is mitigated by the amount of time that the product is on-site.  For over 20 years, we, as well as the contractor have proven Anhydrous Ammonia can be stored and transferred safely.  The community has not been subjected to any exposure as a result of a release of ammonia vapor.  The contractor's equipment is well maintained and equipped with all standard safety devices the ammonia industry requires.  While we do not anticipate a release, we have an emergency action plan filed with the local emergency planning committee, the local fire department, and the local Sheriff's Department.  We maintain an open dialogue with the LEPC and fire department and encourage them to attend a training seminar at our business, so they are familiar with the process.  Our company has administrative Environmental and Regulatory employee, knowledgable about the anhydrous ammonia storage facilities and will assist with any emergency information from remote areas of the United States if required.  Our employees, along with the contractor, the community LEPC, local law enforcement, local fire department and state regulatory agencies are in position to reduce the threat of anhydrous ammonia from reaching the community or residential neighbors.  We are committed to protect the general public from the risks associated with the anhydrous ammonia industry and to assure the public and our employees that safety is foremost a UAP Southwest in Brownfield, Texas.\n\n2.

      "SummaryText": "usiness.  We supply agriculture products to the local farmers who use these valuable products to produce food and fiber from the land for the benefit of families in the United States and beyond.  We mix fertilizer to provide balanced and valuable nutrients to the crops in this region of West Texas.  Along with the fertilizer products, we also sell a variety of crop protection chemicals and seed.  \nIn addition to having well maintained equipment and trained employees, our business has an emergency response plan.  Our emergency response plan has been distributed to the Local Emergency Planning Committee, the local Fire Department and the Local Law Enforcement Agency.  We are prepared to respond quickly and efficiently to mitigate any uncontrolled release of anhydrous ammonia.  Our plan includes (1) a  procedure for informing the public and local entities about accidental releases (2) procedures to be used on site to respond to an accidental release; and (3) a description of the employee training used to educate employees regarding emergency situations.  Our company will continue to work side by side with each agency, so they can assist our company in alerting the commnity of any release inside the established end point zone perimeter.  The sparse population works nicely into our mitigation plan\n\n3.  Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe worst case scenario release would be when a rail car is filled to the allowable filling density for anhydrous ammonia.  The capacity of the rail car sitting on the rail spur  is 131,325 pounds.  The maximum offsite concentrations are associated with a dense gas plume which slumps to the ground and travels downwind.  In this worst case, though highly unlikely, a rail car upset could allow the entire 131,325 pounds of product to exit the rail car and enter the atmosphere and impact the ground in 10 minutes.  Utilizing conservative information from look up tables as a source to determine the impact distance"

      "SummaryText": ", we assume that all released liquid ammonia will become a gas or entrained in the gas.  Some portion of the ammonia will rain out as a liquid or spill on the ground, which reduces the vapor mass.  In this scenario, we assume the entire contents is a vapor.  Using acceptable scientifically developed look up tables, anhydrous ammonia will likely disperse and travel a proportional distance related to the total quantity when released and when the quantity is known.  The look up tables, which are used and readily accepted by our industry, determine that the vapor mass would be diluted to a safe 200 parts per million in air within 2 miles from the point of release.  \n\n4.  The Alternative Worst Case Scenario \n\nThis scenario is based not only on our five year history without having any deaths, injuries, or property damage at the facility, but many years of safety at this facility.  We are proud of our long-standing record of accident or incident  free record and expect this trend to continue.  In spite of having a stellar record, there remains the risk that a transfer hose may split when pumping off to the reactor.  Again, referring to the data from look up charts, prepared by experts, it has been determined that certain sized hoses used to transfer ammonia will release anhydrous ammonia product at a given rate during the upset.  In this Alternative Worst Case Scenario, if the transfer hose is broken or ruptured, the release of 7,127 pounds of anhydrous ammonia could occur in 2 minutes.  We believe our emergency response plan will have the release controlled in less time than two minutes.  Given the size of release from the source, it is expected to impact a portion of .40 mile radius, depending on wind direction, before the dilution of ammonia vapor in air is reduced to 200 parts-per-million concentration.  \n"
