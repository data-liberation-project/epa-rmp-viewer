(FTC&H) has been retained by Marysville Hydrocarbons to assist in updating and resubmiting a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for their facility located at 2510 Busha Highway, Marysville, Michigan. Marysville Hydrocarbons is the owner of Marysville Gas Liquids Company (MGL)located in Marysville, Michigan. MGL along with it?s partner ENCANA Midstream Ltd. owns St. Clair Underground Storage. St. Clair Underground Storage dba Marysville Underground Storage Terminal (MUST). MUST consists of ten underground caverns for the storage of liquid hydrocarbons; propane, and butane. Inbound and outbound deliveries are accomplished by tank truck, rail car, and connections to multiple liquid product pipelines. MGL is responsible for operating and maintaining the MUST facility.\n\nAs required in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Clean Air Act Risk Management Program rules listed in 40 CFR Part 68, this document contains information intended to analyze the impacts of an accidental release of an extremely hazardous substance and to highlight the steps the facility is taking to prevent a release from occurring. The intent of the rule is to reduce the likelihood of a chemical release and the consequences of a release if one were to occur. The materials stored at MUST are highly flammable and a sufficient quantity is present such that the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68 (RMP) apply. Specifically, MUST stores propane (LPG) and butane in quantities exceeding these thresholds. In addition, ethyl mercaptan, which is added to the propane as an odorant, is stored in quantities exceeding the threshold. In certain cases, toxic compounds (i.e., hydrogen sulfide, methyl mercaptan) are present as contaminants in the products but none of the toxics exceed the threshold quantity. Therefore, three processes (LPG storage and handling; butane storage and handling and ethyl mercaptan storage and handling) with flammable substances are subject to RMP requirement"

      "SummaryText": "s.\n\nThe facility is also subject to the Occupational Health and Safety Association (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) program. Modeling results indicate the worst case release would cause an offsite impact. Due to these factors, MUST is subject to Program 3 requirements under 40 CFR Part 68.\n\nMUST is committed to employee and public safety. Policies have been established to implement the requirements of this RMP in accordance with the EPA regulations under 40 CFR Part 68 and with the corresponding regulations under the PSM program and adhere to applicable federal, state, and local laws. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as the training of personnel and consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the processes. MUST policies are intended to prevent releases of substances. If a release does occur, the operating personnel, supplemented by the local fire department, will respond to control the effects of the release and to evacuate potentially affected personnel if needed.\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) conducted by the facility helps to identify potential problems before they occur. This process allows for participation of employees and identification of opportunities for improvement at the plant. The most recent PHA conducted by the plant identified no major deficiencies in either system. The PHA did not identify an impending release of either chemical based on the operation or maintenance of the systems.\n\nAs described in the training section of the PSM document, each employee with job responsibilities associated with the storage, handling, or use of propane, butane, or ethyl mercaptan is thoroughly trained or otherwise deemed competent in the work procedures relevant to their responsibilities. Employee participation is also a key component of the successful implementation of the PSM program at MUST.\n\nThe hazard analysis performed for the facility also includes a review "

During the past five years, MUST has not had an accidental release that met the criteria of 40 CFR 68.42(a). \n\nMUST has been actively involved in emergency response planning. They have worked closely with the St. Clair County Local Emergency Management Agency to develop standard operating procedures (SOPs) for offsite response. MUST is a Program 3 source and a nonresponding facility. The MUST Emergency Action Plan outlines procedures for internal response to incidental releases and notification and coordination with the local emergency response organizations in the event of an incidental release which cannot be contained and will have offsite impacts."
