Facility Policy.\n \n The owners, management and employees of Ag Chem Service/ Fletcher Grain Company at Blackburn, MO. (the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of  anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.  \n \n2. Facility Information.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  It is stored in two tanks, one at 12,000 gallons and 30,000 gallons capacity. The maximum amount stored is 178,500 pounds.\n\n\n3.    Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\na.    The worst-case scenario would be the release of the contents of the total contents of the largest tank as a gas over a period of 10 minutes.  the maximum quantity released would be 127,500 pounds and represents the volume of that tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is 2.4 miles.\n\nb.    The alternate release scenario, based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident), is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.2 miles\n\n4.    Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of the Us Occupational, Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard, 29 CFR 1910.11, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  That standard is referenced in the Registration Form Section 8.3.b.\n\n5.    Five-Year Accident History.        \n\nThere have"

Emergency Response Program.\n\n    The facility has:\n\n    a.    a written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb.    provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\n    c.    a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard \n29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  \n\nThere are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time.
