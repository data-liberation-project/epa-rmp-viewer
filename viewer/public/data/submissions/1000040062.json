(Publix) Lakeland Facility is located at 3045 New Tampa Highway, Lakeland, Polk County, Florida.  Publix requires each facility to develop and maintain accident prevention programs and an emergency response plan appropriate to the site.  Each site is also responsible for regulatory compliance issues that apply to the site.  A site PSM Coordinator is appointed to facilitate compliance.  Publix' corporate environmental and safety personnel provide assistance in training for site employees and in budgeting and procurement of safety and environmental training services.\n\n\n\n2. Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe Publix Lakeland Facility is located south of Interstate I-4 in the western portion of the city of Lakeland, Polk County, Florida.  The facility consists of a milk and ice cream manufacturing plant, a bakery facility, produce and deli meats plant(DelPro) and a freezer/dairy building dedicated to frozen and dairy/box meat storage.  These represent four separate anhydrous ammonia refrigeration systems, and all four exceed the 10,000 lb. RMP threshold quantity.  The four ammonia refrigeration systems' equipment is located in each of four machine or compressor rooms or on associated equipment docks.    \n\n\n\n3. Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThis facility's four refrigeration systems exceed the ammonia threshold quantity for the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, 1910.119, and are all therefore subject to the PSM requirements.  For RMP compliance purposes, this places all four of the Lakeland Facility's refrigeration processes in the Program 3 level.  The Lakeland Facility uses its PSM program as the required Program 3 Prevention Program.  Also, in 2001 Publix appointed an individual dedicated solely to the position of PSM Coordinator of the PSM/RMP program at Lakeland.\n\n\n\nThe Lakeland Facility has a program in place to comply with the OSHA Process Safety Ma"

      "SummaryText": "nagement Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  The PSM Program was established in October 1994 for the three exisiting  ammonia processes. Prior to startup of the Freezer/Dairy ammonia process in July 2001, a PSM program was established.  The PSM Program includes a preventative maintenance plan which requires all ammonia refrigeration equipment to be periodically inspected and serviced.  This will ensure that the equipment remains in good operating condition and will minimize the probability of accidents due to faulty equipment.  In developing the PSM Program, the Lakeland Facility also developed written operating procedures for the refrigeration process.  These procedures cover all phases of operation and include information on safety devices.  These procedures are used to train all operators and mechanics who work on the ammonia refrigeration processes to ensure consistency of operation and minimize human error. These measures ensure that all refrigeration operators and mechanics are properly trained.  Other safe work practices such as Lockout/Tagout and Hot Work Permit ensure that all non-routine work can be performed safely.  Other components of the prevention program include collection and review of all equipment information, the maintenance of updated Piping & Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs), and the correction of any equipment design deficiencies found.  These actions will ensure that the equipment meets all refrigeration industry standards and that accurate equipment information will be available when needed.  The staff also has performed PHAs of these processes as required. Other PSM procedures, including Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Compliance Audits, and Incident Investigation are also part of the program to ensure continued safe operation and prompt correction of deficiencies.  The PSM Program receives full support of plant management and involvement of employees at all levels.\n\n\n\n4. Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe Lakeland Facility has had "

Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe Lakeland Facility has an Emergency Response Plan for Ammonia in place.  The site has internal emergency response capability and has developed a program to comply with paragraph (q) of 29 CFR 1910.120.  The current plan has been coordinated with the City of Lakeland's Fire Department and the Polk County Hazardous Materials Response Team, and the Local Emergency Planning Committee.  Notification is made locally by dialing 911, and by notifying Florida State Warning Point at (800) 320-0519.\n\n\n\n6.
