The                \n    facility manufactures fiberglass building insulation which is sold in the commercial,               \n    residential, and retail markets.  The facility currently encompasses approximately                  \n    701,250 square feet under roof and is set in 478 acres of rural area.  There are presently          \n    about 375 full time employees who operate the Plant 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.                \n                                                                                                        \n    Johns Manville places a strong emphasis on safety and environmental leadership.  The                \n    Company fosters a proactive philosophy to ensure that employees work in a safe                      \n    environment and that each facility remains in full compliance with all applicable federal,          \n    state, county and local regulations.  JM is also committed to environmental leadership              \n    within the community served.  This commitment is exemplified in the Willows Facilitys              \n    strong recycling and waste minimization program development.  The Companys long                    \n    term goal is to have zero process wastes taken to disposal facilities, with all residual            \n    materials either recycled or used for beneficial purposes.                                          \n                                                                                                        \n    The facility maintains a good working relationship with all federal, state, county and              \n    local agencies.

The facility               \n    exceeds the qualifying threshold of 15,000 pounds of this material onsite for a single              \n    process.                                                                                            \n                                                                                                        \n    Liquid resin solution containing formaldehyde (above 1% mixture) is delivered to the                \n    facility via truck transport.  Resin solution is stored in cold storage until it is mixed with      \n    water and other materials to make a binder solution (less than 1% formaldehyde) which is            \n    applied to fiberglass.  This binder solution is applied in the fiberglass manufacturing             \n    process as a low VOC binder which acts to bind glass fibers.  The formaldehyde                      \n    containing resin solution is stored as a liquid in numerous storage tanks (ranging in size          \n    from 4,500 to 6,000 gallon maximum capacity) located inside the facility.

In         \n    addition, the resin storage room is maintained at 50 degrees F to reduce the volatility of          \n    the material.  Although not a qualifying mitigation measure for the 112R program, low               \n    storage temperatures give plant personnel adequate time to react to the situation by                \n    reducing the volatilization rate of the resin material.  As a result of these factors, Johns        \n    Manville has not experienced an accidental release of formaldehyde over the entire life of          \n    the facility.

Under a worst-case scenario, a single vessel containing                \n    6,000 gallons of liquid resin, which includes about 12.0% formaldehyde, is assumed to               \n    spill with complete indoor containment in the resin room and adjacent water room.                   \n    Distance to the toxic endpoint of 12.0 mg/m3 is calculated for Willows using AFTOX, a               \n    dispersion model that will determine toxic chemical concentrations at hazard distances.             \n    According to AFTOX, a worst-case resin spill and subsequent formaldehyde vaporization               \n    onsite at Willows will result in a distance of 0.06 miles to the toxic endpoint.  A plant and       \n    topographic map analysis indicates that 0.06 miles from the location of the resin tank is           \n    completely onsite.
