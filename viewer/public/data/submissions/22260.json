It is MAP Garyville Refinery's policy that in the conduct of its activities it will strive to protect and promote the health and safety of its employees, customers, and others who may be affected by these activities, and to limit adverse effects on the physical environment in which its activities are carried out.  As part of this policy, the MAP Garyville Refinery has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One part of these systems is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the MAP Garyville Refinery and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) rule 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements:  Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule), and the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality regulation (LAC 33:III.Chapter.59).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at the MAP Garyville Refinery.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan executive summary requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the MAP Garyville Refinery.  An initial RMPlan for the Garyville Refinery was submitted to EPA in June 1999.  In accordance with 40 CFR 68.190, the refinery's RMPlan is being revised to address a new storage service for the refrigerated storage vessels in Unit 66.  These refrigerated vessels currently store butane; however, the service will be changed to allow for butane or a flammable mixture of olefins after submittal of this RMP revision.  For this reason,"

In addition, this RMP revision is including a modification that will increase the quantity of the RMP flammable mixture in Unit 14.\n\n\n\n1.1    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe MAP Garyville Refinery has a long-standing commitment to the safety of the general public, of the MAP Garyville Refinery employees and to the preservation of the environment.  One primary portion of this commitment is the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances in and around the refinery.  The MAP Garyville Refinery utilizes engineering controls, inspection programs, and detailed procedures as a means to prevent accidental releases.  In the event of a release, the refinery has well trained emergency response teams to contain, mitigate, monitor, and stop the release.  The refinery has fully staffed and trained emergency response teams for fire fighting (VERT), medical emergencies (RESCUE), and for ambient air monitoring (Air Monitoring Team).  In addition to handling the release, the refinery has also established a wide variety of communication systems to alert the community in the event of a significant release.  In conjunction with our local emergency planning commission (LEPC), the refinery has the ability to notify the local community through cable override systems, radio broadcasts, and/or through an automated telephone notification system (FirstCall).\n\n\n\nThe MAP Garyville Refinery Division Manager has overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the risk management program for EPA?regulated processes at division facilities.  However, the specific responsibilities for certain aspects of that program have been delegated to other personnel who report either directly, or through other management personnel, to the Division Manager.  Those relationships are depicted on the division organization chart.  Specific responsib"

Similarly, responsibility for the RMP hazard assessment and risk management plan has been delegated to the Division Environmental and Safety Manager.  The division's emergency response program, including compliance with the RMP aspects of that effort, is the responsibility of the Division Environmental and Safety Manager.  In keeping with our policy that safe operation is part of everyone's job, many other division personnel are also involved in RMP activities on an ongoing basis.\n\n\n\n1.2    MAP Garyville Refinery Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe MAP Garyville Refinery is a full range refinery and petroleum products facility located in Garyville, Louisiana.  The MAP Garyville Refinery uses crude petroleum as their feed material and makes a variety of petroleum-based products, including gasoline, diesel fuel, and liquefied petroleum gases such as propane and butane.  Many of these products are flammable substances that EPA has specifically listed in the RMP rule and are present in our process units above the EPA threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.  In total, the MAP Garyville Refinery has 26 process units that are covered by the RMP rule because of their flammable process materials.  Although 27 processes are listed in the RMP, there are 26 processes at the refinery covered under the RMP.  The additional process is due to two storage scenarios identified for Unit 66.  These covered units are listed in the RMP data included with this summary (Section 1.17 of the RMP Data Elements).\n\n\n\nThe MAP Garyville Refinery also handles one toxic substance regulated by the RMP rule in a sufficient quantity to be covered by the RMP rule:\n\n\n\n?    Hydrofluoric acid is used as a catalyst in the HF Alkylation unit which produces gasoline.\n\n\n\nThe HF Alkylation Unit is covered because the unit contains more than the threshold quantity"

The offsite consequence analysis consisted of evaluating both worst-case scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  The MAP Garyville Refinery does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility like the MAP Garyville Refinery. Alternative release scenarios can be used to help the LEPC improve the community emergency response plan.  We have submitted release scenario analyses to EPA and have shared that information with the LEPC and other organizations involved in emergency response activities.  It is also available to local residents and businesses.\n\n\n\nThe paragraphs below briefly describe some of the scenarios we analyzed and are the scenarios for which we have included detailed information in our risk management plan.  Please recognize that none of these events have occurred at our facility.  Also, for some of these events, we have emergency mitigation systems that should help reduce the consequences of the events if they occurred.  In all cases, if such events occurred, we would actuate our emergency response plan to respond to the event, notify local authorities, and take appropriate actions to protect both our employees and people in the community.\n\n\n\nIf you are interested in this information, please contact the receptionist at the MAP Garyville Refinery at (504) 535-2241 and ask for the Environmental and Safety Manager.\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario associated with the toxic substances in RMP-covered processes at the refinery is a failure from the hydrofluoric (HF) acid settler/acid storage in the HF Alkylation Unit.  If such a failure released th"

As specified by the EPA, this analysis assumes that all of the HF acid is released to the air and no credit is taken for the operation of our HF acid vapor mitigation system (i.e., a water spray system to reduce the amount of vapor that leaves the unit if released). \n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario associated with a release of flammable substances in RMP-covered processes at the refinery is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank containing butane with the greatest distance to the endpoint.  The analysis assumes that the maximum possible inventory of 4,600,000 pounds is released, completely vaporizes, and ignites, resulting in a VCE.  Because there are some public receptor locations just outside the refinery property, this event could affect members of the public at those closest locations.  Although the MAP Garyville Refinery has numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this worst-case scenario as specified by the EPA.  \n\n\n\nThere are no Program 1 processes at the refinery, therefore, no additional worst-case analyses are reported for such processes.  Also, the MAP Garyville Refinery did not identify any worst-case scenarios that would affect public receptors other than the receptors affected by the scenarios reported above.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nThe MAP Garyville Refinery analyzed numerous release scenarios for toxic materials.  The single alternative toxic release scenario we are reporting as part of the risk management plan involves a release of HF acid from a drain valve failure on the Rerun Tower in the Alkylation Unit.  This would result in a release of 8,248 pounds of HF acid in the tim"

Because the HF acid release would be accompanied by hydrocarbon material, it was assumed the existing atmospheric hydrocarbon monitors would detect the event.  We also took credit in the analysis for the water deluge system that would reduce the amount of HF vapor that would leave the unit.  However, the analysis indicated that the resulting HF vapor cloud could result in toxic exposures to people outside the refinery boundary.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario in our risk management plan for flammable substances at the refinery is a VCE resulting from the release of a flammable mixture from the failure of the compressor discharge piping in our Light Gas Oil Unit (Unit 14).  The piping failure would release 453,092 pounds of flammable material in the time required to isolate the release.  The analysis assumed that all of this material would be involved in a VCE and showed that the resulting overpressure from the explosion would affect public receptor locations outside the refinery.\n\n\n\nAs stated previously, we have included details regarding these scenarios in the additional information submitted to EPA with this executive summary and have shared that information with the LEPC, other organizations involved in emergency planning and members of the local community.

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA), incident investigation, and compliance audit teams.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the MAP Garyville Refinery's accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the MAP Garyville Refinery and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the MAP Garyville Refinery has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include teams which promote both process and personal safety, such as the monthly Health and Environmental Safety (HES) meetings with management and hourly employees and the Behavior Based Safety (BBS) Program.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe MAP Garyville Refinery keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.

In addition, the MAP Garyville Refinery operating procedures provide guidance on how to respond to events that result in exceeding safe operating limits for specific process or equipment parameters.  The written operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the MAP Garyville Refinery has implemented a training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in the MAP Garyville Refinery operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted every 3 years.  Operators are given the opportunity to take part in more frequent refresher training if desired.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe MAP Garyville Refinery uses contractors to supplement its work force throughout the year, as "

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the MAP Garyville Refinery has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the operation manuals for each process unit.  The MAP Garyville Refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, operating procedures, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nThe MAP Garyville Refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nThe MAP Garyville Refinery has a comprehensive PHA program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.

The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the MAP Garyville Refinery periodically conducts audits to confirm the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  These audits are led by a third party contractor with assistance by the MAP Garyville Refinery employees as required.  The findings are forwarded to the MAP Garyville Refinery management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings will be tracked in the IITS until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\n\n\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe processes at the MAP Garyville Refinery have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all EPA RMP-covered processes at the MAP Garyville Refinery.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios of both hydrofluoric acid and flammable substances caused by equipment failures or human errors.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, the MAP Garyville Refinery has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\n\n\n\nRelease Detection\n\n\n\n?    Hydrogen"

This incident involved a release of a small amount of hydrofluoric acid (approximately 3 ounces) in the Alkylation Unit (Unit 27), which was contained on site.  On February 10, 2000 at approximately 12:30 P.M., residual hydrofluoric acid in a nitrogen hose, which is used for purging equipment, splashed on an op"

The MAP Garyville Refinery notified the Louisiana State Police and the Civil Defense.  The nitrogen hose was decontaminated and packaged for disposal.  As a result, refinery personnel were reminded of the proper personal protective equipment to be worn while performing these types of tasks and personnel were refreshed on proper sequence of closing valves.  \n\n\n\n1.6    Emergency Response Program Information\n\n\n\nThe MAP Garyville Refinery maintains a written Emergency Response Plan (ERP), which aims to protect employees, public health, and the environment.  The purpose of the ERP is to minimize the impact on the refinery and surrounding areas in the event of an emergency situation.  The plan consists of procedures for responding to such emergencies as fires, explosions, hazardous gas or liquid releases, natural disasters, and bomb threats.  The plan addresses all aspects of emergency response including responsibilities of the Emergency Response Team, coordination of clean-up activities with mutual aid organizations (fire department, sheriff's office, hospital), timely notification of authorities, maintenance of proper documentation, and guidelines for compliance with applicable government regulations.  Furthermore, the MAP Garyville Refinery has procedures that address proper use, maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment.  All employees receive annual safety and process control training to instruct them in proper emergency response procedures.  The Emergency Response Team participates in additional training sessions so that they can safely handle potential emergency situations.\n\n\n\nThe overall ERP for the MAP Garyville Refinery is coordinated with the St. John the Baptist Parish LEPC.  This coordination includes agreements with other industrial sites for both equipment and personnel.  The organizat"

      "SummaryText": "ions form part of the MAP Garyville Refinery's Incident Command System (ICS), which permits all involved parties to work together safely and effectively in order to bring a favorable outcome to an emergency situation.  In addition, emergencies at the MAP Garyville Refinery are classified in one of three levels as specified by the ICS.  Level One emergencies involve minor incidents limited to the work site.  Level One emergencies include medical emergencies, minor leaks, and hazardous materials response for control and clean up of a small spill.  Level Two emergencies are serious incidents, which pose a moderate threat to the public and environment.  Level Two emergencies include fires requiring the Refinery Volunteer Emergency Response Team and/or standby or support from local fire departments, and large releases of hazardous materials.  Level Three emergencies are major incidents that pose a significant danger to employees, public health, and the environment.  Level Three emergencies include major fires and major releases of hazardous materials, which may require activation of the Community Alerting and Warning System.  This tiered system allows the MAP Garyville Refinery to effectively identify emergencies and hasten clean-up efforts. \n\n\n\nIn order to keep the plan up to date, the emergency response procedures are reviewed annually.  Necessary revisions are made and distributed to the plan holders by the Safety Department.  Affected personnel are trained on the changes in the ERP.\n\n\n\n1.7    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThe MAP Garyville Refinery constantly strives to improve the safety of its operations through periodic safety reviews, the incident investigation program, and a program soliciting safety suggestions from the workers.
