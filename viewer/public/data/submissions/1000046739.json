Rowan, IA.\r\n\r\nThis facility complies with ANSI Standard K-61.1-1989 requirements with amendments for Anhydrous Ammonia storage. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and local regulations. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately vacate the premises, move to a safe location, and notify the Rowan Volunteer Fire Department (via a 911 call) and request that it respond to the emergency. Incidental to the notification to the fire department, a call to the Region 5 Emergency Planning District will be made.\r\n\r\nWhile we have planned for an emergency, it is acknowledged that a real emergency will be unexpected and may very well be much different and cannot be ensured to duplicate what may have be planned. In reality, the situation that develops may not happen in the manner in which it has been planned. In that event, what may have been planned will serve only as a guideline to follow.\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility describes certain procedures that are intended to minimize the hazards associated with human health and the environment from fires, explosions, the sudden and unexpected release of chemicals (i.e., Anhydrous Ammonia), tornadoes, bomb threats or other accidents or acts of God which might occur on our premises.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE ANHYDROUS AMMONIA STORAGE/DISTRIBUTION PLANT AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED AT FARMERS COOPERATIVE COMPANY, ROWAN, IOWA:\r\n\r\nThis facility is a bulk anhydrous ammonia storage and distribution plant. The anhydrous ammonia that is stored at  this facility is distributed to agricultural crop producers in the surrounding area who utilize the anhydrous ammonia for crop nutrient purposes. \r\n\r\nThe system consists of a storage tank with associated piping, valves, liquid pump(s), and other miscellaneous equipment and an unidentified number of nurse tanks.

Finally, Farmers Cooperative Company has extended to the Rowan Volunteer Fire Department the opportunity to visit our anhydrous ammonia plant, to participate in mock emergency simulation training, and to avail themselves of specific anhydrous ammonia health hazard information and training provided by the company.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\r\n\r\nFarmers Cooperative Company, Rowan, Iowa has not had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia in the last five years that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in place.\r\n\r\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\r\n\r\nIn the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous ammonia system, it is the policy of Farmers Cooperative Company  to immediately notify the Rowan Volunteer Fire Department and the Region 5 Emergency Planning District to request that they respond to the emergency. In the unlikely event that the Rowan Fire Department is unable to adequately respond to an emergency at our Rowan location, the Volunteer Fire Department with whom Rowan has a reciprocal agreement will be summoned.
