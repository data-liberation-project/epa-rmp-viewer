Equistar is the site owner and operates one large process; Grace owns three of the site buildings and operates other processes. Equistar provides and manages a broad spectrum of services to Grace including Utilities, Maintenance, shipping/receiving/warehousing and Emergency Response (ER) for both companies. To the extent possible, all Emergency Response programs apply to all site operations and both Equistar and Grace are co-owners of these programs.\r\nThe accidental release prevention policy at the Edison site is documented in the Management System document. It includes all the required elements of RMP including maintaining Process Safety Information, Employee Participation, Process Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment, Standard Operating Procedures, Operator Training, Pre-startup Review, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work Permit, Management of Change,\r\nAccident Investigation, Emergency Response, Compliance Audits, Contractors and Inherently Safe Technology review.\r\nThe Edison site strives to maintain a safe working environment, it is therefore essential that employees beable to deal effectively with emergencies that may develop during course of operations. Therefore, a multifunctional\r\nER team (ERT) has been formed. The site ERT shall provide the actions necessary to control an emergency with the following priorities:\r\n1. To safeguard the lives of company personnel;\r\n2. To protect the well being of our visitors, contractors, truck drivers, neighbors and the community;\r\n3. To protect the environment;\r\n4.

Material Safety data Sheets for all hazardous materials stored at site are available to both site personnel and Edison township emergency responders through site Hazard Communication Program.\r\nb) The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\r\nThe Grace facility is covered by EPA-RMP and NJ-TCPA regulations due to the presence of Titanium Tetrachloride and Isopentane in above threshold quantities at the facility.\r\nc) The general accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps:\r\nSite release prevention and chemical specific prevention includes process safety equipment, mitigation systems, and leak detection equipment including preventative maintenance program covering such equipment, an operator training program, and a Management of Change procedure. All such equipment is owned, operated and maintained by Equistar as per contract; all such procedures and programs, however, are co-owned by both Equistar and Grace.\r\nProcess safety equipment used for both the regulated chemicals includes relief devices such as relief valves and rupture discs, vents, check valves, quench systems, automatic shutoffs, interlocks, grounding and purge systems.\r\nMitigation systems in the accidental release prevention program includes, dikes, sumps, sprinkler systems, deluge systems, water curtains, hazmat foam system, fire fighting foam systems, mineral oil dump system, neutralization and fire water containment sys"
