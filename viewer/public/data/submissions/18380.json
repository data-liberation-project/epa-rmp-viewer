      "SummaryText": "RMP DATA ELEMENT - Executive Summary\n\nPSO Riverside Power Station\n\nRiverside Power Station is a gas fueled power generating station in the Public Service Company of Oklahoma (PSO) subsidiary, which includes a total of six generating facilities located in Oklahoma. This site is located in Tulsa County in the city of Jenks, Oklahoma. The facility has 40 full time employees.\n\nPublic Service Company of Oklahoma (PSO) is an investor-owned utility. The company's common stock is held by Central and South West Corporation, a registered public holding company headquartered in Dallas, Texas and Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nThe facility is a two-unit power generation facility with a total generation of  approximately 900 mw.  It burns gas as the primary fuel and fuel oil in emergencies.  Unit 1 is a Westinghouse turbine with a Babcock and Wilcox boiler installed in 1974. Unit 2 is a General Electric turbine with a Babcock and Wilcox boiler installed in 1976.\n\nThe following information is part of a complete Risk Management Plan (RMP) that was prepared for the PSO Riverside Power Station outside of Tulsa, Oklahoma.  The information includes accident prevention and safety programs, emergency preparedness and response programs, chemical description, five year accidental release history, alternative release scenario and the worst case scenario.  The sharing of this type of information is a means to improve community safety, not a prediction of the probability that either a worst case or more likely scenario would ever occur.  These scenarios are estimates required by the Environmental Protection Agency and are used to illustrate the importance for risk reduction, safety, prevention and emergency preparedness and response.\n\nRiverside Power Station has been producing electricity for over 20 years. During this time, there has not been any chlorine release that adversely impacted the plant or the surrounding community.\n\nThe release scenarios, a worst case scenario and an alternative release scena"

A worst case scenario is defined as the complete release of the largest inventory of the chemical over 10 minutes under weather conditions that would allow the chemical to travel as far as possible.  The distance(s) used in this plan are from the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guide (April 1999). It also assumes that none of the site's mechanical controls or safety systems are operational for this theoretical exercise. However, the laws of physical science do not allow a complete release of the chemical as described in the worst case scenario.\n\nThe worst case scenario for Riverside Power Station involves a cylinder containing 2,000 pounds of chlorine. The entire quantity is released and vaporizes over a 10 minute period and the resulting vapor cloud travels down wind.  A level of concern to the community extends 1.3 miles down wind. \n\nGiven these unrealistic guidelines of a worst case scenario, more realistic scenarios or alternative release scenarios were also developed. These scenarios involve smaller releases and allow a site's safety systems to work.  The alternative release scenario may be used by local government and industry to prepare emergency response plans.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for the Riverside Power Station involves the failure of a one-fourth inch pigtail or similar connection releasing chlorine over a duration of 60 minutes. The resulting cloud extends 0.1 mile down wind.\n\nPSO's chlorinating systems are built and installed with safety controls designed to prevent accidental releases. Some of the typical safety equipment and systems used at the plant include:\n - Storage cylinders meeting American Society of Mechanical Engineering requirements\n - Automatic shut-off devices\n - Interlocks and relief valves\n - Specifically designed pressure gauges, fittings, connections"

This training includes emphasis on:\n - Specific safe work practices\n - Routine operating procedures\n - Audit and inspection procedures\n - Emergency operation including shut down\n - Alarms and emergency notification procedures.\n \n PSO has an established Preventative Maintenance Procedure specifically developed for the chlorination system. This procedure requires:\n - Periodic inspection and testing of all mechanical systems \n - Detailed documentation of all inspection and maintenance activity\n - Documentation of equipment deficiencies\n - Timely and appropriate repair of all deficiencies.\n \n A Process Safety Management System has been specifically developed for the chlorination system at this plant in compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Act Process Safety Management rule. This management system requires:\n - An initial and periodic analysis of engineering and administrative controls\n - Investigation procedures designed to resolve and correct potential incidents\n - Formal audits performed by trained individuals with knowledge of chlorination systems.\n \n All Plant personnel handling chlorine are specially trained. This training includes:\n - Emergency shutdown\n - Emergency operation of the chlorinator\n - Hazards of chlorine\n - Safety procedures to be followed during normal operations\n - Emergency Response Procedures\n - Notification procedures\n - Evacuation procedures.\n Periodic inspection of the equipment is mandatory. Repairs are required on all items identified as defective during inspections.\n \n If a release occurs, only trained Emergency Response Personnel will respond to assess and stop the leak. In all cases, necessary actions will be taken to control the release of chlorine.\n - The Plant Control Room will be notified immediately if a chlorine leak is detec"
