Describe Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\n\nClaxton Cold Storage prevents accidental releases through on the job training of refrigeration personnel and ongoing inspection and maintenance of the system.  New additions to the refrigeration system are located in areas that are not as likely to become damaged (i.e., pipes placed near ceilings, tanks placed away from forklift and truck traffic).\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies are designed to comply with OSHAs Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119) and EPAs Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68). \n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency action program is to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nB.    Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThis facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing capabilities for food products.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in this system is in excess of 10,000 lbs.  The ammonia inventory of this system is approximately 19,000 lbs.  Since ammonia releases from this system could pose a risk of offsite public impact and is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's RM program.\n\nThe higher pressure portions of the system include the condenser, located on the roof, along with refrigerant vent lines where any leaks can dissipate to the air, joining ammonia producted by lightning where it can be consumed as it goes through a natural biodegrading process.

Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe prevention program (OSHA Process Safety Management CFR 1910.119) consists of the following elements:\nEmployee Participation\nProcess Safety Information\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOperating Procedures\nTraining\nContractors\nPre-startup Safety Review\nMechanical Integrity\nHot Work Permit\nManagement of Change\nIncident Investigation\nEmergency Action Plan\nCompliance Audits\n\nD.    Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no reportable incidents in the past five years.\n\nE.   Description of the Emergency Response Program\n\nThis facility will call in local emergency personnel in the event of a significant ammonia release.  The facility is included in the community Emergency Response Program coordinated by the 24-Hour Warning LEPC: GEMA; 404-635-7200.\n\nF.   Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThis facility will continue to improve safety by continuing on-the-job training; PSM maintenance and maintaining a safe ammonia system."
