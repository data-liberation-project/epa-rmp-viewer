The purpose of this document is to provide instruction for Berggruen BioFuels Holdings, LLC* and its subsidiaries to prevent and/or minimize the consequences of unwanted and catastrophic releases of hazardous chemicals especially into locations that could expose employees and the surrounding communities to serious hazards. \nResponsibility ? Management is responsible for ensuring all aspects of the PSM/RMP program are implemented and carried out.  Supervisors and Employees must be familiar with and have an understanding of the hazards, operating procedures, safety systems, start-up procedures, shutdown procedures, training contractor involvement, maintenance, emergency planning, and emergency response.\n\nChange Notes ? \n\nRev. 01 ?05/20/2008 ?

The storage of flammable liquids in atmospheric tanks is exempt from coverage; however the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has indicated that accidents involving flammable liquids would be investigated under the general duty clause.  Manufacturing processes that store or use greater than 10,000 pounds of a flammable liquid are covered.  The distillation, dehydration and evaporation portion of the CGP process contains greater than 10,000 pounds of ethanol, a flammable substance. \n\nSolutions with ammonia content greater than 44 percent and in a quantity greater than 15,000 pounds are regulated under the PSM standard.  The facility is also subject to regulations under EPA RMP 40 CFR Part 68 (see below) and meets the Program 3 eligibility requirements.  One of the requirements of a facility subject to Program 3 is to conduct a PSM review of the covered process.\n\nRisk Management Plan (RMP)\n\nAccording to 40 CFR Part 68, a RMP is required for facilities that co"
