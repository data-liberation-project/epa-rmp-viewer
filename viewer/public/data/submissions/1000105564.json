This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system.  It is Lineage Logistics\u0092 policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  \nThe Program 3 at Lineage Logistics - Port of Stockton is a facility-run program with continuous support from Lineage Logistics \u0096 Safety and Compliance Department that includes Process Safety Management (PSM) Compliance and Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) Compliance. \n  \nStationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\nLineage Logistics - Port of Stockton is located at 2323 Port Road A, Stockton. California. The area immediately surrounding the facility is mostly urban with some industrial and residential areas.\nThe regulated substance handled at the facility is anhydrous ammonia.  The facility's primary activities revolve around large-scale public storage of food products.  All the ammonia inventory is used as a refrigerant.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nAs part of the implementation of the RMP Program, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by Lineage Logistics - Port of Stockton, which also serves to manage process safety issues associated with the use of anhydrous ammonia.  Furthermore, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  The regulated substance is over the 10,000-lbs. federal threshold for EPA RMP and OSHA PSM.   As a result, the anhydrous ammonia-covered process (ammonia refrigeration system) is subject to OSHA PSM and EPA Program 3.\nProgram 3 Prevention Program Elements include:"

Therefore, is not required to have an Emergency Response Plan (ERP).   An Emergency Action Plan (EAP) is in place to properly prepare for emergency evacuations, to provide first aid and medical treatment and to contact federal, state, and local officials in the event of a major release of ammonia.   \n\nThe Facility emergency response program is coordinated with the local responding units such as HAZMAT Team and the local (Stockton) Fire Department.  Detailed information can be found within the facility EAP which is located at the facility.  \nIn addition, the Facility has submitted a 2023 Hazardous Material Inventory (HMI) Business Plan via California Environmental Reporting System (CERS).  \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nSeveral studies have been conducted to examine mitigation measures to"
