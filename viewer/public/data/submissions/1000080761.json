      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\nThe Idaho Falls Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) uses compressed gaseous chlorine to disinfect final effluent to provide disinfected water discharges to the environment and irrigation uses. Storing large quantities of chlorine can be hazardous; therefore the WWTP takes its safety obligations in storing and using chlorine seriously. The following document describes what could happen in the event of an accident, the steps the WWTP takes every day to ensure safe operation, and what to do in event of an emergency. Please contact Carl Utter at 208-612-8108 if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe Idaho Falls WWTP and Idaho Falls Fire Department accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, trains staff on operation and maintenance practices, and uses tested management system practices. All applicable procedures of the State of Idaho and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures. \r\nThis document complies with the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP), under Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), Amendments of 1990 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68. This document summarizes the WWTP's existing health and safety programs, internal management response team, policies, procedures, and on-going actions that are designed to prevent or minimize impacts of accidental releases of chlorine to the environment. The WWTP has prepared a detailed and comprehensive emergency response plan to handle any potential accidental releases and which is designed to safeguard both on and off site people. To date, the WWTP has an excellent record in accident prevention.\r\n\r\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substances Information\r\n\r\nThe Idaho Falls WWTP is located at 4055 Glen Koester Road, City of Idaho Falls, Bo"

      "SummaryText": "nneville County, Idaho. The WWTP is on a 40 acre property about 3 miles south of the center of town and adjacent to Snake River. Wastewater from the Bonneville service area is treated at the WWTP, and the disinfected effluent is either discharged into the Snake River or to reclaimed irrigation uses. The WWTP is designed for 17 million gallons per day (MGD); 39,800 lbs/day BOD; and 44,750 lbs/day TSS.  It currently receives approximately 9.5 MGD; 15,000 lbs/day BOD; and 13,000 lbs/day TSS.\r\n\r\nThe WWTP currently stores chlorine gas; a regulated toxic substances under the RMP regulations. Chlorine is stored in twelve, 1-ton steel containers containing a maximum of 12 tons of chlorine. This chlorine storage exceeds the listed threshold quantities in both the RMP Rules and in the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Rules (29 CFR 1910.119). However, because Idaho is not an OSHA-regulated State, the Idaho Falls WWTP is not subject to the PSM Rules.\r\nChlorine is delivered to the WWTP in 1-ton containers. Current processes only allow gaseous chlorine to be withdrawn from the 1-ton containers. In both the Tank Room and the Chlorinator Room, chlorine leak detectors monitor continuously for chlorine leaks. In the event of a leak, the detectors sound an alarm at the plant control panel; additionally, the tank area has both an audible alarm and a flashing warning light inside and outside of the building. \r\nBoth the Tank and the Chlorinator Rooms are enclosed in the Chlorine Building. The Tank Room is equipped with an automatic chlorine scrubber ventilation system that automatically operates when chlorine is detected in the room. An emergency shower and eye wash station are provided on the outside of the building. Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) packs are available onsite in the Administration Building. As of 2019, brand new equipment had been purchased and plant operations staff thoroughly trained on the new equipment. Th"

Only one accident occurred that resulted in precautionary hospitalization of a worker after accidental exposure to chlorine gas.\r\nAppropriate investigation and documentation occurred in the event of those two events, and will occur in the event of any future reportable accidents. \r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program Summary\r\n\r\nThe WWTP has established a written Emergency Response Program (ERP) that employees follow to help them safely respond to accidental releases of hazardous substances. This program will be coordinated and reviewed by the City of Idaho Falls Fire Department, which is a member of the Local Emergency Response Planning Committee. This program includes an Emergency Response Notification Plan. Emergency response drills and drill evaluations are conducted every 12 months; emergency operation and response procedures also are reviewed at that time.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nThe 2019 PHA will identify any procedures and equipment that may improve the safety of the WWTP facility. It is expected the suggested improvements be examined by plant staff and implemented at the staff's discretion."

Visitors and contractors must enter the administration building and be approved by WWTP staff prior to entry into the WWTP. The WWTP is staffed year-round, 24 hours a day. \r\nBack-up power is available to the chlorination and dechlorination facilities in the event of an emergency. The back-up generator starts within seconds of electrical power supply loss and supplies power to critical processes within the WWTP, including the chlorine leak detectors, lighting, and ventilation systems.\r\n\r\nSummary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chlorine-Specific Prevention Steps \r\n\r\nThe WWTP has a thorough Safety Management Program. Chemical-specific prevention steps include availability of SCBA, worn by the operators during connection and disconnection of the chlorine supplies; awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine; and the presence of chlorine detectors and alarms.\r\nThe WWTP Accidental Release Prevention Program is based on the following key elements:\r\n\u00bf\t\tA detailed management system and clear levels of responsibilities and team member roles\r\n\u00bf\t\tComprehensive process safety information that is readily available to staff and emergency responders\r\n\u00bf\t\tA comprehensive preventive maintenance program\r\n\u00bf\t\tA completed process hazard analysis of equipment and procedures with operation and maintenance staff participation and review\r\n\u00bf\t\tUse of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment\r\n\u00bf\t\tUse of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with operations and maintenance staff participation\r\n\u00bf\t\tA high level of operator and maintenance staff training\r\n\u00bf\t\tImplementation of an incident investigation, inspection, and auditing program using qualified staff\r\n\r\nProcess and Chemical Safety Information\r\n\r\nComprehensive chemical data have been assembled to include regulatory reporting and action threshol"

The 5-year PHA update is slated to be completed in July of 2019 with the WWTP staff for the regulated process. In 2014, the team consisted of process operating and maintenance experts and process design engineers. The PHA technique used was the What-If study, as per acceptable approach guidance from the EPA. The PHA was led by a knowledgeable team on the type of process being reviewed.  Action items from the 2014 review and new potential hazards will examined and list of action items will generated. Staff will document completion of any action item.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nThe Idaho Falls WWTP maintains up-to-date, accurate, written operating procedures that give clear instructions for the chlorine process. The WWTP ensures effective operating practices by combining them with operating and maintenance training programs. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) provide system descriptions, specifications, equipment inspection requirements, and operating procedures for the chlorine system. Procedures inclu"

Also included are maintenance and troubleshooting procedures, consequences of deviation, and steps to correct deviations. Procedures are updated whenever a change occurs that alters the steps for safe operation. Operating procedures will be developed and in place before starting-up a changed process or before any new process equipment goes on-line.\r\n\r\nOperations and Maintenance Training Program\r\n\r\nEach WWTP employee presently involved in operating or maintaining the chlorine process is trained in a process overview and in detailed, applicable, operation and maintenance procedures once per month. The WWTP helps its employees understand, through training, the nature and cause of problems arising from operations involving chlorine on site, and increases its employees' awareness with respect to these hazards. The WWTP's training program includes both initial and refresher training that covers 1) a general overview of the processes, 2) the properties and hazards of the substances in the processes, and 3) a detailed review of the processes, operating procedures and safe work practices. Oral reviews and written self-evaluations are used to verify that an employee understands the training material before the process work can be resumed. \r\nTraining documentation includes the date of the most recent review or revision to the training program, the type of training required, and the type of competency testing used to ensure staff understands the training. \r\n\r\nPre-Startup Safety Review and Mechanical Integrity Program\r\n\r\nThe WWTP ensures that a pre-startup safety review is completed for any new, chlorine process at the WWTP, or for significant modifications to an existing chlorine process that requires a change in the process safety information. The WWTP maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment. The WW"

      "SummaryText": "TP believes that this program is the primary line of defense against a release, and addresses equipment testing and inspection, preventative maintenance schedules, and personnel training. The mechanical integrity program includes the following:\r\n\u00bf\t\tUse of written procedures for maintaining mechanical integrity through inspection and testing of process equipment, based on instructions of equipment vendors, industry codes, and prior operating experience\r\n\u00bf\t\tImplementing written procedures by performing inspections and tests on process equipment at specified intervals\r\n\u00bf\t\tTraining maintenance personnel in procedures for safe work practices, such as tagout, line or equipment opening, and avoidance and correction of unsafe conditions\r\n\r\nInternal Compliance Audits\r\nInternal compliance audits are conducted every 3 years to verify compliance with the programs and procedures contained in the RMP. The WWTP will assemble an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the RMP rule and process. This team will evaluate whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the RMP rule, and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process. The results of the audit will be documented, recommendations will be resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program will be implemented.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nThe WWTP investigates all incidents that could reasonably result in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment, so that similar accidents can be prevented. The WWTP trains employees to identify and report any incident that requires investigation. An investigation team will be assembled and the investigation initiated within 48 hours of the incident. The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented. Information found during the investigation is reviewed with affected staff, added or used to revise operating and"
