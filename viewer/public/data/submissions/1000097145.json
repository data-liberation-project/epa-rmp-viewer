We conduct our activities in a way that protects the environment through best management practices, pollution prevention and beneficially managing wastes, while responsibly using natural resources. Furthermore we maintain programs to ensure operations and facilities are, at a minimum, in full compliance with applicable governmental regulations and company policies. We believe it is the responsibility of each and every employee to perform their daily tasks in accordance with these environmental, health and safety principles. As company leaders we understand the importance of our support and are committed to creating a safe and positive workplace with effective environmental, health and safety programs.\n\n\n\nFacility Description:\n\nColumbia Crest is comprised of a world-class winery creating red, white, and sparkling wines with an extensive estate vineyard. The wine-making activities include receiving grapes, crushing, fermentation, barrel aging, storage, bottling, and warehousing finished goods. Making wine requires controlling the wine temperature at the different stages. At this facility we utilize anhydrous ammonia refrigeration systems to achieve the necessary critical temperature control. Our refrigeration system maintains proper temperatures in our cellars, barrel rooms, storage vessels, bottling lines, and warehouse.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program:\n\nOur ammonia refrigeration system is a covered process under both EPA RMP and OSHA PSM regulations. Our prevention program is comprised of engineering and administrative controls. Engineering controls for our covered process begins with a programmable logic controller (PLC) that regulates the process temperatures, pressures, and flows within preset limits. The process status can be monitored from onsite work stations or remotely. The PLC will alarm if the system"

      "SummaryText": " deviates beyond normal set points and can respond automatically to close valves, activate ventilation systems, or shut-down compressors and pumps. Fixed ammonia sensors connected to the PLC are strategically placed in the engine room to warn personnel of ambient ammonia concentrations. The sensors are also programmed to automatically isolate the process in a safe mode if elevated concentrations are detected. The refrigeration system also includes redundant pressure relief valves and emergency vents to prevent catastrophic release from over-pressurization. Administrative controls begins by following IIAR, ANSI, ASHRAE 15-1994, manufacture's recommendations, and local refrigeration codes and regulations for designing and maintaining the system. We maintain standard operating procedures (SOP) for each system component, assign qualified refrigeration technicians to monitor and operate the system; utilize certified ammonia system contractors for all installations, service, and repairs; control access to the engine room and PLC; limit the volume of ammonia in the high pressure receiver to 80% of its capacity; and perform nondestructive and destructive testing of verify piping integrity. \n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History:\n\nA qualifying event occurred on October 13, 2017 with the release of 3,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia to atmosphere. No serious injury, deaths or offsite impacts resulted from the accidental release.  \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nWe maintain an emergency response plan with a specific ammonia release action plan. The elements of our response follow the National Incident Management System (NIMS) and we utilize the Incident Command System to respond to emergencies. In the case of an emergency we have an internal HAZMAT Team trained and equipped to handle ammonia releases. The team meets regularly and performs at least one drill with our HAZMAT trailer each year. We coordinate facility tours with the local fire chief, include the local fire department in o"

These improvements can be small, such as improving SOP and training, to large, such as upgrading system components. To help identify improvements we conduct comprehensive program audits every three years in accordance with OSHA PSM standard. Our next audit will be performed in 2024. Investigation into the 2017 incident resulted in installing new equipment components with improved process design in all locations identical to the failure point for this incident."
