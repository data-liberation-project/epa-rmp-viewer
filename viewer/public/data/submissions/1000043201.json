Our plan considers all federal, state and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.

We will continue to develop and share management practices involving operations and maintenance activities between Oxy plants.\r\n3.

      "SummaryText": "(a) Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe Occidental Permian Ltd. Wasson CO2 Recovery Plant (WCRP) is committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes (especially regarding the use of hazardous substances) in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combinaiton of accidental release prevention safeguards and programs and emergency response programs to address the safety of our employees and the public, and the protection of the environment.  Our policy is to integrate process controls and administrative procedures that are designed to prevent the release of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, WCRP personnel are trained through an emergency action plan to control and contain the release.  The document provides a brief overview of the risk management activities we have designed and implemented.\r\n\r\n(b) Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled \r\n\r\nWCRP is designed to process produced gas and recycle CO2 back to our field injection operations.  During our process, we recover natural gas liquids (NGL) and strip  hydrogen sulfide (H2S) from the gas stream.  We utilize propane as a cooling agent for the process stream and we treat our cooling water with MISC/other sodium Hypochlotite 12.5% bleach.  Our evaluation of the regulated substances involved in the WCRP process resulted in our classifying this as a Program Level 1 process with only our propane inventory exceeding threshold quanities of the listed regulated substances.\r\n\r\n(c) General Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nWCRP is a Program Level 1 and is not required to have a specific prevention program.  However, we do have an active PSM program, which incorporates accidental release prevention.  \r\n\r\n(d) Five-year Accident History\r\n\r\nThe Wasson Plant has not had any RMP recordable incidents over the past five years.  Nor have there been any incidents with offsite consequences.\r\n\r\n(e) Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nWCRP main"
