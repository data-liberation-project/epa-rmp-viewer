Facility Policy\nThe employee team of Cotton Center Grain Co. are committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  We are also devoted to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and other authorities to minimize the release and the affects thereof.\n\n2. Facility Information\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored and distributed at our east facility in Cotton Center, TX.  The maximum quantity stored would be a filled storage tank which holds 150,000# (127,500# at 85%).  (See Appendix A)\n\n3.  Worst Case Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\na.) The worst-case scenario would be the release of the entire contents of our storage tank (released as a gas in a span of 10 minutes).  The maximum quantity released would be 127,500# which would be a full storage tank at 85% capacity.  At Class F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/x wind speed, and a rural topography, the maximum distance to a toxic endpoint of .14 mg/L is 6.9 miles.  (See Appendix A, Figure 1)\nb.)  The alternative release scenario is based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  This scenario involves the release of 4,400 pounds of ammonia in a gaseous form over a period of 2 minutes.  The distance to the endpoint is .8 mile.  (See Appendix A, Figure 2)\n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThe facility has implemented the standards of the American National Standards (ANSI K 61.1), \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous ammonia\" (See Appendix D)\n\n5.

Emergency Response Program\nThe facility is a non responder that has an emergency response plan.  We have provided state and local authorities the emergency planning. \n\n7.  Planned changes to improve\nSafety improvement and implementation is a very serious and ongoing priority at our facility.  Periodic inspections and evaluations are carried out to insure proper maintenance and safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time with the exception of a routine replacement of a filler hose."
