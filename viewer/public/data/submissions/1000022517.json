Primary products are paints, corrosion preventative compounds and soaps.\n\nAerosol manufacturing is a partially automated system that consists of filling a can with paint concentrate and solvent, crimping a spray valve on the can and adding propellant to pressurize the can. The cans are tested, labeled, capped, and prepared for shipment.\n\nPaint concentrates and other concentrates are stored in 55-gallon drums or bulk containers (330 gallon), inside the production building. Concentrates are stirred in the mix room and are pumped into the aerosol filling lines. Paints to be repackaged are stirred and pumped into the liquid filling lines.\n\nSolvents are stored in above ground storage tanks located outside. Propellants are stored outside, at vapor pressure, in cylindrical tanks. Paints, solvents, and propellants are hazardous substances as defined by OSHA PSM. However, only propellants are regulated by EPA's RMP program. Propellants on the EPA list are flammables and include propane, butane, dimethyl ether and  1,1-difluoroethane. Inventory of each substance maintained by LHB Industries exceeds EPA's threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.\n\nLHB Industries management team has many years experience in chemical and aerosol industries and are committed to providing the safest possible work environment for our employees. All operations are run to maximize safety and minimize the risk of any chemical exposures to employees and the environment.\n\nACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nLHB Industries has had no accidental releases, associated injuries or precautionary evacuations.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe aerosol process is subject to OSHA's PSM program. PSM is Prevention Program 3 of 40 CFR Part 68 and identifies the effort needed to minimize the potential for an unplanned"

Our greatest strengths lie with our maintenance and inspection programs and the simplicity of our processes.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nDesignated employees of LHB are trained to respond to only minor incidents that may occur at the facility. Minor incidents include small flash fires from a single aerosol can, cardboard, or small amount of solvent or propellant. All untrained personnel will evacuate the area in during a minor incident and all personnel will evacuate in case of a major incident. The Berkeley Fire Department will be called to respond in any fire situation.\n\nAn Emergency Response Plan is in place that meets the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.\nThe facility works with Berkeley Fire Department and St. Louis County LEPC to ensure that they are suitably trained and drilled in emergency response.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES FOR IMPROVED SAFETY\n\nUpcoming plans include integrated emergency response drills with the Berkeley Fire Department simulating an Alternate Case Scenario and review for possible upgrade of tank farm fire safety equipment, again with Berkeley Fire Department. We will continue to assess the safety of our aerosol operations and propose to design, build, operate and maintain our facility so it remains safe and acceptable to the local community and industrial area. We will continue to adhere to the highest standards for safe operation of our facility and the protection of the public and environment. \n\n\n \n"
