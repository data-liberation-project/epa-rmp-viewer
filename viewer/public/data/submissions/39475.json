Brooklyn Park's WTP is a conventional water treatment plant utilizing filtration, sedimentation, and disinfecting.  The quantity of chlorine used at the WTP is greater that the Threshold Quantity of 2,500 pounds, which is the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) criteria for requiring the development and submittal of the information found in this RMP document.  A hazard assessment was conducted for the chlorine process and consideration was also given to the other hazardous chemicals at the WTP.\n\nIt is the Brooklyn Park WTP's intent to uphold industry standards in the operation of the facility and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency was to occur, it is our policy and/or procedure to notify the Brooklyn Park Fire Department (via the 911 system) and request that their response to the emergency.\n\nChlorine is considered toxic by EPA standards.  The same properties that make chlorine valuable as a water treatment agent and fuel supply, also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling these chemicals to prevent unnecessary human exposure and to reduce the potential impact or threat to nearby members of the community.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chemicals: combined with safety devices inherent in the design of the Brooklyn Park WTP; and the training of Brooklyn Park WTP personnel.\n\nThe chlorine system at the WTP consists of one tone cyclinders, scales, chlorinators, vacuum regulators, diffusers, injectors, residual analyzers, leak detectors and a chlorine emergency vapor scrubber system.  The chlorine cyclinders, scales and vacuum regulators are located in Room 135. Room 134 houses the chlorinators and the chlorine n"

      "SummaryText": "eutralization system is located in Room 211. Chlorine is also stored and uised at the well houses, for water treatment, in 150 pound cylinders.\n\nThe chlorine storage room has four scales.  One chlorine cyclinder can be placed on each of the scales.  Generally the facility has two cylinders in operation and two cylinders in waiting.  The WTP chlorine storage rooom and the chlorinator room are equipped with chlorine detectors.  These rooms are also connected to a sodium hydroxide emergency chlorine scrubber system.  The distribution/piping system is constructed of schedule 80 PVC piping and is operated unader a negative pressure (vacuum).\n\nIt is the WTP's intent to comply with EPA's accidental release prevention rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  Brooklyn Park takes a systematic, proactive approach to evaluating chemical processes.  Using this approach, the design, technology, operation and maintenance activities, emergency preparedness plans, training, process shnages, and other elements that affect processes are all considered.  Through evaluation, the consequences of catastrophic releases can be prevented or minimized.  \n\nBy fulfilling the required elements of the WTP's PSM and RMP standards, Brooklyn Park intends to prevent unwanted releases or minimize the impacts of accidental releases of hazardous chemicals, especially into locations that could expose serious hazards to employees, the community and the environment.  Our management systems address each of the key features of a successful release prevention program including:\n\n*Process Safety Information\n*Process Hazard Analysis\n*Operating Procedures\n*Training\n*Mechanical Integrity\n*Management of Change\n*Pre-Startup Review\n*Compliance Audits\n*Incident Investigations\n*Employee Participation\n*Hot Work Permit Program\n*Hazard Communications with Contractors\n\nBrooklyn Park WTP is committed to the high standards that the RMP sets.  As we do business, we have specific accountabilities and control"

Brooklyn Park has also developed a risk management system which identifies job positions and responsibilities to ensure proper management of the RMP.\n\nThere have been no releases of chlorine or other toxic/extremely hazardouse chemicals in the past five (5) years which have resulted in injury, death, off-site consequences, response or restoration activities.  We have discussed the content and intent of our emergency response program with the Brooklyn Park Fire Department and rely on their response capability and trained staff, should an accidental release occur."
