The Facility Policy\n\n\n\nThe owners, management and employees of Green Valley Chemical (GVC) Corporation are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.   If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  \n\n\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the manufacture of anhydrous ammonia as an agricultural fertilizer for member  owners (ag retailers).  Anhydrous ammonia is made by reacting natural gas with steam and atmospheric air in the presence of a catalyst to reform the components into Nitrogen (N2), Hydrogen (H2) and Carbon Dioxide (CO2).  The carbon dioxide is then stripped from the process with the remaining nitrogen and hydrogen reacted in the presence of a catalyst to form Anhydrous Ammonia (NH3).  The maximum quantity of ammonia stored would be 40,000,000 pounds in one refrigerated storage tank.\n\n\n\n3.  The worst case scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\n    NOT INCLUDED\n\n\n\n\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\n\n\nThe facility has implemented provisions of ANSI/CGA G-2.1-2014 Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, ANSI/ASME B31.3 Process Piping, ANSI/ASME B31.5 Refrigeration Piping and Heat Transfer Components, ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section VIII and the National Board Inspection Code as well as OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 Storage and Handling of anhydrous ammonia, 29 CFR Part 1910.119 Process Safety Management and Iowa Administrative Code IAC 21-43.6(200) Standard for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\n5.  The Five-year Accident History.\n\n\n\na.  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\nC"

Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations.  The facility is currently undertaking a capital project to upgrade process automation, control and feedback to improve plant efficiency, reliability and safety."
