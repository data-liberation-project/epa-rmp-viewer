      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nRisk Management Plan Executive Summary\r\nAnderson Development Company SCP Facility\r\n\r\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nAnderson Development Company (ADC) is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that includes design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training in the processes at our facilities.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent releases of hazardous substances.  If such a release does occur, the Adrian Fire Department would respond to control and mitigate the effects of the release. If necessary an outside emergency response contractor could be utilized. Anderson Development Company staff would support emergency response personnel.\r\n\r\n2. The Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nADC manufactures a variety of products at our Specialty Chemical Plant (SCP) facility.  The SCP facility has the following RMP regulated materials onsite: titanium tetrachloride and toluene diisocyanate. Maximum inventories of these chemicals at the SCP facility exceed the RMP threshold quantities.\r\n\r\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nADC has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements.  The SCP facility meets all requirements of State Building Codes and MIOSHA Process Safety Management standards for chemical processes.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention program in place at the SCP facility.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information:   Detailed records of process safety information describing chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs are maintained for all processes.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis:   Comprehensive studies are conducted for our chemical processes to ensure that all potential haz"

The studies are performed by teams of qualified personnel who are familiar with the operational details of the process that is being reviewed.  The studies are revalidated at intervals of five years or whenever major process changes occur.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are properly addressed.  \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures   Written operating procedures are maintained for all processes.  These procedures cover initial startup, normal operations, temporary conditions, normal shutdown and emergency shutdown.  The information is regularly reviewed and is followed by process operators.\r\n\r\nTraining   Our comprehensive training program is the basis for certification of the process specific competency of each operator.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity   ADC performs documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure reliable operations.  Process equipment inspected includes:  reactors, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency generators and shutdown systems, pumps, and control systems.  Maintenance operations are performed by qualified personnel.  All identified deficiencies are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change   Necessary process changes to chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures are made in accordance with methodical written management procedures.  Process operators and maintenance personnel are informed of and provided training to safely and reliably deal with necessary process modifications.\r\n\r\nPreStartup Safety Reviews   Whenever startups of new processes or modified processes occurs, a hands on review is conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable before equipment is placed into operation.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits   Extensive reviews of all compliance aspects of accident prevention programs are performed every three years.

These investigations are undertaken to identify the root cause of each incident as well as to identify any corrective actions to prevent releases from occurring.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation   Process safety and accident prevention are a team effort.  All process employees are included in discussions concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  All process employees have access to all information in the accident prevention program, especially information from process hazard analyses.\r\n\r\nContractors   ADC hires numerous contractors to perform specialized maintenance and construction activities.  The safety programs and performance of all contractors are evaluated and continually monitored.  All individuals working for contractor firms hired by ADC receive annual safety training.  ADC informs all contractor workers of known potential hazards related to each project s plan of action.  All contractors are also informed of emergency procedures and required to cease working should an accidental release occur.\r\n\r\n4. Five Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere have been no accidental releases of RMP regulated chemicals from the SCP facility which resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\r\n\r\n5. Emergency Response Plan\r\n\r\nADC has developed a written comprehensive emergency action plan to deal with all emergencies, including the accidental release of hazardous substances.  The plan covers all aspects including first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, shelter in place, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public. Equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  The emergency action plan is promptly"
