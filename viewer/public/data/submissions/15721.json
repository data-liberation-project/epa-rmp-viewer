      "SummaryText": "SYSCO Foods of Eastern Wisconsin is a general line grocery wholesaler located at One Sysco Drive, Jackson, WI. Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant at this facility to provide cooling for perishable and frozen product. This facility has been in operation for three years and until March of 1999 the ammonia charge was under the OSHA threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds. Expansion of the refrigeration system, scheduled for completion in March of 1999, put us over the 10,000 pound limit and in January of this 1999 we developed our Process Safety Management program to help us maintain a safe and reliable refrigeration system.\n\nThe refrigeration system at SYSCO Foods is a closed loop system with normal operating pressures that range between a low side of 0 psi to a high side of 160 psi. The maximum amount of ammonia in the system at any one time is estimated at 14,500 pounds.  \n\nWorst-case Release Scenario for a Toxic Substance:\nOur worst-case release is the failure of the largest vessel in our refrigeration system. This vessel is\ncalled the + 18 Suction Accumulator and has a maximum capacity of 8,800 pounds. In calculating the area affected by this failure, the engine room enclosure, where the Accumulator is located,\nwill provide passive mitigation, thereby reducing the toxic endpoint. The engine room has a volume of 32,000 cubic feet and roof ventilation produces 40 room air exchanges per hour. Using the tables and equations found in chapter 4 of  EPA's \"RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\", the toxic endpoint was calculated at 1.00 miles. Based on census data provided by \"Landview III\", within this radius is a population of 450, a daycare center, residential housing, retail and light industrial businesses. There are no schools or hospitals located within this area. \n\nAlternative release scenario for a toxic substance:\nThe alternative release toxic endpoint was also determined using EPA's \"RMP Guidance for\nAmmonia Refrigeration\" reference tables and equations.

      "SummaryText": " pressure relief valve failure was the most likely cause of an ammonia release. Using the tables provided in the RMP Guidance, a 10 minute release of ammonia at 130 lbs/min, from the High Pressure Receiver relief valve, would affect an area of .20 miles. The estimated population, according to Landview III, within distance to endpoint is 20. There are also some residences, industrial and retail businesses. There are no schools or hospitals within this radius. \n\nAccidental Release and Emergency Response Policies:\nSYSCO Foods has established an in-house emergency response team to quickly respond to and handle releases of Anhydrous Ammonia. The established steps include initial training under the OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.120 HAZWOPER. The facility has also established annual retraining for all personnel that are on the HAZMAT Team as well as periodic spill drills and plant wide evacuation drills to assure all employees are prepared in the event of an emergency. We have also coordinated efforts with Washington County Emergency Management to establish a joint response program. These established plans and procedures shall be periodically reviewed to\nassure that they are current and up to date.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nWe have trained the refrigeration operators and selected production and office personnel in\nHazardous Waste Operation and Emergency Response, 29 CFR 1910.120. The trained personnel\nwill assess each release situation and determine the appropriate emergency response to initiate.\nThis could be by simply tightening a packing nut or flange bolt or initiating a system shut down.\nNorthern Star has  established written operating procedures for the ammonia refrigeration system\nand has included in those procedures the Emergency Shutdown and isolation in the event of a\nrelease. We have also purchased Level B Chemical Suites, Self Contained Breathing Apparatus\nand other appropriate equipment to support the in-house HAZMAT team. This team will\ncoordinate their effo"
