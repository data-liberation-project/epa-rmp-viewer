This mill is located on approximately 1,200 acres in the eastern portion of Columbus County, North Carolina. The areas immediately adjacent to the Riegelwood Mill are populated by residences and businesses, and areas along the river are used for transit and sport. The International Paper facility is located immediately adjacent to the Cape Fear River and other smaller businesses and residences. In addition, right-of-ways cross the mill providing access for the local power company, a water district, and railroad traffic.\n\n\n\nThe International Paper Riegelwood Mill is committed to accident prevention and the protection of public health, employee safety and the environment.  To accomplish this goal the mill manages risk through redundant protective systems including process design and engineering, safety inspections, quality control, employee training, HAZOP review, management of change and routine emergency drills.  The Mill's Emergency Response Program consists of a written Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that outlines the roles and responsibilities for response during an emergency and provides response guidelines for multiple emergency situations that may occur.  The Riegelwood Emergency Preparedness Manual provides the structure and guidance for chemical release response.  The Mill maintains an emergency response team, staffed by shift around the clock, for chemical release response.  The team is funded and supported to provide incident command and emergency response measures for releases of chlorine dioxide.  In addition to equipment and resources, the emergency response team drills annually and across shifts to test, evaluate, and improve the plan where necessary.   \n\n\n\nThe Mill receives raw wood materials that are processed, pulped and manufactured into various types of pulp products. A number of chemicals are used to facilitate the processes and to support auxiliary mill operations."

It is generated on site in an aqueous solution at a concentration of approximately 11 grams per liter. The volume in storage is approximately 628,000 gallons. The total maximum storage of chlorine dioxide is approximately 57,613 pounds.\n\n\n\nIn compliance with EPA's RMP Rule, the International Paper Riegelwood Mill has developed and implemented a detailed Prevention Program. This Prevention Program was originally formatted to meet the requirements of OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard. The Prevention Program, in its existing form, has been in place and operational since 1995 but was built upon the mill's long standing commitment to safe chemical management. The Riegelwood Mill's Prevention Program encompasses all 14 elements of a Prevention Program as defined by both EPA and OSHA. These 14 elements can be classified into three categories including: the technology of the covered processes (provides for the collection of information and development of tools to better understand the processes and chemicals used at the mill); facilities related to the covered processes (administers the systematic monitoring and upkeep of the processes); and the personnel involved in supporting the processes (facilitates the training of and communication with people responsible for the safety and operation of these processes.)\n\n\n\nAs an example of International Paper's commitment to a successful Prevention Program, the Riegelwood Mill has enhanced an existing Safe Works Practices Program. This program represents an expanded version of a Hot Works Program that requires personnel to receive a permit prior to using spark generation equipment in potentially flammable or combustible environments.

Pre-startup reviews include a safety review to ensure compliance with all OSHA and EPA standards.  Safety audits include periodic HAZOPs or \"What-if\" reviews monthly safety inspections.  Management of change procedures are strictly adhered and all proposed process modifications, procedures, training requirements and support measures are reviewed and must receive management approval.  Safe work permits are routinely employed to assure maintenance activities are conducted properly and safely.  The mechanical integrity program includes testing procedures for process components, training requirements, and documentation and quality control.  The Mill has established an action tracking system for the management and closure of corrective measures identified during testing and inspection activities.  Testing and inspection protocols include acceptable limits of tolerance further enhance the mechanical integrity program.  \n\n\n\nEmployees with responsibility for handing or transporting chlorine dioxide, or operating RMP covered systems are required to complete advanced training with annual refresher training.  Training topics include proper use of tools and equipment for handling and transporting chlorine dioxide, incompatibilities of materials and inspection and monitoring protocols for inventory control.  In some cases, check valves have been installed on supply lines to automatically limit flow to a single direction in the event of line failure.

Mill sumps and drains are segregated to prohibit mixing of non-compatible materials and the creation of additional hazards in the event of a release.\n\n\n\nInternational Paper's Riegelwood Mill has developed and implemented a comprehensive Emergency Response Program that is detailed in the mill's Emergency Response Plan. The Emergency Response Plan (ERP) was revised and expanded in response to the emergency planning requirement under OSHA's PSM Standard and has been in its existing format since 1995. This ERP has been continually updated to reflect both policy and procedural changes related to emergency planning and response at the mill. The ERP was most recently updated in 2018 and meets the requirements of both EPA's RMP Rule and OSHA's PSM Standard. The strength of the Riegelwood Mill's Emergency Response Program lies in the fact that International Paper supports and operates an on-site emergency response team 24 hours a day at the Riegelwood Mill. Mill personnel are fully trained and equipped to respond to a release of hazardous chemicals found on-site. The close proximity of these trained personnel and equipment to potential on-site releases at the mill allow for timely and efficient mitigation of releases. In addition to the development and implementation of emergency response planning and training at the mill, International Paper has provided comprehensive information to and has participated in the preparation and coordination of emergency services with the Local Emergency Planning Committee.  Mill management and emergency response personnel coordinate closely with the Local Emergence Response Commission and routinely conduct joint training and drills.

As the Riegelwood Mill continues to manufacture quality pulp products, International Paper's corporate commitment to safety and the protection of the environment focuses on the continued improvement of our policies and procedures. With this corporate focus, the Riegelwood Mill has implemented an Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) process for bleaching pulp. The ECF process replaces the chlorine gas used in the bleaching process with chlorine dioxide, a safer chemical. The introduction of the ECF process has enabled International Paper to completely eliminate the use of chlorine railcars at the Riegelwood Mill. International Paper stands committed to providing a safe workplace for its employees and to be a good corporate neighbor while continuing to provide quality pulp products.\n\n"
