The management and employees of the Linde Wacker facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of Hydrogen. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the community and the environment.\n\n\n\nThe facility's primary operation is the storage and distribution of hydrogen to Wacker Polysilicon North America, LLC, located at the same address.  There is one covered PSM/RMP process, which is:\n\nHydrogen - liquid storage and distribution\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario, based on the EPA's definition for a flammable gas release, was used. The alternative release (or more probable) scenario used, involved the release of flammable gas and was also based on EPA criteria. Both can be reviewed by contacting the Linde facility.\n\n\n\nThe impacted areas were determined using the 2010 US Census data obtained from Missouri Census Data Center.  No environmental receptors are affected. No passive/active mitigation or administrative controls were considered in this assessment.\n\n\n\nThe facility has developed a comprehensive prevention program designed to prevent accidental releases of Hydrogen. The program utilizes state-of-the-art technology, sound engineering practices, administrative controls and active employee participation. Employees will serve on task groups and teams in developing and maintaining risk management program elements. They will be frequently consulted concerning the various aspects of the program and ways to continually improve the safety of the process.\n\n\n\nWritten process safety information has been developed for the Hydrogen system to enable managers, supervisors, and employees to identify and understand the process hazards. This information was utilized to develop a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) "

The PHA focuses attention on equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions, (routine and nonroutine), and external factors that might impact the process by identifying potential failure points or failure modes in the process. The PHA for the Hydrogen system was completed on April 1, 2012, and will be updated at least every 5 years.\n\n\n\nDetailed operating procedures exist which describe tasks to be performed, dates to be recorded, operating conditions to be maintained, samples to be collected, and safety and health precautions to be taken. The procedures have been reviewed/approved to ensure they are technically accurate by employees, managers and personnel with the technical expertise/knowledge of the process. The operating procedures were issued in April 2015 for the Hydrogen system, and will be reviewed annually, and revised as necessary to reflect current operations.\n\n\n\nEmployees are thoroughly trained, including maintenance and contractor employees. The training meets and exceeds the requirements as outlined in OSHA's hazard communication standard 29 CFR 1910.1200.  Training includes operating procedures, safe work practices, emergency procedures (including alarms), special assignments, evacuation and emergency response; safety rules and procedures; routine and nonroutine work authorization; and other pertinent process safety information. Each employee trained has a defined and documented program based on their job duties. The training goals and objectives have been established and written in clear and measurable terms. Hands-on training is provided to employees to enhance their senses beyond listening. In addition, employees receive traditional classroom instruction including lectures, videos, programmed and on-the-job instruction. Employees are encouraged to actively participate.

The screening program involves obtaining information on the contractor's safety performance, including injury and illness rates, and experience. In addition, the contractor's safety performance, job skills, knowledge, and certifications (such as pressure vessel welders) are also verified. The contractor safety procedures were issued in April 2015.\n\n\n\nPreStart-up Safety Reviews (PSSR) will be used for new or modified processes to improve the design and construction of the process from a reliability and quality stand point. The PSSR recommendations will be resolved before final installations are complete. Other items to be completed prior to initial process startup include piping and instrument diagrams, operating procedures, and ensuring operating personnel are fully trained.  The initial startup and normal operating procedures will be fully evaluated as part of the PSSR to assure a safe transfer into the normal operating mode for meeting the process parameters. The first PreStart-up Safety Review was be conducted in April 2015. \n\n\n\nAn on-going mechanical integrity program (maintenance) will be used to ensure safe process operations.  Equipment used to store, process, or handle Hydrogen is designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize releases.

Linde's Confined Space Entry Program is a separate permitting system designed to manage it's employees/contractors in performing this type of work. This Program was issued in April 2015 for both employees and contractors.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change (MOC) procedures have been developed for permanent changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment and facilities. MOC procedures are designed to ensure that prior to any change occurring, that technically qualified personnel with knowledge and expertise of the chemical process, reviews and approves the proposed changes. This would include both technical and mechanical changes.  Process changes include all modifications to equipment, procedures, raw materials and processing conditions other than \"replacement in kind\". A Process Change Authorization is required for all changes.
