Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Jody Cold Storage are strongly committed to employee, public and \n\nenvironmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our \n\ncomprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas \n\nsuch as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and \n\nemployee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is \n\nour policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible \n\nreleases of regulated substances.\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Cold Storage of Packaged \n\nFresh Fruit.  We have 1 regulated substances present at our facility.  \n\nThese substances include  and Ammonia (anhydrous).  Ammonia (anhydrous) \n\nis used for fresh fruit refrigeration.\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release \n\nScenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures \n\nto limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios, we have used the EPA's \n\nRMP*Comp(TM).  For alternative release scenario analyses we have \n\nemployed the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The \n\nfollowing paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic \n\nsubstances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Liquid \n\nAmmonia Cold Storage Facility.  In this scenario 990 lb. of Ammonia \n\n(anhydrous) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a \n\n1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is \n\nestimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  At Class F atmospheric \n\nstability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 0.4 miles is \n\nobtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a \n\nrele"

Under \n\nneutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint \n\nof 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia (anhydrous) is 0.06 miles.\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the \n\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the \n\naccidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 \n\nof the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance \n\nwith NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.    The following sections briefly \n\ndescribe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place \n\nat our stationary source.\nProcess Safety Information\nJody Cold Storage maintains a detailed record of safety information that \n\ndescribes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment \n\ndesigns associated with all processes.\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards \n\nassociated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. \n\n The methodology used to carry out these analyses is State Environmental \n\nAgency.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a \n\ntimely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 02/20/1998.\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered \n\nprocesses, Jody Cold Storage maintains written operating procedures.  \n\nThese procedures address various modes of operation such as initial \n\nstartup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, \n\nemergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  \n\nThe information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to \n\noperators involved in the processes.\nTraining\nJody Cold Storage"

Process equipment \n\nexamined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, \n\nstorage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency \n\nshutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are \n\ncarried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance \n\npractices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized \n\ntraining as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the \n\nmaintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Jody Cold Storage to manage changes \n\nin process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  The most \n\nrecent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on \n\n03/01/1999.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other \n\nemployee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process \n\nconditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with \n\nthe modification.\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to \n\nmodifications in established processes are conducted as a regular \n\npractice at Jody Cold Storage.  The most recent review was performed on \n\n04/06/1999.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, \n\nequipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe \n\nstartup prior to placing equipment into operation.\nCompliance Audits\nJody Cold Storage conducts audits on a regular basis to determine \n\nwhether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. \n\n The most recent comliance audit was conducted on 02/20/1998.
