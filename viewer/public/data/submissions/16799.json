Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Jody Cold Storage are strongly committed to employee, public and \n\nenvironmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our \n\ncomprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas \n\nsuch as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and \n\nemployee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is \n\nour policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible \n\nreleases of regulated substances.\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Cold Storage of Packaged \n\nFresh Fruit.  We have 1 regulated substances present at our facility.  \n\nThese substances include  and Ammonia (anhydrous).  Ammonia (anhydrous) \n\nis used for fresh fruit refrigeration.\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release \n\nScenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures \n\nto limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios, we have used the EPA's \n\nRMP*Comp(TM).  For alternative release scenario analyses we have \n\nemployed the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The \n\nfollowing paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic \n\nsubstances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Liquid \n\nAmmonia Cold Storage Facility.  In this scenario 990 lb. of Ammonia \n\n(anhydrous) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a \n\n1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is \n\nestimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  At Class F atmospheric \n\nstability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 0.4 miles is \n\nobtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a \n\nrele"

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the \n\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the \n\naccidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 \n\nof the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance \n\nwith NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.    The following sections briefly \n\ndescribe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place \n\nat our stationary source.\nProcess Safety Information\nJody Cold Storage maintains a detailed record of safety information that \n\ndescribes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment \n\ndesigns associated with all processes.\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards \n\nassociated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. \n\n The methodology used to carry out these analyses is State Environmental \n\nAgency.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a \n\ntimely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 02/20/1998.\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered \n\nprocesses, Jody Cold Storage maintains written operating procedures.  \n\nThese procedures address various modes of operation such as initial \n\nstartup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, \n\nemergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  \n\nThe information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to \n\noperators involved in the processes.\nTraining\nJody Cold Storage"
