The facility is in the process of being expanded and will be capable of producing 61,000 barrels per day (BPD) of renewable diesel. The feedstock consists mainly of refined animal fats, recycled cooking oil, and corn oil. \n\n\n\nThe existing facility includes an Ecofining unit (DGD Ecofining Unit), which utilizes a UOP-licensed technology that uses Hydrotreating and Isomerization processes to convert the fats/oil feedstock into Green Diesel; a Pretreatment Unit, which removes metals and other contaminants from the feedstock; a small wastewater treating unit; rail and truck unloading facility; and tank farm area.  Within the existing facility, only the Ecofining Unit is a covered process under PSM and RMP regulations.\n\n\n\nAs part of the new expansion project, DGD will add another Ecofining unit (DGD II Ecofining Unit) and a Renewable Gasoline Unit (RGU), which processes the light end streams from both Ecofining Units to separate into liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), light naphtha, heavy naphtha, and refinery fuel gas.  These two new units will also be covered processes under PSM and RMP regulations.\n\n\n\nThis plan has been updated and resubmitted in accordance with 40 CFR 68.190 to address the following:\n\n\n\n1.  Additions of the two new units listed above and their maximum inventory of covered chemicals\n\n2.  Updates to all prevention program data and other facility information\n\n3.  Review and update of the Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA)\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this plan is to provide information about regulated substances at the facility, policies and programs to prevent accidental releases, emergency response planning, accident history and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.

The PSM program is designed to:\n\n\n\n-  Reduce the potential for serious accidents\n\n-  Increase plant reliability, efficiency and product quality\n\n-  Diminish the potential for releases with environmental impact\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Planning\n\n\n\nValero's St. Charles (VSC) Facility is contractually responsible to respond to DGD site emergencies with its Emergency Response Team (ERT). This team coordinates with the St. Charles Parish Department of Emergency Preparedness (DEP) personnel during any incident with potential for offsite impacts. Copies of the Emergency Response Plan as well as ERT exercises are coordinated with the DEP Director as applicable.\n\n\n\nAccident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases in the past 5 years that resulted in on site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nContinuing compliance with PSM/RMP guidelines and regulations forms the basis of DGD's commitment to ensuring a safe working environment for employees as well as a safe community.  The facility benefits from the use of the latest technology in its processes as well as the assurance of the finest training of its employees. Specific actions that will improve safety include:\n\n\n\n-  Evaluation of process changes using Management of Change procedures to ensure safety and Health\n\n-  Continual improvement in safety standards through application of the PHA process\n\n-  Use of process controls such as vents, relief valves, check valves, scrubbers, flares, shutoffs, interlo"
