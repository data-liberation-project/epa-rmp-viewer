We are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an emergency were to occur, it is our ploicy to notify the CORTLAND FIRE DEPARTMENT, and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\n2.  A description of af agronomy princeton location facility and the regulated substance handled:\n      The primary purpose of this facility is storage of fertilizers for sale to the agricultural sector.  Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed grade fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\n3.  The worst case scenerio:\n     We used rmp comp to determine the worst case scenerio release at our facility.  Failure of our largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would have off site consequences.  The alternative case scenerio is based on the most likely incident to occur, which is a break in a transfer hose.  Excess check flow valves and manual shut off valves will help control release in the alternative scenerio.\n\n4.  AF AGRONOMY complies with EPA's Accidentl Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n5.  Five year accident history:\n     We have never had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caused death, injuries, property, or envioronmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in place.\n\n6.
