Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \n\nPortland Water District (PWD) is committed to operating its wastewater treatment plant in Portland, Maine in an environmentally responsible manner and to providing a safe work place for its employees and the surrounding community.  As part of this commitment to environmental stewardship and worker safety, PWD has developed and implemented numerous environmental and safety programs that are designed to eliminate and/or drastically reduce the potential for accidental releases.  PWD has also developed and implemented a number of programs that are designed to ensure that if an accidental release occurs, it will be handled in a manner that minimizes adverse impact to people, the environment and the plant.  Many of these programs have been in place for some time. \n\nPWD views accident prevention, and personnel and environmental protection as a continuous process.  Consequently, PWD continuously strives to improve its accident prevention, environmental protection and emergency response programs.  A recent addition to PWDs overall accident prevention and response program is the development of  its Risk Management Program.  PWDs Risk Management Program (RMP) complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencys (\"EPAs\") Chemical Accident Prevention rule found at 40 C.F.R. Part 68.  One of the requirements of this rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan.  This document is PWDs RMP plan and provides the public with information about PWDs processes, accident prevention programs and emergency response planning efforts.   PWDs compliance with EPAs RMP rule includes:\n\n1. Completion of a hazard assessment in compliance with 40 C.F.R. Part 68, Subpart B, including the five-year accidental release history--PWD has never experienced an RMP reportable release or accident at its Por"

Implementation of an emergency response program.  As recommended in the RMP rule and by numerous federal response entities, the plant has developed a single response plan that is designed to meet the emergency response planning requirements, applicable to the plant under a number of applicable state and federal emergency response planning laws. \n\nAdditional information regarding how PWD addresses each of these requirements is provided below and in the attached RMP plan.\n\nWhile the RMP program at PWD helps ensure that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe and environmentally responsible manner, it is just one component of PWDs comprehensive safety and environmental programs.  Additional components that are beyond the scope of the RMP include, but are not limited to: regular employee/contractor safety training, periodic table-top safety and emergency response drills, acquisition and maintenance of emergency response and personnel protective equipment, development of safe work practices (confined space, lockout/tagout, hot work), implementation of safe work procedures, new project safety review procedures, preventive maintenance and regular inspections of all tanks and equipment that contain hazardous chemicals, chemical control and purchasing procedures, medical emergency response training, contractor certification, etc. \n\nThe plant and all equipment is designed and operated to minimize the possibility of an accidental release.

In 1999, the Portland wastewater treatment facility will install valve actuators on its chlorine and sulfur dioxide tanks.  These actuators automatically seal chlorine or sulfur dioxide tanks in the event of a leak or break in the whip assembly, which delivers chlorine and sulfur dioxide from the tanks to the evaporator room.\n \n2.  In 1998 and 1999, PWD integrated  all of its emergency response and accident prevention plan into a single, easy to use Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP).  The ICP is designed to provide more-effective emergency response guidance and to comply with a number of state and federal laws.  \n\n \n  \nB.  RMP Covered Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nPWD owns and operates the Portland Wastewater Treatment Facility in Portland, Maine.  The plant treats waste water from the city of Portland and septic water from several adjacent towns.  The only chemicals present at the plant in sufficient quantities to be regulated by the chemical accident prevention rule are chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  Chlorine is used to disinfect the wastewater.  Sulfur dioxide is subsequently used to dechlorinate the wastewater before it is discharged into Casco Bay pursuant to the Clean Water Act permit.\n\nChlorine is stored in 2,000 lb. tanks within the chlorine scale room.  The chlorine scale room is equipped with chlorine detectors which sound an alarm in the event of an accidental release of chlorine.  Valve actuators will be installed to seal off the 2,000 lb. tank in the event of any chlorine leak in the water treatment process.\n\nSulfur dioxide is stored in 2000 lb. tanks within the sulfur dioxide scale room.

The total maximum amount of sulfur dioxide stored on-site is 16,000 pounds.  The maximum amount of sulfur dioxide used at any one time in the dechlorination process is 8,000 pounds.\n\nC. Off-site Consequence Analysis\n\nAs required by the RMP rule, PWDs off-site consequence analysis included evaluation of a worst-case accidental release for all toxic chemicals and an alternative release for each covered chemical.\n\nA worst-case release is defined by EPA as \"a release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint defined in ' 68.22.\"  40 C.F.R. ' 68.3.   EPA requires the worst-case accidental release to be modeled using highly conservative meteorological data designed to result in the maximum possible adverse impact.  For example, EPA requires worst-case models to be based on the hottest day of the year, occurring at night with a very slow, steady wind which would not disperse a release very effectively. Further, the model assumes that the entire contents of the largest vessel is released instantaneously.  According to the Chlorine Institute, no 2,000 lb. chlorine tank has ever released its contents in ten minutes.  Accordingly, the probability of a 2,000 lb. tank of chlorine instantaneously releasing its contents in Maine on a 960F night when the wind is blowing at 3.4 miles per hour is extremely low.\n\n\nUsing the EPA mandated criteria described above, the worst-case release at the plant (for purposes of RMP) would involve a complete failure of a 2,000 lb. chlorine tanks, filled to maximum capacity.  If such a release occurred, it would result in a vapor cloud that could impact persons outside of the plants property line.\n\nPWD developed alternative releases of chlorine and sulfur dioxide that focus on more realistic release "

      "SummaryText": "scenarios occurring during more common meteorological conditions.  However, EPA requires modelling of a release which could impact off-site locations. After considering all criteria in the RMP rule, the Process Hazard Analysis performed on the chlorination and dechlorination processes, and all past releases, PWD has chosen an alternative release for chlorine and an alternative release for sulfur dioxide.  Each scenario involves a pinhole leak in the storage tanks.\n\nThe alternative release scenarios for chlorine is based on a pinhole leak from a 1/16\" hole in one chlorine tank.  Chlorine would exit from such a leak as a liquid, gas or as an aerosol.  The liquid portion of the leak would vaporize into a gas almost immediately.  The chlorine gas would then migrate based on meteorological conditions.  PWD has never had a pinhole leak in any of the chlorine tanks in the past.\nHowever, because actuators on the tanks would prevent a release resulting from a whip assembly failure from leaving the site, the pinhole leak appeared to be the most likely scenario.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for sulfur dioxide is identical to the scenario described for the chlorine release.  Since the physical and chemical properties of sulfur dioxide are different that those of chlorine, the migration of this compound off-site would be not be identical to that of chlorine.  There has also never been a pinhole leak in any of the sulfur dioxide tanks in the past.  \n\nD. Accident Release Prevention Program\n\nPWD has developed an accidental release prevention program that is designed and implemented to drastically reduce the possibility of an accidental catastrophic release.   The program complies with the requirements of OSHAs Process Safety Management rule found at 29 C.F.R. Part 1910.119 and is analagous to RMP requirements found at 40 C.F.R. Part 68, Subpart D.

To comply with the RMP rule, the plant has taken its existing PSM program and incorporated an additional focusprotection of the public.  \n\nThe basic elements of PWDs prevention program are described below: \n\n1. Employee Participation.  PWD has developed and implements a written plan of action regarding employee participation in the safety and accident prevention process.  The plan describes how employees are:  (A)  consulted and what input they will have in the development of process hazard analysis (PHA) and other PSM and RMP safety elements; and (B) given access to PSM and RMP information at the plant.   \n\n2. Process Safety Information.  PWD has compiled written process safety information which helped identify the hazards posed by chlorine and sulfur dioxide, handling of materials, management, storage activities and the chlorination and dechlorination processes in general.  The compilation of process safety information provided the foundation for understanding the hazards involved in the wastewater  process and was crucial to the development of a complete and thorough process hazard analyses (discussed in subsection 3 immediately below).

Process Hazard Analyses.  PWD performed its most recent process hazard analysis (PHA) on the chlorination and dechlorination systems in 1998.  The PHA is a key component of the  process safety management system and PWDs RMP accident prevention program.  It provided a thorough, orderly, systematic approach for identifying, evaluating, and controlling hazards posed by the chlorination and dechlorination processes.  The PHA utilized the what-if/PHA methodology in accordance with 29 C.F.R. ' 1910.119(e) and 40 C.F.R. ' 68.67.  \n\nThe PHA addressed: (1) hazards of the process; (2) engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards and their interrelationships such as appropriate application of detection methodologies to provide early warning of releases (e.g., process monitoring and control instrumentation with alarms); (3) consequences of failure of engineering and administrative controls; (4) facility siting; (5) human factors (human error); and (6) a qualitative evaluation of a range of the possible safety and health effects of failure of controls on the employees in the work place.\n\n4.

PWD makes all necessary information available to those persons responsible for compiling process safety information and those assisting in the development of the process hazard analysis.\n\nE. Five Year Accident History\n\nThe Portland plant has never experienced a release that requires reporting under the chemical accident prevention rule.\n\nF. Emergency Response Procedures and Policies\n\nPWDs wastewater treatment plant employees have been trained to control \"non-emergency\" incidents such as small, incidental spills and leaks.  Employees have been trained on confined space entry procedures and the proper use of personal protection equipment (PPE).  In the event of small fires, all plant employees are trained in the use of fire extinguishers.  Personnel have also been trained to notify the plant manager in the event of more extensive accidental releases.  The plant manager is responsible for assessment of the extent of the release, internal notification of the release and determination of whether or not outside responders are needed.  During an emergency, all PWD employees have been trained to evacuate to a predesignated muster point to assist outside emergency response teams.\n\nIn the event that an accidental release occurs that is beyond the capabilities of PWDs wastewater treatment plant employees to control, the plant depends on the the Portland Fire and Police Departments, and Med-Cu ambulance services for outside support.
