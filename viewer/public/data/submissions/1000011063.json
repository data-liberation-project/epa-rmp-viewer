Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Newfolden Co-op Elevator Association in Newfolden, Minnesota are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  We coordinate our response efforts with the Newfolden Fire Department, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous ammonia stored in one 30,000-gallon tank, five 1,500-gallon nurse tanks and twenty-nine 1,000- gallon nurse tanks at our facility in Newfolden, Minnesota (Figure 1).  The maximum amount stored is 56,525 gallons (290,877.7 pounds) at 85% standard maximum storage capacity including the capacity of the on-site nurse tanks.   The largest single storage vessel at our facility contains 131,223 pounds at 85% standard maximum storage capacity.\n\n  3.
