      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\nIntroduction \nChemicals are widely used in almost all industries, in the home, and in the environment.  They are transported on roadways, waterways, and railways.  The City of Kirkwood, Missouri?s Water Treatment Plant (WTP) also uses chemicals.  The WTP uses chlorine as a disinfectant to provide safe potable water to the citizens of Kirkwood.  The natural world contains more that 1,500 chlorine-containing compounds.  Human cells generate hypochlorite, a form of chlorine to fight infection.  It purifies our drinking water, disinfects our swimming pools and is truly life saving. The World Health Organization estimates that 25,000 children worldwide die every day from waterborne diseases resulting from the lack of a water disinfection agent such as chlorine.  \nStoring chemicals can be a hazard.  Kirkwood?s Water Department takes their safety obligations in storing and using chemicals as seriously as they take providing its customers safe disinfected potable water.  The following document describes what could happen if there were to be an accident, the steps taken everyday to ensure a safely operating plant, and procedures to follow in the unlikely event of an emergency.  \nRegulatory Background\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency?s (USEPA) Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 included provisions that require facilities that use certain substances to develop a formal plan to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release of the substances to the atmosphere and reduce the likelihood of serious harm to the public and the environment. Before these regulations were in place, the Kirkwood WTP had already established many of the components of the plan. The requirements of this plan, commonly referred to as a Risk Management Plan (RMP), are detailed and codified in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68.  The City of Kirkwood WTP stores gaseous chlorine in quantities above the regulatory thresholds at which a RMP is required, and thus, must co"

      "SummaryText": "mply with this regulation.\nChlorine Process Safety Systems\nThe WTP stores gaseous chlorine in 1-ton containers.  Gaseous chlorine is mixed with the treated plant service water and is introduced at strategic locations throughout the WTP process, including finished water transferred into the City?s water distribution system.  Chlorine is non-explosive and non-flammable.  However, similar to oxygen, it is capable of combustion under some circumstances.  In addition, it is an irritant to the respiratory system, eyes and skin.  Exposure through inhalation at high concentrations is toxic. To prevent accidental releases that may cause these injuries, the plant has several safety systems. These systems, along with the Prevention Program described below, greatly reduce the possibility of a significant release of chlorine occurring. One safety system is the chlorine ?leak detectors? that continuously monitor for leaks in the chlorine storage area.  Even the smallest of leaks activates alarms that immediately alert plant personnel and allow them to prevent a potential release of chlorine to the atmosphere.  In addition, sensors monitor the system pressures and temperatures to detect abnormal conditions that may indicate that a chlorine leak is about to occur. These monitors allow corrective actions to be taken before a leak may occur.\nThe WTP did experience an accidental release of chlorine in 1997.  No serious injuries but significant on-site damage resulted from the release.  Since the release, the City has installed additional mitigation devices that make another release event significantly less likely.\nComponents of the RMP\nThe RMP consists of three major parts. The first part is the Hazard Assessment. The Hazard Assessment is done to determine the effects that a release of a regulated substance could have on the public. The second part is a Prevention Program that consists of seven elements designed to improve the system safety and decrease the likelihood of a release. Th"

      "SummaryText": "e third part is the Emergency Response Program, which develops a plan for dealing with a release in the unlikely event that one would occur. \nHazard Assessment\nA Hazard Assessment was performed to determine the effects a release would have on the public. For chlorine, the distance to which a set endpoint concentration of the gas would travel must be determined.  In addition, an estimate of the population outside of the plant boundary that a release of chlorine would impact was determined, and sensitive receptors such as hospitals, schools, and parks were identified. The Hazard Assessment considers two release scenarios?a ?worst case? and an ?alternative case.? \nWorst-Case Scenario\nThe regulations require the development of a Worst-Case release scenario based on conservative assumptions. For example, it is required by USEPA to assume that the entire contents of the largest single container of chlorine will be released over 10 minutes. This is unlikely to occur since the properties of chlorine would cause a freeze and thaw cycle to occur at the leak, which would slow the release. In addition, only ?passive? mitigation methods such as buildings can be considered when determining the distance the release could travel. Passive mitigation, as defined, requires no mechanical, electrical, or human input. However, in many scenarios, mitigating the release by isolating the process could reduce the amount released. In addition, the worst-case scenario requires that conservative atmospheric conditions be assumed which results in a large area of impact. \nThe hazard assessment requires that the ?toxic endpoint? be determined.  Toxic endpoint is the distance from the point of release to a location at which the chemical concentration equals or exceeds a certain concentration. That concentration is defined as the maximum airborne concentration below which individuals could be exposed for up to 1 hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects, or"

      "SummaryText": " symptoms that could impair an individual?s ability to take protective action. Because the cloud from a chlorine leak would disperse relatively quickly, an individual at a toxic endpoint would be exposed to the exposure limit concentration for much less than the 1 hour assumed by the limit. In addition, the exposure limit concentrations result in relatively minor health effects. Therefore, an individual at the toxic endpoint would be affected less than the results of the worst-case scenario may imply. Using these assumptions, computer modeling estimated that the distance to the toxic endpoint would be 0.94 miles.\nAlternative Scenario\nThe RMP rule also requires that at least one alternative release scenario be evaluated. The alternative scenarios reflect a type of release that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario. Unlike the worst-case scenario, the alternative release scenario may consider ?active? mitigation such as shutoff valves and a more realistic release quantity and release rate. Active mitigation is defined as requiring mechanical, electrical, or human input. Lastly, it assumes local, typical meteorological conditions, which are more realistic than the conservative meteorological conditions that must be assumed for the worst-case scenario. An alternative release scenario for chlorine was a release of chemical through a container connection failure. This alternative release scenario is considered to be more representative of the effect likely in the event of a release. The distance that the alternative release of chlorine would travel was estimated to be 0.16 miles.\nPrevention Program\nThe Prevention Program, together with the Emergency Response Program, make up the RMP. The Prevention Program consists of seven elements designed to improve the system safety and decrease the likelihood of a release.\nSafety Information\nThe RMP regulations require that information concerning process chemicals, technology, and equipment be compiled as part of a RMP"

The information will be supplied to contractors who will work in the chlorine process area. All the required process safety information was compiled as required by the RMP regulations. The information meets and in many cases exceeds the minimum required by the regulations.\nProcess Hazard Review\nA process hazard review (PHR) was conducted systematically to evaluate potential causes and consequences of accidental releases. This information was used by Water Department staff to improve safety and reduce the consequences of accidental releases. The chlorine system PHR was conducted by Water Department staff familiar with the process operation, maintenance, and plant management with assistance from CH2M HILL. The review was done using a ?Checklist? method. Based on the results of the review, changes in operating, maintenance, and other process safety management procedures that would improve the overall safety of the chlorine system were identified. The changes that most effectively help prevent an accidental release have been implemented. \nOperating Procedures\nOperating procedures for the chlorination processes have been developed. Written operating procedures assure continuous, efficient, and safe operation of the facility. The goal of the operating procedures is to provide clear instructions to safely operate the process. Operating procedures are also used to train new employees and to provide refresher training for existing staff.\nThe detailed operating procedures include startup, shutdown and emergency operating procedures. The procedures describe how the system should be operated in order to minimize the chances of an accidental release. The procedures also emphasize safety considerations during operation and address hazardous situations that can occur and how to correct them.\nTraining\nAn effective RMP training program can significant"

Employees involved in operating or maintaining the chlorination process receive training that includes applicable operating and maintenance procedures and an overview of the process. Training must emphasize safety and health hazards and safe work practices.\nNew Kirkwood WTP staff receive six to eight weeks of on the job training.  Refresher courses are provided periodically to fortify the training.\nMaintenance\nAn effective maintenance program is one of the primary lines of defense against a release. The maintenance program also addresses equipment testing and inspection, preventative maintenance schedules, and training of personnel. The intent is to ensure that equipment used to process, store, or transfer chlorine is properly maintained and installed to minimize the risk of releases.\nThe Water Department staff performs preventative maintenance on the chlorination equipment on a scheduled basis.  Operational checks are performed every shift.  Once per week, the chlorine leak alarm systems and automatic valve operators are tested for functionality.  All maintenance activities are documented using a card system.  The Water Department staff performs corrective maintenance in the event of equipment malfunction or breakdown. Work orders indicate what safety precautions must be followed. All maintenance staff are trained how to properly and safely perform maintenance.\nIncident Investigation\nEach incident that resulted in or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release of chlorine must be investigated. A process to identify the underlying causes of incidents and implement procedures for preventing similar events has been developed. To investigate an incident, an investigation team will be established. As part of the investigation, an incident report will be prepared to recommend system changes to prevent the incident from occurring in the future.\nThe investigation team should ask questions such as "

On the incident report form, the Water Department Director identifies which of the recommended system changes are approved for implementation. The incident investigation report and any changes resulting from the report will be reviewed with all staff members who operate and maintain the applicable system. \nAn Incident Investigation was performed by the City after the release event of 1997.  The investigation led to a determination of the failed equipment, and the implementation of appropriate corrective measures.\nCompliance Audit\nThe WTP is required to complete a compliance audit for the RMP program. The primary goals of conducting a compliance audit are to gather sufficient data to verify compliance with RMP requirements and good process safety practices, identify process safety deficiencies and develop corrective actions, and increase safety awareness among plant staff.\nThe compliance audit methodology is modeled after the Occupational Safety and Health Administration?s (OSHA) guidelines for conducting regulatory Process Safety Management (PSM) compliance audits: Compliance Guidelines and Enforcement Procedures, OSHA Instruction CPL 2-2.45A (September 28, 1992). A compliance audit must be conducted at the plant at least once every 3 years for the chlorine process. An auditor knowledgeable in the covered processes, RMP requirements, and audit techniques will conduct the audits. The Water Department Director and the Plant Superintendent will promptly determine an appropriate corrective action for each deficiency identified during the audit and document the corrective actions and the dates by which they "
