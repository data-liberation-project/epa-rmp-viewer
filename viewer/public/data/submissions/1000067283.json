Several developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  We installed emergency shutdown and isolation systems for the unloading of railcars and tank trucks containing flammable products.   We have added cameras to view unloading operations and have the ability to remotely shut down the unloading process.  We also added additional deluge systems and improved our facility foam systems.  Revalidation of our Process Hazard Analysis, Operator Requalification, and continued development of the Advanced Integrated Management System (AIMS) are other major steps we have taken to further improve safety at our facility."

Investigation report findings are shared with all employees affected by the findings.  \r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\nBay-Pol has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years.  Due to our stringent prevention policies, there have been no releases of any RMP regulated chemicals at our facility that have had any impact on the community, the environment, or plant personnel.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nBay-Pol has a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of regulatory agencies and the public, on and offsite monitoring, as well as post-incident clean up of any affected areas.  The emergency response plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.  We coordinate our emergency plan with the Southeast Regional LEPC, our facility's Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  Bay-Pol has been an active member of the LEPC since purchasing the plant in 1992.  The planning effort of the LEPC helps ensure our emergency plan is coordinated with that of the local municipalities.  \r\n\r\nTo quickly and effectively respond to emergencies at our facility, Bay-Pol maintains both a mobile aerial foam truck and a fast attack truck onsite.  The entire plant is surrounded by an underground firewater header that will supply firewater from our 1.2 million gallon firewater storage tank.  In addition, our firewater system is also tied into the fire water system of the neighboring plant. This serves both as a backup to our system and offers additional firewater capacity if needed.

Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the contractor's safety performance is carried out.  Bay-Pol has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and our processes.  Contractors are also informed of all of the emergency response procedures should an accidental release occur.  \r\n\r\n7. Pre-Startup Safety Review - Pre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Bay-Pol.  These reviews are used to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup before ever placing equipment into operation.\r\n\r\n8. Mechanical Integrity - We have comprehensive preventive maintenance and mechanical integrity programs in place for the entire facility.  The program incorporates industry codes, procedures from federal and state regulations, and instructions provided by equipment manufacturers.  Bay-Pol carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operation.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\n9.

Long standing safety systems have enabled us to successfully manage the risks associated with these, and other potentially dangerous materials, with zero incidents resulting in any impact to the community or the environment .\r\n\r\nBackground\r\nBay-Pol is located in the Bayport Industrial District in Pasadena, TX.  TOTAL has owned and operated the facility since purchasing the HDPE Plant in 1992. However, the plant has transferred ownership to Bay-Pol on January 1st, 2018.  The facility currently provides jobs for 107 fulltime Bay-Pol employees and approximately 50 fulltime contract employees.  The facility consists of two HDPE production units, Bay 1 and Bay 2. The site also operates an additional production unit, called the Hydro Dearomatization (HDA) unit. This unit is not applicable to RMP regulations.  Bay-Pol has maintained an outstanding environmental and safety record through a commitment to operating our plant in a manner which is safe for our people and for our community.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\r\nWe are committed to conducting our activities with the highest regard for environmental, health, safety, and community well-being. Safety is integrated into all activities of all employees working at the Bay-Pol plant.  As a member of the American Chemistry Council (ACC), Bay-Pol is committed to the principles of Responsible Care.  Commitment to safety and the environment comes from top management, both on site and corporate.
