The program includes engineering, education, and enforcement provisions for hazard communication, spill prevention and response, hazardous waste, universal waste and waste oil management, waste water and stormwater management.\n\n\n\n2.  Emergency Response Program:  ConAgra Foods' facility has developed an OSHA hazardous substance emergency response program called HAZWOPER.  The HAZWOPER document contains detailed procedures for; 1. Pre-emergency planning and coordination; 2. personnel roles and lines of authority; 3. training; 4. communication; 5. emergency recognition and prevention; 6. safe distances and places of refuge; 7. site security and control; 8. emergency alerting and response; 9. ammonia decontamination; 10. emergency medical treatment and first aid; 11. critique of response and follow-up 12.  personal protective and emergency equipment; and 13. medical surveillance.\n\n\n\n3. Stationary Source and Regulated Substance:  ConAgra Foods is a food processing plant located at 3100 East Main Street, Russellville, AR.  The main building houses a processing plant used for mixing, cooking, conveying, freezing and packaging.  The processed products require refrigeration for processing and storage.  Anhydrous ammonia is the primary refrigerant used.  There are three ammonia refrigeration systems completely separate from each other.  \n\n\n\n4.  Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios:  RMP*Comp was used to calculate the worst case and alternative release scenarios for the processes.\n\n\n\n5.  Five Year Accident History: There have been no reportable incidents during the past five years.  However, the facility maintains records of all incident investigations reports regardless of anhydrous ammonia quantity released into the atmosphere.\n\n\n\n6.  Planned changes to improve safety:  Based on the Process Hazard Analysis "
