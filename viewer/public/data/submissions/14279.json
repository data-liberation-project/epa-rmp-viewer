Rochelle, Georgia facility, we handle anhydrous and aqueous ammonia, which are considered hazardous toxic substances by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  We also handle propane, which the EPA considers a hazardous flammable gas.  It is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling ammonia and propane to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ammonia and propane combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\nWe at Martin Resources, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulate substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with Wilcox Emergency Management which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\nFacility description and regulated substances handled \n\nThe Martin Resources, Inc. Rochelle, Georgia facility uses anhydrous ammonia in the manufacturing of aqueous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is delivered to the facility via rail car and is stored in aboveground storage tanks at the facility prior to process use.  The anhydrous ammonia is react"

The toxic endpoint for ammonia is 0.14 mg/L (200 PPM).  Based on 130,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia released, the distance the affects of a vapor cloud is expected to have no serious harm to the general public is 4.4-miles from the location of the storage tank.  The worst-case release scenario for aqueous ammonia yielded a release of 210,000 pounds and a toxic endpoint distance of 1.1-miles.\n\nThe EPA defines worst-case release scenario for flammable substances as the failure of our largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed.  The entire contents of the tank are assumed to release as a vapor cloud, which finds an ignition source.  Ten percent of the released quantity is assumed to participate in the resulting explosion.\n\nThis worst-case scenario as defined by the EPA is also highly unlikely to occur.  During the evaluation, the scenario assumes none of the facility's mechanical controls or safety systems are operational, assumes no emergency response efforts take place, and assumes it occurs under the worst weather conditions.  \n\nMartin Resource, Inc. has incorporated a company policy that limits the maximum filling capacity of all propane storage tanks to 88% at 60:F.  Therefore, our worst-case release scenario would result in a release of 110,000 pounds of propane from a 30,000-gallon storage tank.\n\nBased on 110,000 pounds of propane released, RMP*Comp\u0019 calculated the distance the affects of a vapor cloud explosion is expected to have no serious harm to the general public is 0.4-mile from the location of the storage tank.\n\nThe EPA states an alternative release scenario as a release that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario and will reach an endpoint off-site.  Active and passive mitigation systems may be considered for the alternative release scenario.\n The alternative release scenario for anhydrous"
