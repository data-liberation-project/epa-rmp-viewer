              "Description": "The T reactor system encompasses anhydrous ammonia and superphosphoric acid reacted together in a stainless steel pipe where the ammonia neutralizes the acid.  The product is duluted with water in a holding portion of the system where the material is recycled over a cooling system that returns to the pool.  The objective is to achieve a finished product of a neutralized ammonium polyphosphate solution at a pH of .612 and at a temperature of 78 degress plus or minus 5 degrees to storage.  Prevention of entrainment in the cooling system is achieved by passing the fluid over a screening system where air moving in the opposite direction results in a partial part of the cooling.  Care of preventing entrainment moving out of the system is with a water spray system that flows counter to the air movement over the screening and palls such that only steam exists in the plume.\n\nThis is a continuous flow system where anhydrous ammonia is handled by a monitoring system that matches the rate of use by the rate of the acid and water being added to the system.  We have continuous monitoring of pH and specific gravity to assure that the product is on proper specification in the making of 10-34-0.  The ammonia system has the proper schedule 80 pile relief valves and pressure gauges and temperature gauges going into the system which at steady state the pressure is at approximately 6 lbs. and the ammonia has been vaporized in the heat exchanger with the finished product going in the opposite direction to storage.\n\nThe entire T reactor unit that we designed and own is on a stainless steel floor with curbing on the side to contain any leakage in the sysem where it can be returned to the pool within the convertor.  The system operates on a buddy basis where 2 qualified operators are on hand at the site and both have the qualifications to turn off and start the units.  We have operated with 3 T reactors within the company, one in Janesville, Wisconsin, one in Hampton, Iowa, and one in Durant, Iowa.  We have had experience at all 3 places since 1975 and 1985 and have never had an ammonia release.  A major concern of management is that the system is designed that if either acid or ammonia are interrupted in their flow that the constant monitoring of both the gallons per minute of all products as well as the pH and specific gravity will immediately tell the operators that the system needs to be shut down.  The concern is not a release of ammonia or acid but rather a plugging up of the system because of the very low or very high pH that results from an interruption of one or two of the raw materials.  The operators are all trained to shut down, flush the system, repair the cause of the interruption and proceed again.",

The Facility Policy:  The owners, management and employees of Twin State, Inc.,\n are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training of all persons that work with ammonia.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nThe administration of Twin State is located in its central office at 3541 East Kimberly Road, Davenport, Iowa, and has the responsibility for the oversight and administration of all activities on the Janesville, Wisconsin, property.  Therefore, the officers of Twin State are responsible for the administrative controls that include the following:\n\nThe review of right to know and procedures to follow with respect to all raw materials on the Janesville property, the dangers involved to personnel and to properties beyond that of Twin State, that includes the notification to the Fire Department in Janesville, Wisconsin, and notification to the Rock County Emergency Planning group and the Department of Natural Resources for the state of Wisconsin.\n\nAt the present time, the oversight administration is chaired by R. Hovey Tinsman, Jr., at the Davenport office with the assistance of Joe Grell, manager of all processing at the Durant property and local process manager, Josh Jackson.\n\nWith respect to mitigation measures to limit the distance of products on the property, it should be noted that anhydrous ammonia is a gas when vaporized at ambient conditions and, therefore, is only protected by dilution in the air and is assisted by the plant being located on 5 acres of property, at a distance in excess of 1 mile from the nearest farm residents, and located 10 miles from "

Facility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the reacting of ammonia \nwith phosphoric acid to make intermediate ammoniated phosphate solutions that are upgraded to mixed grade fertilizers.  The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia stored would be 140,196 pounds in the facilityA?s one 30,000 gallon storage tank filled to 85% capacity.\n\nThere are no additional nurse tanks on the property for any additional storage of anhydrous ammonia since the products use is only for ammoniation of phosphoric acid as part of the plant process and is not used for direct application.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is delivered from time to time in rail cars.  The tank capacity of the rail car is 30,000 gallons filled to an 85% capacity and the tank car has a maximum weight of 140,196 pounds of product.  Inasmuch as the annual ammonia consumption is represented by 30 cars of anhydrous ammonia and the normal time on the property would be 2 or 3 days, there usually is only 1 car on the property at any given time.\n\nWith respect to worse case scenario, a rail car of ammonia would have the same conditions as the storage vessel into which the ammonia is transferred.\n\nSecondary purposes of the property are to provide nitrogen solution storage that is reshipped to distribution centers and to provide the necessary raw materials to make potash and micronutrient additions for N-P-K-S-Zn finished product grades.\n\n3.    The Worst-Case Release Scenario would be the release of the total contents of the \nstorage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 140,196 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank.  This was calculated by multiplying the water capacity of the storage tank by 4.6732, which represents the pounds of ammonia per gallon of water tank capacity.  The distance to the dispersion endpoint based on the DEGADIS Model is 2.68 miles.\n\nThe  Alternative-Case Release Scenario is assumed to be a release fr"

The distance to the endpoint of dispersion is 1.2 miles.\n\nAdditional major hazards include vandalism and vehicular accident.  The storage vessel for anhydrous ammonia is protected by a steel barrier from invasion by vehicle.  With respect to protection against vandalism, the tank is locked and there are no hose connections but rather it is piped to the reactor with permanently-mounted piping.\n\n4.     The Accidental Release Program:  The facility complies with the Rules and \nRegulations relating to The Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions, Equipment, Containers and Storage Facilities.  These regulations are administered by the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture consistent with ANSI K61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n5.      The Five-Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of \nanhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site.  To our knowledge, there have been no accidental releases that have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6.    The Emergency Response Program:  The facility has a written action plan in \naccordance with OSHA standard CFR 1910.38 and provided state and local authorities and emergency planning and committee right to know information as required under SARA Title III of EPCRA.  Our emergency action plan has been reviewed with the local fire department and provided to the local emergency planning committee for coordination in the community response planning.\n\n7.  Upgrade:  The plan has been upgraded from the original risk management plan required of 1999 to further include safety information, operating procedures, training, maintenance, incident investigation, compliant audits and emergency action in order to "

Planned Changes to Improve Safety:  Safety improvements are an ongoing process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations.  There are no additional specific anhydrous safety recommendations for implementation at this time.  \n\nThe type of competency testing used is a personal review by the Durant plant manager who has the responsibility for processing procedures for all production properties, Joe Grell.  Training practices are based on a two-man buddy system involved with the processing and ammonia transfer under the guidance of Mr. Jackson.  No one on the property is allowed to be involved in ammonia transfer and use other than those assigned for processing by Mr. Jackson which at this time involves only three people.\n\nThis plan is to be reviewed annually and signed off on by members of the staff at the Janesville plant.  This would include a statement of annual meeting with the local emergency planning committee of Janesville and county government at Janesville in Rock County, Wisconsin."
