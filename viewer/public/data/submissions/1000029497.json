              "Description": "The Chlorine/Sulfur Dioxide Systems of WWTP is subject to comply with EPA Prevention Program 3.  This is based on the worst case release scenario analysis results from both the Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide Systems being subject to OSHA's PSM rule, 29 CFR 1910.119 and  EPA's RMP 40-CFR-68.  The City of Frederick accidental releaseprevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices, and it is in compliance with all applicable EPA and OSHA Prevention Program requirements.  This section describes the EPA and OSHA requirements the City has fulfilled as operator of our Frederick WWTP. The plan also includes the prevention steps taken beyond this regulatory requirement.  The City of Frederick?s WWTP?s Document Management System (DMS) contains in it the key OSHA/EPA document which details the operation of the prevention program.\n\nThe City of Frederick accidental release prevention program is based on OSHA PSM program and EPA RMP Level 3 prevention program (described above in section 1.1.2).  The plant has an emergency response program, which is coordinated (reviewed by) with the City of Frederick Fire Department, which is a member of Local Emergency Response Planning Committee (LEPC) along with Fort Detrick's HazMat Team.  This program includes an emergency response decision tree and a notification plan.  Emergency response drills and drill evaluations are conducted annually by the operating department.  Emergency operation and response procedures are also reviewed at that time.  To ensure the public's safety evacuation may be required during a major release.  Evacuation will begin with a minimum of 1.3 mile radius from the source.  The incident commander is advised to evacuate up to 4 miles radius based on the circumstances of the catastrophic release.  This is three times the distance recommended by the EPA Guidance.  Besides the specific emergency response program, key elements of the prevention programs are incorporated in the operating culture of the City of Frederick plant by the following:\n\nHigh level of involvement in every aspect of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide system operations including participation in : \n\n    Safety committee \n\n        Chlorine PSM/RMP safety teams, \n\n    Development of the operation procedures, \n\n    Hazard evaluations,\n\n    Process Hazards Analysis, and\n\n    on-going training of the operators and other involved staff.\n\nPreventive maintenance and mechanical integrity programs ensure the safe operation of the equipment and systems.\n\nUse of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment that meets and/or  exceeds industry and regulatory standards.\n\nUse of accurate and effective operating procedures written with the participation of the operators.  These documents are all controlled by City of Frederick WWTP document control system.\n\nManagement of all changes to the procedures, equipment and chemicals used by the City of Frederick on the site.  Again, the document control system is key to the high quality of the operation and its products.\n\nPerformance of a hazard review of equipment, plant, and procedures\n\nImplementation of an audit and inspection program.\n\nChemical-specific prevention features of the plant include:  1).  the chlorine/sulfur dioxide building ventilation systems, 2).  chlorine and sulfur dioxide detectors and alarm system, 3).  Use of full face chlorine SCBA respirator worn by the operators during connection and disconnection of either the chlorine or sulfur dioxide ton containers, 4).  The availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) in the event of a HHC leak, 5).  employee training in operations and maintenance with emphasis on awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine and sulfur dioxide, 6).  Participation of the Frederick-Risk Coordinator and Fire department in site safety evaluations.\n\nThe City of Frederick has in use: policies, procedures and systems as part of their prevention program.  The program addresses each of  the EPA Program level 3 listed 12 elements, plus  RMP elements and OSHA rules needed to implement the program, and similar elements in place in the plant's OSHA PSM program.  These are maintained in the City of Frederick WWTP document control system under the Key Document listed below:\n\nElement Title    EPA 68 #    OSHA 1910-119 #\n\n    Management System    15    (a&e)\n\n    Process safety information    65    ( d )\n\n    Process hazard analysis    67    ( e )\n\n    Operating procedures    69    ( f )\n\n    Training    71    ( g )\n\n    Mechanical integrity    73    ( j )\n\n    Management of change    75    ( l )\n\n    Pre-startup review    77    ( i )\n\n    Compliance audits    79    ( o )\n\n    Incident investigation    81    ( m )\n\n    Employee participation    83    ( c )\n\n    Hot work permit    85    ( k )\n\n    Contractors    87    ( h )\n\n    Emergency Response    95    (n)\n\n    Trade Secrets    N/A    ( p )\n\nThe OSHA PSM elements which are like the RMP elements (above) of the response plan have been in place.  The program is tailored to the City of Frederick Water Plant #1 and to the emergency response services available in the Frederick, Maryland community.  Finally, the plant is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements as well as Maryland Vulnerability",

The plant is boarded by  Gas House Pike to the north and north east, the City of Frederick Golf Course to the east, the Frederick Municipal Airport to the south and farm land to the west.\n\nThe Plant includes a separate highly hazardous chemical storage building that includes a control room as well as pump room.  The building is mounted over the chlorination contact chambers.\n\nThe boundaries of the highly hazardous chemical system subject to the RMP regulation include the ton chlorine and sulfur dioxide Chemical Storage Room, the Feed Control room that houses the chemical control and injection systems, and the Hydro Tank Room which has one injection point.  Chlorine is also fed to the head of each of the two contact chambers, and sulfur dioxide is fed to the inlet of the dechlorination contact chamber. These are detailed in the Block Flow as well as the Process and Instrument Drawings (P&ID) which are part of the plant Process Safety Information (PSI).  All drawings are maintained in the plant's RMP Process Safety Information.\n\n1.6.1.    REGULATED SUBSTANCE (b) (2)\n\nChlorine and sulfur dioxide are the only regulated substances on site which exceeds the EPA 40 CFR-68 rule threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds and 5,000 pounds respectively.

      "SummaryText": "he Monocacy River.  The WWTP operates under permit from the State of Maryland Department of the Environment.  The chlorine and sulfur dioxide are received, stored and distributed to the WWTP wastewater process control systems. \n\nChlorine is an EPA and OSHA-listed toxic chemical.  It is an irritant and it is corrosive.  It is a halogen with the formula Cl2.  It is a chlorinating or oxidizing agent that is not flammable.  It has a one ppm OSHA ceiling Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) and a NFPA health rating of four, severe; with immediate and delayed health hazards.  Chlorine is not a carcinogen.  The maximum inventory stored on site is eight each, one ton containers.  This equals 16,000 pounds.\n\nSulfur dioxide is also an EPA and OSHA-listed toxic chemical.  It is an irritant and also corrosive.  Its formula is SO2 and in combination with water forms sulfuric acid.  It reacts with chlorine to form a salt and is used to scavenge the excess chlorine in the wastewater process.  It has a five PPM OSHA PEL.  The NFPA health rating is a three.  The maximum inventory stored on site is six each one-ton containers.  This equals 12,000 pounds.\n\n \n\n\n\n2.    HAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nA hazard assessment was performed to determine the effects a release would have on the public and environment. For both chlorine and sulfur dioxide, the distance to a set endpoint concentration of the gas would travel was determined.  In addition, an estimate of the population that could be affected by a release of highly hazardous chemicals was determined, and sensitive receptors such as nursing homes were identified.  The hazard assessment considers two release scenarios-a \"worst case\" and an \"alternative case\". \n\nTwo offsite consequence analyses were conducted.  The first is a \"worst case release\".  The second is a more probable \"alternative release scenario\".  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \"the operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a "

The alternative scenario is defined \"more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario\".\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling was performed to determine the distance traveled by a chlorine release before its concentration decreases to the \"toxic endpoint.\"  The EPA- specified endpoint for highly hazardous chemical is 0.0087 mg/l which equals 3 ppm. The 3 ppm endpoint is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  The sulfur dioxide endpoint is 0.0078 mg/l which equals about 3 ppm.  These levels are defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the \"maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\"  The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance was defined, \"to estimate the population potentially affected.\"\n\n2.1.    WORST CASE   (C) (1)\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling for the worst case scenario was performed using the EPA assumptions and EPA's RMP Comp Program.  Results demonstrate a distance to the toxic endpoint for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide of 1.3 miles containing 5.3 square miles of area assuming an urban topography without an enclosure.  The residential population that could potentially be affected by the release is one individual based on the U. S. Census 2010 demographic data.  This data is kept on site in our process safety information.  All receptors were listed per the 2000 census data.\n\n2.2.    ALTERNATIVE CASE   (C) (2)\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the failure of the regulator of the pressure system or the pipes and valves connected to one of the one-ton containers.  This failure was defined during the recent Process Hazards Analysis.  This failure is equal to creating "

ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM (D)\n\nThe City of Frederick WWTP accidental release prevention program is based on OSHA's PSM program and EPA's RMP Level 3 prevention program.  The PSM program has been in place and has been effectively used for many years.  It is part of the plant's operating culture.  There are two parts to the program.  The first is the general overall City of Frederick WWTP Division-wide program and the City of Frederick WWTP Treatment Plant site-specific program.  The second is the chlorine or sulfur dioxide specific actions within the site program.  This is coordinated with the Frederick County LEPC and the City of Frederick Fire/Rescue Department (including the Ft. Detrick Haz Mat Team).\n\n3.1.    GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM   (D) (1)\n\nPlant-wide, many elements of the prevention program are used for all operations.  An overview of the generally written programs is listed below:\n\nThe City of Frederick WWTP has detailed process safety information on each of its operations. \n\nThe document maintenance system is integral to the management of change for all operations on site control.  \n\nTraining is the backbone of employee knowledge, job operations and is ongoing in each area.  Employee training in operations and maintenance emphas awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of all chemicals used. Refresher training is conducted annually.\n\nMaint"

The storage, hydro and control building rooms are equipped with forced ventilation systems.  There is a separate area monitor for chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  One for each will be found inside the storage room and one each in the control room.  If a highly hazardous chemical is detected, the monitor alarms and shuts down the forced air ventilation system.  It also starts the building chemical vent system.  Both monitors alarm in their local area as well as in the WWTP Main Control Room. \n\n3.2.3.    Equipment Design\n\nBoth chlorine and sulfur dioxide have two types of pipe systems, high pressure and low (vacuum) pressure.  The high pressure chemical piping system is made of chemical compatible steel pipes, copper or other like compatible components.  There are also non-metallic compounds (not corroded by chlorine or sulfur dioxide) all are rated to 500 psig.  The maximum pressure of the highly hazardous chemical in the high pressure system is only 150 psig giving a 3-to-1 safety factor.  There are two sets of four each one-ton containers on each chlorine line.  A vacuum check regulator is mounted on the top (vapor) angle valve of each ton container.  This valve opens when a vacuum from the control system is applied to it.  Upon opening chlorine vapor flows from the ton container into the vacuum check regulator and enters the manifold that carries it to the control system.  One bank is in service and the other is on standby.  An automatic switch over system places the standby ton containers on line when the ones in service are empty.  The sulfur dioxide is piped similarly however it only has three each, one- ton containers per set.\n\nThe low pressure system operates under a vacuum pressure of 13 inches of mercury.  There is a pressure relief valve which vents if the pressure in the line reaches above "
