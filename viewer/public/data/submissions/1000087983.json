              "Description": "Eastman Chemical Resins Inc. has fully implemented a PSM program for all applicable units at the Jefferson Plant.  This includes all resin production units.  The PSM program assures compliance to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard, Process Safety Management (29 CFR 1910.119).  This is a proactive system to identify, evaluate, and minimize or prevent unwanted releases of chemicals that could occur as a result of failures in processes, procedures, or equipment.  It is intended to minimize the potential of an incident which could have a major impact on employees, contractors, the community, or lead to a significant business interruption.\n\n\n\nThe Process Safety Management standard applies to processes that involve chemicals at or above threshold quantities specified in Appendix A of the 29 CFR 1910.119 and processes that involve flammable liquids or gases on-site in one location, in quantities of 10,000 pounds or more.  The management program provides the organization structure for the program to include the roles and responsibilities of the PSM program, Health Safety Environment and Security Department, Process Engineering Department, and the Human Resources Department.  Employees attend and participate in regular safety meetings and Behavior-based safety meetings where they are informed of changes in plant policies and procedures, and basic safety principles are reviewed.  Employees are involved in any formal incident investigation team.  Wageroll employees are involved in every Process Hazards Analysis.  Audits and reviews of safety procedures are accomplished by performing Behavioral Job Analyses and audits and reviews of safety and operating procedures to maintain ISO quality systems and Responsible Care Management systems usually involves at least one wageroll employee and one supervisor.\n\n\n\nJefferson Plant Process Safety information is readily available through several databases including an online and hard copy Hazard Communication system for MSDS's.  Mechanical Equipment specifications and preventative maintenance records are also maintained.  Information pertaining to the technology of the process including block flow diagrams, process chemistry, maximum inventories, safe operating limits, and evaluation of the consequence of process upsets are documented in the PHA reviews is documented in the PSM database. Information pertaining to the equipment in the process: materials of construction, piping and instrument diagrams, and area electrical classifications is maintained.\n\n\n\nSafety systems, including interlocks, detection, and suppression systems are employed. The Plant has a supervised alarm system that is activated from the pull stations located throughout the plant.  The coded alarm signals the area and sub-area that has the fire.  The fire horns sound the alarm as well as signal on all plant radios.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Interlocks, both hardware and software, are included in each unit.  These interlocks are documented in the PHA documentation as they relate to specific process upsets and avoidance of undesired consequences.  Excess flow valves prevent high rate releases from occurring outside the storage areas for 2-Methylpropene (Isobutylene) and Ammonia.\n\n\n\nPHA analyses are conducted on a schedule to ensure that every aspect of the manufacturing process is evaluated every five years.  The results of these analyses are accessible online and in HSES Department files.\n\n\n\nOperating procedures and practices are documented as Jefferson Work Instructions located on the LAN system.  These procedures are revewed annually.  These unit specific procedures include safety specific instructions (such as Confined Space Entry and the Lockout Procedure).  Work instructions and procedures on the LAN are available to all employees and are categorized for ease of use.   Behavioral Job Analyses (BJA's)and ISO audits are used to verify that the procedures are current and applicable to the operation.\n\n\n\nEmployee training is conducted initially and on an on-going schedule consistent with each job classification's requirements.\n\n\n\nThe Jefferson Plant Contractor Safety Work Rules Work Instruction can be found on the LAN.  This procedure is reviewed in an interactive session with each contractor before they can begin work on the plant.  Two levels of contractor safety training are provided depending on whether the contractor will perform work in the plant (piping or electrical for example) or is delivering materials or services (water delivery or sales service for example). All other applicable plant safety procedures (such as confined space entry or hot work) are also reviewed before the contractor can start work on the plant.  In addition to participating in the Contractor Safety Training session, contractors are tested on their knowledge of the training and receive a handbook detailing specific safety requirements.  This review is updated with each contractor at least, verified by written documentation and included in the contractor access/badging program.\n\n\n\nThe Jefferson Plant PSM Mechanical Integrity Plan outlines the requirements to comply with paragraph (j), Mechanical Integrity of OSHA PSM 1910.119.  This regulation applies to the following process equipment: Pressure vessels & storage tanks, Piping systems, Relief & vent systems and devices, Emergency shutdown systems, Controls, and Pumps.  It requires Written Procedures, Training on Process Maintenance Activities, Testing & Inspection, correction of Equipment Deficiencies, and Quality Assurance that both the installation of new equipment and the repairs/installation of existing equipment are suitable for the process application.\n\n\n\nThe Jefferson Plant Operating Area Welding Permit and Open Flame Permit, and Safe Work Permit procedures can be found on the LAN.\n\n\n\nThe OSHA Process Safety Management rule requires that all changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures, and facilities related to covered processes are managed.  This management process must include documentation of the technical basis of the change, the impact on health and safety (including risk assessment), modifications to procedures, time period (if not permanent), authorization requirements (approval of the change), and communication of changes to affected employees.  This includes changes to process chemicals, operating procedures, maintenance procedures, equipment, process specifications, control strategy, and facility. All process changes are documented in the Management of Change database or in capital project papers.\n\n \n\nAll incidents and near-misses on the Jefferson Plant are reported to Area Supervisors, Shift Supervisors or the HSES Department.  These incidents are discussed with the person reporting the incident and documented on an incident investigation form.  The form is routed to the responsible supervisor for investigation.  When appropriate, a root cause analysis is performed and required action items are documented and followed up on.  The Jefferson Site Leadership Team reviews results of these investigations.",

Fusible links which melt in a fire at the hydrogen storage area as well as piping all vents and reliefs to a safe location \n\n\n\nThe five-year accident history\n\n\n\nThe Jefferson Site experienced one accident in the past five years.  The incident occurred on June 6, 2015 and involved the release of 150 lbs. of 1,3-pentadiene.  Residents were instructed to shelter in place as a precautionary measure.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program\n\n\n\nThe Jefferson Site maintains an on-site Emergency Response Team which is trained to respond to fires, accidental releases, and confined space entry rescues.  The site also maintains a fire truck, a confined space rescue vehicle, and a hazmat response vehicle which are always available on site"
