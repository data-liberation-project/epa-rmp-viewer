Chlorination is considered to be the most important process for preventing the spread of waterborne disease in drinking water.  The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) also uses chlorine for drinking water disinfection purposes to protect public health per state and federal water quality standards.  Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations.  The LADWP takes safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as it takes in providing safe drinking water.  The LADWP has been operating the Upper Stone Canyon Chlorination Station (USCS) since 1986. The USCS is a chlorination facility that stores and uses anhydrous chlorine for disinfection purposes.  The LADWP made significant improvements to the chlorination facility to further enhance the safety of the chlorine handling process.  The modified chlorination facility is in operation since 2008. The Upper Stone Canyon Chlorination Station chlorine handling process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and Plan, and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program regulations.  The facilities subject to the EPA and CalARP regulations are required to prepare and update Risk Management Plans (RMPs). An update is required at least once every five years from the date of its initial submission.  An update is also required within six months of a change that alters the Program Level that applied to any covered process. The RMP is to include policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility and the actions taken by the facility in an event of an emergency.\r\n\r\nA Risk Management Plan for the Upper Stone Canyon Chlorination Station was prepared in June 1999 that was updated in June 2004 and November 2007.

The LADWP has prepared an Emergency Response Plan for the Upper Stone Canyon Chlorination Station to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.  The Emergency Response Plan has been coordinated with the local response agency (City of Los Angeles Fire Department). The Upper Stone Canyon Chlorination Station has a good record in preventing accidents from happening.\r\n\r\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\r\nThe Upper Stone Canyon Chlorination Station is located at 1900 North Stone Canyon Road in Los Angeles, California.  There are multiple chlorine feed points on the reservoir complex property to disinfect water in Upper and Lower Stone Canyon Reservoirs, the Upper Stone Canyon bypass pipelines #1 and #2, and the membrane filtration plant.  The treated waters are piped into the distribution network, which serves parts of west Los Angeles with potable water.  The station building consists of a chlorine storage room, chlorine equipment room, an electrical equipment room, several chemical storage rooms, and a 4,700-lb capacity dry media scrubber room.  The facility stores chlorine, a regulated toxic substance under the EPA and CalARP Program rules.  The Upper Stone Canyon Chlorination Station stores a maximum of 22 one-ton chlorine containers.  Ten of these containers can be connected to the chlorination process to feed chlorine liquid or gas.  The maximum quantity of chlorine present at the Upper Stone Canyon Chlorination Station at any given time exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the EPA and CalARP regulations.  It also exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the federal and California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Cal OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standards.

Thus, the LADWP Upper Stone Canyon Chlorination Station is not subject to federal or California OSHA PSM regulations.\r\n\r\nThe design incorporates two banks of four one ton-containers each, which normally feed liquid chlorine to evaporators.  There is an automatic switchover system that determines which liquid chlorine header feeds the evaporators.  This system consists of a control panel, two motorized ball valves, and a pressure switch on the liquid header before the evaporators.  When the pressure in the liquid chlorine supply line drops to 20 psi, the switchover system opens the valve isolating the standby bank of ton containers to allow liquid chlorine to flow.  At the same time, it closes the ball valve on the now empty bank of ton containers.\r\n\r\nThe system is also configured with gas headers for each of the two banks of four one ton-containers.  This is essentially a complete gas feed system with automatic switchover capability.  It can be used during periods of low chlorine demand, or if the liquid system is out of service for repairs.  It has been provided because of the uncertainty of operations at this site in the future.\r\nSince the normal operation is by withdrawing liquid chlorine, and the evaporators are equipped with motorized vacuum regulating valves downstream, it is possible for the gas supply to the chlorinators to be automatically shut off at the vacuum-regulating valve.  These valves can close upon a low temperature condition in the evaporator or at the valve, or upon power failure.  For this reason, in order to assure no interruptions of chlorine feed, a third bank of two one-ton containers is provided.  These two one-ton containers connect to a gas header which leads to three automatic switchover type vacuum regulating valves in parallel acting as an automatic backup gas supply.  The vacuum regulating valves have a capacity of 3,000 ppd each, for a total feed capacity of 9,000 ppd"

      "SummaryText": ".  The valves open automatically based on a high vacuum condition that pulls the valve out of its detent position.  Since this is a mechanical setting on each separate valve, and the settings are not exactly the same, it is likely that not all of the valves will open at once.  One would open, followed by a second and then a third if the feed demand is great enough.  With only two one-ton containers supplying this gas manifold, the sustainable gas feed rate is only about 800 ppd due to the inherent physical properties of chlorine.  Therefore, when it comes on line it must be considered an emergency supply only.  A quick response from an operator is needed to come to the station and either get the liquid system back on line, or else start shedding chlorine feed (such as shore feeds) to a rate that can be sustained from two gas containers.  Other options include placing one or both of the primary banks of four one-ton containers each on their gas header systems.  This emergency backup is intended for only an hour or so of feed before intervention.\r\n\r\nThe gaseous chlorine from the evaporators or from the chlorine gas header proceeds to the chlorinators that regulate the flow of chlorine.  Chlorine gas from the vacuum regulating valve with check-relief units is pulled by vacuum to the chlorinators and then to the injectors.  It is important to note that in case of loss of vacuum downstream of the vacuum regulating valve with check-relief units, air would be drawn in rather than chlorine gas being released. In addition, the vacuum regulating valve with check-relief unit will shut down the chlorine supply to the chlorinator, operating as a shut-off valve. \r\n\r\nA dry media type chlorine gas scrubber system (main scrubber) is installed at the station.  The unit is actuated by chlorine detectors at a chlorine concentration of 3 ppm.  The scrubber can neutralize up to 4,700 lbs of chlorine in case of a chlorine leak.

The MS is an emergency chlorine scrubber intended to protect personnel working in the building or immediate area from a chlorine gas release from the pressure safety relief vent provided in the vacuum regulator check units. Mini-scrubber can neutralize up to 25 lbs of chlorine, and the media manufacturer specifies chlorine removal to less than 5 parts per billion.\r\n\r\nAll the one-ton containers connected to the process are equipped with Halogen actuators which shut the ton container valves when desired.  These actuators close all eight ton-containers (two banks of four each) that are connected to either the liquid or gas headers when any of the chlorine gas sensors in the chlorine container or chlorinator rooms detect gas exceeding 10 ppm.  \r\n\r\nThe chlorinators supply gaseous chlorine to each of the Upper Reservoir, the two bypass lines, the Lower Reservoir, and the membrane filtration plant injection systems.  Chlorine gas is withdrawn from the chlorinators under vacuum to the injectors.  In the injectors, chlorine mixes with a high-pressure water supply to form a concentrated solution.  The chlorine solution discharged from the injector is diffused into the pipelines or the reservoirs through multiple diffuser nozzles.  The Stone Canyon Complex injection system has eighteen injectors spread out among seven vaults, at various locations throughout the complex.\r\n\r\nSeven chlorine leak sensors are provided in the station to detect chlorine leaks.  The sensors are located in the chlorine container and chlorinator rooms, as well as from the scrubber inlet and outlet ducts.  The detectors signal an alarm by activating a f"
