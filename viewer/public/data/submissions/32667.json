With respect to the community outside of StanChem, StanChem is also committed to communicating with and maintaining awareness by all concerned persons regarding the Company?s commitment to environmental, health and safety principles.\r\n\r\nThe Company holds each of its employees responsible and accountable for compliance with these policies.\r\n\r\nThe facility and the regulated substances handled\r\n\r\nStanChem has three divisions:\r\n\r\n1)  The Specialty Coating division, which manufactures a diverse group of plastisols, specialty adhesives, printing inks, pigmented dispersions and high\u001eperformance coatings;\r\n\r\n2)  The Albi division, which is a pioneer in the fire-protective coating industry, and continues to be a leading manufacturer of innovative, high-performance fire-retardant and fire-resistant coatings; and\r\n\r\n3)  The Polymer division, which manufactures a broad line of polymers for a variety of industries including paint, paper, adhesive and building products.\r\n\r\nStanChem currently uses only one regulated substance subject to EPA?s Risk Management Program (RMP).  That substance is vinyl acetate, a monomer used in the majority of our polymer products.  This material is stored on site in a 20,000 gallon tank.  The tank is equipped with level indicators, audible and visible high-level alarms, and sits within secondary containment (dike)\r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario and alternative release scenario\r\n\r\nPursuant to the RMP regulations and guidance, the worst-case scenario involving vinyl acetate has been identified as the entire contents of a full vinyl acetate storage tank emptying into the dike.  It has been conservati"

According to the software, the radius of effect is a 0.7 mile around StanChem.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario is a leak in the transfer hose from a vinyl acetate tanker truck.  It has been conservatively assumed that a maximum of 5400 lbs. could be released over a 3-hour period in such a scenario.  The model used is the EPA?s RMP*Comp software.  According to the software, the radius of effect is 0.1 miles.  \r\n\r\nStanChem believes that as a practical matter, the potential for either of these scenarios to occur is extremely small, given the multiple safeguards and controls against such incidents at the facility, and StanChem?s many years of operation without such incidents.\r\n\r\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical\u001especific prevention steps\r\n\r\nStanChem?s accidental release prevention program includes numerous safeguards and controls to prevent or limit the effects of an incident such as the worst-case scenarios discussed above.  With regard to unloading of vinyl acetate monomer into the facility?s storage tanks, these safeguards and controls include, but are not limited to:  a vapor recovery system to direct monomer vapors back into the tanker truck; an emergency recovery tank under the unloading pad to trap dripped or spilled monomer; secondary containment dike around the tank; multiple high-level alarms on the tanks; and a ?scrubber? treatment system to handle any vapors from potential excess pressure in the tank during loading.  \r\n\r\nSafeguards and controls for the pumping of monomer from the storage tanks to pre-emulsion tanks and subsequently to polymerization reactors include:  equipment grounding and bonding; automated material delivery and cut-off valves; pressure and temperature monitors and alarms; check valves.   A ?kill solution? (reaction inhibitor) to stop a polymerization reaction; rupture disks; and treatm"

Other controls for the polymerization process include:  automatic and manual shut-offs; back-up pump; and a purge system to promote consistent and complete polymerization.   \r\n\r\nIn addition to, and as a supplement to RMP measures, StanChem maintains and implements numerous material management, reporting, and other requirements pursuant to the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) Title III and Tier II programs, the OSHA Process Safety Management program, annual and biannual waste reporting requirements, and various other state and federal regulations and reporting requirements.  Our employees are trained in Chemical Safety and Hygiene, chemical handling, first-responder emergency response, and other training designated by federal and state regulators.  StanChem continuously seeks to identify and assess potential ways to reduce waste, increase productivity, and improve protection of the safety and health of its employees and the public.\r\n\r\nFive-year accident history\r\n\r\nDue to careful planning and the training and diligence of StanChem supervisors and employees, StanChem has had no accidental releases in the past five years.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response program\r\n\r\nStanChem has coordinated with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC), fire department, police department, area hospital, utility companies, and StanChem?s emergency response contractor to handle a potential emergency at the facility and related communications to the public.
