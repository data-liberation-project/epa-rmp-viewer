The final treatment process is disinfection of the treated effluent.  The facility uses chlorine for this process.\n\nThe Risk Management Program is a Federal Regulation that affects facilities that use, make or store certain amounts of regulated chemical.  The rule requires companies to share information about chemicals used, the potential risks these chemicals pose to the community, the ways they manage these risks, and in the unlikely event of a release, how the company will respond to the emergency.\n\nThe goal of the RMP is to prevent serious chemical accidents that could cause harm to the public and the environment, and to reduce the potential impact of accidental releases.  More than 66,000 facilities across the country and approximately 480 facilities in the State of Oregon are participating in this program.  There are 77 toxic substances and 63 flammable substances covered by this rule.\n\nWhile the documentation and some of the analyses required by RMP are new, the overall thrust of the program is not.  All businesses are required to comply with the General Duty Clause that simply states that they operate their business in a manner that does not present hazards to staff or the community.\n\nIn 1985 OSHA introduced the Hazard Communication Program.  This program required a business to obtain an MSDS sheet for every product used in the workplace.  The program was primarily directed at protecting the employees.\n  \nIn 1992 OSHA introduced the Process Safety Management Program.  It was directed at preventing or minimizing the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals. The program was primarily directed to protect the employees.\n\nIn 1999, the Risk Management Program (RMP) expanded on the requirements of the PSM program with a major portion of the program directed at protecting the public through developme"

      "SummaryText": "nt of off-site consequence analysis.\n\nThe basic elements of the RMP are hazard analysis, accident prevention, emergency response and submission of the RMP to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n\nHazard Assesment:  A what if analysis was used in the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) to consider the consequences associated with the events that might occur as a result of failures involving equipment, system design, operating procedures, and natural disasters.  Staff analyzed potential problems associated with fire earthquakes, equipment failure, and operator error.  Based on the PHA, it was determined that the greatest accident potential existed during removal or addition of a chlorine cylinder to the system.\n\nAs a result of the PHA, several changes had been identified.  The on site chlorine inventory had been reduced, the security of the storage building had been improved to prevent unauthorized access, and the storage area had been partially enclosed to help mitigate any chlorine release.  Chlorine detection equipment, and an alarm system are currently in place, and are regularly inspected and tested.\n\nAccident Prevention:  Chlorine has been used for disinfection since 1962, without an accidental release.  This is a record that we are proud of, and demonstrates the District's overall commitment to safety and training.  Safety in handling chlorine depends upon the effectiveness of employee education, proper safety instructions and use of suitable equipment.  Training for employees is conducted periodically to maintain a high degree of competence in handling procedures.  Employees are informed of the hazards that may result from improper handling.  They are trained to operate in a manner that minimizes the potential for leaks, and thoroughly instructed regarding proper action to take in the event of a chlorine release.  Each employee is familiar with emergency procedures, repair activities and first aid measures.\n\nEmergency Response:  Oak Lodge Sanitary District h"

      "SummaryText": "as met with the local Fire District personnel to be certain that they are familiar with the facility layout, chlorine location, and to discuss how the two agencies will work together to provide effective notification of the surrounding area, prompt leak mitigation and equipment repair.  A component of the RMP requires that a worst-case release scenario as well as an alternative scenario be developed.\n\nWhat Happens if a Major Release Occurs?\nThe Plant Emergency Alarm is activated.  This is a loud audio alarm that can be heard throughout the neighborhood.\n\nStaff calls 911 - Clackamas County Fire District #1\nThe following are also notified:  Pioneer American (chlorine supplier), the Oregon Emergency Response Center, the National Response Center, and the U.S. Coast Guard.\n\nA log will be kept detailing the time of calls and the name of the individual contacted at each agency.  \n\nIf the Plant Manager is not in the plant, the following chain of responsibility will be in effect for notifying the appropriate agencies; \n1) Operations Coordinator, 2) Collections Coordinator 3) Laboratory Technician\n\nThe facility's front gate is to be manned by an operator with a Self Contained Breathing Apparatus.  He will be responsible for preventing unauthorized entry.  Once the Fire Department has arrived with additional SCBA, a sweep will be made of the park to evacuate all persons from that area.  All personnel not involved with the securing of the plant, will report to the Administration Office.  This is the designated gathering area where all employees can be accounted for and administered first aid.  Any employee needing further treatment will be transported to the local hospital.  Once the leak is secured, no action will be taken until representatives of Pioneer America (the chlorine supplier) have arrived.\n\nTraining for employees takes place in either November or December each year.  This is the time all procedures and emergency contact numbers are verified."
