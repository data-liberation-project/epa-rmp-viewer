A comprehensive review of all systems, as well as administrative, technical, and operating and maintenance procedures has been conducted, in addition to the other required program elements of the RMP Rule.  A detailed hazard review was conducted for the Water Treatment Plant using a What-If analysis.\r\n4.0 Five-year Accident History\r\nIn the past five years, the Water Treatment Plant did not have a release of chlorine resulting in injuries, deaths, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.  The effectiveness of the facility's design, operating procedures, and training has resulted in an excellent safety record.\r\n5.0 Emergency Response Program\r\nThe Gadsden Water Works and Sewer Board has implemented an Emergency Response Program for the Water Treatment Plant, which coordinates response efforts with the Gadsden/Etowah County Emergency Management Agency (EMA), the Gadsden fire department's HAZMAT team, the police department, and the hospital.\r\n6.0 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nThe Gadsden Water Works and Sewer Board encourages its employees to suggest ideas for changes to improve safety. Overall safety issues are discussed during routine employee meeting.  Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and to present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards."

The policy includes working with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies to promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork and to orchestrate an effective contingency plan in the unlikely event of a process incident occurring at the Water Treatment Plant.  It is the Gadsden Water Works and Sewer Board's policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws applicable to the Water Treatment Plant. \r\n2.0 Description of Facility and the Regulated Substance Handled\r\nThe Water Treatment Plant is a publicly owned and operated water treatment facility.  Chlorine is used primarily to prevent the spread of disease from the finished water by destroying any pathogenic microorganisms that might be left after filtration.  Disinfecting the finished water protects consumers from bacteria such as Cryptosporidium and giardia that cause severe illness and gastrointestinal disorders.  Another possible use of chlorine is for odor control.  The Water Treatment Plant has two chlorination facilities, one for finished water chlorination and the other for raw water chlorination.  The maximum quantity of chlorine stored at the finished water chlorination facility exceeds the threshold limit, requiring RMP. The maximum quantity of chlorine stored at the raw water chlorination facility exceeds the threshold limit, requiring RMP.  The chlorination system at the finished water and raw water facilities consists of vacuum regulators, chlorinators, injectors, chlorine leak detectors, alarms, associated piping, valves, and other miscellaneous equipment.  \r\n3.0 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-speci"
