Standards codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration at 29 CFR 1910.119 are applicable to two of the four covered processes operated at this Facility.  OSHA standards at 29 CFR 1910.111 are also applicable and are included in the Combined Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program (PSM/RMPr) document that is implemented by this Facility.\n\n\n\nThis electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of aqua ammonia from the Kirkland, IL Facility located about 0.5 miles west of Kirkland, IL.  The physical address to the Facility is 60 Route 52, Kirkland, IL 60447.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Kirkland, IL Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Kirkland, IL Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release (even though a release is unlikely) will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\n\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\n\n\nHelena is submitting this as a Voluntary Update as the Kirkland, IL Facility is newly acquired from the former owners of Hintzsche, Inc.  All relevant sections for a Program 2 and 3 PSM/RMP Facility have been reviewed and/or updated.  The updates are reflected in both the EPA RMP Submit report and the Facility PSM/RMPr Program Document.  \n\n\n\nFACILITY\n\n\n\nThe Kirkland, IL Facility is a retail and fertilizer blending agricultural chemical facility that operates four (4) covered processes including: Covered Process 1: Storage and Handling (Anhydrous Ammonia); Covered Process 2: Aqua Ammonia Blending; Covered Process 3: Storage and Handling (Aqua Ammonia); and Covered Process 4: Base Blending.

The commercial tanker truck operator (Vendor/Contractor) performs these transfer operations.  \n\n\n\nHelena stores the anhydrous ammonia in the stationary storage tank.  From the stationary storage tank, the Facility either: transfers anhydrous ammonia into nurse tanks for retail to the end user (i.e. farmer); or transfer the anhydrous ammonia to one of five (5) 30,000-gallon aboveground storage tanks filled with water to blend aqua ammonia.  The aqua ammonia is stored and handled in the 30,000-gallon storage tanks until it is transferred to the Base Blender for blending other fertilizer products.  All transfer and blending operations are performed in accordance with the covered process-specific operating procedure as provided in the PSM/RMPr Program Document.  \n\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nTwo worst case offsite consequence analyses (OCA) representing each regulated substance and the four (4) covered processes were completed for this Facility.  Each worst case scenario release assumes that all the contents in the largest single storage tank are released.  For anhydrous ammonia, the largest vessel is the 18,000-gallon stationary storage tank.  For the aqua ammonia, the largest vessel is a 30,000-gallon aboveground storage tank.  The anhydrous ammonia was modeled as a dense gas ground level horizontal jet release.  The aqua ammonia was modeled as liquid spill and evaporation from the secondary containment system.  \n\n\n\nThree alternative (or more likely to occur) scenarios were completed for four (40 Covered Processes.  The release from Covered Process 1 assumes to take the form of a failure of the 3\" transfer hose used to load into the stationary storage tank from a commercial tanker truck.

The Manager is assisted by other Helena staff, as directed.  The Manager is responsible for ensuring that Helena Staff are properly trained in the implementation of the Prevention Program which includes Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Mechanical Integrity, Management of Change, Pre-Startup Review, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigation, Hot Work Permit, Contractors and Emergency Response.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nHelena's Kirkland, IL Facility is a non-responding facility.
