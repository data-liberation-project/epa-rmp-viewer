As part of this commitment, BPC has established a \nsystem to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this \nsystem is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at BPC and that \ncomplies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulation 40 \nCFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements:  Risk Management Programs (the \nRMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan \n(RMPlan) describing the risk management program at BPC.  This document is intended to \nsatisfy the RMPlan requirement of the RMP rule ('68.150 through '68.185) and to provide the \npublic with a description of the risk management program at BPC.\n\n1.1    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nBPC is committed to the safety of BPC workers and the public, and to the preservation of the \nenvironment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  BPC will \nimplement reasonable controls to contain releases in a manner that will be safe for workers and \nwill help prevent injury to the public or the environment.\n\n1.2    The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nBPC is a paper mill with bleaching operations.  The facility handles one substance in a \nsufficient quantity to be regulated by the RMP rule covered.  The regulated substance is sulfur \ndioxide gas.  Liquefied compressed sulfur dioxide gas is stored for use as a pH adjuster in the \npulp process.\n\nThe storage delivery system contains up to 160,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide.\n\n\n1.3 Offsite Consequence Analyses\n\nThe RMP rule requires BPC to perform an offsite consequence analysis for the following \nscenarios:\n\nOne worst-case release scenario for sulfur dioxide delivery system.\n\nOne alternative release scenario for sulfur dioxide"

      "ESSeqNum": 1,
      "FacilityID": 17491,
      "SummaryText": " delivery system.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for sulfur dioxide gas is failure of the 16,000-gallon sulfur \ndioxide (SO2) storage tank, which is used in the pulp production process.  Administrative \ncontrols limit the quantity of sulfur dioxide in the tank to 13,900 gallons or 160,000 pounds.  \nA cement dike would contain the released (SO2), which would boil if the ambient air \ntemperature were above 14 0F, forming a dense gas cloud.  The maximum distance to the toxic \nendpoint concentration is 13 miles.  The City of Grand Rapids and surrounding communities \nwithin southern Itasca County could be effected by a worst-case release of SO2.  The estimated \npopulation within a 13-mile radius of the storage tank is 20800 people. \n\nThe alternative release scenario for sulfur dioxide gas is rupture of a 1-inch diameter liquid \nline from the SO2 storage tank.  This scenario assumes that the sulfur dioxide is released \nthrough the ruptured pipe for 60 minutes before workers are able to isolate the line.  The \nreleased SO2 would rapidly boil if ambient air temperatures were above 14 0F, forming a dense \ngas cloud.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.8 miles.  The downtown district \nof the City of Grand Rapids is located within this radius.  The estimated residential population \nwithin a 0.8-mile radius of the storage tank is 2260 persons.  \n\n\n1.4    Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific \nPrevention Steps\n\nThe RMP rule requires a Program 3 prevention program for the sulfur dioxide system.  The \nfollowing paragraphs describe the prevention program elements at BPC that apply to this \nsystem.  \n\nSafety information.  BPC maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help \nensure safe operation of the BPC processes.  Material safety data sheets (MSDSs) document \nthe physical properties of hazardous substances handled at BPC, including regulated substances \nin covered processes.  The engineering design documents include the operatin"

BPC performs and periodically updates hazard reviews of the covered \nprocesses to help identify and control process hazards.  Checklists are used to guide the hazard \nreview.  These checklists include items to help ensure that BPC operates and maintains the \nequipment in a manner consistent with the applicable design specifications, codes, standards, \nand regulations.\n\nOperating procedures.  BPC develops and maintains operating procedures to define how tasks \nrelated to process operations should be performed.  The operating procedures are used to (1) \ntrain employees and contractors and (2) serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to \ntake during both normal operations and process upsets.\n\nTraining.  BPC trains personnel in the operating procedures to help ensure safe and effective \nperformance of their assigned tasks.  A training documentation file is maintained to help ensure \nthat refresher training is provided, as necessary.\n\nMaintenance.  BPC properly maintains the process equipment.  The BPC maintenance \nprogram includes (1) procedures to safely guide workers in their maintenance tasks, (2) worker \ntraining in the maintenance procedures, and (3) an inspection and testing program to help \nidentify equipment deterioration and damage before equipment failure occurs.\n\n\nCompliance audits.  This document is the first report for the BPC Risk Management \nProgram.  Future compliance audits will be conducted at three year intervals in accordance \nwith Part 68.79 of the Risk Management Program Rule.  \n\nIncident investigations.  BPC investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in \na serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment.  BPC trains employees to identify \nand report any incident requiring investigation.  An investigation team is assembled, and the \ninvestigation is i"

The results of the investigation are \ndocumented, recommendations are made, and appropriate process enhancements are \nimplemented. \n\nChemical-specific prevention steps  sulfur dioxide.  Industry standards are followed at BPC \nto ensure safe handling of SO2.  The SO2 vendor supplies SO2 via a Department of \nTransportation (DOT)-approved tank truck and follows DOT standards and BPC Operating \nProcedures when loading the SO2 storage tank.  The storage tank design and construction are \nconsistent with American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards.  Workers who \nperform operations involving SO2 receive training emphasizing safe handling procedures for \nSO2 developed by BPC.  \n\n1.5    Five-Year Accident History\n\nBPC maintains a five-year accident history that fulfills the requirements of the RMP rule \n('68.42).  This history indicates a good record of accidental release prevention over the past \nfive years.  Two minor releases of SO2 have occurred from BPC in the last five years that have \nresulted in consequences of interest.\n\nOn February 9, 1996 a 1/8-inch line between the SO2 tank fill line and a signal transmitter \nwas removed for maintenance purposes allowing the release of approximately 10-pounds of \nSO2.  A BPC employee was treated for respiratory distress at Itasca Medical Center and \nreleased that same day.  No other consequences of interest, either on-site or off-site, were \ngenerated by this incident.  \n\n\nOn November 18, 1997 a malfunctioning pH probe led to the release of an undetermined \namount of SO2 into a bleach tank.  Two BPC workers, working in the area at the time, \nwere exposed to SO2 levels of 17 parts per million or higher.  The workers were sent to the \nItasca Medical Center for evaluation and released that same day. No other consequences of \ninterest, either on-site or off-site, were generated by this incident.\n\n1.6    Emergency Response Programs\n\nBPC has established a written emergency response plan t"

This plan has been communicated to local \nemergency response officials through the local fire department.  Regular dialogue is maintained \nbetween BPC and the local fire chief.  BPC periodically conducts emergency response drills, \nincluding annual exercises.\n\n1.7    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nBPC constantly strives to improve the safety of the processes at BPC through both the incident \ninvestigation program and a program soliciting safety suggestions from the workers.  The \nfollowing changes to improve process safety have been implemented as a result of the February \n9, 1996 SO2 release:  \n\nBPC has provided a second means of escape from the sulfur dioxide storage tank area.  A \nsecond stairway to the south of the tank has been installed.\n\nA check valve has been installed in the fill line and ball valves have been added to the \npressure switches.\n\nWalkways have been installed over the storage tank to allow workers to close the hand \nvalves prior to working on the rupture disc mechanisms.\n\nHand valves on the storage tank are shut before work is performed on the rupture disc or \nalarm transmitters.\n\n\nA sign has been installed on the SO2 storage system which requires that the PGW shift \ncoordinator be notified prior to any work being performed on the SO2 system.  The sign \nalso directs workers performing maintenance on the rupture disc to shut the hand valve on \nthe tank before working on the disc or the transmitter.  The sign directs all individuals \nworking on the system to assume that the worst-case scenario is in order.  \n\nThe following changes to improve process safety have been implemented as a result of the \nNovember 18, 1997 SO2 release:  \n\nThe high output alarm setting for the SO2 valve was reduced, and is checked on a regular \nbasis.\n\nA SO2 sensor for the pulp storage tank facility has been installed."
