This commitment is embraced by each member of our team, no matter what position or area. Our active role includes an obligation to point out any deficient safety or environmental practices that are observed anytime, anywhere. Positive reinforcement will be our primary motivation tool to benchmark satisfactory performance. Safety hazards or environmental concerns are exposed and relayed to team members without fear of reprisal or resentment. Great safety and environmental records are a team effort.\r\n\r\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\r\nThe facility is a 96 acre site, with 3 major structures and a paved shipping / receiving area. The facility produces pasteurized milk products, soymilk, non-dairy coffee creamers, and packaged juice products. The facility operates three (3) anhydrous ammonia refrigeration systems to produce space cooling, product cooling, and process equipment cooling. The refrigeration system is designed to provide: operating flexibility (through availability of multiple operating equipment combinations); economy and efficiency of operations (through the use of operating pressures commensurate with the degree of cooling required); optimal safety performance: and, consistency of operation, utilizing programmable logic controllers (PLCs) to monitor, record, operate, and modulate refrigeration equipment as conditions require. Major equipment components include: compressors, condensers, receivers and other storage vessels, purgers, and a variety of heat exchanges (evaporators, air handlers, etc.).\r\n\r\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS:\r\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario have been completed as stated in Sections 2 and 3 of the RMP Submit.\r\nTo evaluate both the worst case, and"

As specified in the RMP Guidance, the worst case and alternate case release scenarios have been calculated and the results of the calculations are documented in the RMP Plan on file at the facility.  Public and environmental receptors that could possibly be affected by the release scenarios were determined through the use of data from the 2010 U.S Census figures using the MARPLOT software, and Google Earth mapping system software.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\r\nThe facility has implemented a Process Safety Management program for its ammonia refrigeration process operation and maintenance. The PSM Program has been incorporated as both policy, and most importantly, procedure in everyday operations and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system. Among the many safety features present at the facility are: OSHA Process Safety Management Program, and EPA Prevention Program.\r\nAmmonia detection and alarm system throughout the ammonia system.\r\nEyewash and safety showers throughout ammonia distribution areas.\r\nEmergency communication systems.\r\nClose cooperation with the Fire Department for emergency response.\r\nTraining Programs, such as Chemical Safety, Safe-Work Practices, and others.\r\nPlant Safety Committee, trained, involved, and motivated.\r\nMonthly Safety Meetings.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\r\nThere have been no accidents or injuries related to the ammonia refrigeration system during the past five years.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\r\nThe \"Facility Emergency Action Plan\" has been developed in accordance with OSHA 1910.38, and in concert with the Bridgewater Fire Department. The plan addresses fire, explosion, spills or releases of toxics, severe weather, and other criteria. The plan details response actions by facility personnel for such emergencies, safety and emergency equipment, communication responsibilities, and coordinati"
