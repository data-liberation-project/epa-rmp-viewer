Ammonia (anhydrous) and Propylene are utilized as raw materials in the production of Acrylonitrile.  Propane is an impurity in the Propylene.  Chlorine is utilized in water purification. Sulfur Dioxide is utilized as an inhibitor. A by-product of the Acrylonitrile process is Hydrogen Cyanide.  Hydrogen Cyanide is processed into A"
