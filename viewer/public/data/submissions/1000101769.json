The following elements involve employee participation regarding the RMP/PSMP:\n\n\u00b7 Involve employees in the PHA, Compliance Audits, and RMP/PSMP reviews and updates\n\n\u00b7 Provide employee access to the RMP/PSMP\n\n\u00b7 Present an overview of RMP/PSMP requirements to staff annually\n\n\u00b7 Involve employees in the development and updating of training\n\n\u00b7 Involve employees in an incident investigation\n\nAn authorization and permit program for hot work operations near or around the regulated substances (chlorine and/or sulfur dioxide) and processes has been implemented at the WWTP.\n\nContractors performing maintenance or repair on or adjacent to chlorine and/or sulfur dioxide processes are instructed in the hazards of the materials on-site, and documentation is maintained on contractor understanding of training provided as described in the RMP/PSMP. In addition, emphasis is placed on knowing evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency.\n\nThe WWTP chlorine and sulfur dioxide system technologies are not confidential and any information regarding the process or process chemistry is available for review in the RMP/PSMP.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nNo accidents that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage onsite, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage involving chlorine or sulfur dioxide systems have occurred at the facility in the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe RMP/PSMP Emergency Action Plan for the Gallup WWTP includes procedures to evacuate. The Gallup WWTP is considered a non-responding facility whose employees will not respond to an accidental release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide. The Fire Department would respond to accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety include updating labeling of the covered processes as needed, providing additional info"

All employees involved in working with and around the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems are trained in process and safety procedures.\n\nThe mechanical integrity of chlorine and sulfur dioxide process equipment is documented and maintained through maintenance, inspection, and testing programs. In addition, a Management of Change program has been established to ensure proper review of a proposed change to the chlorine and/or sulfur dioxide system.\n\nA pre-startup safety review is performed on new or modified processes to ensure that equipment and construction meet design specifications, procedures and training have been implemented, and hazard analysis recommendations are resolved prior to start-up.\n\nA Compliance Audit Program has also been implemented. The objective of this self-evaluation program is to ensure that a strong Risk Management Program is maintained, implemented, and followed by personnel.\n\nStaff have developed a formal documented system to manage incident investigations and follow-up. Each incident from a covered process that resulted in deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage will be investigated, and an incident investigation report filed in the RMP/PSMP.\n\nGallup WWTP management staff are committed to involving employees, or their representati"

      "SummaryText": "Facility Information\n\nThe Gallup Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) is owned by the City of Gallup. The City of Gallup has contracted with Jacobs to provide daily management, operations, and maintenance of the WWTP however, the City of Gallup has full legal responsibility for the Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP), including this Risk Management Plan (RMP) and has/retains the authority to make all policy and procedure decisions for this facility.\n\nThe WWTP is designed to treat wastewater utilizing chlorine as a disinfectant in the treatment process. Sulfur dioxide is used to neutralize the chlorine before discharge. The WWTP is designed to treat up to 3.5 million gallons per day (MGD) and is located in Gallup, New Mexico.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Gallup WWTP implements a scheduled preventive maintenance program, including inspection and testing, to minimize the potential for accidental releases. Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) have been reviewed and revised to enable the employees to perform their work safely and efficiently.\n\nThe Gallup WWTP staff are trained only to manage incidental releases related to maintenance and operation activities and the facility is considered a non-responding facility per 40 CFR 68.90. Emergency response to accidental releases is coordinated with the local fire department and local emergency planning committee.\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Gallup WWTP utilizes chlorine (regulated substance) as a biocide in the treatment of wastewater. Sulfur dioxide (regulated substance) is utilized to neutralize the chlorine before discharge.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) as well as written process safety information has been developed to enable personnel to identify and understand the hazards posed by processes involving highly hazardous chemicals (HHC). Process safety information includes chlorine"
