      "SummaryText": "The Salado Creek Water Recycling Center (WRC) is owned and operated by the San Antonio Water System (SAWS).  SAWS, a public utility owned by the City of San Antonio, was created in May 1992, and is responsible for treating drinking water and wastewater.  SAWS also owns and operates as a separate utility a chilled water and steam plant, which is a centralized heating and cooling system for the buildings in and around Hemis Fair Park.\n\nSAWS takes pride in observing the most stringent industrial safety precautions in preventing chemical related accidents.  The latest safety technology and monitoring detection systems are used at the Salado Creek Facility.  Internal inspections and inspections by staff from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) and EPA are conducted on a routine basis.  A reportable accidental release has not occurred at this site within the last five years.  A search of available records showed that no reportable releases of regulated material have occurred at this site since it was constructed.  Our goal is to first prevent accidental releases.\n\nLike other water utilities in the state, the Salado Creek WRC is required to disinfect treated effluent prior to discharge to ensure that disease causing bacteria (pathogens) are reduced to a safe level.  Chlorine is a widely used disinfectant in the wastewater industry, because it is effective against a broad spectrum of pathogens.  Chlorine has shown itself to be an effective agent against waterborne bacteria, viruses and most protozoan agents.  Sulfur Dioxide is used to remove chlorine in wastewater prior to stream discharge to reduce aquatic toxicity.\n\nA process hazard analysis has been performed for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide using estimates and tables from EPA's Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants.  Because all storage containers used by SAWS must conform to stringent Department of Transportation (DOT) construction standards the occurrence of worst-case release is not realistic."

      "SummaryText": "  Information from the hazard analysis is used to imporve emergency planning activities with the San Antonio Fire Department and the Bexar County LEPC.  An analysis of a more likely alternative release (pipe rupture) showed that chlorine or sulfur dioxide would not be expected to extend beyond property lines.\n\nA hazardous chemical safety management plan for accident prevention, which documents employee training, operation and manintenance procedures and emergency preparedness, is maintained and is on file at the facility's administrative building.  All personnel handling hazardous chemicals at Salado Creek are required to be TCEQ certified operators and receive training in the safe use of chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  Training exercises are routinely held at the facility.\n\nA procedure is in place to investigate and report any accidental release or \"near miss\" event.  Lessons learned and findings from these investigations are immediately incorporated into the accident prevention plan.  The hazardous chemical safety management plan is reviewed and updated each year during the facility's Tier II submittal process.  A copy of this RMP has been provided to the San Antonio Fire Department and the Bexar County LEPC."
