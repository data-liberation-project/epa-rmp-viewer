Wynne Water Utilities, a publicly owned utility, operates a wastewater treatment plant that uses one chemical of concern, namely chlorine.  This RMP is the result of a phone call we received from EPA- Dallas inquiring as to how much chlorine or quantities of other chemicals  we had stored on site.  The EPA representative was told that we only use chlorine and the chlorine is stored in one-ton cylinders.  The representative was told that as a one ton cylinder is emptied another is ordered to replace the one being used at that time.  Unfortunately, the operater who made this report said that there were two cylinders setting on the dock at that time.  The operater did not have personal knowledge of the pounds stored nor was he involved in the ordering of chlorine.  As a result of this phone call we were directed to submit a RMP and pay a pentaly.  We paid the $750.00 without admitting any responsibility for the alledged violation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             We paid the amount requested because after checking into the matter it appears that the operater assumed that the tanks were full and the EPA representative assumed the threshold amount had exceeded.

The risk management plan will be modified as it relates to chlorine and threshold amounts within the next eighteen months.  We are currently under going major renovations within our treatment facilities and will be using ultraviolet light for disenfection instead of chlorine.   Therefore, we have completed this submission based on reality and not on a precieved mistake. We hope that this submission does what needs to do and in the abscense of a better plan we will use this plan until notified to the contrary.                                                                                                                                                                The RMP along with our Emergency Plan and our Safety Program will provide our employees and the general public with the assurances that all that can be done as it relates to Risk Management is being done.  Following the format provided by EPA has created another level of awareness to promote and practice worksite safety.                                                                                                                                                                               In closing, I am proud of the plan as presented.  It says what we think it needs to in order to mimumize our risk while dealing with chlorine  and other related matters."
