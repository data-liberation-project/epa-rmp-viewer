      "SummaryText": "The primary activity at the Texas Extraction Plant, herein referenced as the stationary source and the Facility, located in Galveston County Texas, the plant separates hydrocarbon liquids from the incoming natural gas stream by reducing the temperature and pressure low enough so that liquification occurs.   The liquids are then separated from the gas stream and further split into an ethane/propane product and a light gasoline/condensate product and removed from the plant by pipeline. The remaining gas is also removed by pipeline. Rich oil demethanizer (ROD) off gas from the Amoco Texas City refinery and regeneration gas from the dehydration unit are treated to remove hydrogen sulfide.  The treated gas is compressed and forms gas streams from the Kinder Morgan Texas City Terminal.\n\nThe Texas City Extraction Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Based on process knowledge, Texas City Extraction Plant identified regulated substances and quanities kept on site.\n\nListed flammable substances which are stored above threshold quantities at the Texas City Extraction Plant are propane and light gasoline/condensate.  Based on worst case analysis, distance to the endpoint exceeds the distance to public receptors in addition, the Texas City Extraction Plant is subject to the OSHA regulation (PSM ? Process Safety Management).  Therefore, the Texas City Extraction Plant is classified as a program level process is 3. \n\nProcess Controls are in place at the facility, to prevent or minimize an emergency release, include various automatic and manual shutoffs, alarms, vents, relief and check valves, excess flow devices, and grounding equipment.  In addition, the facilty is equiped with UV/IR detection and LEL/HAM (Hazardous Atmosphere Monitors).\n\nUnder EPA requirements the WCS assumes weather conditions that allow the chemical to travel as far as possible, and further assumes that none of the facility's mechanic"

Based on these assumptions, the WCS vapor cloud explosion could potentially effect nearby residences, commericial and industrial areas.  The process controls mentioned in previous paragraph minimize the potential for the WCS to occur.\n\nThe facility complies with Ocuupational Safety and Health Administrations (OSHA) regulations, including the Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements.  Facility personnel undergo operaitons competency training and testing including emergency response drills.  The response training and drills program includes notification to local emergency response agencies as available during the response training.  Agencies also receive applicable SARA Tier II chemical inventory reports annually.  In addition the facility is inspected and audited on a compliance schedule according to the PSM requirements.   A Process Hazard Analysis / Hazop is conducted at least every five years as part of the OSHA PSM requirements as well.\n\nThe facility has not expierenced any chemical releases since 1994."
