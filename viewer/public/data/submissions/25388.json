THIS COMPANY IS A FULL SERVICE FARM SUPPLY COMPANY WITH THE GREATEST RISK OF RELEASE COMING FROM OUR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA STORAGE TANKS.

IF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT, OR OTHER AUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACTS OF THE RELEASE TO PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT. THIS LOCATION HAS 2 BULK TANKS AND 18 NURSE TANKS. THIS FACILITY HAS THE CAPACITY TO STORE 236,000 POUNDS OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA. THE STORAGE TANKS ARE LOCATED ON THE SOUTH EDGE OF THE TOWN OF LACONA. THEY ARE THE 2 WEST TANKS AND THE VALVES ARE LOCATED ON EAST END OF THE TANKS. THE NURSE TANK FILL STATION IS LOCATED ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE TANKS. THE WORST CASE SCENARIO WOULD BE THE RELEASE IN THE AMOUNT OF 79,000 POUNDS. THE RELEASE WOULD BE 7900 POUNDS PER MINUTE FOR 10 MINUTES. ASSUMING A 1.5 M/SEC. WIND SPEED, THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT WOULD BE 3.6 MI. AFFECTING 564 PEOPLE. THE ALTERNATE WOST CASE SCENARIO WOULD BE A TRANSFER HOSE FAILURE. THE QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 11,908 POUNDS AT A RATE OF 5954 POUNDS PER MINUTE. THE RELEASE DURATION WOULD BE 2 MINUTES. ASSUMING A 3 M/SEC. WIND SPEED THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT WOULD BE .5 MI. AFFECTING 15 PEOPLE. WE HAVE AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM IN EFFECT. THE FACILITY HAS BEEN REVIEWED FOR GENERAL COMPLIANCE WITH PROVISIONS OF \"SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA, K-61.1\", PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARDS INSTITUTE, INC. (ANSI), AND THE STANDARDS OF THE U.S. OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA\".
