(HRI) operates a ChemDry cleaning products production facility (the facility) located at 1530 North 1000 West, Logan, Cache County, Utah 84321.  As part of the manufacturing process, HRI operates an aerosol charging system (the System) that charges product-filled aerosol cans with dimethyl ether (DME), an aerosol propellant.  HRI is committed to operating this system in a manner that is protective of the health and safety of HRI and contractor employees, the public, and the environment.  In addition, HRI is committed to operating this facility in full compliance with all applicable Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulatory requirements.\nTo ensure that the System is operated in a safe manner and in compliance with applicable OSHA and EPA regulations relevant to accidental release prevention, HRI has developed this integrated Process Safety Management/Risk Management Plan.  Among the important components of this plan are HRI?s system of policies and procedures for operation and maintenance of the facility, and HRI?s Emergency Response Plan (ERP) for the facility.  HRI has designated the Operations Manager as the individual with primary responsibility and accountability for seeing that this plan and its associated components accurately reflect actual conditions and that it is fully implemented.                                                                                                                                                        STATIONARY SOURCE DESCRIPTION\nThe System charges aerosol cans filled with ChemDry cleaning products with an aerosol propellant, DME.  DME is delivered to the facility via tanker truck, and is stored on site in a 12,000-gallon storage tank.  Administrative controls limit the maximum intended inventory of DME on site to 80% of the tank capacity, or 9,600 gallons (53,700 pounds).  T"

      "SummaryText": "his quantity is greater than the threshold quantity for PSM and RMP applicability of 10,000 pounds.  \nAerosol cans are filled with product in the production area of the facility building.  The product-filled cans are then conveyed to the DME gas house, which is located outside the facility building, where the product-filled aerosol cans are charged with DME.  The charged aerosol cans are then conveyed back into the facility building for packaging.  The remainder of the DME system, including the DME storage tank, is located outside.  \nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\nFacilities subject to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations are required to complete an off-site consequences analysis to examine the potential effects of a catastrophic release of DME from the facility.  In performing this analysis, consideration must be given to a worst case release scenario in which 100 percent of a regulated flammable substance held above the threshold quantity in a single container or the process is released over a ten minute period.  The regulatory agencies recognize that a release of this magnitude is an unlikely scenario due to engineering and administrative safeguards that are integral to the DME system.  For this reason, the regulations also require that consideration be given to a more likely alternative release scenario.  \nThe worst case release scenario considered for the facility is the release of the entire contents of the DME tank, or 53,700 pounds, over a 10 minute period, as required by applicable RMP regulations.  This release is assumed to result in a vapor cloud explosion in which ten percent of the vapor cloud is assumed to participate.  Using the EPA?s model software RMP Comp, the distance to an overpressure of one pound per square inch (psi) was determined to be 0.3 miles.  The LandView III mapping program indicates that a population of 15 people resides within a 0.3 mile radius of the facility.  Public receptors are present within this radiu"

      "SummaryText": "s.  There are no environmental receptors located within the potentially impacted area, based on a review of the USGS topographic map of the Smithfield, Utah quadrangle.  \nThe more realistic, alternative release scenario identified for the facility was the sudden failure of a transfer hose during DME delivery.  For this scenario, it was assumed that the release would continue over a ten minute period, resulting in a release of 12,600 pounds of DME.  Using the EPA?s model software RMP Comp, the distance to the lower flammability limit of DME was determined to be <0.1 miles under rural conditions.  The potentially impacted population was determined to be 1 person.  Public receptors are present within the endpoint radius.  However, no environmental receptors were identified within the endpoint radius.  \nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe facility has an aggressive accidental release prevention program that is based upon a foundation of employee awareness and frequent inspections.  This program is documented in this integrated plan.  The effectiveness of this program, which meets or exceeds all requirements of applicable PSM/RMP regulations, is evident by the fact that the facility has had no significant releases of DME in the five years prior to the date of this Plan.\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no accidental releases at the facility in the five years prior to the date of this plan that resulted in injuries or death to facility or contractor employees on site or the off-site public, or damage to potential environmental receptors.\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe facility has an Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that defines the sequence of actions to be taken by Facility employees in the event of an accidental release of hazardous materials.  This ERP has been communicated to the Logan Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  The LFD is responsible for notifying the public in the event a release occurs with the potential to imp"
