This concrete dike acts to control the release to the atmosphere because it reduces the surface area of the release and thus reduces the release rate.\n \n \nThe ARS for Formaldehyde Solution involves a toxic release caused by the total failure of the off-loading hose from the tank truck to the storage tanks.  The tank truck off-loads from the bottom of the truck.  The area and process are monitored by the tanker driver and via CCTV in the control room.  The response time for active mitigation in the scenario is estimated to be 3 minutes or less.  The release amount is calculated based on the process flow rate of 1,062 lbs/min x 3 min for an amount of 3,186 lbs released to passive mitigation dike containment around the storage tanks and truck off-loading area.  Based upon the calculations for 44% solution and using formula B-7, the release rate is calculated to be 2.41 lbs/min, which would take 1,322 minutes to completely vaporize.  The endpoint was obtained from Table 17 and calculated to be 0.2 miles.  The release would have off-site impacts on the industrial facilities adjacent to the facility but would not impact other public or environmental receptors.  \n\nThe ARS for Ethylenediamine involves a toxic release caused by a total failure of the off-loading hose from the tank truck to the storage tank. The tank truck off-loads from the rear of the truck.  It is assumed since the off-loading is a monitored operation that 1081 lbs of the tank truck contents would be released through the discharge line prior to it being shut down.  The release would be contained in the containment dike around the storage tank and truck off-loading area, and thus reduces the release rate to 18 pounds/minute.

Through Incident Investigations and other related tools, improvements in operations or equipment will be evaluated and implemented, as necessary.  The facility continually trains employees in the areas of health, safety, and environmental protection.

Maintenance team members perform many tasks, ranging from preventative inspections and testing to calibrations to repairs of equipment.\n\nThe key to the entire prevention program is involving the operators in all aspects of the plant HSE programs.  The Lima facility operators are an integral part of Process Hazard Analyses, Pre-Startup Safety Reviews, operating and HSE procedures development and modifications, Managements of Change, Incident Investigations, and many other areas.  Internal and External validation audits and reviews are conducted for ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 14001:2015.\n\nFive-Year Accident History:\nThe Lima facility has had no accidental releases as defined by the EPA of listed chemicals from covered processes.  However, did have an exposure incident noted from a covered chemical in a covered process.  No adverse effects were noted from the incident.  \n\nEmergency Response Program:\nThe Lima facility has a comprehensive emergency response program that follows the National Response Team One Plan guidance.  The facility is prepared to address many types of emergencies, including chemical releases, medical emergencies, and fires.  The facility has three internal alarm systems, a fire alarm, an evacuation alarm, and an emergency alarm.  If the event requires off-site assistance, phone calls will be made to the appropriate agencies.  Arrangements have been made with the Shawnee Fire Department to assist with any emergency in which they are needed.

First, the facility has complied with the OSHA PSM regulation since the facility was built in 1993.  The facility has applied the spirit of the PSM regulation to all facility activities, not just those covered by the regulation.  This is evidenced by the facility's involvement with the Chemical Manufacturers Association's Responsible Care program.  Due to this proactive approach, procedures are already in place and active for the RMP covered processes.\n \n The facility has many technological prevention steps, which include:\n\u00b7computerized control systems\n\u00b7computerized interlocks and permissive\n\n\nIn addition, the facility has trained operators running the processes.  Each operator goes through extensive training, including classroom, computer-based, and on-the-job training, prior to becoming certified operators.  To assist the operators in running the plant safely, the facility has many operating procedures-these direct procedures operators in how to properly run the given process.

It is stored in one of three storage tanks (one 50,000 gallons; two 30,000 gallons), depending on which process it is associated with.  Aqueous ammonia is delivered and shipped in tank trucks and pipelines to INEOS Chemicals.  ACH is received in tank trucks and is stored in one 10,000 gallon storage tank.  ACH is used as a raw material in the process.  \n \n \nWorst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenarios:\nThe Lima facility has reviewed all the covered processes at the facility to determine which Worst Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenarios (ARS) would be reported.  All scenarios were calculated using either the RMP*Comp software or the calculations and tables contained in the OCA Guidance.  All assumptions made in the OCA guidance (i.e., wind speed and stability, release elevation, etc.) were used in the scenario evaluation.  Based on the number of buildings and structures surrounding the plant, urban topography was used in all modeling.  In each ARS evaluation, the facility chose to consider 'worst case' type conditions (i.e., response teams taking longer than expected, etc.)Distances of impact areas were plotted and measured using the google maps distance measurement tool. \n \nThe Worst-Case Scenario, which involves a toxic release from the cyanide weigh tank (a tank used to verify the weight of HCN prior to being placed in the reactor), results in off-site impacts on neighbors, a public recreation area (the Rotary River Walk), and industrial facilities.  This scenario takes into consideration administrative controls that limit the amount of HCN in the weigh tank, which include operating procedures, operator training, computer interlocks, and redundant monitoring systems.  These controls limit the weight of HCN in the weigh tank, which has a capacity of 5,800 pounds, to the maximum charge weight of 2,900 pounds.  In addition to the adminis"

      "SummaryText": "escription and Regulated Substances Handled :\nThe Lima facility, which began operation in October 1993, is situated on approximately 13 acres located between INEOS Chemicals and Husky Refinery.  The facility consists mainly of an administration building, manufacturing/technical building, and four tank farms.\n \nThe main products manufactured at the Lima facility are called chelates.  Chelates are chemical compounds that have the ability to complex or interact with metal ions like calcium and iron and change the property of the metal ion.  For example, chelates will prevent hard water metal ions like calcium from forming precipitates and scale. Because of their unique ability to chelate metals, these chelate products are used in numerous household cleaners, personal care products, photographic processing, and a host of industrial applications like pulp and paper manufacture, latex polymerization, and energy production, to name a few.\n \nThe Lima facility creates all of its products through hydrocyanic acid ('HCN') chemistry.  The facility takes HCN, which is a co-product in the manufacturing of acrylonitrile, from the adjacent INEOS Chemicals facility.  The HCN is received through a pipeline from the INEOS Chemicals facility and is piped into reactors.  The HCN is reacted immediately upon entering the reactors with various raw materials to produce different chelates and other products.\n \nThe Lima facility handles five regulated substances above the threshold quantities - HCN, ethylenediamine ('EDA'), formaldehyde solution, aqueous ammonia.  HCN is not 'stored' on-site - it is taken from the INEOS Chemicals pipeline and placed directly into process vessels.  EDA is received in tank trucks and occasionally rail tank cars and is stored on-site in two 30,000 gallon storage tanks.  EDA is used as a raw material in the process.  Formaldehyde is received in tank trucks and is stored in three 30,000 gallon storage tanks.  Formaldehyde is also used as a raw material in the proc"
