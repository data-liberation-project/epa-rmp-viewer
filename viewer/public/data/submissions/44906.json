      "SummaryText": "We are a fertilizer retail facility.  The only material considered hazadous at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.  Our facility has one 18,000 gallon tank, equipment for receiving ammonia by truck and equipment for transferring ammonia from storage to trucks or nurse tanks for delivery to customers.  It is our policy to meet, or exceed , all local, state, and national standards relating to handling ammonia.\n\nIn the past five years, we have not had any accidents or releases with off-site consequences.\n\nSpecific safety features that we employ to minimize the impact of an accidental release include:\n\n1. Excess flow valves to prevent flow from the tank if any hose or line breaks.\n2. Pressure relief valves on the storage tank to prevent overpressuring and rupture of the tank.\n3. Inspections by independent inspectors to ensure that our equipment is maintained in a manner that ensures safe operation and prevent releases.\n\nTo further ensure safe operation of the facility, our emplyees are trained in procedures for safe handling of hazardous material, and in safe operating and maintence porcedures.  We have also coordinated with the Coupland Volunteer Fire Department to respond in the unlikely event of an emergency.\n\nAs required by the EPA, we have analyzed the worst-case release scenario defined by the EPA.  This scenario involves a release of the entire contents of the storage tank.  According to information supplied by the EPA the impact from this scenario would extend 5.1 milie from our facility, and would impact residences, schools, and commercial areas.\n\nIt is extremely unlikely that an event such as EPA's worst-case release scenario will ever occur.  A more probable, but still highly unlikely event, would be an event lie a hose break during a truck pull away.  According to information supplied by the EPA, the impact from such a release would only extend 2000 feet and would impact several residences."
