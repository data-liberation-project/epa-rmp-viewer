As a result, the 50 Buttes Gas Plant is subject to the RMP Level 1 requirements.\n\nSummary of Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has implemented a Program 1 level Prevention Program, as required by the RMP rules.  These prevention program provisions are specifically intended to minimize the probability and/or consequences of accidental NGL releases from the facility and include such measures as safety information, a system hazard review, operating and maintenance procedures, training, compliance auditing, management system, and updates.  The facility prevention program is an ongoing program based on periodic training, incident investigations, audits, procedure revisions, and RMP updates as required to reflect facility changes and RMP requirements.\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nThe facility has had no RMP-reportable accidents/releases of NGL since the previous RMP submittal.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThe 50 Buttes Gas Plant is a Non-Responding Facility as per 48 CFR 68.90(b). The plant maintains a written emergency response plan, which is in place to help protect employee and public safety as well as the environment.\n\nManagement System\n\nThe facility is committed to ensuring its operations are safe and in accordance with all RMP requirements. Facility management and technical personnel are responsible for RMP development, implementation, and compliance.  A company-wide Management of Change Program is in place to ensure that the appropriate changes occur as necessary to maintain and improve safety. Ongoing hazard reviews, training, audits, maintenance, and investigations will be conducted as required by the RMP.  Updates to"

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIt is the policy of  Western Midstream that its employees, environment, property, and the public be protected from any harm that may occur as a result of its operations.  To achieve this, Western Midstream strives to operate its facilities in compliance with applicable federal, state, and local safety, health, and environmental regulations.  \nWestern Midstream implements its emergency response policies to comply with the overall corporate policies of providing its workers with a safe workplace and of minimizing risk to the public. Protection of the environment is also a high priority.  Once the issues of life, safety, and the environment are addressed, the secondary issues of property conservation and business recovery may be considered.\n\nFacility Description\n\nWestern Midstream owns and operates the 50 Buttes Gas Plant in Campbell County, Wyoming. The facility is in an open area as shown in Appendix B; the business address is 3669 South Hwy 50 Gillette, WY 82718, with coordinates 43\u00b051'09.9N 105\u00b046'40.1W. The area is surrounded by open range land. The nearest major streets are Savageton Rd and US Highway 50. Aerial photographs of the area around the 50 Buttes Gas Plant, including a facility plot plan, are presented in Appendix B.\n\nCovered Processes and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has published regulations and guidance for chemical accident prevention at facilities that handle hazardous chemicals, which can be found in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) rule. These facilities, which handle certain hazardous chemicals, must develop a Risk Management Plan, which [1]: \n1.\tIdentifies the potential effects of a chemical accident;\n2.\tIdentifies steps the facility is taking to prevent an accident; and\n3.\tSpells out emergency response procedures should an accident occur.\n\nThe list of regulated substances under the RMP program can be found at the following link:"
