To achieve this, Meritage strives to operate its facilities in compliance with applicable federal, state, and local safety, health, and environmental regulations.  \n\nMeritage implements its emergency response policies to comply with the overall corporate policies of providing its workers with a safe workplace and of minimizing risk to the public. Protection of the environment is also a high priority.  Once the issues of life, safety, and the environment are addressed, the secondary issues of property conservation and business recovery may be considered.\n\n\n\nFacility Description\n\n\n\nMeritage owns and operates the 50 Buttes Gas Plant in Campbell County, Wyoming. The facility is in an open area as shown in Appendix B; the business address is 3669 South Hwy 50 Gillette, WY 82718, with coordinates 43?51'09.9\"N 105?46'40.1\"W. The area is surrounded by open range land. The nearest major streets are Savageton Rd and US Highway 50. Aerial photographs of the area around the 50 Buttes Gas Plant, including a facility plot plan, are presented in Appendix B.\n\n\n\nCovered Processes and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has published regulations and guidance for chemical accident prevention at facilities that handle hazardous chemicals, which can be found in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) rule. These facilities, which handle certain hazardous chemicals, must develop a Risk Management Plan, which [1]: \n\n1.    Identifies the potential effects of a chemical accident;\n\n2.    Identifies steps the facility is taking to prevent an accident; and\n\n3.    Spells out emergency response procedures should an accident occur.\n\n\n\nThe list of regulated substances under the RMP progr"

When a facility is built, and the chemicals handled are above the listed threshold quantity, the company needs to implement a risk management program, develop the RMP, and submit it to the EPA. The plan must be revised and resubmitted to the EPA every five years.\n\nThe 50 Buttes Gas Plant handles the following regulated substances per RMP paragraph 68.130:\n\n?    Methane\n\n?    Ethane\n\n?    Propane\n\n?    i-Butane\n\n?    n-Butane\n\n?    i-Pentane\n\n?    n-Pentane\n\n?    n-Hexane\n\n\n\nPer the requirements of the RMP rule, this document addresses the following [1]:\n\n?    Hazard assessment that details the potential effects of an accidental release, an accident history of the last five years, and an evaluation of worst-case and alternative accidental releases;\n\n?    Prevention program that includes safety precautions and maintenance, monitoring, and employee training measures; and\n\n?    Emergency response program that spells out emergency health care, employee training measures, and procedures for informing the public and response agencies (e.g., the fire department) should an accident occur.\n\n\n\nSummary of Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\n\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario\n\n\n\nThe selected worst-case scenario for the 50 Buttes Gas Plant is a release of 7,083 pounds of the flammable mixture in the NGL Bullet Tanks resulting in a Vapor Cloud Explosion (VCE) and distance of 0.14 miles to 1-psi overpressure. \n\nWithin MARPLOT;, there are zero (0) public receptors (housing units) within the \"worst-case\" scenario for the NGL Storage Tanks. Based on information provided by MARPLOT;, the estimated population within the \"worst-case\"' scenario is zero (0).  \n\nSee Section II \"Hazard Assessment\" and Appendix C for Offsite Consequence Analysis - Worst-case scenario detailed information.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\n\n\nThe alternative scenario for the 50 Buttes Gas Plant is a 10-minute release of propane "

Additionally, these processes must have had no accidents with specific offsite consequences within the past five years to be eligible for Level 1, which imposes limited hazard assessment requirements and minimal prevention and emergency response requirements.\n\nRMP Program Level 2 (Level 2): Processes not eligible for Level 1 or subject to Level 3 are placed in Level 2, which imposes streamlined prevention program requirements, as well as additional hazard assessment, management, and emergency response requirements. \n\nRMP Program Level 3 (Level 3): Processes not eligible for Level 1 and either subject to Occupational Safety and Health (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard 1910.119 under federal or state OSHA programs or classified in one of ten specified North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) codes are placed in Level 3, which imposes OSHA's PSM standard as the prevention program as well as additional hazard assessment, management, and emergency response requirements.\n\n\n\n50 Buttes Gas Plant RMP Program Level\n\n\n\nThe 50 Buttes Gas Plant is regulated by the federal Accidental Release Prevention Program (Title 40, Part 68 of the"

These prevention program provisions are specifically intended to minimize the probability and/or consequences of accidental NGL releases from the facility and include such measures as safety information, a system hazard review, operating and maintenance procedures, training, compliance auditing, management system, and updates.  The facility prevention program is an ongoing program based on periodic training, incident investigations, audits, procedure revisions, and RMP updates as required to reflect facility changes and RMP requirements.\n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe facility has had no RMP-reportable accidents/releases of NGL since the previous RMP submittal.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe 50 Buttes Gas Plant is a Non-Responding Facility as per 48 CFR 68.90(b).
