              "Description": "CHLORINE STORAGE\nDESIGNED TO ELIMINATE HAZARDS\n\n    Safety is the primary consideration in chlorine storage.  However, both function and convenience can also be accomplished with common sense and careful design.\n\n    Only trained and authorized employees should have access to chlorine storage.\n\n1-TON CONTAINERS\n\n?    These containers are designed for both liquid or gas withdrawal.  Store horizontally.\n?    Use a level rack or platform with safety blocks to prevent rolling.\n?    Shield from all moving objects.\n?    Align container valves vertically when in service.\n\n\nCHLORINE STORAGE AREAS\nDESIGN AND LOCATION\n\n?    Chlorine gas feed and storage should be enclosed and separated from all other operating areas of your plant.\n?    Locate chlorine rooms on the downwind side of the building, on or above ground level.\n?    Keep containers away from direct sunlight and heat.\n?    Store all containers where they can be moved in case of a leak or fire.\n?    Keep chlorine supply and chlorinators in different rooms.\n?    Place containers in the order they are received so that the oldest are used first.\n?    Locate cylinders in use near doors so they can be quickly turned off without an employee having to fully enter a contaminated room.\n?    Empty containers should be marked immediately.  Store them apart from other containers to avoid confusion.\n\nSAFETY FEATURES\n\n?    Respiratory protection equipment should be stored outside of chlorine rooms in a convenient  place.\n?    Chlorine rooms should have at least two doors equipped with panic hardware that open to the outside of the building.\n?    A shatter-resistant inspection window should be installed in the chlorine-room door or wall.\n?    Switches for the storage-room fan and lights should be located outside of the storage room.  All employees must know the location of these switches.\n?    A signal light indicating fan operation should be provided at each entrance to the storage area.\n?    Electronic chlorine detectors with sounding alarms and warning lights should be installed in the chlorinator room, the chlorine storage rooms, and in the withdrawal room,  Check often to make sure they are in working order.\n\nTEMPERATURE\n?    The recommended temperature of a storage area is 650 F.  The temperature should never be allowed to drop below 550F or exceed 1400F.  (Fusible plug material melts at a 1580F to 1630F.)\nVENTILATION\n\n?    All chlorine rooms should have a ventilation system to remove leaking chlorine gas.\n?    Storage-area ventilation fans should provide at least one complete air change per minute when the room is occupied.\n?    Inlet and exhaust fans should be located in opposite corners.  The air inlet should be located near the ceiling, and the exhaust near the floor in the area farthest away from the door.\n?    The exhaust should discharge to the outside, away from air tanks and any materials susceptible to corrosion.  Exhausts should never be located near other ventilation systems.\n?    Ventilation system switches, located outside chlorine rooms, should be clearly marked.  The safest ventilation system is one that automatically begins when the detection system finds a problem.",
