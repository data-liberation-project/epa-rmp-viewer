      "SummaryText": "Techalloy Company, Inc. - Welding Division stores anhydrous ammonia in a 31' 1 long by 7' outer diameter carbon steel pressure vessel with hemispherical comed ends and a nominal capacity of 8,000 gallons.  The diameter of the domed ends is 3' 6.  Design pressure for the tank is 250 psig.  The tank and ancillaries are constructed in accordance with the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section VIII Division I and the American National Standard Safety Requirments for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, ANSI K61.1-1999.\n\nThe pressure vessel is filled through a 2 black iron pipe to a fitting at the top of the tank.  This line is equipped with both a hydrostatic relief valve and an excess flow valve.\n\nFor pressure relief, the tank has 4 1.25 pressure relief valves.  each is capable of relieving 4,670.4 cfm air in accordance with ANSI K61.1-1999.\n\nThe pressure vessel has a pressure gauge, level float gauge and fixed liquid level gauge for the purpose of overfill prevention.  The fixed liquid level gauge is set to bleed through a 0.054 hole when the tank capacity has reached 85% full.\n\nWhen ambient conditions are insufficient to provide the energy for maintaining the system pressure at 75 psig, a 10 kW immersion heater is used for vaporizing the liquid ammonia to increase the pressure.  The heater is controlled by pressure switches.  The heater is turned on when pressure is reduced to 70 psi and shut off when the pressure reaches 80 psi.  In the event that the heater fails to turn off at 80 psi, an overpressure switch is set to shut off the heater when the pressure reaches 200 psi.\n\nAll lines in which liquid ammonia could be isolated contain hydrostatic relief valves.\n\nAll lines contain excess flow valves which close in the event of line break or leakage.\n\nTechalloy is renting its 8,000-gallon anhydrous ammonia tank and ancillaries from LaRoche Industries.  LaROche personnel provide anhydrous ammonia deliveries"

Any conditions requiring corrective action are addressed by LaRoche Industries.  Techalloy maintenance personnel inspect the piping system monthly and are responsible for performing any corrective actions on the piping from the tank to the ammonia dissociator.\n\nIn accordance with API 510 (Pressure Vessel Inspection Code) and API 570 (Process Piping Inspection Code), the pressure vessel and piping have periodic inspections by third-parties for the purpose of evaluating the integrity of the components, determining corrosion rates, and estimating the reamining useful life of the components.  The remaining useful life determines the next required inspection in accordance with API 510 and API 570.\n\nTechalloy personnel are trained to respond to small leaks of anhydrous ammonia but are not trained to peform emergency response actions.  Emergency reponse actions are governed by the facility's emergency plan.  It calls for evacuation of the facility in the event of an emergency and immediate contact of local, state and national authorities and private emergency responders.  The Baltimore City Fire Department, as head of the Baltimore City LEPC, will be in charge of emergency actions upon arrival at the site.  Implementation of the facility's Emergency Plan is the responsibility of Mr. Allan Demarest, Manufacturing Manager, with the assistance of Mr. Bob McCarty, Maintenance Supervisor.\n\nThe facility has in place operating procedures and maintenance procedures for the anhydrous ammonia storage and transfer process.  A Pre-Startup Review shall be conducted prior to putting the 8,000-gallon pressure vessel into use.  If necessary in the future, Management of Change procedures will be evaluated prior to implementing any change which would have safety implications to workers or the environment. \n \nImplementation of this Level 3 RMP is the r"
