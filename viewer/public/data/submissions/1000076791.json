The maximum amount of butane that can be stored at this site is 1,812,000 lb.  Center Point operates as a bulk liquid storage and transfer facility/terminal for hire (SIC Code #4226) to handle various liquids (RMP and non-RMP) owned by its customers.  It receives butane by tank truck into bullet tanks located on site.  Butane is stored in twelve (12) 30,000-gallon storage tanks\r\n\r\nAfter receipt, the butane is injected as needed into gasoline tanks also located on the site of Center Point to enhance the octane (RVP) of the gasoline on behalf of the gasoline liquid owning customers that have hired Center Point to store and transfer gasoline at the site for a fee.\r\n\r\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nGiven the flammable nature of butane and other liquids on site, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling practices to prevent unnecessary human exposure at the site and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  In this regard, safety at the company's facility depends upon the manner in which butane is handled as well as ensuring safety device integrity is incorporated into the design of the butane tanks and their ancillary equipment.   Furthermore, comprehensive training for site employees adds to the inherent safety at the facility.\r\n\r\nCenter Point's emergency response program was developed in 2004 by an outside consulting firm and is updated every 5 years or as needed to reflect significant process changes at the facility.  In addition to the presence of appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of butane, if a release were to occur, the company operates in compliance with NFPA Code 30 (Fire Code for tank farms) and NFPA-58 (LPG gas code) to reduce potenti"

Center Point also works closely with the local fire department to help ensure emergency response personnel are trained and knowledgeable on how to control and mitigate a release.\r\n\r\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nAs stated above, the site receives, stores, and transfers butane for blending with gasoline for RVP and octane enhancement.  Butane arrives at the site via tank truck and is stored in twelve (12) 30,000-gallon storage tanks.  The unloading spots include both hose and pipe connection points.  The transport modes are off-loaded with the assistance of a terminal operator employee as needed. Access to this site is restricted to authorized solely to facility employees, carriers, and contractors.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe facility has taken extensive measures to comply with the EPA accidental release prevention risk management requirements described in 40 CFR 68. In addition, the facility operates under the OSHA PSM standard 29 CFR 1910.119.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA Code 30, NFPA-58, and other applicable design codes in effect at the time of installation.  \r\n\r\nThe following sections briefly describe the release prevention program that is in place at the company's site:\r\n\r\nSafety Information\r\n\r\nCenter Point maintains a detailed record of written safety information, which describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all aspects of the company's bulk liquid terminal. The safety information is routinely reviewed and updated on a necessary basis to reflect any pertinent process or product changes.\r\n\r\nHazard Review\r\n\r\nA process hazard analysis was performed at each facility and is reviewed every five years.  The reviews or periodic audits focus on operating procedures, equipment functions, handling practices, employee participation, contractor"

The audits are conducted by a team of qualified personnel with extensive knowledge of facility operations and are re-validated at a regular interval of three years per 40 CFR 68.  Any findings related to the hazard reviews are addressed in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within the company's covered operations, the site maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the operations. \r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nCenter Point has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees operating processes are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. New employees receive training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently. Refresher training is provided on a continuing basis by experienced company personnel. Personnel are routinely trained on safety concerns and appropriate processes for the various types of procedures.  \r\n\r\nMaintenance\r\n\r\nCenter Point documents maintenance checks on butane equipment to ensure proper functioning.  Maintenance activities are carried out by qualified contractors certified for such work. Furthermore, facility personnel, as well as contractors, are offered any specialized training that may be needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nAs stated, Center Point conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP and PSM rules are implement"

These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as identify corrective actions to prevent the release from recurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\r\n\r\n4. The five-year accident history\r\n\r\nThe Center Point has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to the company's stringent release prevention policies and practices, there has been no accidental release during this period. \r\n\r\n5. Emergency Action Plan/ Emergency Response Action Plan\r\n\r\nCenter Point has developed a written emergency action plan to address accidental releases of butane.  The emergency response plan is based in accordance with the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA '90).  The plan includes first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas. Center Point has coordinated the emergency plan with the local fire department to ensure emergency response personnel are trained and knowledgeable on how to control and mitigate a release.\r\n\r\nThe emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  The emergency action plan/ emergency response action plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes within Center Point's processes that require a modification to the emergency response.
