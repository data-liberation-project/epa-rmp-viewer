As such, safety during all phases of this process is of utmost importance to the ownership, senior management, supervisors, and employees.  Continual monitoring is performed by management and staff on both, process and personnel, to assure a satisfactory level of safety is being achieved.  Any condition found suspect is analyzed and corrected.  ABC periodically trains employees as to the safe handling of chemicals and machinery.  Departure from established safety practices by an employee is not tolerated.\n\n\n\nAs mentioned previously, ABC Compounding is involved in the business of manufacturing and distributing various cleaners and related products.  Our facility is located within the bounds of the Great Southwest Industrial district in Grand Prairie, Texas.  Our 50,000 square feet plant sits upon approximately four acres.  We package the cleaners into aerosol cans of various s.  A variety of chemicals, both hazardous and non-hazardous, are used in producing the cleaners and other compounds.  Of particular concern to the EPA per section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act is the storage and usage of approximately two thousand to sixteen thousand gallons of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG).  These gases are stored in liquid form by pressurization in two certified nine thousand gallon capacity vessels located on the back lot of the property.  They come in two blends blends of LPG's.  These blends are naturally occurring hydrocarbons used as the aerosol propellant.\n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario in regards to the LPG vessels would be the total release and ignition of the hydrocarbon blends.  The resulting explosion would have an off-site impact of approximately 0.3 mile radius.  This is based upon the RMP computer model provided by the EPA.  ABC C"

      "SummaryText": "ompounding, with the counsel and recommendations of the Texas Railroad Commission, and local fire department has installed hardware and safety systems making the worst case scenario highly unlikely.  The above ground vessels with LPG are certified and periodically inspected for integrity and leaks.  Any signs of potential problems are immediately repaired.   All pumps and associated switches used in transfer process are explosion proof.  Emergency shut off switches are strategically located, allowing for quick shutdown of the vessel pumps.  High flow water cannons surround the vessel and will be used to deluge the vessels with water to keep them cool in the event of an encroaching fire.  Extensive training and care is used in the area of LPG transfer.\n\n\n\nABC Compounding has demonstrated compliance with Process Safety Management.  Thorough analyses of the LPG vessels, process, technology and equipment have been conducted.  Daily visual and audible inspections are performed on the vessels and piping to detect any possible leaks.  If any are found, they repaired immediately.\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidents or releases with respect to the LPG vessels in the previous ten years, nor in the years before.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program at ABC Compounding begins at the ground level with our employees.  A team of qualified personnel have trained in the area of detection and correction of an accidental release of LPG.  A local emergency response company, Protect Environmental Service, Inc., is on contact to respond to any large release of LPG that may occur.  Periodic inspections and education is provided by the local fire department.  Material Safety Data Sheets have been provided to the local fire department in the event of a release and the Local Emergency Planning Committee has been sent all required information including the Texas Tier II.\n\n\n\nABC Compounding is constantly participating in any pertinent safety or instructional training offered by various organizations.

      "SummaryText": " In house inspections often lead to changes in methods or equipment used in the LPG process as well as other areas.  The hazards of LPG and its transfer are certainly recognized by ABC Compounding.  As a result, it is treated with respect.  We are proud of our safety record and intend to continue the high level of vigilance required to maintain a safe operating environment for our employees and neighbors."
