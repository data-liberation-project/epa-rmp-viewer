This resulted in a change (decrease) in worst case scenario for toxics at the facility.  In addition, there has been information added to the 5 year Accident History and details from worst case and alternate case scenarios have been removed.\n\n1.  Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:  Huntsman Odessa is committed to providing a safe, healthy and environmentally conscious work place for its employees and neighbors.  This is exemplified by the Odessa site having earned OSHA's VPP Star Certification Program.  The Huntsman Odessa facility maintains a working PSM program, which implements a series of steps to prevent potential hazards associated with the process and assures a well-trained work force.  The PSM program further implements its policies with onsite procedures and manuals.  Huntsman Odessa participates with community agencies to develop emergency response plans and participates in cooperative training with these agencies.  Since its certification in January 1993, the Odessa Site has been an active participant in the International Standards Organization (IS0) 9002 quality management program.\n\nThe Odessa site is subject to numerous safety and environmental regulations at both the state and federal levels.  The Odessa site is subject to Clear Air Act (CAA) Title V.  There are two identifiers for the air operating permits (O-01230 for the East and O-02150 for West).  Although assigned numbers, they currently are in the application review phase and actual permits have not yet been issued by the TNRCC.\n\n2.  Regulated Substances: Huntsman's Odessa site is located in Odessa, Texas.  The Odessa site operates five Program Level 3 processes.  These processes receive, handle and store flammable hydrocarbon feedstocks for the production of olefins and specialty grade polymers.  End"

Huntsman's Odessa site has large volumes of several regulated flammable substances, such as ethane, ethylene, propane, propylene, butene and butane.  The Odessa site uses small volumes of toxic chemicals, which are consumed in the process.  The toxic chemicals are:\n-Hydrogen Chloride - Used in manufacture of polypropylene.\n-Chlorine-Used for microbiological control in cooling tower water.\n-Vinyl Acetate- Used as a co-monomer in the manufacture of polyethylene.\n\n3.  Offsite Consequence Analysis:  The RMP Rule requires offsite consequence analysis (OCA) be performed to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.  This OCA includes the development of worst and alternative release scenarios for the release of toxic and flammable substances.  The OCA allows for the consideration of administrative controls in estimating potential scenario impacts.  Distances for worst case and alternative release scenarios in this RMP have been calculated using the methods described in EPA's OCA Guidance Document.  The population within the circles defined by these distances has been calculated using the Landview III program.  For release scenarios where there are no public residences inside the circle, the reported population is zero.\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\nThese worst case scenarios are based on EPA required assumptions, are highly unlikely, and have not occurred at this facility.\n\nThe worst case scenario associated with the release of flammable substances is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE), involving an underground hydrocarbon storage well.  \n\nThe worst case scenario associated with the release of toxic substances is a chlorine vapor release from a 2000 lb. cylinder. \n\nALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\nThe alternative case scenarios used in this RMP do not tak"

The one active mitigation measure considered is isolation of releases after 10 to 20 minutes. \n\nThe alternative case scenario for flammable substances is a complete seal failure on the LPG Pump (P-55C) in the Utilities area.  \n\nThe alternative case scenario for anhydrous hydrogen chloride is a vapor release from a failure of the 1/4 inch piping off the 600-pound cylinder, resulting in release of 410 pounds of hydrogen chloride.  \n\nThe alternative case scenario for chlorine is a release of vapor from a failure of the 3/8 inch tubing off a 1 ton container of chlorine resulting in the release of 210 pounds of chlorine.  \n\nThe alternative case scenario for vinyl chloride is a pump seal failure on the pump used for unloading vinyl acetate from a truck into a storage tank.  \n\n4.  General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:  Following is a brief summary of the elements that Huntsman's Odessa site has implemented to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements outlined by EPA as well as with the Occupational Health and Safety Administration(OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\nHuntsman's Odessa site maintains a compilation of current and accurate written safety information to identify and understand the hazards of the process.  This includes information pertaining to:\n- Hazards of regulated substances: For each regulated substance, there is a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) which discusses physical properties of the chemicals, exposure hazards, the required personal protective equipment and appropriate first aid and emergency treatment for exposure.  \n- The technology of the process: Includes a discussion of process chemistry, safe upper and lower limits of temperature and pressure, and analysis of consequences of deviation.\n- Equipment in the process: Includes such information a"

The Odessa site utilizes the HAZOP and What-if/Checklist methodologies, recognized and generally accepted methods for identifying and evaluating hazards in the process.  The Odessa site assigns employees to the HAZOP team who are knowledgeable in the HAZOP methodology and the specific process.  The HAZOP team develops recommendations to reduce the potential hazards which, if approved, are implemented within a reasonable period of time.  \n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\nHuntsman Odessa maintains written operating procedures that were developed by the operators to provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities associated with a covered process.  The procedures address steps for all operating phases, safety systems, control measures and precautions to prevent exposures to process hazards.  The procedures are reviewed and revised periodically to ensure their accuracy and completeness.  \n\nTRAINING\nHuntsman Odessa provides initial training as well as refresher training to employees to assure the required level of skills and knowledge are maintained.  The training emphasizes safety and health hazards, emergency operations, and safe work practices.  All operators receive periodic refresher training.  \n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\nHuntsman Odessa has developed written procedures for maintaining the operating components of the process (including pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown system controls, and pumps) through the mechanical integrity program.

The procedures assure that, prior to any change, the following issues are considered: the technical basis for the proposed change, its impact on safety and health, any modifications to operating procedures, the necessary time period for the change, and any authorization requirements.  Employees involved in operating a process, as well as maintenance and contract employees whose job will be affected, are informed of and trained in the change.  If necessary, the process safety information and operating procedures are updated. \n\nPRE-STARTUP REVIEW\nHuntsman Odessa performs pre-startup safety reviews when the addition of or a modification to the facility is made that is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.  The pre-startup safety review confirms, prior to the introduction of highly hazardous chemicals, that construction and equipment is in accordance with design specifications; safety, operating, maintenance and emergency procedures are in place; management-of-change requirements are met; and training of employees affected by modifications is complete.  \n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDIT\nHuntsman Odessa performs audits of its compliance with provisions of its process safety management program.  Teams comprised of employees, with appropriate knowledge of audit techniques, process safety and operating experience, conduct audits every three years to verify the procedures and practices developed are adequate and being followed.  The findings of the audit team are reviewed and appropriate corrective actions are implemented and tracked until resolved.  \n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\nHuntsman Odessa investigates any incidents that resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release of covered chemicals."
