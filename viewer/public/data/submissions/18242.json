      "SummaryText": "Ohio Edison - Sammis Plant \n   \nOhio Edison operates the Sammis Plant in Stratton, Ohio.  The Sammis Plant is a coal-fired power plant, which employs approximately 434 full time employees.\n\nThe Sammis Plant uses only one regulated chemical that is above threshold quantity as specified in the Risk Management Program regulations.  The facility stores chlorine in up to six one ton cylinders at a 100% maximum fill capacity, holding 2,000 pounds each.  The Facility adheres to the appropriate government rules and industry guidelines for the storage and use of this toxic substance.\n\n\nRisk Management Planning\n\nThe Facility has an extensive information sharing practice with its workers and the general public regarding the chemicals used at the facility and their associated risks.  The Facility is subject to the Risk Management Program requirement under Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act due to its storage and process use of chlorine. The facility uses both passive measures and active mitigation to minimize the likelihood of releases and their potential impact on the public and on the environment.  \n\nThe mitigation system is used to minimize the consequences of a release.  The mitigation system used for the chlorine cylinders includes a storage room with a ventilation fan.\n\n\nWorst-Case Scenario\n\nThe instantaneous failure of the chlorine cylinders, while being unloaded is used as the Regulated Toxic Substance Worst-Case Scenario at the facility.  This scenario is assumed to result in a total release of one cylinder's contents (2,000 lbs.).  Moreover, the worst case meteorological conditions are incorporated into the calculation of the endpoint distance for the chlorine release.  The conditions are:  temperature of 40 oC, humidity of 65%, and a windspeed 1.5 m/sec.  The distance to the endpoint is defined as the distance to which a minimum concentration of 3.0 mg/L occurs from the vaporization of the chlorine.  The distance to endpoint for this toxic liquid spill and complet"

This endpoint extends beyond the facility's property line and includes a residential population, schools, a state park, and recreational areas.\n\n\nAlternate Case Scenario Results\n\nAn alternate release scenario was examined for the chlorine cylinders and process at the Sammis Plant.  The alternate scenario involves the failure of a cylinder containing 1,000 lbs. of chlorine.  There is assumed to be a complete failure of the chlorine cylinder, resulting in a total release of the liquid (1,000 lbs.) into the chlorine storage building.  The release rate is mitigated by the building and is estimated to be 41.0 pounds/minute and is assumed to continue for 23.4 minutes.  The endpoint distance is estimated to be 0.3 miles.  This endpoint extends beyond the facility's property line and includes a recreational area (no residental population).\n\n\nAccident History and Safety Information\n\nThe Ohio Edison is committed to keeping preventive procedures, safety precautions, and alternatives updated.  In addition, standard operating procedures are available for all pieces of equipment, which entail process descriptions, safety information, and emergency shut down instructions.  Furthermore, personnel are trained to respond to minor accidental releases.  The Sammis Plant has not had any accidents involving a release of a regulated substance in processes within the past five years.  The five-year accident history is defined by the RMP regulations to include accidents related to regulated chemicals that result in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. Ohio Edison is continuously improving operating procedures, equipment, and several safety measures to reduce the likelihood of an incident.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe Sammis Plant believes the best way to manage risk is not only to prevent accidents, but also to"

After careful consideration of the identified release scenarios, the accident history, and a review of the latest inspection report from the Environmental Protection Agency, no changes to the current systems are planned. The Emergency Response Program will continue to reduce the risk through continuous use of safety precautions and instructions that already exist at the facility.  The Sammis RMP Manual includes such Risk Management components as: process safety information, equipment identification, operating procedures, inventory restrictions, process or facility change, employee participation plan, injury/incident reporting and investigation, respiratory protection, hazard communication plan, and plant emergency operations."
