      "SummaryText": "Tronox LLC's Hamilton Facility is an OSHA VPP (Voluntary Protection Program) Star site that has a standing policy, Commitment to Environmental Stewardship.  We are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and environmentally responsible manner.  Several programs have been developed and implemented to address accidental release prevention and emergency response planning to help ensure the safety of our employees, contractors, and neighbors and protection of the environment.  The Hamilton Facility has developed and implemented an Emergency Response Program for protecting public health and the environment. \n \nThe Tronox Hamilton Facility is situated on approximately 3,000 acres in Monroe County, near the town of Hamilton, Mississippi, and produces titanium dioxide (TiO2) pigment.  Chlorine is used to manufacture TiO2, and as a processing aid in the cooling towers and water treatment systems.  Titanium Tetrachloride (TiCl4) is produced as an intermediate product during the pigment production process.  \n\nThe facility has prepared a worst case scenario for chlorine and an alternative release scenario for titanium tetrachloride.\n\nThe facility has taken numerous steps to prevent releases from its operations.  Some of these include installation of pressure relief valves and excess flow valves on storage tanks.  Water deluge systems and diking of tanks and vessels have been utilized.  Standard operating procedures (SOPs) and job safety and environmental analyses (JSEAs) have been developed for handling these substances at the facility.\n\nOur approach to accidental release prevention is full compliance with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and implementation of the ABS Consulting Process Safety Management Compliance program.  Key elements include: \n\nProcess Safety Information - chemical hazards, process technology and equipment information is documented, maintained, and available to personnel; \n\nProcess Hazards Analysis - process ha"

This plan provides procedures for informing the public and local emergency response agencies about accidental releases.  We have a Community Alert System that includes nine offsite sirens that can be activated in the event of an emergency by any of the three activation stations located inside the plant or by the Monroe County Emergency Management Agency.  Our ER Plan is site-specific and has been shared with the Monroe County EPC.  Facility employees are trained to respond to emergencies as described in the emergency response plan, including routine drills.  Onsite HazMat Fire/Rescue team members are trained in the use of the necessary personal protective equipment needed to respond to accidental releases of all substances at the facility.  EMR/EMT team members are trained in the proper first aid and emergency medical treatment necessary to treat accidental human exposures.  In addition, the facility has a full-time Occupational Nurse onsite that provides medical monitoring for all employees.\n\nTronox is committed to continuously improving our safety, health and environmental performance including the prevention of accidental releases."
