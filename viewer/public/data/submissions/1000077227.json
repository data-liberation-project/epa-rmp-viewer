Facility Description\n\n\n\nSolenis LLC, formally BASF Corporation in Suffolk Virginia was established in 1983 as an organic chemical manufacturer. The plant utilizes acrylic chemistry to manufacture water soluble polymers for use in the water treatment, mining, and paper industries. There is also on-site warehouse that manages the site's distribution activities. The facility can receive raw materials in containers by rail or truck. Finished goods are packaged for shipment in various sized containers or delivered by truck or rail. \n\n\n\nThe site covers 225 acres on the west side of Wilroy Road, ? mile north of the Wilroy Industrial Park and east of the Nansemond River. Of the 225 acres the production facility occupies 35 acres and the remainder is utilized for agriculture or undeveloped.\n\n\n\n2.    RMP Chemicals on Site\n\n\n\nThere are several chemicals on site that are listed under the RMP rule: acrylonitrile, propane, acetylene, sulfur dioxide and ammonia hydroxide.  All but acrylonitrile are stored at levels below the RMP threshold.  Acrylonitrile is used in the manufacture of acrylamide, the site's primary raw material.  \n\n\n\n3.    Process Description\n\n\n\nProduction of acrylamide monomer from acrylonitrile began in 1997 with a process called catalytic hydration.  This process was discontinued in September of 2013 and was replaced by a biocatalytic process in July 2014. The new operation is a batch process that operates under ambient pressure and temperatures. Acrylamide is produced by feeding acrylonitrile into a biocatalyst slurry until the batch concentration achieves 50% acrylamide and negligible AN \n\n\n\nAcrylonitrile is delivered to the site exclusively in rail cars designed to be off-loaded from the top into a closed system. The rails cars and the unloading apparatus were designed to meet NFPA 497A requirements for highly flammab"

The tanks are equipped with the following alarms; high and low level, high and low pressure and high and high/high temperatures. \n\nStorage tank levels can be monitored and controlled remotely by production personnel and observed via a CCV. \n\n\n\n4.    Accidental Release Prevention Measures\n\n\n\nThe highest probability of a release of acrylonitrile would occur during the unloading process, but the likelihood of a significant release is extremely remote based on the design, construction, operation and testing associated with acrylonitrile offloading.  \n\n\n\nPrevention measures include the following:\n\n\n\n?    A derailer is placed on the railroad track in front of the railcar being offloaded, which prevents any other railcar mistakenly placed on the track from reaching the offloading car.\n\n?    Transfer hoses are inspected, and pressure tested before each offload.\n\n?    The initial step in the off-loading process is to pressurize the rail car and the transfer line to the pump. In this manner issues with equipment would be detected quickly and a minimal amount would be released.\n\n?    During the entire railcar offloading process, the rail car, the offloading line and the storage tank diked areas are monitored by remote tilt/zoom cameras from the process control room which is manned throughout the off-loading operation. If required, the off-loading process can be halted remotely from the control room\n\n?    An acrylonitrile detector is mounted beneath the offloading station that would detect a vapor release to atmosphere. There is also a sensor in the diked area to provide early warning of a leak. \n\n?    Each storage tank is equipped with an independent high-level shutoff mechanism to prevent overfilling.  \n\n?    Should a leak occur, a remotely operated shutdown switch is in place, which would close all transfer lines, shut down the transfer pump and close the storage tan"

The storage tank diked area can immediately be covered in foam in the evident of a leak, which suppresses vapor formation.  This foam system operates automatically in case of fire but can also be operated remotely from the process control room if a leak were detected.  \n\n?    The level in one of the three acrylonitrile storage tanks is low enough to hold the contents of a full tank, in this manner a leaking tank could be transferred and would not release the full contents.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nNo accidents occurred within the past 5 years that would be defined as an accident under 40 CFR 68.42 \n\n\n\n5.    Safety Philosophy\n\n\n\nManagement of the Suffolk Solenis Site is guided by the principals found in Responsible Care. The American Chemistry Council (ACC) Responsible Care Management System (RCMS) is composed of six codes of management practice found in the ACC's Association's Responsible Care initiative.  Three of the codes are particularly relevant to this discussion which are, Process Safety (PS); Employee Health and Safety (H&S); and: Community Awareness and Emergency Response (CAER).\n\n \n\nProcess safety oversite is managed by the site's Process Safety Management (PSM) Committee, which is comprised of employees from each production area, engineering and maintenance, Senior Management as well as environmental, health and safety personnel.  The committee monitors PSM issues, hosts training activities and performs PSM audits.  \n\nOversite and management of the elements of Process Safety are the responsibility of site employees who have been designated as a Subject Matter Experts (SME). It is their responsibility to implement and manage the program. The site's SMEs review the status of their element annually and present these findings to the PSM committee through formally scheduled presentations.  These "

The objective was to broaden the site's knowledge around PSM compliance and assist the SME in critique their element.  The results of these audits were included in the SME's annual review.\n\n\n\nEmployee Health and Safety; The Suffolk site was certified in 2001 by Virginia's Occupational Safety & Health Administration under the Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) as a STAR facility.  To maintain the STAR status the site must have a documented Safety and Health program that covers all elements of VPP. This program must demonstrate the following activities: \n\n\n\n?    Management Support and Participation \n\n?    Establishing Health and Safety goals, \n\n?    Participating in site audits, \n\n?    Dedicating EHS resources, \n\n?    Conducting \"Safety Contacts\" with line employees to promote safe work practices \n\n?    Participating in safety meetings\n\n\n\nTo support the STAR status a site wide safety audit is conducted quarterly and a self-evaluation of the site's VPP program performance is conducted annually.  \n\n\n\nCommunity Awareness: The site has a strong relationship with the city of Suffolk Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) holding both chair and co-chair position within the past five years. The committee sponsored two joint agency drills, one in June 2016 and second in November 2018. These drills were designed to ensure there is a good working relationship between the site and local emergency responders such as; Suffolk Fire and Rescue, Police, 911 dispatch, area EMT's and local Hospitals and the city's communication department. \n\n\n\nThe June "

Local agencies including Suffolk Fire and Rescue, Suffolk Police Department, Virginia Regional Hazmat Team, Sentara Obici Hospital, Sentara BelleHarbour Emergency Department, Tidewater Regional Health Department, Suffolk Emergency Communications, and various other support personnel participated in a tabletop exercise as a continuation of the practical exercise in the morning.  The Suffolk site sponsored the event and provided a professional facilitator for the exercise.  A team of exercise evaluator published an After-Action Report and provided it to the Suffolk Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) for follow-up actions to ensure the recommendations are addressed\n\nIn November 2018 Solenis (BASF) hosted a large-scale hazmat railcar exercise on November 9 involving over 100 participants from area hospitals, media, local industry, and local and regional hazmat teams. \n\n\n\n\n\n6.

The team participates in training every quarter, some on-site and some off-site.  Training also includes regular drills to test the site's response capabilities. The results of these drills are communicated to all employees including evacuation plans for non-responders.  The site also owns and maintains a wide selection of emergency response equipment.  The site works jointly with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) including a myriad of Virginia's Emergency Response specialists including the hospital staff, HAZMAT teams, local fire and police, and many other experts in emergency response in the state.
