The City of Winfield abidies by all pertinent EPA Risk Management Program regulations to guard against accidental releases of chlorine at the water treatment plant, and if they do occur, to minimize the harm to the surrounding community and the environment.\n\n4.  Five-Year Accident History.  There have been no accidental releases of chlorine during the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, has there been any accidental releases resulting in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuation, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n5.  Emergency Response Program. The facility has a written emergency action plan.  We do not plan to have our employees respond to a major release.  If a large release of chlorine takes place at our facility, the response is to evacuate the area of the spill and call 911 and all applicable emergency response numbers listed in our Emergency Action Plan.\n\n6.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety.  Safety improvement is an on-going process at this facilty.  Perodic evaluations are performed to access the condition of the facility.
