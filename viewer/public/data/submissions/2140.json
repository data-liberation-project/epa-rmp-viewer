To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nSuper Store Industries maintains an emergency response committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Emergency Response Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes. \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\u0015 The Super Store Industries facility chills and stores a variety of food products in their cold storage warehouse.  The refrigeration process, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold storage rooms.  Changes in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature.  For example, lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature.  Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat.  Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize.  Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid.  Typical operating conditions range from 2 psig on the low pressure side of the system to 110-150 psig on the high side.\n\n\u0015 Ammonia is used as the refrigerant in"

The programmable controller will however, continue to read all the system sensors.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nSuper Store Industries has implemented an Emergency Response Team that is trained to handle an ammonia release.  All refrigeration operators are OSHA Technician Level trained (24 hours) and all supervisors are OSHA First Responder Operations Level trained (8 hours).  The Super Store Industries' Emergency Response Plan, is designed to meet the requirements for Process Safety Management, and give our employees and community the maximum protection in the event of an ammonia release.\n\nThe contents of this plan is used in the Hazardous Materials Management Plan which is filed with the San Joaquin County Office of Emergency Services, as well as to update the existing plan in the Training Program Manual. The process for developing the best possible mitigation to any release large or small is through employee participation using the Process Safety Management Committee, and any site specific documented plan previously used. \n\nThe Response Plan, includes continuously changing scenarios that are discussed during those meetings to always improve Response Safety. An Emergency Response Team, located at this facility as well as First Responders Operational Program gives Super Store Industries both defensive and offensive protection.\n\nSuper Store Industries conducts on-site emergency drills to provide training and to evaluate employee response in the event of a potential release. Fire drills can be incorporated using the scenarios that the wind may have disrupted the designated area on occasion.  \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)  provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the Super Store Industries Lathrop facility located at 16888 McKinley Avenue in Lathrop, California 95330.

The high pressure receiver can hold the entire charge.  This vessel is enclosed by the building and therefore passive mitigation measures were incorporated into the release rate.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used: 1.5 m/s and F stability.  This facility is located in a rural setting.  The maximum potential downwind distance to 200 ppm was determined using Exhibit 4-4 from EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Facilities, November 1998.  This potential release scenario reaches off-site and may affect population receptors.  No environmental receptors are affected by this potential scenario.\n\nAlternative Release Result Summary\nThe alternative release scenario was that of a 0.25 inch diameter leak of high pressure liquid ammonia for one hour.  The quantity of ammonia released in one hour at this rate is 6300 pounds.  This release could occur due to a gasket rupture, pinhole leak, flange seal leak, valve bonnet seal leak, etc. In addition, this release could occur outside; therefore passive mitigation measures were not utilized. The meteorological conditions used were 3 m/s and D stability. This facility is located in a rural setting.  The maximum potential downwind distance to 200 ppm was determined using Exhibit 4-5 from EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Facilities, November 1998.  This potential release scenario reaches off-site and may affect population receptors.  No environmental receptors are affected by this potential scenario.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nAdministrative Measures:\nThe facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (II"
