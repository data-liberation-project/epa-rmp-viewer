              "Description": "Chlorine is purchased from Ideal Chemical in Jackson,MS. in 150-lb. containers only.  These cylinders arrive in a company-owned tractor trailer.  The delivery truck is required to back up to a loading dock which closely matches the heighth of the rear door of the trailer.  Cylinders are never off loaded from the ground level to minimize the chance of an accident. The cylinders are preloaded by the vendor onto steel pallets with rails and chains to prevent tipping of the cylinders.  Each pallet contains fifteen cylinders.  A forklift with a lift capacity of 4150 lbs. is used to lift the pallets containing the cylinders out of the delivery truck.  All receiving paperwork is checked to insure an accurate count and the pallets with the full cylinders are transported sixty feet to another dock where the cylinders are unloaded and stored individually on the cylinder dock.  Empty chlorine cylinders,which have been stored in a separate area of the cylinder dock, are then reloaded onto the steel pallets and moved back to the loading dock.  There they are placed inside the tractor trailer to be returned to Ideal Chemical.  Chlorine cylinders are loaded by hand from the loading dock onto delivery vehicles which are designed and built to handle the weight of these cylinders.  The driver is required to secure these cylinders in an upright position using heavy web straps. A  proper manifest and placquarding of the vehicle is also required.  All chlorine cylinders are delivered with safety caps installed to insure the valve will be protected in the event that the cylinder falls.  When the driver arrives at the customer's location he is required to use extreme caution in the handling of a chlorine cylinder.  The cylinder is lowered to the ground over the rear gate while holding it securely to prevent it from simply dropping.  The driver is not allowed to change out an empty chlorine cylinder for the customer.  The customer is required to have the empty cylinder available for pickup and the driver simply leaves the full cylinder for the customer to actually hook up.  Empty chlorine cylinder are treated just like full cylinders.  They are secured in an upright position using heavy web straps.  Upon arriving back at the facility, they are off-loaded and stored on the cylinder dock to await pickup by the vendor, Ideal Chemical.",

Greene Welding Supply is dedicated to protecting the health and safety of it's employees and the public while complying with all applicable laws and regulations.  The only regulated chemical present is chlorine.  This chemical is sold to water systems in the trade area in 150-lb. cylinders only.  The worst case release scenario is the release of one standard cylinder of chlorine in 10 minutes.  Toxic endpoint for the release is .4 miles.  The alternate release scenario is the release of one standard cylinder of chlorine over a period of eight hours from a .1square inch hole.  This scenario represents the greater likleyhood that a chlorine cylinder would develope a leak in the valve and slowly leak down over an extended period of time.  Toxic endpoint for the alternate release scenario is .1 miles.   In the event of a reportable release, the Monroe Fire Department will be notified to respond.  The Local Emergency Planning Committee would also be notified in order to inform the public and effect any other emergency procedures to protect public safety."
