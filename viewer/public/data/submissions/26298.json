      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\u00a7 68.155 (a) Accidental Release Prevention Program and Emergency Action Policies \n\nChlorine is used to manufacture bleach at this OnLine Packaging, Inc. facility.  Since chlorine is considered to be hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), OnLine Packaging, Inc. will use appropriate safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent accidental releases and minimize any hazard to human health or the environment.  It is the policy of OnLine Packaging, Inc. to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving chlorine, the emergency response plan calls for certain internal procedures and actions to be taken in addition to the immediate notification of the Michigan City Fire Department, the National Emergency Response Center, and the Chemical Transportation Emergency Center (CHEMTREC). \n\n\u00a7 68.155 (b) Stationary Source and Substances Handled\n\nOnLine Packaging, Inc. manufactures bleach, RV antifreeze and windshield washer solution at their plant in Michigan City, Indiana.  The regulated substance handled at this facility is chlorine. The maximum inventory of chlorine on site is a 90-ton tank car located on a railroad spur adjacent to the building.  Chlorine is used to manufacture sodium hypochlorite (bleach) for consumer use.  Liquid chlorine is piped from the tank into the building where it reacts with caustic soda to produce bleach under carefully controlled conditions.\n\n\u00a7 68.155 (c) Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case scenario described in Section 2 of this plan involves the release of the total contents, as liquid chlorine, of a 90-ton tank car in 10 minutes.  Using RMP*Comp, the distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case release is 14 miles.  This toxic endpoint encompasses Michigan City, Indiana, and parts of Porter and Berrien Counties.  \n\nIn the alternative release scenario for this facility, it is assumed that a chlorine unloading hose failure results i"
