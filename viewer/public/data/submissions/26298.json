Since chlorine is considered to be hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), OnLine Packaging, Inc. will use appropriate safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent accidental releases and minimize any hazard to human health or the environment.  It is the policy of OnLine Packaging, Inc. to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving chlorine, the emergency response plan calls for certain internal procedures and actions to be taken in addition to the immediate notification of the Michigan City Fire Department, the National Emergency Response Center, and the Chemical Transportation Emergency Center (CHEMTREC). \n\n? 68.155 (b) Stationary Source and Substances Handled\n\nOnLine Packaging, Inc. manufactures bleach, RV antifreeze and windshield washer solution at their plant in Michigan City, Indiana.  The regulated substance handled at this facility is chlorine. The maximum inventory of chlorine on site is a 90-ton tank car located on a railroad spur adjacent to the building.  Chlorine is used to manufacture sodium hypochlorite (bleach) for consumer use.  Liquid chlorine is piped from the tank into the building where it reacts with caustic soda to produce bleach under carefully controlled conditions.\n\n? 68.155 (c) Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case scenario described in Section 2 of this plan involves the release of the total contents, as liquid chlorine, of a 90-ton tank car in 10 minutes.  Using RMP*Comp, the distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case release is 14 miles.  This toxic endpoint encompasses Michigan City, Indiana, and parts of Porter and Berrien Counties.  \n\nIn the alternative release scenario for this facility, it is assumed that a chlorine unloading hose failure results i"

      "SummaryText": "n the release of 150 pounds of liquid chlorine in 1 minute.  Using RMP*Comp the distance to the toxic endpoint calculated for this alternative release scenario is 0.2 miles.  No passive mitigation devices are used at OnLine Packaging, Inc.  However, both automatic and manual systems can activate system shutdown if a leak occurs. \n\n? 68.155 (d) General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOnLine Packaging, Inc. complies with the EPA?s accidental release prevention rules and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  The chlorine systems are designed and operated in accordance with Chlorine Institute recommendations. \n ? 68.155 (e) Five-Year Accident History\n\nThe OnLine Packaging, Inc. Michigan City plant is starting up in 2002 and therefore has never had an accidental release of chlorine in any quantity.   A second OnLine Packaging, Inc. plant in Plover, Wisconsin, has never had an accidental release of chlorine in any quantity.\n\n? 68.155 (f) Emergency Response Program\n\nIn addition to the emergency response procedures discussed above, the employee emergency action plan is implemented whenever the safety of employees is at risk.  The plan identifies outside agencies that will be notified and establishes procedure for evacuating personnel.\n\n? 68.155 (g) Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThis is a new facility.  No changes are planned at this time.  However, if continued operations indicate the need, changes will be implemented."
