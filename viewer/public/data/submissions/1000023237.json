Each employee is granted the authority to stop work if it is deemed unsafe.

However, safety requires the participation of everyone...only you can make safety a reality. Be alert for conditions which appear unsafe. Report unsafe conditions immediately.

Description of the Bensalem PA Facility\nThe Bensalem, PA Facility is located at 3800 Marshall Lane, Bensalem, PA.  The facility provides transportation and public warehousing services for manufacturers, distributors and end users of pre-packaged specialty chemicals. Warehousing activities include shipping, receiving and storage of chemicals as specified by customer requirements. The chemicals stored at the Bensalem Warehouse include flammable, corrosive and toxic hazards. Toluene Diisocyanate is the only RMP regulated substance handled at the site. \n\n1.2.2.    Description of the Warehousing and Storage Processes \nRinchem receives the Toluene Diisocyanate by truck as shipped from the manufacturer or distributor. It is unloaded from the truck using a forklift and staged for inspection. After the material passes quality and safety inspection, it is placed into the hazard-specific storage area until it is shipped to the end user. The storage location of each material is tracked in an electronic inventory management system. \nAfter an order is received, Rinchem ships the Toluene Diisocyanate as ordered by the end user. The material is picked and staged for quality and safety "

Worst-Case Release Scenario\nWell-documented offsite consequence analyses are essential to adequate communication of potential hazards at the Rinchem Bensalem, PA Warehouse.  Rinchem conducted an offsite consequence analysis, using the EPA's Areal Location of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA&reg;) in conjunction with the rules specified in 40 CFR 68.25 to estimate the offsite consequence of a Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) from our warehousing process. The WCS associated with toxic substances in the Bensalem, PA Warehouse is a catastrophic failure of the single largest container resulting in a release of the total contents, 55 gallons of Toluene Diisocyanate. The passive mitigation measures taken into account for this scenario are the limited quantity of the Toluene Diisocyanate that can be released due to container  and the handling of containers within the building.\n\n1.4.    The Five Year Accident History\nThere has never been a reportable accident involving Toluene Diisocyanate at the Rinchem Company Inc, Bensalem Warehouse. \n\n1.5.    The Emergency Response Program\nOverall safety at the Rinchem Company, Inc. Bensalem Warehouse is governed not only by our ability to prevent accidental releases of Toluene Diisocyanate from occurring, but also by the ability to mitigate any accidental releases of Toluene Diisocyanate. Rinchem has developed an emergency response program to minimize the effects of accidental releases of Toluene Diisocyanate to employees (vapor-dispersion modeling demonstrates no impact public receptors). Rinchem management has opted to respond to releases of Toluene Diisocyanate by containing the spill when it can be safely done and using contracted services for spill cleanup. \nThe Bensalem Warehouse Emergency Response Program consists of:\nA?
