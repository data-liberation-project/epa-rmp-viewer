Installation of 600 GPM Deluge system covering the Bromine Terminal and Storage Tank\n2. Relocation of the Bromine Feed tank out of the process area and to the Bromine terminal adjacent to the Bromine Storage Tank within the Deluge system covered area.\n3. Installation of a Containment area, water layer sump, and storage tank for parking of road trailers containing bromine trailers prior to offload. \n\nThese have all been installed and implemented with the intent to mitigate potential offsite and on-site impacts."

At this site, Albemarle produces sample quantities (1 kg level) to semi-commercial quantities of various flame retardants and brominated compounds. Additionally, Albemarle has truck unloading facilities to receive and store elemental bromine. This bromine has been supplied via pipeline to an adjacent external facility and to processes within the plant for over a decade. In April of 2018, Albemarle Corporation divested its Catalyst Business from operations at the Process Development Center to W.R. Grace & Co.  This included the flammable chemical required to be reported for RMP purposes.  The Albemarle Process Development Center now exclusively runs on Bromine related processes.  \n\nCurrently Albemarle has on site RMP covered levels of one toxic chemical (bromine) that is above RMP threshold quantities. Bromine is used extensively in two processes, 1) the Bromine supply terminal, and 2) manufacture of a polymeric flame retardant, HP-7010.  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies - In its operations, Albemarle is committed to the safety of the surrounding community, as well as protection of the environment. With a strong Process Safety Management program in place, Albemarle combines both passive and active mitigation systems to prevent offsite consequences in the event of a spill of bromine. In addition, our highly trained Emergency Response team is always available to respond to any incident, and bring it quickly under control. Emergency responders are trained annually, and a trained Incident Commander is on site at all times to coordinate emergency response procedures. Albemarle shares an Emergency Response Team with W."

Grace & CO and participates in the Baton Rouge Area Mutual Aid System (BRAMAS) and the North Baton Rouge Chemical Industry Task Force. \n\nFive Year Accident History - There have been no offsite accidents at this location that had any adverse effects to neighboring industry or the community.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety - Albemarle is committed to an ever improving safety program to maintain its rating in the top 5% in the chemical industry. We conduct Process Hazards Analyses (PHA) of all chemical operations including lab safety audits for all bench scale processes for new projects. We conduct Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA) to improve the quality of PHA studies to ensure thoroughness and effectiveness.   We also conduct reactive hazard evaluations on all processes, with the goal of identifying reactive hazards which might occur during normal or upset conditions.\n\nSince the previous submission in 2018, \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program - Albemarle employs the latest technology in its process controls, monitoring, and mitigation systems to ensure that accidental releases are prevented or the risks associated with them are minimized. Process documentation for covered processes are in compliance with OSHA 1910.119 requirements for Process Safety Management (PSM). Equipment inspections are scheduled and documented to ensure vessel integrities. Bromine storage and handling equipment are either glass-lined carbon steel, kynar lined piping, or nickel piping and vessel. Bromine detectors are maintained and tested on a regular frequency to aid in early detection of bromine releases.  Hydrocarbon detectors are strategically located to detect the release of flammable materials.  \n\nAlbemarle has a Special Events Management Plan (SEMP) program.  The purpose of the program is to provide a management/communication tool to mitigate the overall impact of an event and to ensure that Albemarle takes those actions necessary to comply with all legal requirement"
