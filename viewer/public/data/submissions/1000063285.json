      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES Quality Refrigerated Services is committed to providing a safe environment to its employees and surrounding communities. This commitment is reflected in the safety and environmental programs that are implemented at the facility. For example, written procedures have been created for operating the ammonia refrigeration system. Only trained operators and licensed refrigeration contractors are permitted to perform system operations. Quality Refrigerated Services has also developed a robust maintenance program to ensure the equipment is in good operating condition. All of these programs are geared towards the prevention of an accidental release at the facility. In addition, these programs incorporate emergency procedures to mitigate the effects of a release if it does occur. At such an event, emergency coordinators will assess the situation and notify outside responding agencies as necessary. \r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE Quality Refrigerated Services is located at 2626 Polar Road, Worthington, MN  56187. The area surrounding the facility is rural with a mixture of light business and residential areas. The Quality Refrigerated Services ammonia refrigeration process was designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations. The ammonia refrigeration system uses approximately 17,365 pounds of ammonia for dock operations, cold storage, and freezer storage. The majority of the system is located in the machine room including vessels and compressors. The condensers and are mounted on the roof above the machine room. Evaporators are located in their respective cold storage rooms/areas. \r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS Quality Services Refrigeration has developed an accidental release prevention program for compliance with OSHA and EPA regulations. The program includes but is not limited to the following elements"

In addition, engineering controls have been implemented to reduce the chance of an accidental release to the environment. These are comprised of equipment monitoring systems and safety cutouts to shut off the equipment when operating parameters exceed safe operating limits. Relief valves on pressurized ammonia vessels prevent equipment rupture in the event of over pressurization. Regular inspections and tests are performed to ensure these controls are in good working order. \r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY A review of the facility's five-year accident history showed that there have been no incidents at the facility that meet the RMP criteria for a reportable accident (onsite deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place). In addition, there have been no incidents at the facility in the last five years that resulted in a release of more than the Federal Reportable Quantity (100 pounds). \r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM Quality Refrigerated Services has developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) for the purpose of protecting employees and the surrounding community. The EAP covers procedures for: 1) evacuating and accounting for visitors and employees, 2) dealing with an ammonia release and other foreseeable emergencies that could occur onsite, 3) notifying external agencies and emergency response personnel, and 4) administering first aid measures for ammonia exposure. Employees are informed of the elements of the EAP. In th"

Ammonia sensors are present in the machine room, and automatic shutdown systems. Employees within the building are to shelter in place or evacuate to a point upwind of the facility. Evacuation drills are performed annually. \r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY PHA's and Compliance Audits will be performed on the ammonia refrigeration system, and these studies will offer action items to improve safety at the facility. The recommendations will mainly consist of formalizing procedures, implementing practices consistent with industry standards, and performing inspections and tests to maintain the integrity of the equipment. Quality Refrigerated Services will implement these action items and will move forward with completing any remaining outstanding recommendations. In addition, the facility plans to continue providing employees with a safe work environment through continued training on current policies and procedures, and conducting audits to identify deficiencies and make improvements"
