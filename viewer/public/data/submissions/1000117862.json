This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in training personnel and promoting safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Koch\u0092s policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. Should a release occur, Koch\u0092s personnel are trained to respond quickly and effectively to control and mitigate the release.\n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event of an accidental release, the five-year accident history of the facility, and planned changes to improve safety at the plant.\n\n2.1.2\tSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe Wever fertilizer facility is operated by Koch to manufacture anhydrous ammonia, urea ammonium nitrate (UAN), granular urea, and diesel exhaust fluid (DEF). Liquid urea, ammonium nitrate, and nitric acid are produced as intermediate products. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia, a flammable mixed gas (hydrogen, methane) and a flammable natural gas mixture (methane, ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, pentane, and isopentane) are the RMP-regulated flammable materials present in amounts greater than the threshold quantity that is used or stored at the Koch Wever facility. The facility is regulated under the Program Level 3 requirements.\n\n2.1.3\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by Koch. These high standards include:\n\u0095\tOperating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations. \n\u0095\tOperating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases \n         are minimized.\n\u0095\tOperating and"

The accident prevention program is applied to all RMP-covered processes at Koch. Collectively, these activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failure and/or human error. In addition to the accident prevention program activities, Koch has safety features on many units to help 1) contain/control a release, 2) quickly detect a release, and 3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The following types of safety features are used in various processes: \n\u0095\tHydrocarbon and ammonia detectors with alarms \n\u0095\tProcess relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases \n\u0095\tValves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated) \n\u0095\tDouble-wall ammonia storage tank design for containing ammonia liquid \n\u0095\tRelease containment/control \n\u0095\tEmergency shutdown system \n\u0095\tCurbs or dikes to contain liquid releases \n\u0095\tRedundant equipment and instrumentation \n\u0095\tAtmospheric relief devices \n\u0095\tRelease mitigation \n\u0095\tFire suppression and extinguishing systems \n\u0095\tTrained emergency response personnel \n\u0095\tPersonal protective equipment\n\nThe following summary describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program at Koch. Koch is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and has procedures and standards for each PSM element. A summary of these programs and standards are listed below.\n\n2.1.4.1\tEMPLOYEE PARTICPATION\nKoch encourages employees and contractors to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Each Koch department is responsible for ensuring employee participation within the"

Examples of employee participation include involvement in pre-startup safety reviews, process hazard analysis, job hazard analysis, reviewing procedures, and participation in training and incident investigations. In addition, Koch has a safety committee and town hall meeting forums during which employees and contractors can address both process safety and occupational safety issues.\n\n2.1.4.2\tPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\nKoch maintains information pertaining to the highly hazardous materials used or produced at the facility, technology of the processes, and equipment used. Information is readily available and updated when changes are made in accordance with management of change procedures. Safety data sheets and other various technical documents are used to facilitate safe operation of the processes. The documents address limits for key process parameters, safe operating limits, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\n2.1.4.3\tPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS (PHA)\nKoch conducts scheduled evaluations of the safety of all processes and related facilities within its boundary limits to ensure safe operation and prevent potential catastrophic releases of hazardous materials. Potential offsite consequences are considered as part of this evaluation. Koch currently uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) method of analysis. Each analysis is conducted by a cross-functional team and facilitated by someone familiar with both Koch and HAZOP methodology. \n\nAs safety concerns are evaluated, they are ranked according to probability and consequence. All concerns are documented as part of the HAZOP process. Safety concerns that warrant action are formally documented as recommendations and passed on to an individual or department that will be responsible for resolution. The PSM group manages tracking of the Process Hazards Analysis act"

The results of these updates are documented and retained for the life of the process. Updated findings are stewarded for resolution and tracked.\n\n2.1.4.4\tOPERATING PROCEDURES\nKoch has developed and compiled a comprehensive set of operating procedures to provide instruction for the safe operation of Koch processes. Procedures provide a reliable and consistent reference for all phases of process operations including: 1) unit startup, 2) normal operations, 3) temporary operations, 4) emergency shutdown, 5) normal shutdown, 6) initial startup of a new process, 7) emergency operations, and 8) startup following an abnormal or emergency shutdown. \n\nEach procedure developed is reviewed for accuracy, consistency, and completeness. Each procedure contains procedure steps, operating parameters and limits, safety and health hazard information, safety control measures, and assignment of responsibility for performing the procedure. Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified per site operating procedure standards.\n\n2.1.4.5\tTRAINING\nKoch has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process or utility. Operators receive classroom, field training, exercise, and simulation training. Operators are required to demonstrate their knowledge through tests and skill demonstrations as well as have adequate knowledge to perform job duties and tasks in a safe manner. Refresher training is conducted at least every three years or more often if needed. All training information is documented.\n\n2.1.4.6\tCONTRACTOR SAFETY PROGRAM\nKoch has developed a Contractor Safety Program to satisfy PSM guidelines by extending plant safety requirements to non-Koch employees working within the site.

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, Koch has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform Koch personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to beginning work. In addition, Koch evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of contractors. Koch personnel periodically monitor through audits and contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n2.1.4.7\tPRE-START-UP SAFETY REVIEWS\nKoch conducts a pre-startup safety review (PSSR) any time new equipment or modifications to existing equipment change the associated process safety information. The review is intended to verify and document that all aspects of the equipment's design, construction, and operation have been evaluated as well as to ensure readiness that the equipment can be placed in operation. The PSSR team uses checklists and field verification of construction to examine all aspects of readiness. The PSSR is the final step in the construction or installation of new or modified equipment before the equipment is placed in service. \n\nPSSR procedure ensures that 1) construction is per design and safety system are tested per design; 2) operating, maintenance, and emergency response procedures are updated and readily available; 3) affected personnel are trained or notified as necessary; 4) process hazard analysis is conducted and all pre-start-up-related action items are complete; 5) post-start-up punch list items are documented and"

The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests per Recognized and Generally Accepted Good Engineering Practices (RAGAGEP), (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment. \n?\nWork is performed under the supervision of a maintenance craft supervisor. Maintenance personnel follow Recognized and Generally Accepted Good Engineering Practices (RAGAGEP) industry standards and equipment specifications during maintenance activities. Written safety procedures are followed for specific job tasks (i.e. line openings). A Job Safety Analysis (JSA) is conducted for maintenance jobs that are non-routine or may be different due to variables in the operation (i.e. hot taps or work on flare line.)\n\n2.1.4.9\tSAFE WORK PROCEDURES\nKoch has written programs for safe work practices to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include 1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, 2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, 3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials prior to opening process piping or equipment, 4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and 5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.

The process also ensures that all affected process safety information is updated to reflect the change and that the safety of the modification has been evaluated before startup.\n\n2.1.4.11\tINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\nKoch has a procedure that requires an investigation of all incidents which resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personnel injury within 48 hours. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. As per the procedure, the formal report is presented and distributed at the conclusion of the investigation. Each recommendation arising from the investigation is assigned and tracked until it is resolved. Resolution to each recommendation is documented and retained.\n\n2.1.4.12\tCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\nAs per the site Compliance Audit procedure, at least once every three years Koch is subject to a compliance audit. The audit team will include at least one employee knowledgeable in Koch and the audit process. At the conclusion of the audit, the audit team submits a report to Koch.

Team members attend routine required training that meets OSHA requirements for emergency responders; the training also complies with NFPA Standards. \n\n2.1.7\tPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nKoch is committed to a high level of corporate citizenship, placing the highest priority on the safety of people both within Koch and the neighboring community. Koch strives to continually improve its safety program and reward employees for outstanding safety performance. Koch has adopted the Safe Start Program. The program has been rolled out to all employees on site (and to the new employees as they are hired). Koch is using the DuPont Safety Perception Survey as a way to measure gaps. The site has a Safety Committee that meets on a monthly basis. The Safety Committee is comprised of employees from all areas of the plant. The Safety Committee has added subcommittees to focus on the three main items of communication, rewards and recognition, and employee participation from the results of the site\u0092s first safety perception survey. Weekly Toolbox talks are held to present different safety topics. Examples of a toolbox meeting are recent incidents from Koch and other plants, winter driving, using power tools, and electricity. The site has continuous tr"

The assigned courses are automatically sent out on a set frequency to the employees based on their job description. Some topics that are part of Koch's training portfolio include Confined Space Entry Training, Industrial Exterior Fire Brigade Training, CPR, Pressurized Flammable Gas Fire Training, and Hazmat Technician Training. Tabletop exercises are held with Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and Trans Canada (Natural Gas Pipeline into the Koch plant). Site-wide safety drills are being conducted to discover where the deficiencies are, if any. Local emergency responders, LEPCs, hospitals, and med-vac services are all invited to join Koch employees in these drills. The site has been set up with Reverse 911 to notify the community should there be an incident that goes off site.\n\n2.2\tRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN DATA ELEMENTS\nThe data elements included here are a more detailed version of the Risk Management Plan submitted to EPA. They are the same elements reported to EPA in RMP*eSubmit. In Table 3, the data elements reported to EPA have been modified by adding \"Source\u0094 and \"Rationale\u0094 columns to explain where the information was found, or from whom it was received (Source), and the reasoning behind the information (Rationale) if an explanation is needed. These two extra columns will not be reported to EPA in the Risk Management Plan submission. They are for the facility's information and use only.\n\nIncluded in this documentation are MARPLOT\u00ae results indicating population within the distance to various endpoints.  MARPLOT\u00ae, a software package created ty the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Census Bureau, shows population statistics from the 2010 Census for the Worst-Case Scenarios (WCS) and Alternative Release Scenarios (ARS) radii, as determined by the Offsite Consequence Analysis. The distance to the endpoint radii is indicated at the top of each page. The"
