No accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia have occurred at this facility in the past five years.\n\n5. This facility has an emergency response program, which has been coordinated with the Dike Fire Department, which is part of the Grundy County LEPC. This program includes a response decision tree and a notification plan.  Emergency operations plans and response procedures are reviewed annually, with a site visit of the facility by the Fire Department.\n\n6. Chang"
