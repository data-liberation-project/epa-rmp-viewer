No onsite reportable injuries involving Sulfur Dioxide, Sulfur Trioxide, or Isopropylamine have occurred since startup of the facility in 1984.\n\nBecause we believe that in the event of a chemical accident quick response is necessary to minimize the likelihood of onsite or offsite injuries, an extensive emergency response plan has been developed.  In addition to the written plan:\n-All employees receive annual training on the use of the emergency response and evacuation plans, use of personal protective equipment, operation of fire extinguishers and spill mitigation techniques.\n-Currently, 40 plant personnel are trained at the 40-hour industrial emergency responder Technician level.

Pilot Chemical holds to the ChemStewards environmental, health, safety and security principles as developed by the Society of Chemical Manufacturers and Affiliates (SOCMA).  Pilot Chemical is also committed to the maintenance of a quality management system which meets the requirements of the International Standards Organization ISO 9001:2008.  This commitment requires the work force to focus on the production of a quality product through continuous improvement in all phases of its operations.\n\nThe Pilot Chemical Company of Ohio, Middletown Plant occupies 27 acres in an open, relatively flat, combination rural and industrial area, southwest of Middletown, Ohio.  The original facility was constructed in 1984 with building additions in 1995 and 2012 and process additions in 1995 and 1998. The facility produces detergent grade sulfonic acid, synthetic detergents, surfactants and emulsifiers through continuous sulf(on)ation and neutralizer systems for use in the industrial, agricultural and personal care markets.\n\nThe regulated substances on site exceeding threshold quantities are Sulfur Dioxide and Sulfur Trioxide, both of which are toxics, and Isopropylamine, which is a flammable liquid.\n\nSulfur Dioxide is a clear, water-white liquid at temperatures below its atmospheric-pressure boiling point of 14 deg. F.  Sulfur Dioxide is stored on site as a liquefied, compressed gas at a pressure near 100 psi.  Sulfur Dioxide vapors are colorless and heavier than air, but are extremely irritating and suffocating at concentrations above 30 ppm. With a distinctive rotten egg smell, Sulfur Dioxide has good warning properties with an odor threshold of 0.5 ppm.  Sulfur Dioxide is stable and non-flammable in either the gaseous or liquid state.\n\nSulfur Trioxide is a clear, colorless, oily liquid at temperatures between its freezing and boiling points, which are 90 deg.
