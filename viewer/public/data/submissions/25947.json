We operate under General Electric Company's policy for Safety, Health & Environment.  This policy states: \n\nGE is committed to achieving environmental, health and safety (EHS) excellence.  This is a responsibility of management and employees in all functions.  GE will strive to provide a safe and healthy working environment and to avoid adverseimpact and injury to the environment and the communities in which we do business.\n\n Requirements:  \u00bf Assess EHS impacts before starting a new activity or project.  Consider EHS impacts in the design and production of GE's products and services.  Eliminate unreasonable risks from GE's facilities, products, services and activities.   \u00bfReduce the use and release of toxic and hazardous materials, prevent pollution and conserve, recover and recycle materials.  Continue to improve our EHS systems and performance as an integral part of GE's operational strategy.\n\nFacility Description And The Regulated Substances Handled\n\nGE Betz manufactures specialty water-treatment chemicals, primarily used for the treatment of water and wastewater in industrial process systems such as boilers and cooling towers.  \nMost of our products are formulated by blending several raw materials within a mixing vessel and then packaging into various size containers.  Depending on our customer's needs, our package types can range from small 5-gallon pails to 6000-gallon truckload quantities.\nSimilarly, our raw materials, which we receive from suppliers, come in various size containers depending on customer demand for the product and the amount necessary to meet supply limitations and production demand.\n\nThe GE Betz - Addison Plant covers 6.55 acres of property, of which 2.31 acres are used for offices, warehouse(s), production facilities and outdoor materia"

The balance is used for access roads, parking lot or open lawn, or idle areas.\n\n\n\nAt this plant, cyclohexylamine is a chemical raw material stored onsite as a liquid in 55-gallon drums.  It acts as a corrosion inhibitor by neutralizing acids and elevating pH in steam condensate, which makes it particularly useful as a component of our product line and to our customers.  This material is stored in a protected area and removed from any combustion sources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Worst-Case Release Scenario(s) And The Alternative Release Scenario(s)\n\nWithin the cyclohexylamine drum storage process, our Worst Case event involves a scenario where the contents of several drums are lost as an instantaneous release to an uncontained pavement outdoors during material transfer.  Using the U.S. EPA Offsite Consequence Guidance modeling data, this scenario would have an offsite consequence.  Although this material is normally stored in a protected containment area when not in transit, for the purposes of meeting the EPA requirements we did not consider any passive controls.  We also conservatively viewed that an amount of several drums would be released without any intervention by plant personnel to stop the release or to control the spread of the release, even though our facility personnel are capable of responding to mitigate a release of this chemical in various ways.  \nBecause all plant operators are well trained in hazardous chemical handling procedures, forklift operation, and spill response, we think that a release event of this sort is unlikely to occur.\n\nAs an Alternative Scenario an event more likely to occur than the Worst Case involving cyclohexylamine, we considered a release event of one single drum, again using the EPA methodology.  Mitigation systems were not included in this scenario.  The analysis indicates that this scenario would have an offsite consequence but it would be limited to a distance slightly less than the distance from the Worst Case scen"

      "SummaryText": "ario.  We choose to evaluate this scenario because the EPA required an Alternate Scenario that extended beyond the fenceline, although we feel an event involving a minor drum puncture of substantially less than a drum quantity would be more likely and would have no offsite consequences.\n\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program And Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe purpose of the program is to define steps that are taken to identify, evaluate, and prevent or mitigate releases of hazardous chemicals that could occur as a result of failures in processes, procedures, or equipment.  The prevention program includes elements that cover the compilation of process safety information related to the process, performance of process hazard review to identify and evaluate potential release scenarios, development and use of operating procedures, processes for insuring proper training of employees who are involved in handling hazardous chemicals, preventive maintenance for key equipment to limit the potential for failures that could cause releases, processes for managing changes in the process and conducting incident investigations for any release events that may occur.  The prevention program also includes requirements for performing compliance audits of the implementation of the prevention program.\n\n\nThe Five-Year Accident History\n\nAt the GE Betz - Addison Plant we have not had any accidental releases that resulted in significant death, injury, property damage on-site or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property or environmental damage in the past 5 years due to the use or handling of cyclohexylamine.\n\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nOur chemical release response program contains these elements:\n\n\n- Identification of emergency organization personnel structure and functional responsibilities\n- Quarterly inspections to determine any new sources of ignition and a check of safety control devices\n- Fire extinguisher training  \n-"
