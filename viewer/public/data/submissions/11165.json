This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Welland Chemical, Inc. plant is located in Newell, Pennsylvania. This facility produces Nitric Acid, in various forms and mixtures to meet exacting customer specifications. Nitric acid goes into the production of many of the modern comforts we enjoy in today's society. These industries, amongst others, utilize nitric acid as part of their production system; specialty steels, high-end electronics, plating, fertilizer, and explosives. The production of nitric acid starts with anhydrous ammonia and air. These two components are mixed together and reacted over a catalyst forming nitrogen dioxide. Nitrogen dioxide is then cooled, and condensed to form weak nitric acid. This weak nitric acid and remaining nitrogen dioxide then passes through an absorbing tower where nitrogen dioxide is absorbed in water to create more weak nitric acid. This weak nitric acid is then concentrated using sulfuric acid to absorb the water content of the weak nitric acid, leaving a concentrated or strong nitric acid. This strong nitric acid is then mixed with weak nitric to create blend acid solutions, or blended with oleum to create mixed acid solutions. \n\nThe facility has propane as a regulated flammable, and anhydrous ammonia, Oleum (20%), and nitric acid above the threshold quantity as regulated toxic chemicals that are part of the RMP program."

The unloading of these barges is completed while the towboat or motor force remains connected to the barges; for this reason, the unloading of ammonia is not covered. The model used for the Worst Case Scenario (WCS) and Alternative Case Scenarios (ACS) is the EPA's RMP*Comp(tm). It lists oleum as (30%) only; this facility utilizes Oleum (20% and 35%). Additionally, nitric acid is listed as 100%, this facility produces 98%. The facility's covered processes require the application of the RMP Program 3 criteria.\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nThe hazard assessments were completed utilizing the EPA's RMP*Comp(tm) modeling system. This system calls for the atmospheric stability class to be used as type F, which is the worst atmospheric situation. For all the scenarios, the type F atmospheric stability class was used.\n\nFlammable Substance\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances in the covered processes at the facility is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the largest (only) storage tank containing propane. This scenario would release 171,628 pounds of propane, assumed to release instantaneously, completely vaporize, and ignite, resulting in a VCE.  This event would have off-site consequences from the 1psi overpressure wave. The distance to endpoint would be .40 miles, which is just past the facility gate. The estimated population within the distance to the endpoint is 153. The public receptors within the distance of the endpoint include residences and recreational facilities only.  There are no environmental receptors within the distance to the endpoint Although we have controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this worst case scenario. \n\nThere is one alternate release scenario (ACS) considered more credible for the flammable release.

The 1psi endpoint would be .06 miles which is within the boundaries of the facility and will not reach public or environmental receptors.\n\nToxic Substance\nThe worst case scenario associated with the release of a toxic substance is a storage tank containing nitric acid. This scenario would release 713,775 pounds of nitric acid over a 10-minute period. The release would involve a liquid spill and vaporization of nitric acid. The release rate would be 71,377.5 pounds per minute. The wind speed would be 1.5 m/sec. The topography used in the model is urban.

The environmental receptors, within the distance to endpoint would include officially designated wildlife sanctuaries, preserves, or refuges and federal wilderness areas. The release would reach a public receptor at the ERPG 2 concentration.\n\nThere are three alternate release scenarios for toxic chemicals that would have off-site consequences. The chemicals involved are anhydrous ammonia, nitric acid and oleum. These events are selected as being practical scenarios for use in emergency planning and response.

Employees also form the emergency response team and haz mat teams for the facility and receive training to maintain qualifications; participate in safety and environmental meetings. Our process unit operators monitor their areas of responsibility and provide monthly reports on the status of various safety and emergency response equipment. \n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Welland Chemical facility maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific persons within the facility are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date Process Safety Information (PSI). Each process unit has its specific PSI training material for the operating personnel to refer to when questions arise.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, are provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the processes are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazards Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Welland Chemical facility has a program in place to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards, and to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe facility uses primarily the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) analysis and What-If/Checklist technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP and What-If/Checklist analysis are recognized as the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a multi-disciplined team with various experience backgrounds. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\nThe PHA team findings are documented for local management.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  Resolution of items can be categorized as procedures,"

The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained in a facility item tracking process.  \n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Welland Chemical facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe facility maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as unit startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified, by operators and management, as current and accurate.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the Management of Change (MOC) process, described below.  These written operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the operating and maintenance procedures, the facility has a comprehensive training program for all employees.  New employees are required to complete the facility-training program.  This program includes formal operations training, classroom training, on the job training, self-study training, and testing.

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction, and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Welland Chemical facility has practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include; conducting training, developing written procedures, performing inspections and tests, correcting identified deficiencies, and applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on safety and health hazards, applicable maintenance procedures, emergency response plans, and applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner.
