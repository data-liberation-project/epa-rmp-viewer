In the\nevent an accidental release should occur, we are prepared to work with our Local Fire\nCompany(s), Emergency Response Personnel, and other appropriate authorities deemed\napplicable depending on the specific incident, to best mitigate any release and to minimize the\nimpact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nFacility Information:\n\nThe primary activity of our company is NAICS code 422910, Farm Supply, however we are\nalso engaged in providing agricultural inputs that include the receiving, storage, and reloading\nof Anhydrous Ammonia for delivery to farmers in our area.  The NAICS code we feel most\napplicable for receiving, storing, and reloading Anhydrous Ammonia is # 493130 farm product\nwarehousing and storage.  Although Anhydrous Ammonia is the only product subject to the\nEPA Risk Management Plan at this time, it should be noted that we also handle Propane for both\nagricultural uses and home heating, which is under consideration as a listed substance.  We\ninclude Propane (as well as all crop protectents and petroleum products) in our planning,\ntraining, and maintenance  programs, however only the Anhydrous Ammonia facilities will be\nincluded in this report.    \n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application to farm fields\nduring the early and fall months.

      "SummaryText": "the location\ndescribed is 51,000 Lbs. The maximum on site vessel size is   12,000   Gallons, storing   \n51,000  Lbs.  The maximum quantity handled at a given time would be the off loading of a\nsemi-trailer vehicle tank holding 40,000 to 42,000 lbs.\n\n\n\nThe facility is operated on an as needed basis with staff present only during the receiving and\nreloading of product for delivery.  Total annual hours for these needs do not meet the 2,080 hour\nrequirement to qualify as a full time employee on site, therefore item number 1.11 is Zero.  \nOur facilities have adequate lighting, and are inspected  at various times of day and night\nthroughout the year.   Time expended for these inspections is not included in our staffing\ncalculation.\n\nWorst-case release scenario:\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is considered to be the release of the total contents of our\nlargest Anhydrous Ammonia tank.  The maximum quantity released would be  51,000  Lbs. \nbased on 85 % tank capacity as limited by design standards.   The distance to the endpoint (point\nof dispersion to 200 ppm) is 3.0 miles based on EPA's RMP -Comp Program (Version 1.06). \nPossible public and environmental receptors within the area has been provided to the County\nLEPC (Local Emergency Planning Committee) for their consideration.   \n\nAlternative release scenario:\n\nThere has not been an actual release of Anhydrous Ammonia during the last 5-years at the site. \nWe believe the most likely release would be caused by a break in a transfer hose.  Transfer hoses are protected by manual,  self closing excess flow , and pull away valves so our alternative release scenario is based on the loss of contents from the largest hose used (off loading transportation equipment).  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is (Urban) 0.06 miles (317 feet) rounded to 0.1 mile (528 feet) per instructions by EPA guidance.\n\nAccidental Release Program:\n\nOur Anhydrous Ammonia accidental release program is based on guideli"
