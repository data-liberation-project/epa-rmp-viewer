      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Anschutz Ranch East Gas Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.  \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Anschutz Ranch East Gas Plant, located near Evanston, Wyoming, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products, including natural gas, natural gas liquids, and condensate from the produced well stream.  In addition, the plant operates a variety of refrigeration and support processes which use ammonia, methane, and propane as the refrigerant.    The Anschutz Ranch East Gas Plant has several regulated flammables from methane through pentane.  These compounds may be present in both hydrocarbon mixtures and  as essentially pure compounds.   The only regulated toxic at the facility is anhydrous ammonia used as a refrigerant in a gas chilling system.  Hydrogen sulfide is not present in the facility in any concentrations or volumes subject to regulation or of concern.\n\nAll of the covered processes in the facility are designated as Program 3 under this Risk Management Plan and handled accordingly.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nToxic Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of toxic substances is a catastrophic failure of the largest vessel (ammonia receiver) in the ammonia based refrigeration system. This scenario assumes the release of the entire vessel contents (39,713 pounds) of anhydrous ammonia during a 10 minute period.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such r"

The dispersion of the released ammonia was modeled using HEGADAST 3+ incorporating the conservative assumptions of a liquid release which flashes to an aerosol vapor cloud and stable/low speed wind conditions (worst case meteorological conditions).  The maximum distance to the regulatory toxic endpoints of 200 ppm and 1000 ppm was predicted by the modeling to be 1.2 miles and 0.4 miles respectively. \n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for anhydrous ammonia was chosen as the complete severing of a 2 process pipe connected to the liquid phase of the same ammonia receiver vessel.  Again, the entire vessel contents of 39,713 pounds was  released through the broken pipe but over the time period necessary to empty the vessel through a 2 orifice (~126 minutes).  Both worst case meteorological conditions (F stability and 1.0 m/s wind speed) and typical calm daytime meteorological conditions (D stability and 3 m/s wind speed) were modeled.   No mitigation or control measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoints of 200 ppm and  1000 ppm for the worst case meteorological conditions was 1.7 miles and 0.3 miles respectively.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoints of 200 ppm and 1000 ppm for the typical calm daytime meteorological conditions was 0.4 miles and 0.2 miles respectively. \n\nFlammable Release Scenario\u0012s\n\nThe WCS associated with the release of flammable substances at the Anschutz Ranch East Gas Plant is the release of the full inventory of one of the NGL storage bullets followed by a vapor cloud explosion.  This is an instantaneous release of 282,487 pounds of a mixed NGL product.  The EPA\u0012s RMP-Comp model was used with the default worst case meteorological conditions of F stability and 1.5 meters/sec wind speed.  The maximum distance to"

Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences. no credit for control or mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS.  \n\nThe ARS for flammable substances was chosen to be the complete severing of a 2 process pipe on the bottom (liquid portion) of the storage bullet followed by a vapor cloud explosion.  A conservative assumption that the entire inventory was propane was made due to the model\u0012s inability to handle mixtures in the alternative scenario mode.  Propane was chosen as the substance which has the greatest overpressure zone associated with this type of release.  The EPA\u0012s RMP-Comp model was used to determine the release rate of 11,800 lbs/min and the maximum distance to the 1-psi overpressure endpoint.  Meteorological conditions used were those incorporated into the model as defaults for alternative scenario evaluation.  The release was assumed to persist for 24 minutes duration at the initial flow rate which is the time necessary to release the entire vessel contents through the 2 inch pipe.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi overpressure endpoint for this ARS is 0.3 miles.  No control or mitigation activities were considered in evaluating this scenario.\n \nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant.
