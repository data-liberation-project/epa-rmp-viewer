This section, commonly referred to as the \"Risk Management Plan\" or RMP, is designed to both prevent and prepare for releases of chemicals or flammable substances that would have an impact on the surrounding public.  The Bhopal, India release of methyl isocyanate  is an example of such a catastrophic event.  Under the regulation certain facilities would be required to submit a RMP that summarizes their Risk Management Program to the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  USAAVNC and Fort Rucker store/use toxic chemical and flammable substances in quantities meeting the rule's thresholds and are therefore required to develop a risk management program and submit a risk management plan to the EPA.  \n     Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies are available at the Installation.  Areas of concern are the Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) and the Fire Fighting Training Pit (FFTP).  Regulated substances at the WWTP are chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  Regulated substance at the FFTP is propane.\n    A worst-case release analysis for a toxic chemical has been performed using EPA-required parameters.  Results of this analysis indicate that the area of concern, or footprint, from a worst-case release of sulfur dioxide would be 6,039 people in a circle with a 3.3 mile radius.  This circle includes portions of Fort Rucker, Daleville, and portions of Dale and Coffee Counties.\n     A worst-case release analysis for a flammable chemical has been performed using EPA- required parameters.  Results of this analysis indicate that the area of concern, or footprint, from a worst-case release of propane would be several buildings on Fort Rucker in a circle with a 0.26 mile radius.\n     We are in compliance with OSHA PSM rules.  We have had one accidental release involving 1"

      "SummaryText": "50 pounds of chlorine in the last five years.  No offsite injuries were reported but several houses were evacuated as a precautionary measure during the 11/08/94 release.  Our Emergency response plan has been coordinated with the local community plan and joint training drills with the local fire department are conducted.\n     The Clean Air Act Risk Management Program at Fort Rucker is designed to help insure that catastrophic releases of chlorine, sulfur dioxide, and propane will not occur.  This is done via the development and implementation of a comprehensive program to manage chemical process risk.  Key participants in this program include the Fort Rucker Environmental Quality Control Committee; the Public Works Environmental Division; Aviation Branch Safety Office; Preventive Medicine (Industrial Hygiene); Directorate of Plans, Training, Mobilization, and Security; Staff Judge Advocate; Public Works Operation and Maintenance Division; Fire Protection Division; Public Affairs Office; and the Provost Marshal."
