              "Description": "The plan is to minimize those hazards to human health and to the environment that are associated with accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. Employees working at the bulk storage plant make routine\n\nobservations prior to and during transfer operations of the anhydrous ammonia from the storage vessel(s) to nurse tanks. In so doing, they are able to detect problems before they arise. This routine inspection identifies any portion of the system, which may be under stress or about to fail. Repairs can be made before they become problematic. Employees are annually trained to recognize the hazards associated with storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia. In addition to annual training for employees who have been on the job for a number of years, the company conducts training for new hires. This training includes classroom instruction, on-site training at the plant, and follow-up observation to determine their individual comprehension and understanding of the new hire. Finally, the company routinely invites local fire department personnel to visit the site. In the event that the local fire department requests assistance in training its employees on anhydrous ammonia, the company cooperates fully in their endeavors\n\n",

It also has training sessions for all employees engaged in the transfer of product and the repair of this facility.\n\n\n\n1. Facility Policy.  The owners, management and employees of Consumers Oil Company are committed to theprevention of any accodental releases of Anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, thefacility is prepared to work with the local fire department, the Nodaway County LEPC and /or other authorities to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the public and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information.  The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizer for sale to farmers.Anhydrous ammonia is the chemical covered by the risk management program.  It is received, stored anddistributed to the farmers, who are the end users. This RMP covers the storage of nurse tanks at our elevator location south of the office.  Nurse tanks are stored in the open field south of the grain bins during the fall and spring ammonia season. Off season, nurse tanks are stored at the ammonia bulk plant north of the office.\n\n\n\n3.  Accidental release prevention program.  The facility has implemented the provisions of \"SafetyRequirments for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and the standards of the U.S.Occupational Safety and Health Administration.\n\n4.  Five Year accident history.  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past fiveyears that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility, nor to ourknowledge, have resulted in any off site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage orenvironmental damage.\n\n5.
