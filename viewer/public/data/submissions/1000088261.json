These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.   Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.  Our safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities.  Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.  \n\n\n\n    Our safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.  The facility will not respond to a leak but will evacuate.  Emergency Response will be conducted by the local fire department.\n\n\n\nThe total anhydrous ammonia inventory in this single process is 21,715 lbs.\n\n\n\nTo prevent the accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the system and process York Cold Storage will utilize Mechanical integrity inspections, planned maintenance, training, Standard Operating Procedures (SOP's), and other steps of the PSM program.

      "SummaryText": " the event of an accidental release York Cold Storage will use training, installed valves and emergency shutdown switches, installed exhaust fans and NH3 alarms to reduce the elements of exposure and minimize the amount of anhydrous ammonia that might be released.  If exposure results in contact there are emergency eyewash stations and deluge showers to be used.\n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario involves the vessel with the most ammonia inventory, the low temperature accumulator. Under normal operating conditions the accumulator holds 4000 lbs. If the low temperature accumulator made it to its high level, it would be holding 6300 lbs of ammonia. The low temperature accumulator is located in the engine room, making it a mitigated release.  The worst case release is estimated to last ten minutes.   Under worst-case weather conditions, ammonia could travel 0.59 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public. \n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario is based upon the outdoor release of high pressure liquid through a 3/4\" opening in a transfer hose. The liquid is also estimated to be at 150 psig pressure. This scenario would release 5400 lbs of ammonia over a time period of ten minutes.  Under common weather conditions (3 m/s) ammonia could travel 0.4 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  Transfer hose failure was chosen as the alternative release scenario because it is a temporary connection and constructed of materials other than steel.  \n\n\n\nThe last accident was 08 December, 2016.  The Evaporator coil AU-F8-1 developed a small hole due to expansion rubbing and rust. This release resulted in <1 lb of Anhydrous Ammonia being released.  There were no injuries on or off site. \n\nOn 07/09 2016 there was a release of approximately 5 lbs of Anhydrous Ammonia.  The incident was caused when a fan blade broke in AU-F3-1 causing the motor mount to break and rubbing a hole in the evaporator coil.  There were no injuries on or off s"

The accident was caused when an employee was removing ice from above ammonia piping without his supervisors' knowledge.  A large piece broke off and struck an isolated liquid ammonia line in Freezer 5/6 causing the pipe to bend and break off. The accident resulted in injury to three employees with no consequences off site.\n\n\n\nYork Cold Storage will also follow the Process Management Program, and conduct its required inspections this will improve the safety of the plant and its systems.  Accident Investigations will be conducted immediately after an accident and the results will be transmitted to applicable employees and investigation recommendations will be implemented.\n\n\n\n    York Cold Storage is a facility in York, Nebraska which is a cold storage warehouse and food processing plant.  The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing capabilities.  The system is operated as a two-stage system.  On the low stage portion of the system, a low temperature accumulator operating at -28?F pumps liquid to the blast freezers, freezers, and the ice room.  The low temperature ammonia liquid flows through coils where it picks up heat, changing the ammonia from a liquid to a vapor.  The low-pressure ammonia vapor is sent from the plant to the accumulator via a suction header.  Vapor from the low temperature accumulator is fed to low stage compressors. The compressed vapor from the low stage compressors is sent to an inter-cooler operating at +10?F. \n\nThe high stage portion of the system consists of a cooler, process coolers, and tempering.  Liquid flows from the high-pressure receiver to the accumulators, then through the coils where it picks up heat, changing the ammonia from a liquid to a vapor.  The low-pressure ammonia vapor is sent from the plant to the inter-cooler via a common suction header.  Vapor from the inter-cooler is then fed to the high stage compressors"

During the compression phase in the high stage compressors, the temperature of the ammonia vapor will rise as the pressure of the ammonia vapor is increased to approximately 150-180 psig. The high-pressure ammonia vapor flows from the high stage compressors to evaporative condensers where heat is removed, turning the vapor into a high pressure liquid.  The high-pressure liquid is collected in a high-pressure receiver.
