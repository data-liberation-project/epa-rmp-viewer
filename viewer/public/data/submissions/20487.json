Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at LaRoche Industries Inc. - Seneca Works are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the production of Nitric Acid, Industrial Grade Ammonium Nitrate, Ammonium Nitrate Solution, and Nitric Acid Blending.  We have 3 regulated substances present at our facility. These substances include 98% Nitric Acid, Ammonia (anhydrous) and Nitric oxide  [Nitrogen oxide (NOX)].  The quantity of Nitric Oxide stored onsite is below the regulatory threshold, and therefore does not require risk management planning.   98% Nitric Acid is used in the acid blend operations to produce different grades of acid.  Ammonia is used to produce ammonium nitrate.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Ammonia is 1,142,756.76 lbs, and the maximum inventory of 98% Nitric Acid is 289,688.00 lbs NA.\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s) \nThese scenarios include administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.  To perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Ammonia Storage.  In this scenario 160,000 lb. of Ammonia (anhydrous)"

At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 14 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a release from Ammonia Storage.  The scenario involves the release of 4,750.00 lb. of anhydrous ammonia.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by excess flow valve(s).  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia (anhydrous) is 0.62 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for 98% Nitric acid involves a release from Nitric Acid Blend.  The scenario involves the release of 13,500 lb. of nitric acid over 90 minutes.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.026 mg/L of 98% Nitric acid is 0.87 miles.\n\n\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\nLaRoche Industries Inc. - Seneca Works maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts compre"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is Checklist, What If/Checklist (combined), HAZOP and Fault Tree.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 10/27/1998.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, LaRoche Industries Inc. - Seneca Works maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nLaRoche Industries Inc. - Seneca Works has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every year and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nLaRoche Industries Inc. - Seneca Works carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten proced"

Due to our stringent release prevention policies, no accidental RMP releases have occurred in the past five years.\n\nIt should be noted that LaRoche did have emissions of nitric oxide gases (NOx) in August 1997, which did not violate the plant air permit but created a large visible orange plume.  Unusual weather conditions were the primary contributing factors to the intensity of the plume.  Under the RMP guidelines, we do not exceed the threshold quantity for  NOx, although we are including the release as part of our RMPlan.\n\n6.    Emergency Response Plan\nLaRoche Industries Inc. - Seneca Works carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.
