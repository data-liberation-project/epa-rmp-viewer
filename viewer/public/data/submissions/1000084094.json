      "SummaryText": "This Risk Management Plan for EuropTec USA, Inc. applies to the storage of Hydrofluoric Acid 70% concentration (HF), which is the only 112r listed material that is stored at the facility in quantitites above the trigger level.  EuropTec, Inc. has a maximum of 63,000 lb of HF(70%) on site at any given time.  Approximately 60,000 pounds of HF are stored in a double-walled bulk plastic tank located in a 1,500 square foot room.  In addition to the bulk tank of acid, approximately 3,000 pounds of HF, consisting of five (5) 55-gallon drums, are stored in a diked area in the Etch Line room.  This room is vented continuously to an air scrubber system.  Any leaks from these drums would be captured and neutralized along with the fumes generated by the etch line, itself.\n\n\n\nNo flammable materials are stored at the facility at quantities above the trigger level.\n\n\n\nFor HF, the Worst Case Scenerio involves the rupture of the bulk HF tank.  In this event,  The predicted endpoint for this release would be 0.2 miles, affecting 240 people.\n\n\n\nThe Alternate Case Scenerio involves a leak from the bulk HF tank causing 1% of the tank volume to leak out in 10 minutes.  The predicted endpoint for this release would be 0.1 miles, affecting 45 people. \n\n\n\nThe facility has not experienced a major release of Hydrofluoric Acid.   An emergency response program has been prepared to provide deal with any major release.  These measures include:\n\n1.  Using  the plant intercom to notify plant personnel of a suspected release.\n\n2.  Limiting access to the release area only to properly trained and equipped maintenance and supervisory personnel.\n\n3.  Dialing 911 in the event of a major release.\n\n4.  Utilizing established safe operating procedures to contain the release.\n\n"
