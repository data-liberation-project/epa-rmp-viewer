Two entrepreneurs opened Albemarle, Tyrone Plant for business in 1976.  In 1986, Albemarle, Tyrone Plant was bought by First Chemical Company of Pascagoula, MS.  First Chemical Company is a subsidiary of First Mississippi Corporation, who was restructured under the name of ChemFirst Inc. in late 1996. Albemarle Corporation purchased the site in July of 2001. \r\n\r\nThe facility is designed for maximum flexibility and is continuously upgraded to ensure safe operation, minimal waste, and top efficiency.  We have more than 60,000 gallons of reactor capacity and a complete range of solids handling equipment.  The plant is especially well equipped for complex, multi-step synthesis.  Albemarle, Tyrone Plant's production operations consist of the batch production of specific and finite campaigns to produce chemicals for our customers.\r\n\r\nThe facility's Quality and Environmental management systems are ISO 9002 (Quality) and RC 14000 (Environmental and Safety) registered.\r\n\r\nFACILITY POLICIES FOR ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVETION AND EMERGENCY REPSONSE\r\n\r\nCompany environmental and safety/health policy statements stress the importance of protecting the safety and health of our employees as well as that of the community and the public.  The world's natural resources of air, water, and land are finite and must be conserved and protected.  Life and health are precious and must be safeguarded.  These beliefs compel us to conduct our business in a manner that protects the health and safety of our employees and the public....  The personal safety and health of each employee of this company and the general public of Tyrone is of primary importance.  The prevention of occupationally induced injuries"

These chemicals and their maximum intended inventory levels are: anhydrous ammonia, 77,000 pounds; 37% formaldehyde 60,000 pounds, 16,000 pounds of diethyl ether, 66,800 pounds hydrogen, 17860 lbs, 23% ammonia (ammoniate, and 8000 lbs of chlorine.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia and hydrogen are gases delivered by truck and maintained in pressurized tanks, while aqueous ammonia, and 37% formaldehyde are liquids that are stored in an atmospheric tanks, diethyl ether is stored in tanker trucks and chlorine is stored in one ton cylinders.    In addition to minimizing the inventory of these and other chemicals that are needed for our production operations, we also try to remove the chemicals from our site when they are no longer needed for a production campaign.\r\n\r\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\r\n\r\nWorst-case release scenarios have been modeled for formaldehyde, aqueous ammonia, ethyl ether, chlorine, and hydrogen.  An alternative release scenario has also been modeled for each substance as well. Some of the releases have off-site impact. \r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia for the worst-case scenario the pressurized tanks leaks and releases 77,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia  (the entire contents of the pressurized tank) in 10 minutes.  The toxic end point hypothetically could be up to 1.5 miles during the worse possible weather conditions.  This scenario DOES NOT take into account the plant's safety and prevention systems, and assumes nothing is done to minimize the release.\r\n\r\nFor ethyl ether the tanker fails and releases 16,000 pounds of ether (the entire contents of the tanker) in 10 minutes.

Employee input during all stages and phases is critical.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information:  MSDSs are furnished by our customers, and they usually contain toxicity, PEL, physical, reactivity, and corrosivity data.  The R&D Department reviews this and other (i.e., thermal and chemical stability) information obtained from customers, and if the information is inadequate, testing of the reaction mixtures or compounds is performed.  The Engineering Department generates a P&ID for each project so that the R&M Department can install the equipment as designed.  The Engineering Department has determined the electrical classification for the various buildings and purchases equipment, which meets these requirements.  The Engineering Department designs the general ventilation systems for the production buildings and designs the local ventilation systems throughout the plant.  Design Codes and standards that are used are a combination of Albemarle, Tyrone Plant requirements, ASME Boiler Codes, NFPA Codes, and other applicable codes and standards.  The Engineering Department reviews the process and generates a short process description and block flow diagram.  It also reviews proposed chemical usage and determines the maximum inventory levels.  The Engineering Department reviews process chemistry and determines the corrosivity of raw materials and reaction mixtures.  They then select the proper equipment, which will withstand the corrosive effect of the various chemicals or mixtures.

Administrative control of the projects is maintained by the use of a Production Batch Record for each batch that is produced, Production Shift Supervisor Checklists for each shift, and Production Coordinator weekly production reports.  Facility siting concerns are reviewed using a checklist developed by the Engineering Department.  Human factors are covered during the PHA.  The Production Department has established Standard Operating Procedures for corrective action systems for both ISO 9002 and 14001.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures:  Production Coordinators write Batch Records for each project.  The batch records are used as operating instructions for production operators.  The Production Department develops procedures for emergency shutdown, emergency operations, and startup after an emergency; these are included in the batch records.  The R&D Department also generates limits for temperature and pressure that are incorporated into the batch records.  The Safety Department reviews the MSDS for each raw material and product, and the information is put into a batch record safety sheet, which uses a standard format to make it easier for operators to locate needed information.
