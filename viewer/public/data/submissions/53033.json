      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nA Risk Management Plan has been implemented at Arkema Chemicals, Inc. Beaumont, Texas facility to reduce the risks associated with accidental releases of highly hazardous chemicals.  The purpose of this document is to provide an Enhanced Risk Management Plan that meets the TCEQ NSRPD Disaster Review requirements.  This document addresses the new chemicals proposed in this permit application that exceed the threshold quantities as defined in the NSRPD Draft Disaster Review Technical Guidance Document, January 2001.  This Risk Management Plan summarizes the managerial, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to the community of hazardous chemical releases.  The plan summary is organized to correspond with specific United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Plan definitions and requirements.\n\n*Introduction\n*Arkema Inc., Policies to Protect Health, Environmental, and Safety.\n*Facility Identification and Regulated Substances in Covered Processes.\n*Hazard Assessment.\n*Prevention Program\n*Five-Year Accident History\n*Emergency Response Plan\n\nARKEMA INC., POLICIES FOR HEALTH, ENVIRONMENT, AND SAFETY\n\nArkema Inc., is committed to employee, public, and environmental safety by conduction its options in a safe and responsible manner.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive risk management program that covers equipment design, installation, operating procedures, preventive maintenance, and employee training associated with processes at the Beaumont plant.  The Risk Management Plan formalizes the management system that documents these activities.\n\nThis commitment to health, environment, and safety (HES) starts with the Chief Executive Officer.  Senior Management routinely dedicates time to review HES matters.  This emphasis on safety is carried on at all levels of the plant.  The Beaumont plant has a safety committee that meets monthly to discuss HES topics.  Th"

      "SummaryText": "e success of the plant's HES program is also demonstrated by a strong commitment to safety by our employees and site contractors.\n\nArkema Inc., HES programs include policies, procedures, standards, and guidance materials to ensure our commitment to health, environment, and safety.  These materials include Risk Management Program guidance used by our facility in the development and implementation of risk prevention and reduction programs associated with potential accidental releases.\n\nFACILITY IDENIFICAION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES IN COVERED PROCESSES\n\nThe Arkema Inc., Beaumont facility is located at 2810 Gulf States Road in Beaumont, Texas.  This facility currently manufactures Methyl Mercaptan and Ethyl Mercaptan.  Methyl Mercaptan is used to produce photographic chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and Methionine, a synthetic amino acid used in animal feed supplement.  Ethyl Mercaptan is used to produce agrichemicals such as biodegradable herbicides and pesticides.  Certain substances used and produced within the facility are regulated substances under 40 CFR 68, the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule.  An RMP has been previously filed with the EPA and presented to the public.  Methyl Mercaptan, Hydrogen Sulfide, Carbon Disulfide and Ethyl Mercaptan are present at or above the minimum threshold for RMP applicability.\n\nArkema was issued authorization by the TCEQ and EPA to mfg. Acrolein, which is present in quantities that exceed the threshold quantity.  In addition, the chemical substance allyl alcohol is present in a quantity greater than 500 pounds but less than 1000 lbs.  This Plan addresses acrolein.  Acrolein is used as an intermediate product to manufacture Methylmercaptoproprialdehyde (MMP).  MMP is formed by reacting MeSH and Acrolein.   \n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\nTOXIC WORST CASE SCENARIO\n\nThe worst-case accidental release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substance involves a catastrophic failure of the Acrolein storage tank.  Acrolein is stored as a liquid a t"

Administrative controls limit the quantity of Acrolein stored to 80% of the tank liquid capacity and a second storage tank is available for emergency transfer if necessary.  This quantity (172,383 pounds) is assumed to be to be released over approximately a 26 minute time period and that the entire quantity is released into a diked area and vaporizes.\n\nHazard assessment data indicates that, under worst case conditions, the release could produce an Acrolein vapor plume that could travel up to 25 (EPA Look-up Table) miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public and the environment.  It should be noted that the regulatory agency and Arkema Inc. as an extremely unlikely event recognize the worst-case scenario.  Arkema Inc. has mitigation and prevention programs implemented to reduce the likelihood of a worst-case incident from occurring.\n\nFLAMMABLE WORST CASE SCENARIO\nThe worst-case accidental release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances involves catastrophic failure of an Ethyl Mercaptan storage tank.  It is stored as a liquid.  Administrative controls limit the quantity of Ethyl Mercaptan stored to 90% of the tank liquid capacity.  This quantity (2,000,000 pounds) is assumed to be released over a 10 minute time period as a vapor.\n\nHazard assessment data indicates that, under worst-case conditions, the potentially affected area is a maximum distance of 0.90 (EPA Look-up Table) miles which corresponds to end point distance of a 1 psi overpressure.  Again, it is noted that the worst case scenario is an extremely unlikely event and Arkema Inc. has implemented mitigation and prevention programs to reduce the likelihood of a worst case incident from occurring.\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE MITIGATION MEASURES\n\nThe multiple layers of preventive and mitigation measures are currently in use at the Beaumont plant makes it very unlikely that a significant release would occur.

      "SummaryText": "release occurs, Arkema Inc. has mitigation measures in place to reduce potential impacts to the community.\n\nIn accordance with the guidelines used to define worst case incidents, active mitigation measures were not considered in modeling the worst case scenarios.  However, the significant mitigation measures effectively reduce the risk and consequences associated with a RMP worst case incident.  Mitigation measures include:\n\n* Fixed water deluge systems on storage vessels and stationary fire monitors that can be used to suppress vapor.\n* Mechanical Integrity Program.\n* Trained Emergency Response Team on-site at all times.\n* Member of area Mutual-Aid organization\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\nTOXIC ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO - ACROLEIN\n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substance involves a 1 inch leak in the piping between the Acrolein reactor and the storage tank.  This scenario involves the release of 4084 pounds of Acrolein.  Under atmospheric stability class F, conditions the vapor plume was estimated to travel 3.0 miles based on 23 minute release.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS MITIGATION MEASURES\n\nWhile the Alternative Release Scenarios are, by definition, more likely to occur than the worst case scenario, they are still very unlikely to occur due to the facility's existing release and accident prevention program.  If a release should occur, Arkema Inc. has mitigation measures in place to reduce potential human health and environmental receptor impact.  The prevention program elements in place at Beaumont are:\n\n* Fixed water deluge systems on storage vessels and stationary fire monitors that can be used to suppress vapor.\n* Mechanical Integrity Program\n* Trained Emergency Response Team on-site at all times.\n* Member of area Mutual - Aid organization\n* Vapor Scrubbing System\n* Flare System\n* Excess Flow Valves on Storage Tanks\n* Dikes\n* Emergency Shutdown Systems\n* Area Gas Detectors\n* Planned Inspection Programs\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL REL"
