Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide are \nused to chlorinate and dechlorinate the plant's effluent prior to discharge to the Red River.  A maximum of 8000 pounds of chlorine and sulfur dioxide can be stored on site. In case of a chlorine or sulfur dioxide leak, the City of Pineville has an emergency policy which requires City personnel to notify LA State Police Hazmat by calling the 911 Response Center.  Local fire and police departments are notified.  These emergency personnel are used to assist in the evacuation of citizens in the affected area.\n\nPlant personnel have been properly trained to handle chlorine and sulfur dioxide stored in one ton cylinders.  Formal and on-the-job training ensures plant personnel have the necessary knowledge and skill to properly maintain the chlorination and dechlorination system.\n\nThe City of Pineville has no history of reportable releases for chlorine or sulfur dioxide at this site.  \n\nThe City of Pineville Wastewater Treatment Plant is included in the written community emergency response plan.  The facility does not have its own written emergency response plan.  The facility notifies the 911 Center which contacts the State Police Hasmat Unit, local fire and police departments for assistance.\n\nThe City of Pineville is reviewing possible active and passive mitigation in order to improve safety at the facility.  Ongoing operator\ntraining and preventive maintenance continue to be key tools to ensure the safety of the public."
