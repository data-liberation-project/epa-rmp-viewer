The company stores\n\nand distributes anhydrous ammonia in pressure vessels.\n\n\n\nCHS believes that the health, safety, and preservation of our environment are critical components of\n\neffective management and business success. As a company, we are committed to:\n\nProviding a secure and health conscious work environment for employees and visitors\n\nConducting our business with always having value for the communities in which we operate and in\n\nthe spirit of a good neighbor\n\nMeeting or exceeding the requirements of the environmental, health, & safety laws and regulations\n\nTraining employees on the environmental, health & safety requirements of their jobs\n\nWorking with government and other stakeholders to identify and solve problems\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in pressure vessels on properties. It is transferred into the vessel\n\nfrom either semi-transports or rail cars and then placed into application equipment or nurse tanks.\n\nThe application equipment and/or nurse tanks are then transported to the farmer's field where the\n\nanhydrous ammonia is injected into the soil.\n\n\n\nAn anhydrous ammonia storage tank is equipped with safety relief valves that are designed to\n\nrelease pressure in the event the tank becomes over pressurized. The tanks are also equipped with\n\nexcessive flow valves that are designed to shut down the flow of ammonia if a sudden release\n\nshould happen.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is created to show how far a plume of ammonia with a\n\nconcentration greater than 200 parts per million (PPM) would travel before being dispersed to a safe\n\nexposure level.\n\n\n\nA complete discharge of the storage vessel would be a very unusual event. We are also required to\n\ncreate an alternative or more likely release event. Although we will continue to do what we can to\n\nensure no accidental release occurs, we have chosen a 2-inch pipe or hose rupture to mee"

Again, calculations show the extent of the plume with an ammonia concentration\n\ngreater than 200 PPM.\n\n\n\nWe have used RMP Comp to calculate the area these types of releases would impact. RMP Comp\n\nis supplied to us by the EPA. It tends to over exaggerate the plume, which in turn adds a good\n\nsafety factor into the planning process. Our written programs are continually updated and are\n\navailable for review at the ammonia storage locations.\n\n\n\nIn the event of a release from a storage facility that could impact the community, we advise those in\n\nthe affected area to shelter in place until the plume dissipates. Shelter in place involves everyone in\n\nthe affected area seeking shelter indoors, shutting the windows and turning off the air conditioning\n\nand other ventilation systems.\n\n\n\nCHS operates over 100 storage sites across the country. In the past five years we have had very\n\nfew releases from fixed storage facilities. Vandalism and theft from nurse tanks has accounted for\n\nthe some of our releases.\n\n\n\nOur employees are trained in the characteristics and proper handling procedures for anhydrous\n\nammonia. They are equipped with the proper personal protective equipment for routine handling of\n\nthe product. The training also covers the basics in responding to emergencies involving ammonia\n\nreleases and is available to assist the community first responders with technical information and\n\nadvice.\n\n\n\nCHS provide training, training material and emergency response information to each fire department\n\nwith jurisdiction over our locations. We also meet with concerned citizens and other interested\n\nparties about our risk management program and anhydrous ammonia safety in general.\n\n\n\nCHS continually updates the training provided to its employees. Employees are trained in proper\n\nhandling, facility inspections, ammonia characteristics; emergency procedures and must review the\n\nemergency response plan, emergency action plan, and site security plan annually.\n\n\n\n"
