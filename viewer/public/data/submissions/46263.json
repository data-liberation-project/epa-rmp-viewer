The emergency response policy is to immediately notify the St. Martin Parish Office of Emergency Preparedness through 911.\n\nThe stationary source consists of two (1) ton cylinder of chlorine.\n\nThe worst case release scenario would consist of a rupture of the one ton chlorine cylinder allowing all of the chlorine inside to be released in ten minutes, which would create a cloud of chlorine with a radius of 1.3 miles and an affected population of 3,500 people. There are no passive mitigation measures in place to affect the severity or range of the release.\n\nThe alternative release scenario consists of a fusible plug blowing out of the chlorine cylinder. It will take approximately 5 minutes for emergency response personnel to respond to the release. It will have a release rate of 2 lbs/min and will have a radius of effect of 0.1 miles and effect 100 people. There are no active or passive mitigation measures in place at the facility.\n\nProper training and certification of operators helps to prevent accidental release and chemical specific hazards.\n\nThere have been no reportable accidents at this facility in the past five years.\n\nThe emergency response at this facility will be handled by non facility personnel ( fire department, sheriff's department, AMPOL, etc..)\n"
