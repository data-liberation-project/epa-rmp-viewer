The Dynegy Kendall Energy, LLC (Facility) is taking a proactive, managed approach to risk. The Facility is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for site personnel, the community, contractors, and the environment. To meet this commitment, Dynegy Kendall Energy, LLC has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the process. One component of these systems is the Risk Management Program that has been established and implemented to assist in managing the risks involved with the storage and use of aqueous ammonia (>20 weight percent), the only hazardous substance stored and used at the Facility that is regulated pursuant to Program 2 of 40 CFR 68. \n\nTo protect the environment, aqueous ammonia is used at the Facility to reduce oxides of nitrogen (Nox) pollutants, which are generated from the combustion of natural gas.  Specifically, ammonia is the reducing agent used in the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) pollution control systems. The SCR is a post-combustion gas treatment technique that reduces nitrous oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in the turbine exhaust stream to molecular nitrogen and water. The SCR systems are comprised of a number of subsystems. These subsystems include the SCR reactor with associated fluework, the ammonia vaporization and injection system, and the ammonia storage and delivery system. All subsystems are equipped with the required controls and interlocks. \n\nThe Facility is located in a sparsely populated rural area and has never had a reportable accident. Ammonia is a ubiquitous material, which is used by the surrounding farmers for fertilizer.  Pursuant to 40 CFR 68.125  Exemptions - Ammonia used as an agricultural nutrient, when held by farmers, is exempt from all provisions of this part (40 CFR 68). \n\nThe Risk Management Plan (RMP) addresses potentially catastrophic chemical releases that could res"

The RMP includes the Facility's Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that contains procedures, which are designed to maximize the safety of all employees, contractors, and visitors in the event of an emergency and also guard against environmental consequences. \n\nTo foster communication with the community, the RMP and ERP have been submitted to the local fire department and the Local Emergency Response Committee (LEPC). The Facility has chosen to use a dilute solution of ammonia rather than the inherently more dangerous anhydrous form. The storage quantity of ammonia was reduced as much as possible. The storage tank area is diked and partially enclosed. The facility property is partially encompassed by a series of landscape berms, which would have a mitigating effect on an ammonia vapor plume.\n\nAt this Facility, comprehensive accidental release prevention and emergency response programs have been established. It is Dynegy Kendall Energy, LLC's policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations. Dynegy Kendall Energy, LLC is committed to the safety of workers, contractors, and the public, as well as to the preservation of the environment. Dynegy Kendall Energy, LLC will implement the measures necessary to prevent foreseeable releases of the substances regulated by 40 CFR 68. The measures include:\n\n* Employee training in accidental release prevention and emergency response programs/measures;\n* Establishment of safety programs for Facility operations, design, and maintenance of the regulated process; and\n* Establishment of a hazard assessment process.\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe Facility has never had a reportable accident.\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nThe Dynegy Kendall Energy Facility, located at 1401 County Line Road in Minooka, Illinois, is a 1,100-megawatt natural gas-fired combined-cycle power generating plant"

This stationary source stores and uses a regulated substance, (>20 weight percent) aqueous ammonia (CAS No. 7664-41-7), that is used in the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) pollution control systems. The RMP aqueous ammonia threshold quantity (TQ) limit is 20,000 pounds.  The maximum quantity of ammonia stored on site will not exceed 40,000 pounds (including all piping). The AST is centrally located within the Facility,  has a four (4)-foot high secondary containment dike, is protected by a roof and is enclosed on three sides, which would mitigate a potential ammonia release.\n\nNominal 30-weight percent aqueous ammonia is periodically delivered by tank truck (5000-6000 gallons) by trained qualified personnel using established standard operating and DOT procedures to an unloading station equipped with interconnecting piping connected to a single horizontally-orientated cylindrical 15,000-gallon above ground storage tank (AST). The 15,000-gallon AST volume is administratively controlled to 85-percent by volume (12,750-gallons) with an equivalent weight of 28,471 pounds reported as 28,000 pounds. The aqueous ammonia is stored at ambient temperature and will have a maximum pressure of 50 pounds per square inch-gauge (psig). \n\nAqueous ammonia \"storage\" and the \"vaporization / injection system\" is the process considered for the RMP at this Facility.
