Contractors entering our property will follow applicable requirements of the City's hazard communication program.\n\n    Your personal commitment to this policy will provide a double check on its success.  In case of any conflict in interpretation of the policy, contact your supervisor.\n\n    The City of Union's Water Treatment Plant is located at the corner of Calhoun Street and Arthur Boulevard within the city limits of Union.  This facility treats raw water from the Broad River to supply potable water for the City of Union and a large surrounding area.  The plant operates under  SCDHEC System ID #4410001.  Treatment processes include physical/chemical steps for solids settling and filtration, and chlorination for disinfection.\n\n    Facilities in place to accomplish chlorination include pumping and chlorinator equipment to introduce a chlorine solution into the water stream.  Chlorine for this process is stored and handled on-site in ton cylinders.  Normal operations include two cylinders on-line, with two spare in reserve.  The on-line cylinders have individual vacuum regulators, and are manifolded on the vacuum side with automatic switchover to the chlorination equipment.\n\n    Chlorine is the only regulated substance maintained on-site in quantities above the regulated threshold limit.\n\n    The general accidental release prevention program is a multi-faceted effort configured to comply with both EPA's RMP and OSHA's PSM rules.  Key elements include a high level of employee training, an aggressive equipment maintenance routine, detailed operation procedures, hazard reviews and management controls.\n\n    Chemical-specific prevention steps include availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine, and the presence of chlorine detection equipment.\n\n    No accidental releases of chlorine have occurred at this facility in the past five years.\n\n    The facility has an emergency response program, which has been coordina"
