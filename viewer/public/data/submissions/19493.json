      "SummaryText": "ALTIVIA's Emergency Response Plan (ERP) was updated in 1999.  The ERP is divided into fourteen sections ranging from administration, policies, duties, chemical information, notifications, evacuations, drills and communications.  Drills are an important learning tool for ALTIVIA employees.\n\nAs part of any good analysis, ALTIVIA also wanted to review the worst possible scenario, which might occur, and the impacts it would cause.  With guidance and models from the EPA, ALTIVIA detemined the worst possible scenario would be a total release of a 2000 lb. container of chlorine in a 10-minute period. The effected residential population would be 2,854.  ALTIVIA believes with its safety procedures in place the likely occurrence of this happening is small.  In addition, with EPA guidance, the alternate case scenario would be the release of 100 pounds of chlorine in twenty minutes.  The effected residential population would be 204.   \n\nAs ALTIVIA grows, we are continually looking for new and improved methods to ensure safety of our personnel and our community.  These changes can only occur with continued input and support of our personnel, regulatory agencies, and our community."
