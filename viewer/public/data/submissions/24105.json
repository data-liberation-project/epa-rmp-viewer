Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Ineos L.L.C. -Plaquemine, Louisiana Operations (Ineos) is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  As an integral part of this commitment, Ineos has developed and implemented a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers such areas as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, emergency response and employee training associated with the processes at its Plaquemine, Louisiana facility.  This program complies with all of the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68, \"Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions\" and with Chapter 59 of LAC 33:III, \"Chemical Accident Prevention and Minimization of  Consequences\".\n\n\n\nIt is Ineos' policy to always operate the manufacturing processes in a safe manner and according to the established procedures and good engineering and management practices.  As part of this policy, Ineos has established the appropriate management and administrative controls for the prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances.  In the unlikely event that such a release may occur, trained emergency response personnel are available on site to take the necessary and appropriate corrective action to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  \n\n\n\nIneos has also established lines of communication with the Iberville Parish Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), in the event that an accidental chemical release may have beyond-the-fenceline effects and that additional emergency response expertise may be deemed necessary.\n\n\n\nFigure 1 presents an organization chart that shows the Ineos staff and supervisory positions responsible for the implementation of the various parts of the RMP program, in compliance with 40 CFR 68.15\n\n\n\n2.

      "SummaryText": "neos and the Dow Chemical Company (Dow) finalized agreements whereby Ineos, as an independent business entity, operates the existing production units at the Dow Plaquemine facilities known as Block 55. Specifically, Ineos owns and operates the ethanolamines unit and operates the glycol ethers and polyethylene glycol units for Dow.    The 3 production units that now comprise the Ineos facility manufacture approximately 18 different ethylene oxide and propylene oxide derivatives used in a wide variety of consumer products such as antifreeze, shampoo ingredients, automotive fluids, cosmetics, and water purification chemicals.  \n\n\n\nIneos uses a few organic chemicals as raw materials, including ethylene and propylene oxides, methanol, n-Butanol and ethylene glycol.  Inorganic chemicals used in the process include phosphoric acid, potassium hydroxide and ammonia, among others. Although chlorine is not used in the manufacturing processes, it is used on site for cooling water treatment.  \n\n\n\nNone of the products and byproducts manufactured at the Ineos facility is regulated under the risk management program (RMP) established by Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA).  The only RMP-regulated substances present at Ineos above the RMP threshold quantities are Chlorine and Ammonia (anhydrous).  Ethylene oxide  [Oxirane] and Propylene oxide  [Oxirane, methyl-] are both used as raw materials in the Ineos processes, but they are received by pipeline from nearby Dow facilities on a continuous basis and as needed in the chemical manufacturing processes.  Consequently, there are no storage facilities for these two chemicals within the Ineos Block 55 perimeter.\n\n\n\nMaximum inventories and threshold quantities for the RMP-regulated substances at the Ineos facility in Plaquemine, Louisiana are shown on the table below.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1\n\n112(r) Regulated Chemicals Present at the Ineos-Plaquemine Facility\n\nand their Threshold Quantities\n\n\n\nRMP Regulated Substance\n\nInventory Quantity (lbs)\n\n"

The amounts shown are the volumes of the existing in-line surge drums.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia.  Ammonia is received on the Ineos plant site by railroad tank car and it is stored under pressure in a spherical tank, DS-205.  From this tank, it is pumped into the process.  DS-205 has a gross storage capacity of  approximately 750,000 lbs. of ammonia, but the necessary administrative controls (written operating procedures and level controls and alarms) are in place to limit the maximum amount of ammonia in the tank to 500,000 lbs.  DS-205 has no refrigeration, therefore the material is kept under pressure and, according to operating personnel,  the storage temperature is usually between 750 and 850 F. The vapor pressure of anhydrous ammonia in this temperature range is between 140 and 180 psia.\n\n\n\nChlorine. The Ineos manufacturing processes do not use chlorine either as a raw material or as a reagent.  This chemical is only used for cooling water treatment, and two (2) one-ton cylinders are kept on site next to the cooling tower, for a maximum total amount of 4,000 lbs. of chlorine kept on site.  One cylinder is connected to the cooling tower and the other one is kept on stand-by.  The chlorine feed line is connected to the vapor side of the one-ton cylinder.  When the first cylinder is empty, the second cylinder is connected and a full cylinder placed on order.\n\n\n\n3.0    Worst Case Release Scenario (WCS) and Alternative Release Scenarios (ARS's), Including Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures\n\n\n\nPart of the requirements of 40 CFR "

In Ineos' case, at least one ARS will be necessary each for ammonia and chlorine.\n\n\n\nThe WCS must assume that the entire maximum amount of the regulated substance being stored is released into the environment over a period of 10 minutes, no matter how unlikely such a massive release may be.  The WCS cannot take into account any available active mitigating conditions such as existing leak detection systems and alarms, deluge systems and other such measures.  Only passive mitigating measures, such as containment diking, can be taken into account for the WCS.\n\n\n\nBoth the WCS and the ARS's were evaluated using the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations, in combination with the USEPA-developed dispersion-modeling program, RMP*Comp.  Brief descriptions of the selected scenarios are presented below.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1 WORST CASE SCENARIO (WCS)\n\n\n\nThe WCS for the Ineos facility involves anhydrous ammonia and it was visualized as a catastrophic failure of the ammonia storage sphere, DS-205, with the subsequent release of the sphere's entire contents into the environment.  It was assumed that the sphere would contain its maximum operating capacity at the time of the hypothetical release, therefore under this scenario, 500,000 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia would be released over a period of 10 minutes.  \n\n\n\nThe area under the sphere has a concrete dike wall that provides a containment area measuring approximately 57.5 feet wide x 75.5 feet long x 30 inches deep, where some of the spilled ammonia would be collected while it evaporates into the surrounding air.

Figure 2 presents a map of the area and the extent of the ammonia WCS end-point circle.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2    ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS (ARS's)\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenarios are also quite unlikely to occur but they represent a somewhat more realistic view of a hypothetical release.  Unlike in the WCS, existing active mitigating conditions can be taken into account for the ARS, providing that they will be able to withstand the hypothetical release and still continue to function after it occurs.\n\n\n\n3.2.1    Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a release from a leaking 1-inch bleed valve on the ammonia feed pump, P-205.  Assuming that the valve somehow becomes wide open, the release rate was calculated at approximately 1,680 pounds per minute.  Pump P-205 is located next to the ammonia sphere (DS-205), where there are ammonia detectors that will alert the operator about the leak.  On this basis, the response time was estimated at approximately 15 minutes until the operator can get the valve closed.  Thus, the total amount of ammonia released to the atmosphere under this hypothetical ARS is approximately 25,000 lbs.\n\n\n\nUnder the above assumptions and with neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia was estimated at approximately 0.30 miles, using the USEPA's RMP*Comp dispersion modeling software.

Under this scenario, the open cylinder valve would then be releasing chlorine vapor directly to the atmosphere.  According to available literature  (Wallace & Tiernan Co. Pamphlet No. WAA 25.000, \"Chlorine Handling Manual\", Issue B, May 1991), the maximum possible vapor withdrawal rate from a one-ton chlorine cylinder is approximately 8.0 pounds per day per degree Fahrenheit (8.0 lb/24 hr/0 F).  \n\n\n\nAssuming that the chlorine cylinder is at a temperature of 85 0 F, the initial chlorine vapor release rate would be approximately 8 x 85, or 680 lbs/day, or almost 0.5 lb/min.  However, since the chlorine inside the container is liquefied under pressure, the vapor release rate would decrease rapidly because of the chilling effect of the evaporation process taking place inside the cylinder. \n\n\n\nFor purposes of the ARS, it was assumed that the vapor release rate would continue at 0.5 lb/min, until operating personnel detects the leak and shuts the cylinder valve off.  This was further assumed to take 1 hour (60 minutes).\n\n\n\nUnder the above assumptions and with neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L of chlorine was estimated at approximately 0.1 miles, using the USEPA's RMP*Comp dispersion modeling software.  This end-point radius barely extends past the Ineos facility fence line and it is well within the boundaries of the Dow facility.  The chlorine ARS end-point circle is also plotted on Figure 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.3    Ethylene and Propylene Oxides\n\n\n\nNo alternative release scenarios were developed either for Ethylene oxide [Oxirane] or for Propylene oxide [Oxirane, methyl-], because there are no storage facilities within Ineos with capacity in excess of the RMP thres"

General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nIneos has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out by the USEPA under 40 CFR Part 68.   Before Ineos was created, its installations were part of the Dow chemical complex and as such, they were designed and constructed in accordance with Dow Loss Prevention Principles and Dow Engineering Standards.  Similarly, they were operated according to established procedures and good engineering and management practices.  Ineos has adopted and continued such policies and the following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is now in place at the Ineos facility.\n\n\n\nIneos has continued to implement and follow the Dow health and safety procedures since February 2001.  These health and safety procedures are being reviewed and revised as needed by Ineos.  Ineos anticipates completing this review and revision effort by February of 2002.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Ineos facility maintains detailed records of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes, including those that involve the regulated chemicals, ammonia and chlorine.  Documentation kept on site provides information regarding the chemical properties and chemical hazards associated with the regulated chemicals. These documents include, but are not limited to:\n\n\n\n* Copies of current Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS's), \n\n* Equipment specifications and manufacturer's design data, \n\n* Complete sets of construction drawings and specifications\n\n* A copy of the plant's Emergency Response Plan\n\n* Copies of Shop Drawings and assembly and maintenance"

These studies included the process units that now comprise the Ineos facility. The methodologies used to carry out these analyses include What If/Checklist (combined), HAZOP, the Dow Fire and Explosion Index, the Dow Chemical Exposure Index, and Reactive Chemicals/Process Hazards Analysis (PHA).  It is Dow's practice that these studies be undertaken periodically by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and that any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  It is Dow's practice to revalidate these Process Hazard analysis at a regular interval of 3 years and Ineos management is committed to continue these practices.  The most recent PHA/update on the process systems that are now part of Ineos was performed by Dow's technical staff on 05/17/2000, therefore the next PHA is due approximately in the spring of 2,003.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within the manufacturing processes, Ineos maintains complete and up to date written standard operating procedures (SOP's) for each process.

This will continue the internal audit policy previously established by Dow, when the Ineos processes were still a part of the Dow chemical complex. The most recent RMP compliance audit was conducted by Dow on 05/25/1999.  Continuing Dow's practice, these audits will be carried out at least once every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits will be addressed in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nIneos incident investigation procedures also parallel those in effect at Dow, which were established in compliance with OSHA's PSM requirements.  Ineos has adopted these procedures and will promptly investigate any incident that results in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations will be undertaken to identify the situation, conditions and contributing factors leading to the incident as well as to identify any corrective actions to prevent the incident from reoccurring.  The objectives of such investigations are:\n\n\n\n* to establish the facts relating to the incident, \n\n* to determine the factors causing or contributing, directly or indirectly, to the incident and\n\n* to define what corrective actions, if any, are necessary to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future.\n\n\n\nThe incident investigation team will include members of the staff who are familiar with the process involved in the incident and shall also include personnel from the operations, maintenance and management departments.\n\n\n\nThe investigating team will submit its findings and recommendations to plant management for resolution.

Ineos' employee participation program is a continuation of the program developed and implemented by Dow in compliance with OSHA's PSM requirements, which by definition also complies with the requirements of the RMP program.  PHA procedures call for the active participation of Ineos employees; the findings and recommendations resulting from PHA reviews are made available to all employees and are discussed with all employees who work in the affected areas.  \n\n\n\nFurther, company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.

After such a contract has been awarded but before the actual work commences, all of the contractor's employees who will be performing work inside the plant must undergo, as a condition of the contract, a mandatory safety orientation.   As part of this orientation, Ineos will inform the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes involved.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response, should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.  Contractors are also required to inform Ineos of any hazards they may introduce at the site.\n\n\n\n5.    Five-year Accident History\n\nThe Ineos facility (formerly Dow's Block 55) has not had any accidental releases of regulated chemicals during its short life (February 2001 to the present). Prior to the creation of Ineos, the Block 55 operations did not experience, within the last 5 years, any accidental releases of regulated substances  that were reportable under 40 CFR 68.42(a) (i. e. that resulted in deaths, injuries or significant onsite property damage or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter in place, property damage or environmental damage).   However, there have been releases reportable under rules other than Part 68 and these have been subject to internal investigation and evaluation.\n\n\n\nThe Dow facility in general has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Thanks in part to its stringent release prevention policies, Dow has been able to reduce the number of accidental releases to a minimum.  Ineos has adopted and intends to continue Dow's strict accident prevention policies, therefore it is anticipated that Ineos will maintain an excellent accident record in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.    Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Ineos facility has developed and implemented an emergency response program that parallels Dow's program, including procedures to respond to emergencies involving toxic materials"

This Plan is currently being reviewed and updated by Ineos personnel.\n\n\n\nThe Plan addresses all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  Medical and emergency response support is coordinated with the Dow Plaquemine operations.\n\n\n\nSome of the major topics addressed in the Plan include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n* Description of the uses of chlorine and ammonia within the plant\n\n* Physical Properties of chlorine and ammonia\n\n* Safety measures that must be taken before working in the  ammonia storage area\n\n* Description of monitoring, warning and alarm systems in the ammonia storage area\n\n* Description of safety features provided at the ammonia storage sphere area.\n\n* Personnel responsibilities during a chlorine or ammonia emergency, including local and evacuation alarms.\n\n* List of emergency call numbers to be contacted (local agencies and public)\n\n* Procedures to inform the media and the public about accidental releases of regulated substances\n\n* Emergencies requiring public action\n\n* Proper first-aid and emergency medical treatments for accidental human exposures to ammonia or chlorine\n\n* Closure of emergency condition\n\n* Plant evacuation procedures and checklist\n\n\n\nPlant personnel received training on the Plan when it was originally issued by Dow.  Ineos intends to hold refresher training on the Plan in the near future. \n\n\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, Ineos emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.
