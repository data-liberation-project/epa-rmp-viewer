Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at the Salt Lake City Water Reclamation Plant are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\n2.      The Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass processing waste water and sewage.  We have one regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is chlorine, used for disinfection.  Our chlorine processs and storage facility is capable of a maximum inventory of 32,000.00 pounds; however, the actual quantity of chlorine on-site is generally limited to approximately 20,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n3.      The General Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with generally recognized wastewater treatment codes.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nSalt Lake City Water Reclamation Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If/Checklist (combined).  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineerin"
