The Plan includes an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release, a five-year accident history, and a release prevention and emergency response program.  \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nWilbur-Ellis has implemented release prevention and emergency response procedures to minimize the potential for accidental releases of hazardous materials.  Emergency response procedures including evacuation procedures and notification procedures have been implemented by Wilbur-Ellis.  In addition, Wilbur-Ellis has developed operating procedures and preventative maintenance activities to reduce the likelihood of accidental releases.\n\n\n\nThis Plan and the emergency response procedures document the accidental release prevention, safety, and emergency policies in place at Wilbur-Ellis.\n\n\n\nDescription of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nWilbur-Ellis is located at 38202 SR 27 in Oakesdale, Washington (the \"facility\").  Wilbur-Ellis is a retailer of fertilizer in the form of anhydrous ammonia stored under pressure.  Anhydrous ammonia is delivered to the site by means of rail cars.  There are eight rail cars at the facility each with a capacity of approximately 33,878 gallons and there is one anhydrous ammonia storage tank located at the facility with a capacity of approximately 30,000 gallons.  The anhydrous ammonia is transferred from the rail cars to the storage tank and then into tender trucks.  There are four tender trucks with two 1,000-gallon tanks and one tender truck with two 1,500-gallon tanks that can contain anhydrous ammonia at the facility.  The contents of tender trucks are sold and delivered to the local farming community for use as fertilizer.  \n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Rel"

The Plan's purpose is to enhance the facility's existing safety programs implemented at the site to reduce the possibility of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia that could cause harm to employees, the public and the environment.  The emergency response program, documented in the emergency response procedures, includes accidental release prevention and chemical specific prevention steps.\n\n\n\nWilbur-Ellis ensures that equipment meets the appropriate industry standards prior to use.  Wilbur-Ellis implements operating procedures and maintenance procedures in accordance with manufacturer and industry specifications to prevent accidental releases at the facility.  Chemical specific prevention steps implemented at the site include excess flow valves, pressure relief valves, emergency shut off valves with cables that run along the length of the horizontal storage tanks for quick access, and ammonia training for personnel.\n\n \n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere has been one accidental anhydrous ammonia release at the facility within the five-year period prior to this plan.  On 8 September 2013, approximately one quart of anhydrous ammonia (approximately 1.2 pounds) was released and a Wilbur-Ellis employee was injured while off loading anhydrous ammonia from a rail car.   An incident investigation was conducted following the accident and changes at the facility were implemented based on the findings of the investigation. \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe facility coordinates with the Oakesdale Fire Department (\"fire department\") regarding specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.

Information on emergency health care.\n\n3.    Emergency response training for employees.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nPlans to improve safety at the facility were developed based on the results of compliance audits, hazard reviews, and a Risk Management Plan (RMP) site inspection conducted by an outside contractor.  The Branch Manger is currently working on an implementation schedule for the recommended actions.  Recommended actions include the following:\n\n\n\n1. Update emergency shutdown section of operating procedures to include specific references to valves and couplings\n\n2. Evaluate potential installation of an additional remote stop button for the pump\n\n3. Modify the daily in season inspection form to include end of day check to ensure valves are locked before site personnel leave for the day\n\n4. Update written operating procedures or RMP data to reflect site specific information regarding colors\n\n5. Relocate trucks and establish parking area that is away from the roadway. Post sign to prohibit parking mobile equipment associated with anhydrous ammonia system near roadway. \n\n\n\nTo improve the safety of ammonia and all other aspects of operations, Wilbur-Ellis has implemented a comprehensive, risk-based safety management process to help guide employees to improved safety performance. The safety management process, branded Guiding People to Safety (GPS), is designed to be implemented in four steps, step one comprising of the foundation and fundamental elements of a strong safety program and positive safety culture.
