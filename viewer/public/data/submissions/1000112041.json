Should an accidental release occur, this facility is prepared to respond with an internal emergency response team, in coordination with the local fire department and emergency planning committee to minimize the impact of the release of the regulated substances to people and the environment.\n\nFacility Information and the Regulated Substances\nThe primary activity at this facility is the production of a silicon-carbon anode, supplied to lithium battery manufacturers.  Group14\u0092s regulated substances are silane and acetylene.  Both substances are received, stored, and distributed via cylinders and piping to specific locations in the facility to be used in the production of the silicon\u0097carbon anode material as a final product.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThis facility has developed worst-case and alternative-case scenarios for both listed chemicals; however, it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as security-sensitive information as requested by EPA.\n\nThis facility complies with the various rules and regulations governing the storage and handling of silane and acetylene including CGA G-1 and G-13, OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111, 40 CFR 68, and regulations administered by our state and local jurisdictions.  Training is provided on safe silane and acetylene operations for employees.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nThere have been no accidental releases of silane or acetylene for the covered process at this facility in the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThis facility has a written emergency plan in accordance with OSHA Standards 29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.120.

Periodic inspections and evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations.  There are no additional specific silane or acetylene safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\nGroup14\u0092s facility is currently in the commissioning phase.  Accordingly, new safety systems, control equipment, alarms, cameras, and other technology such as Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS) for independent monitoring and safety actions are being installed."
