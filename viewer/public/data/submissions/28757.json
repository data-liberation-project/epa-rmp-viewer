Box 69, Armstrong, Mo.\nContact:     Joe Nanneman\nPhone:     660-273-2415\n\n\n1. The Facility Policy\n\n    MFA Incorporated, and the employees of the MFA Agri Service in Armstrong are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Armstrong Fire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n    The primary activity at the facility is the receiving, storage and distribution of dry fertilizer and anhydrous ammonia for direct application as a crop nutrient. The facility also handles and stores grain.\n\n    The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored at any one time would be 157,960 pounds. The facility has (2) 12,000-gallon storage tanks, and the largest tank onsite would be the 12,000- gallon storage tank containing approximately 56,078 pounds. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a transport delivery truck holding approximately 50,000 pounds. The facility also has (9) 1,000-gallon nurse tanks, (1) 560-gallon applicator tank, (1) 400-gallon applicator tank, (1) 375-gallon applicator tanks for product distribution. \n\n3. The worst-case and alternative release scenario.\n\n    a. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the largest storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 56,078 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.6 miles.\n\n\n\n    b. The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a 3\" transfer hose during receiving operations. This release is assumed to last approximat"

The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.2 miles.\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n    The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, 1981\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., the Missouri Anhydrous Ammonia Law and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n5. The Five-year Accident History\n\n    There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program.\n\n    The facility has;\n    a. a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA\n       Standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n    b. provided State and Local authorities with the emergency\n       planning and community right-to-know information as\n       required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\n    c. a written emergency response program, in accordance with\n       OSHA Standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency\n       planning and employee training.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n    Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\n\n    8/6/03"
