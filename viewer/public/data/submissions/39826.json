      "SummaryText": "Met-Al, Inc. manufactures specification aluminum alloys using scrap aluminum, metallic silicon, copper scrap, zinc scrap and magnesium scrap.  The metal is purchased from manufacturing operations (new scrap) and from scrap dealers who collect and sort obsolete scrap such as pots, pans, radiators, siding, roofing, automotive engine blocks (after removing internal parts), automotive transmissions (after removing internal components), lawn mower parts (after removal of non-alumium components, aluminum furniture, etc.  They also use RSI, (Remelt Smelters Ingot), which are large blocks of aluminum usually generated at facilities that operate sweating furnaces (scrap yards, etc.).  The RSI is usually used as \"heel\" metal to start a new batch.  It is charged into the combustion zone since it is less likely to become oxidized than lighter section aluminum scrap.  After the heel is melted aluminum scrap is charged into the outer charging hearth.  This hearth is connected to the combustion chamber by openings in the separating wall.  These openings are below the normal molten metal bath to minimize the movement of unmelted material into the combustion zone.  When the level is high enough and the temperature has reached 1375 degrees F the molten metal circulation pump is turned on to circulate the metal in the furnace.  Chlorine is introduced through carbon tubes deep into the bath into the discharge of the pump.  This allows the magnesium refining reaction to occur.  This reaction lowers the magnesium content of the bath and causes the magnesium chloride (formed by the reaction) to rise to the surface of the molten bath in the charge hearth to be skimmed."
