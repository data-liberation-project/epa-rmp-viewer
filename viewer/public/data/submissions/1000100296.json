Operators will receive ongoing training in accident prevention and chemical safety, will conduct visual inspections of the ammonia system routinely, as well as perform maintenance recommended by the equipment manufacturers to reduce the risk of accidents.\r\n\r\n5. Five-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere have been no accidental releases of a regulated substance at the West Phoenix Power Plant in the past five years.\r\n\r\n6. Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nAPS is required to meet the requirements for Program 1, which includes coordination with the local emergency responders.  APS has coordinated emergency response with the Maricopa County Emergency Planning Commission.\r\n\r\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nAPS has an ongoing program of training, maintenance, and inspections in order to minimize the possibility of accidents.  Following start-up of the new ammonia system storage tank for CC1/2, the facility will evaluate procedures and implement recommendations as appropriate from ongoing review of operator training and inspection programs."

The storage tank also has a maximum design pressure of 25 psia and is completely within a walled containment basin designed to hold all of the tank contents.  The tank also has an administrative fill limit of 28,500 gallons.  An additional 42,000-gallon tank will be installed and utilized by the facility to further provide support to plant operations.  This tank (CC1/2) shall be directly adjacent to CC3, and release scenarios reflect the update to this configuration. The storage tank has a maximum design pressure of 25 psia and is completely within a walled containment basin designed to hold all of the tank contents.  The tank also has an administrative fill limit of 39,900 gallons.  \r\n\r\n3. Worst-case Release Scenario\r\n\r\nThe primary worst-case scenario is a release of the entire contents of the adjacent storage tanks for CC3 and CC1/2.  In addition, APS has also provided additional worst-case scenarios in the event only CC1/2 or if CC5 were to fail.  The worst-case analysis was conducted separately for the 42,000 gallon tank at CC1/2 & the 30,000 gallon tank at CC3, the 42,000 gallon tank at CC1/2 only, and the 30,000 gallon tank at CC5 in order to determine risk from catastrophic failures of ammonia storage at both locations.  As stated, all tanks are surrounded by walled containment basins that limit the exposed surface area and reduce the release rate for the 29.4 wt.% aqueous ammonia.  Using EPA's RMP*comp and based on the assumption that the tank liquid will be equal to air temperature at 77\u00baF, the distance to toxic endpoint on all scenarios is 0.10 miles.  This distance is contained within the property boundary based on both locations.  As such, no public receptors are affected within the distance to the toxic endpoint, as a worst-case release from both locations are predicted to remain on-site and/or not reach a public receptor.\r\n\r\nThe facility has not had a release of a regulated substance"

APS has adopted and implemented policies and procedure that ensure our operations adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.

Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies are supported at the highest level within the Company.  The facility is operated to protect the health and safety of our employees and neighbors, as well as to protect the environment.  To communicate this philosophy, APS has an ongoing environmental, health, and safety training program for employees.

Description of Facility and Regulated Substance Handled\r\n\r\nThe West Phoenix Power Plant is located in the western portion of the greater Phoenix metropolitan area.  As mentioned, an SCR system has been installed to control NOx from the existing combined-cycle CC1/2, CC3, and CC5.  The SCR system for CC5 uses a 29.4% solution of ammonia in water, ammonium hydroxide.  The ammonia storage and handling system for CC5 consists of a single 30,000-gallon storage tank, pumps, and piping to the vaporizer, which produces a uniform distribution of aqueous ammonia injected into the flue gas upstream of the SCR catalyst.  The storage tank has a maximum design pressure of 25 psia and is completely within a walled containment basin designed to hold all of the tank contents.  The tank has an administrative fill limit of 28,500 gallons.\r\n\r\nCombined cycle (CC3) has been retrofitted with a system using the same 29.4% solution of ammonia in water, ammonium hydroxide.

      "SummaryText": "The following outlines the key components of the Risk Management Plan for the aqueous ammonia storage and handling system at Arizona Public Service Company's West Phoenix Power Plant.  The organization of this executive summary follows the elements listed in the U.S. EPA's RMP*Submit User's Manual, with a brief introduction.\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\nArizona Public Services (APS) owns and operates the West Phoenix Power Plant, an electric power generation facility located in Maricopa County, Arizona.  The units at the West Phoenix Power Plant include two simple-cycle turbines, three 85 MW combined-cycle units (CC1-3), a 120 MW natural gas-fired combined cycle unit (CC4), a 530 MW natural gas-fired combined cycle unit (CC5), a natural gas-fired auxiliary boiler, and three steam generating units.  As part of the construction of CC5, and the retrofitting of one existing combined cycle unit (CC3), selective catalytic reduction (SCR) control systems were installed to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx).  The SCR system utilizes aqueous ammonia to reduce NOx emissions.  Ammonia with concentrations of 20% or higher is listed as a regulated substance under Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the SCR NOx control systems, the quantity of aqueous ammonia stored and used at the facility is greater than the Threshold Quantity, thus a Risk Management Plan (RMP) is required.  The aqueous ammonia system was identified as the only process at the facility that triggers RMP requirements.  This document is an update to a previous submittal due to the addition of an ammonia tank adjacent to the existing CC3 ammonia tank to support the combined-cycle units CC1 and CC2 (CC1/2).  The following information includes updates to mitigate any adverse consequences of a release to public receptors within the distance to toxic endpoint.\r\n\r\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nAPS is committed to operating the facility in a manner"
