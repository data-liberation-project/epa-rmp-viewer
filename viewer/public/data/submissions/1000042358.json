Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at WesPak, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public \n\nand environmental safety.  This commitment to safety is demonstrated by \n\nour comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas \n\nsuch as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and \n\nemployee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. \n\n\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass packing and storage of grapes \n\nand tree fruit (SIC 0723).  We have 3 Federal and State regulated \n\nsubstances and one State only regulated substance at our facility.  Ammonia(anhydrous) is the only substance above Federal and/or State minimum thresholds.  Propane, Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) and Methyl Bromide are below State and Federal thresholds.  Ammonia (anhydrous) is used for Refrigeration.  Propane is used for forklift fuel.  Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) and Methyl Bromide are used for fumigation.\n\n\n\nThe maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) at our facility is 39,711lb. distributed in various vessels, pipes and coils.  Regulated substances \n\nfalling below minimum threshold criteria are 4848 lb. of Propane in a single vessel, Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous) in 70 lb. cylinders at 3 locations totaling 560 lb. and Methyl Bromide in 5 - 175 lb. cylinders or 875 lbs.\n\n\n\n3.  Worst Case and Alternative Scenario Description\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we \n\nhave used the EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Reference \n\nTable or Equations. The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic \n\nsubstances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Ammonia \n\nRefrigeration equipmen"

      "SummaryText": "t.  In this scenario, 13461 lb. of Ammonia \n\n(anhydrous) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1-cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is \n\nestimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  The released quantity has been \n\nlimited to 38% of the maximum capacity of the source by a flooded \n\nAmmonia System design and limited High Pressure Receiver capacity.  At \n\nClass F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the maximum \n\ndistance of 1.42 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/l.  Because of the rural location and prevailing wind, potential for off-site exposure would be minimal.  Several employees live onsite and are closer than public receptors.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a release from Ammonia Refrigeration equipment.  The scenario involves releasing 1500 lb. from a typical sight glass, seal, valve or gasket failure on liquid vessels or piping.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 15.00 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/l of Ammonia anhydrous) is 0.085 miles.  There are no public receptors within this distance. \n\n\n\n4.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the \n\nChemical-Specific Preventions Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirement set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.  \n\n\n\n5.  Five-year Accident History    \n\nWesPak, Inc. has had an excellent record of preventing accidental \n\nreleases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention \n\npolicies, there has been no reportable accidental release during this period.\n\n\n\n6.  Emergency Response Plan\n\nWesPak, Inc. carries a written emer"
