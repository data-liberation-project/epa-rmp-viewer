In September of\n\n2008 Bozzuto's moved into an existing refrigerated warehouse distribution center. Among its advantages, this\n\ndistribution center utilizes the benefits of ammonia as a refrigerant. Bozzuto's does recognize ammonia as a\n\nhazardous chemical, and this was a consideration when selecting the facility. In consideration of the risks\n\nassociated with the use of ammonia, Bozzuto's commits its efforts to ensuring the employees and\n\nsurrounding community continue to enjoy a healthy and safe environment.\n\nPart of this commitment includes:\n\n- Employing only skilled refrigeration technicians;\n\n- Contracting with only experienced ammonia refrigeration contractors;\n\n- Organizing an in-house Emergency Support Team\n\n- Coordination with the North Haven Fire Department;\n\n- Partnering with a hazardous materials release contractor; and\n\n- Maintaining communication with the designated North Haven Local Emergency Planning Commission.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION\n\n\n\nAccidental release prevention is the approach Bozzuto's has taken to minimize and possibly eliminate the\n\npotential for an accidental release. Bozzuto's exercises ongoing preventive maintenance and equipment\n\nintegrity procedures.\n\nSome of these programs include:\n\n- Process Safety Management / Risk Management\n\n- Hazard Communication, and\n\n- Lockout / Tagout\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nBozzuto's maintains twenty-four hour, seven day per week coverage of trained Security Officers. In the event\n\nof an emergency the notifier will dial an emergency extension and be connected to a Security Officer. The\n\nSecurity Officer will gather the information and initiate the Emergency Action Plan.\n\nHaving this continuous coverage reduces the response time in an emergency con"

Accidental release prevention programs include:\n\n- Process Safety Management / Risk Management,\n\n- Hazard Communication,\n\n- Lockout / Tagout.\n\n\n\nThrough a Process Hazard Analysis, Bozzuto's tries to identify potential accidental release conditions through\n\na Haz-Op study to identify risks. Solutions are then developed to prevent or limit these conditions from\n\nhappening.\n\n\n\nIf an incident were to happen, an investigation would take place, and new procedures would be implemented\n\nso a similar occurrence could be prevented.\n\n\n\nBozzuto's prevention programs are audited at regular intervals to validate their effectiveness; the objective is\n\nto be proactive in preventing accidental releases, not reactive.\n\n\n\nBozzuto's is not aware of any reportable release prior to taking occupancy in September 2008. With the\n\ncurrent practice of education, preventive maintenance, and commitment, Bozzuto's strives to minimize the\n\npotential for accidents in the future.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\n\n\nBozzuto's Emergency Response Plan is organized in multiple levels of response, many of which are by trained\n\nBozzuto's employees. The Emergency Support Team is the core of the action plan. This team is trained in the\n\nEmergency Action Plan procedures and implementation. The Emergency Support Team meets to review\n\nprocedures and discuss new and improved methods of response. Among the benefits of having a trained in-house\n\nsupport team is reduced response time and more immediate decision making capabilities; these\n\nqualities greatly contribute to minimizing the effects in the event of an actual emergency.\n\n\n\nThe North Haven Fire Department is an important part of Bozzuto's Emergency Action Plan, and are kept\n\ncurrent with Bozzuto's facility information.\n\n\n\nBozzuto's continues to revise and improve its Emergency Action Plan.
