This commitment is demonstrated by the resources it has invested in accident prevention and training, as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.  MRE's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent release of regulated substances.  However, if a release occurs, MRE personnel may respond to contain and control the release.\n\n\n\nStationary Source Description and Regulated Substances\n\nThe plant is located about 2 miles east of Sutherland, Nebraska and operates 24 hours per day, 7 days a week manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  Denaturant (natural gasoline) is stored in an 18,500-gallon aboveground storage tank.  Denaturant contains greater than 1% of a regulated substance (butane, isopentane, and pentane) and is regulated as a Flammable Mixture.  This RMP is submitted to cover denaturant stored at MRE.\n\n\n\nOff-Site Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe worst case scenario at the facility is release of the entire contents of the 18,500-gallon denaturant storage tank followed by ignition of the resulting vapor cloud.  The worst case vapor cloud explosion generates a 1 psig over-pressure endpoint about 0.3 mile from the tank.  There are no public or environmental receptors or population centers within this distance.  The Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) evaluated release of a flammable substance because of a hose break.  This ARS generates a dispersion distance of 0.1 mile to the lower flammabilit limit (LFFL) for a vapor cloud fire.  There are also no public or environmental receptors or population centers within this distance.\n\n\n\nAlthough MRE has numerous controls in place to prevent such a release and to manage potential consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive or active mitigati"

      "SummaryText": "on meaures were taken into account in evaluating these scenarios.\n\n\n\n5 Year Accident History\n\nMRE began operations at the plant on September 1, 2004 and has experienced no accidents that resulted in significant off-site impacts.  The plant was shut down from February 2012 to current (the date of this RMPsubmission), although start up is expected imminently.  \n\n\n\nPrevention Program Information\n\nThe plant prevention program includes safety information (Material Safety Data Sheets, chemical inventory, and equipment and process specifications), perodic review, written operating procedures consistent with safety information, training, maintenance schedules and procedures, and compliance audits.\n\n \n\nEmergency Response Program Information\n\nMRE's Safety Compliance Manual and Spill Prevention Countermeasure and Control (SPCC) Plan incorporate emergency response requirements.  These documents are updated as necessary.  The Safety Compliance Manual includes Emergency Notification and Contingency Planning, Emergency Fire Protection & Prevention Plan, and Spill Prevention/Reaction Plan sections.  The SPCC Plan addresses spill prevention and response activities.  Employee training is required.  May 13, 2013 a joint familiarization and demonstration of water supply and pressure systems with the Sutherland Rural Fire Department has been planned.\n\n\n\nEnvironmental Management System\n\nAgate Environmental has created a secure Internet website (SharePoint) where MRE stores and manages environmental requirements.  SharePoint is populated with current and historical compliance records, permits, photographs, data forms, equipment specifications, correspondence, and other pertinent information.  Forms are created to manage the flow of information from the plant to SharePoint and tasks are assigned to MRE personnel."
