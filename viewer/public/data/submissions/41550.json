Inland Star is committed to the prevention and minimization of accidental releases of potentially hazardous chemicals.  It is Inland Star's policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.  As such, Inland Star maintains an on-site HAZWOPER certified emergency response team, has installed high-density sprinkler and foam extinguishing systems, and has graded the site to drain to truck bays and containment ponds in order to prevent off-site releases.  To meet their commitment to prevention, Inland Star has implemented a comprehensive EPA Risk Management Plan (RMP) to address regulatory requirements from Section 112\u00ae of the Clean Air Act (CAA).  Based on the regulatory requirements and on Facility operations, a Program Level 2 Prevention Program has been prepared for Facility operations. \nThe Facility stores agricultural and industrial chemicals for distribution to chemical dealers and distributors. The only chemical stored in the warehouse process at the Facility that is in sufficient quantity to be regulated under EPA RMP regulations (40 CFR, Part 68) is 46,000 pounds of ethylene oxide or oxirane (CAS No. 75-21-8).\nThis RMP includes a review of potential hazards associated with the storage and handling of the ethylene oxide at the Facility, operational procedures, maintenance procedures, and employee training.  Periodic safety reviews are communicated to employees to reduce the possibility of an accidental release.  To minimize the hazards presented by an accidental release to Facility staff or the public, Inland Star has prepared an emergency response plan that coordinates the actions of Facility staff with local emergency responders.  The Facility\u00bfs emergency response program is based upon the EPA Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act Regulations, federal and st"
