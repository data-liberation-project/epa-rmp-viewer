Albemarle, Tyrone Plant was opened for business in 1976 by two entrepreneurs.  In 1986, Albemarle, Tyrone Plant was bought by First Chemical Company of Pascagoula, MS.  First Chemical Company is a subsidiary of First Mississippi Corporation, who was restructured under the name of ChemFirst Inc. in late 1996. Albemarle Corporation purchased the site in July of 2001. \n\nThe facility is designed for maximum flexibility and is continuously upgraded to ensure safe operation, minimal waste, and top efficiency.  We have more than 60,000 gallons of reactor capacity and a complete range of solids handling equipment.  The plant is especially well-equipped for complex, multi-step synthesis.  Albemarle, Tyrone Plant's production operations consist of the batch production of specific and finite campaigns to produce chemicals for our customers.\n\nThe facility's Quality and Environmental management systems are ISO 9002 (Quality) and 14001 (Environmental) registered.\n\nFACILITY POLICIES FOR ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVETION AND EMERGENCY REPSONSE\n\nCompany environmental and safety/health policy statements stress the importance of protecting the safety and health of our employees as well as that of the community and the public.  \"The world's natural resources of air, water, and land are finite and must be conserved and protected.  Life and health are precious and must be safeguarded.  These beliefs compel us to conduct our business in a manner that protects the health and safety of our employees and the public....\"  \"The personal safety and health of each employee of this company and the general public of Tyrone is of primary importance.

These chemicals and their maximum intended inventory levels are: chlorine, 6,000 pounds; anhydrous hydrochloric acid, 21,000 pounds; 37% formaldehyde  40,000 pounds,  12% oleum, 12,000 pounds and hydrochloric acid (37% solution), 40,000 pounds. \nChlorine and anhydrous hydrochloric acid are gasses that are delivered and maintained in cylinders, 12% oleum is a solution stored ina a 2000 gallon vessed while hydrochloric acid solution and 37% formaldehyde are  liquids that are stored in an 8000 gallon tanks.  Only one cylinder of chlorine and/or anhydrous hydrochloric acid is used at a time to feed the raw material to a batch.  In addition to minimizing the inventory of these and other chemicals that are needed for our production operations, we also try to remove the chemicals from our site when they are no longer needed for a production campaign.\n\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nA worst-case release scenario has been modeled for anhydrous hydrochloric acid .  An alternative release scenario has also been modeled for anhydrous hydrochloric acid, and the worst-case release scenario is being presented as the alternative release scenario for the other regulated substances; some  of the releases have off-site impact. \n\n For the worst-case scenario, a cylinder leaks and releases 3000 pounds of anhydrous hydrochloric acid  (the entire contents of the pressurized cylinder) in 10 minutes.  The impact distance hypothetically could be up to 2.4 miles during the worse possible weather conditions.  This scenario DOES NOT take into account the plant's safety and prevention systems, and assumes nothing is done to minimize the release.\n\nFor chlorine, a cylinder leaks and releases 2000 pounds of chlorine  gas (the entire contents of the pressurized cylinder) in 10 minutes.

Employee input during all stages and phases is critical.\n\nProcess Safety Information:  MSDSs are usually furnished by our customers, and they usually contain toxicity, PEL, physical, reactivity, and corrosivity data.  The R&D Department reviews this and other (i.e., thermal and chemical stability) information obtained from customers, and if the information is inadequate, testing of the reaction mixtures or compounds is performed.  The Engineering Department generates a P&ID for each project so that the R&M Department can install the equipment as designed.  The Engineering Department has determined the electrical classification for the various buildings and purchases equipment which meets these requirements.  The Engineering Department designs the general ventilation systems for the production buildings and designs the local ventilation systems throughout the plant.  Design Codes and standards that are used are a combination of Albemarle, Tyrone Plant requirements, Albemare let requirements, ASME Boiler Codes, NFPA Codes, and other applicable codes and standards.  The Engineering Department reviews the process and generates a short process description and block flow diagram.  It also reviews proposed chemical usage and determines the maximum inventory levels.  The Engineering Department reviews process chemistry and determines the corrosivity of raw materials and reaction mixtures.  They then select the proper equipme"

The Engineering Department develops relief system design using a computer program and often customer recommendations.  The R&D Department develops material balances for the reactions.  The Engineering Department generates a list of safety systems and engineering controls (i.e., interlocks, pressure relief devices, computer alarms and controls) which are used during a project.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:  The Production Project Coordinator, Safety Department, Engineering , Production, and Customer representatives conduct a Process Hazard Analysis for each project.  Administrative control of the projects is maintained by the use of a Production Batch Record for each batch that is produced, Production Shift Supervisor Checklists for each shift, and Production Coordinator weekly production reports.  Facility siting concerns are reviewed using a checklist developed by the Engineering Department.  Human factors are covered during the PHA.  The Production Department has established Standard Operating Procedures for corrective action systems for both ISO 9002 and 14001.\n\nOperating Procedures:  Production Coordinators write Batch Records for each project.  The batch records are used as operating instructions for the production operators.  The Production Department  develops procedures for emergency shutdown, emergency operations, and startup after an emergency; these are included in the batch records.  The R&D Department also generates limits for temperature and pressure that are incorporated into the batch records.  The Safety Department reviews the MSDS for each raw material and product, and the information is put into a batch record safety sheet which uses a standard format to make it easier for operators to locate needed information.  Raw material and product specifications are developed to maintain materials quality control.\n\nTraining:  The Production Project Coordinator conducts initial t"

Refresher training is conducted prior to successive production campaigns.\n\nContractors:  Contractors use Albemarle, Tyrone Plant Emergency evacuation procedures and safety permits, and Albemarle, Tyrone Plant informs contractors of work and unique process hazards.  Contractors attend Albemarle, Tyrone Plant safety training programs and also have their own job training programs.  The Engineering and Safety Departments conduct periodic evaluations of the safety programs and performance for each contractor company.\n\nPreStartup Safety Review:  A series of checklists are developed and implemented to ensure that all appropriate items are reviewed before projects are started.  The Production Project Coordinator develops a list of recommendations from the PHA, and the recommendations are resolved before the project is started.\n\nMechanical Integrity:  The R&M Department has developed Standard Operating Procedures for Preventive Maintenance, and personnel are assigned to conduct the various PM items.  The PM system is also a part of the ISO 9002 and 14001 systems, and these systems are each audited two times a year by third party auditors.  The R&M Department conducts an annual shutdown each year in which additional equipment is inspected and/or tested.  Certain equipment may also be inspected and/or tested by contractors.  The R&M Department has developed and implemented a quality assurance program for various types of equipment to ensure that replacement parts meet initial design requirements (replacement in kind).\n\nHot Work Permit:  The Safety Department has developed and implemented a Hot Work Permit which is used by all Albemarle, Tyrone Plant and contractor employees.  Other permits (i.e., Line Breaking, Confined Space, Lockout/Tagout, Safe Work, Elevated Work) are also implemented.\n\n\nManagement of Change Procedure:  Standard Operating Procedures are developed and implemented to describe when this pro"

The hard copy of the MOC is maintained in Production, and the MOC is also tracked in our computer network.\n\nIncident Investigation Procedure:  The Production Shift Supervisor generates the initial incident report following any accident, incident, or close call.  An investigation is held to identify root causes and to propose corrective actions.  These suggestions are added to a computer tracking system where the are monitored until they are resolved.  Information is shared with appropriate employees at the plant and at other company locations.\n\nEmergency Planning and Response:  The Safety and Environmental Departments have developed several emergency response plans for the site.  Training and drills are conducted to ensure the plans are understood and followed.\n\nAudits:  Process Hazard Analyses are conducted prior to each new campaign, and at least every five years for repetitive projects which last more than five years.  Batch records are continuously reviewed and updated to ensure they are accurate and the production employees are following them.  The Corporate Safety Department conducts a compliance audit at least every three years to certify compliance with the PSM standard.\n\nTrade Secrets:  Albemarle, Tyrone Plant does not claim any trade secrets.    \n\nEmergency response program\n\nSeveral plans and procedures address emergency planning and response for the entire plant as well as procedures for handling localized releases.  The Emergency Response Plan is updated to reflect any facility changes, and is coordinated with the Blair County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC).

Each Team is comprised of employees and is led by its shift supervisor, who assumes the role of Incident Commander during any on-site emergency.  Albemarle, Tyrone Plant emergency response personnel receive appropriate training (i.e., confined space rescue, SCBA, fire fighting, spill response); some members are also certified in CPR and first aid response.  Drills are conducted at least twice/year for each crew's response personnel.  The safety department determines the scenario for each drill.  After the drill is completed, it is critiqued; the findings and recommendations are used to help design future drills and training exercises.  Using this approach, each Team addresses specific response areas that need improvement.\n\nAll production and maintenance employees are also trained to respond to spills and releases, and all employees receive training in the use of hand held fire extinguishers to extinguish incipient stage fires.  In addition, the facility is protected with a foam sprinkler system, and is also equipped with several outdoor fire monitors and wheeled fire extinguishers that may be used in the event of a larger fire.  In addition to this emergency response training, all employees are instructed to activate the fire alarm and to evacuate the facility in the event of an emergency.    \n\nWe also utilize the emergency fire and medical response services provided by the City of Tyrone emergency response personnel; response time to our facility is about five (5) minutes.  We provide periodic orientation and informational tours for off-site response personnel.
