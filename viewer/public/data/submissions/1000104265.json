This is a realistic release that is expected to happen at least once over the life of the system. To simulate it a seal or flange leak of \u00bc diameter gas release is assumed. The release rate is 10 lbs/minute at a pressure of 154 psig corresponding to 86\u00b0F condensing pressure. A response time of 30 minutes is assumed. Plant maintenance personnel could respond more quickly in most cases. The distance of <0.1 miles is obtained from RMP Comp software corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L. Using tables which have values less than .1 miles it's actually less than .06 miles. \n\nFive-year Accident History\nThe previous owner and Cabot Packing, LLC has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 12 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there have been no reportable accidental releases or injuries during this period.\n\nProgram 3 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nCabot Packing, LLC maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.

Specific activities include washing, packing, pre-cooling and cold storage of grapes and tree fruit.  The flooded Ammonia refrigeration system provides 3 pre-coolers, 3 storage rooms 1 refrigerated hallway/dock and a hydro-cooler.  Ammonia (anhydrous) refrigerant is the only regulated substance present at our facility above thresholds requiring an RMP.  Total system NH3 capacity is estimated at 17,262 lbs..  Sulphur Dioxide seasonally used for fumigation is also present however quantities are under 300 lbs.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Reference Tables or RMP Comp Software. No specific unusual external events were included due to the facilities rural location, remote equipment location and recent construction meeting all applicable seismic and safety codes. A pipe/tank rupture in the largest vessel was used to represent the Worst Case. Potential impacts by forklift or other facility traffic typical to this type of operation or errors made during maintenance/construction are the most likely cause of a reportable release. Any catastrophic earthquake, fire or weather type events would result in the same impacts as presented in this OCA or less. Details are not included"

It\u00bfs designed to provide the Fresno County CUPA with necessary details required for review. The original program was filed and approved in 1999. It was updated per regulatory requirements in 2004,2009,2013,2018,2019\n\nThere were minor changes in refrigeration equipment with no inventory change or releases in the last 5 years. The only changes at the facility was plant manager retirement and new replacement. \n\nA Compliance Audit was completed in 2023. Suggestions from the Compliance Audit will be followed and implemented, or rejected and any suggestions documented in the follow-up section. The major recommendation was more complete documentation of inspections, training, contractor qualifications and employee awareness.\n\nThe original Process Hazards Analysis was reviewed as required at 5 years and minor changes completed as recommended. \n\nA current detailed copy of RMP, PSM including PHA materials can be reviewed at the facility by contacting John Bath. Since the materials consist of several several binders and facility drawings which are constantly updated as changes are implemented, any reproduction becomes obsolete at the time of printing.
