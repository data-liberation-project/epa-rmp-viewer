      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\n\nIt is the policy of Crestwood Farms, LLC to conduct business in a manner that is safe to the employees, the community, and the environment.  The company's officers, managers, and supervisors are accountable to carry out the policies of the company relevant to the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous materials.  Crestwood has made a determined effort to develop a plan to prevent releases of extremely hazardous substances.  Procedures to assist in the prevention of extremely hazardous material releases are set forth in EPA's Risk Management Program.  In the event of a release, the Emergency Response Plan will be the guidance for responding to, containing, and reporting such releases.  The Emergency Response Plan includes an incident command system for decision-making authority for each stage of a release situation.  Crestwood will coordinate with public responders and emergency services in ensuring safety of the public.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nCrestwood is a further processing facility.  Product is shipped to the facility, cooked, and packaged ready for the market.  Ammonia refrigeration is used to cool or freeze the food products.  Ammonia refrigeration is a closed loop system, meaning the ammonia is continually reused.  Liquid ammonia is changed to a gas and then condensed to a liquid for reuse.\n\nRELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nCrestwood has set forth in its policies the importance of operating safely.  It has aggressively developed programs, policies, and materials to minimize the possibility of releases.  These programs include compliance with appropriate OSHA and EPA regulations and sound safety practices.  Stringent material and contractor requirements have been developed to assure that materials and work conform to recognized standards.  Training for employees is conducted to maintain a high awareness level when working with hazardous materials.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HI"

      "SummaryText": "STORY\n\nCrestwood has not had any reportable accidental releases in the past five years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nThe local fire department provides emergency response.   Joint response training is conducted with local emergency service organizations (i.e., fire, police, rescue, etc.).\n\nSAFETY IMPROVEMENTS\n\nFuture changes to improve release prevention include: continued maintenance procedures and periodicity; addition of new technology as it becomes available; and continued training of plant personnel."
