      "SummaryText": "Kentucky Hydrocarbon, Maytown Plant, is a natural gas liquids extraction facility located in a rural section of Floyd County near Langley, Kentucky. At this location we can extract up to 150,000 gallons per day of natural gas liquids from raw natural gas that is piped to the plant. The liquid product primarily consists of liquid propane with lesser amounts of butane, isobutane,isopentane, hexane and smaller quantities of ethane and methane. This mixture of natural gas liquids is flammable and is considered to be hazardous by the US Environmental Protection Agency. The liquids are stored in seven pressurized horizontal bullet storage tanks with a total capacity of 210,000 gallons. Also in the process area are four smaller tanks with a total capacity of 27,000 gallons giving a total site capacity of 237,000 gallons. Because of the proximity of the storage tanks to each other, they are considered part of the same process. It is our policy to take proactive action to reduce the risk of exposure of these hazardous chemicals to company employees, the local community and the environment. We comply or are in the process of updating our compliance with all Federal and State regulations including OSHA Process Safety Management. These regulations require specific actions to identify potential hazards in the process, to train operators in procedures that will reduce potential releases of hazardous chemicals and appropriate measures to reduce the potential of uncontrolled process releases. Due to our efforts in these safety and prevention programs, there has been no accidental releases of hazardous chemicals in the last five years. In the event of an accidental release of hazardous chemicals, we are trained to respond by means of an Emergency Action Plan. The Emergency Action Plan includes step by step procedures for protecting plant personnel and the general public in the event of an uncontrolled release of hazardous chemicals and includes response and evacuation procedures.
