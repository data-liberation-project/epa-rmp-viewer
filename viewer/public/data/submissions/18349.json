      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nAgra Resources Coop. (dba Exol) is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process, specifically the natural gasoline used as the ethanol denaturant. The natural gasoline is added to the ethanol to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption.  It is the policy of Agra Resources Coop. (dba Exol) to comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws.\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nAgra Resources Coop. (dba Exol) operates an ethanol fuel production plant located near Albert Lea, in Freeborn County, Minnesota. The facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn and a process by-product known as dry distillers' grain with soluables, which is used as a livestock feed.  The fuel ethanol production process requires use of a denaturant (natural gasoline) which is reported to contain 30 to 40 percent pentane, an RMP regulated substance. The maximum amount of natural gasoline on-site is estimated to be 120,000 pounds. The natural gasoline is stored in an above ground tank as a liquid and is introduced to the fuel ethanol in the final stage of production. The denaturant tank is located in the facility's tank farm area which includes secondary containment.\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\nThe worst case scenario defined by RMP Guidance is a failure of the natural gasoline storage tank resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. According to RMP*Comp, a software tool developed by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for use in performing offsite consequence analysis,  the maximum estimated distance from the facility's center to a one pound per square inch overpressure is 0.4 miles. The estimated number of human receptors within a 0.4 mile radius of the plant is 35  persons. The analysis assumed a release of 120,000 pounds of denaturant (the entire contents of the tank), a wind"

      "SummaryText": "speed of 3.4 miles per hour and an air temperature of 77 degrees F. \n\nAlternate Case Scenario\n\nThe alternative case scenario evaluated using RMP Guidance was a failure of the largest natural gasoline storage tank resulting in a vapor cloud fire. According to RMP*Comp,  the maximum estimated distance from the facility's center to the Lower Flammability Limit for pentane (1.5%) is less than 0.1 miles. The estimated number of human receptors within a 0.1 mile radius of the plant is 9 persons. The analysis assumed a release rate of 2000 pounds of pentane per minute, a wind speed of 6.7 miles per hour and an air temperature of 77 degrees F. The analysis also assumed the release occurs in a diked area since the Exol tank farm is located in a diked secondary containment area.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThrough completion of this RMP, Agra Resources Coop. (dba Exol) has complied with the EPA requirements under 40 CFR Part 68. Process safety information and operations/maintenance procedures are documented on-site. Periodic functions such as process hazard analysis, training, change management and incident investigation are conducted on a regular basis. Audits of the overall RMP will be conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA regulations.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nAgra Resources Coop. (dba Exol) has not had a natural gasoline accident causing death, injuries, environmental of property damage, evacuations or in-place sheltering in the last five years at the fuel production facility.The facility began operation in March of 1999.\n\nThe Emergency Response Program\n\nIn the event of an emergency, it is the policy of Agra Resources Coop. (dba Exol) to notify the City of Glenville Fire Department and evacuate all employees from the facility."
