      "SummaryText": "General Executive Summary For The Dow Chemical Company La Porte Site\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at the La Porte Site are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of all chemicals including regulated substances. If such an unforeseeable release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.   We are also coordinated with Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA) which provides additional emergency response expertise. \n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur primary activities encompass The Dow Chemical Company facility in La Porte, Texas, which is in the chemical manufacturing business.  The basic products manufactured at the site include Methylene Diphenyldiisocyanate based (MDI based) polymeric isocyanates, polyol systems, related polyurethane elastomers and foams, and phosgene.  Chloroformate chemicals are produced at this facility also.  We have five regulated substances present at our facility, which are involved in several uses. These substances include Formaldehyde (solution), Isopentane, Methyl Chloroformate, Propyl Chloroformate, and Phosgene  [Carbonic dichloride].  Formaldehyde (solution) is used for polymeric amine production.  Isopentane is used for foam bun production.  Phosgene  [Carbonic dichloride] is used for polymeric isocyanate production.  Methyl and propyl chloroformates are sold as specialty chemical intermediates. \n\nThe maximum inventory of Formaldehyde (solution), Isopentane, and Phosgene  [Carbonic dichloride] are present at our facility in quantities of 92,"

The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), Including Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures to Limit the Distances for Each Reported Scenario\n\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  For alternative release scenario analyses, we have employed Phast version 5.1.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Polymeric MDI Production.  In this scenario, 17,346 lb. of liquid Phosgene  [Carbonic dichloride] is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1-cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  The released quantity has been limited to 20 % of the maximum capacity of the source by a system of administrative controls.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of >25 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.00081 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Phosgene  [Carbonic dichloride] involves a release from Polymeric MDI Production of 1635 lb. of phosgene gas. The release is also assumed to be controlled by deluge system(s), scrubber(s), emergency shutdown system(s) and steam curtain.  These active mitigation systems have the effect of stopping the release in ten minutes and suppressing the released vapors.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.00081 mg/L of Phosgene  [Carbonic dichloride] is 4.9 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Formaldehyde (solution) involves a release from Polymeric MDI Production.  The scenario involves the release of 11,440 lb. of 50% Formaldehyde solution from a broken transfer"

The release is also assumed to be controlled by excess flow valve(s) and emergency shutdown system(s).  These active mitigation systems have the effect of stopping the release after ten minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.012 mg/L of Formaldehyde (solution) is 1.1 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Methyl or Propyl Chloroformates involves a release from Chloroformate Production of 11,250 lbs. of 100% Methyl or Propyl Chloroformate liquid from a broken one inch pipe.   Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1-cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to be covered with foam after 15 minutes.
