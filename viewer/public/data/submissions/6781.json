In addition, it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws.\n     Turnis Farm Service, Inc. Mission states To provide for the safety of our employees, our customers and the general public.  In order to fulfill this mission, Turnis Farm Service, Inc. provides an EHS group to maintain and administer comprehensive safety and environmental programs and procedures.  EHS field safety services supervisors audit and monitor facility compliance with the safety standards of the company.\n     This facility maintains approximately twelve (12) 1,000-gallon nurse tanks for customer delivery.  Our combined storage capacity in nurse tanks is 56,000 pounds.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in one (1) stationary tank (1@ 30,000 gallons) on site.  140,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia is the maximum storage capacity of stationary storage tanks.  Therefore, the total facility anhydrous ammonia storage capacity for our facility is 196,000 pounds.  The largest single storage vessel at our faciltiy contains 140,000 pounds.\n\nTHE WORST CASE SCENARIO\n     Our worst case sce"

The maximum quantity released would be 140,000 pounds.  According to DEGADIS modeling, this release (distance to point of dispersion to 200 PPM) would have off site impact.  It should be noted that Turnis Farm Service, Inc. has never had a release of an entire stationary storage tank.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n     The most common alternative release scenario(s) from our faciltiy would not reach an end-point off-site.  The alternative release scenario modeled for the purposes of this plan is a 2-minute release from a stationary storage tank representing a valve and hose failure requiring a manual shut down.  The total amount of anhydrous ammonia released in this scenario would be 12,000 pounds.  This release scenario (distance to point of dispersion to 200 PPM) would have off site impact.  It should be noted that Turnis Farm Service, Inc. has not had a release of this type.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS.\n      The ammonia system is designed, installed and is maintained in accordance with ASTM standards and the ASME codes.  This facility complies with the ANSI K 61.1 standards (1989), OSHA (29 CFR 1910.111), EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule as well as all applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations.\n     Our ammonia system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shutoffs and emergency shutoff valves.  The load-out risers used for the purpose of filling the nurse tanks are protected by excess flow valves and fill line breakaways to immediately stop the flow of ammonia if a line or a hose fails.  All of the main storage tank valves and the riser load valves are locked when not in use. \n     Our ammonia system is inspected on"

The manager conducts comprehensive annual audits to measure regulatory compliance including those governing the safe handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia.\n     Our location has a 'site safety coordinator' as an extension of the EHS group.  This coordinator is given training to monitor the day to day safe work activities, maintain the required regulatory recordkeeping, conduct regular safety meetings and conduct employee training.  The site safety coordinator and the manager act as the location emergency contact.\n  \nA DESCRIPTION OF OUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED.\n     This faciltiy is a wholesale farm supply distribution center.  As such, we store and distribute a wide variety of pesticides and fertilizers including Anhydrous Ammonia.  Anhydrous Ammonia is received by truck, is handled and stored on-site and is a regulated substance by the EPA requiring us to comply with the Risk Management Program.  We sell anhydrous ammonia to grower customers in 1,000 gallon nurse tanks.  The customer applies the ammonia into the soil as a source of nitrogen fertilizer for growing agricultural crops.  Training is provided to all employees at least annually, whenever there is a change in the process or whenever competency with the regulations is questioned.  The training consists of classroom lecture, current videos, testing and certification and on the job training.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY.\n      There has been no accidents involving anhydrous ammonia that caused deaths, injuries, pro"

In preparation for this, we have coordinated with all of the local response agencies by providing information and facility tours to ensure that they are familiar with and properly prepared for an incident at our faciltiy.  This will help to ensure that our community has the strategy for responding to and mitigating the threat posed by an ammonia release.  This complies with the requirement for our facility to be included in the community emergency response plan prepared under EPCRA and coordinated with our LEPC.\n     In addition, Turnis Farm Service, Inc. has an Emergency Response and Contingency Plan that complies with the requirements of OSHA (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.1200).  The plan includes public notification, provisions for initial medical care, evacuations and LEPC coordination.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY.\n     We do not plan to make any changes to the physical site.  We will continue to provide our employees with ongoing annual training to ensure that they are current with all of the safe ammonia transfer and handling procedures, and provide regular inspection and maintenance on all of the ammonia equipment."
