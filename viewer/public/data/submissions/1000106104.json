All 14 elements of the OSHA PSM program, the EPA requirement for developing an Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA), and the RMP submittal are included within the facility's prevention program.  \n\nDESCRIPTION OF FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe Connell, Washington facility produces various potato products such as french fries and formed potato products. The plant site consists of a main processing plant, raw potato storage buildings, boiler/refrigeration facility, primary and secondary water treatment facility, and refrigerated cold storage.\nActivities are conducted at this site during all months of the year.\n\nThe covered process at the facility is a closed loop anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.  The ammonia refrigeration system allows the finished products to be quickly cooled and frozen.  There is one independent refrigeration system at the facility, which has more than the Threshold Quantity (TQ) of anhydrous ammonia.  \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe OSHA PSM component elements are organized as follows: 1) Employees participate in the elements of this safety and release prevention program whenever possible; 2) Ammonia awareness and PSM training is provided to all employees, operators and maintenance personnel receive additional training; 3) Process Safety Information (PSI) is maintained on the covered processes; 4) Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) of the covered processes were conducted and will be periodically reviewed to ensure adequacy of controls; 5) The Mechanical Integrity program ensures the covered processes will continue to operate as designed; 6) Operating and Maintenance procedures provide operators and maintenance staff the information necessary to safely operate and maintain the covered processes; 7) Contractors working on or near"

The ERP has been reviewed with the Connell Fire Department and the Franklin County Local Emergency Planning Committe"

The purpose of the plan is to establish policies and procedures for protecting the health and safety of employees, contractors, and visitors, and to comply with all applicable federal and state regulations.  Training of employees and contractors includes providing a copy of the plan upon initial employment at Lamb Weston, Inc. and reviewing it for their specific assignment, annual refresher training for current employees, and review for all whenever the plan is changed. In addition, plant evacuation drills are conducted on a regular basis.\n\nThe plan is comprehensive enough to deal with all types of emergencies specific to the Lamb Weston Connell, Washington facility and defines the following:\n\n\u00bf\tPreferred means for reporting fires, hazardous materials incidents, medical, and any other emergencies;\n\u00bf\tEmergency escape routes and assembly areas;  \n\u00bf\tProcedures to account for all employees including contractors and visitors; and\n\u00bf\tNames of agencies and persons to contact.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nSafety systems and preventative maintenance measures will be constantly evaluated and improved.  The facility will evaluate recommendations from Process Hazard Analyses and Compliance Audits in a timely manner and implement, as soon as possible, those recommendations that will reduce the possibility of a release and/or mitigate the consequence of an unintentional release."
