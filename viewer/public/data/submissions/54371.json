Safety is integrated into all activities of all employees working at the Spontex Columbia Plant.  Commitment to safety and the environment comes from top management, both on site and corporate. This is demonstrated by both our site operating philosophy and our corporate Health, Safety, and Environmental policy.\n\n \n\nDescription of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled (40 CFR ?68.155(b))\n\nThe Spontex Columbia Plant resides on 47.4 acres of land located in northern Maury County, Tennessee along the Duck River.   The U.S. Government constructed the original buildings at the Columbia Plant between 1942-1944 for the manufacture of gas masks.  However, gas mask production never began at the facility.  The government abandoned the facility in 1945 after the conclusion of World War II.  The facility was apparently vacant between 1945 and 1947.  The Maury County Cooperative used the facility for storing grain and for retail sales between 1947 and 1952.  From 1952 to 1981, E. I. Du Pont De Nemours and Company, Inc. (Du Pont) manufactured sponges for household use at the facility.  Spontex has used the facility to manufacture household sponges since 1981.   At the Columbia Plant, sponges are made from the viscose process, the same process used to make rayon, cellophane, sausage casings, etc.  Wood pulp (cellulose) is steeped or wetted with sodium hydroxide to form alkali cellulose.  The alkali cellulose is then reacted with carbon disulfide to form a xanthate.  This xanthate is put into solution with water resulting in viscose.  The next steps are determined by the desired end product; to produce sponge, the viscose is mixed with salt crystals to form ?sponge mix.?  This ?sponge mix? is then heated causing the regeneration of the cellulose and liberati"

The cellulose forms around the salt crystals, the salt crystals melt away and the result is a sponge.\n\nThe EPA RMP regulation applies to the Spontex Columbia Plant because of the quantities of carbon disulfide that we use as a raw material in the manufacturing of cellulose sponges.   Carbon disulfide is on the list of EPA toxic RMP materials and is used in our manufacturing process. \n\n \n\nDescription of Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Steps (40 CFR ?68.155?)\n\nSpontex has implemented an accident release prevention program, which meets or exceeds every requirement of the accidental release prevention provisions set forth in 40 CFR Part 68 by the EPA. Processes at our facility are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. This program includes provisions for the following program requirements.  \n\n1. Employee Participation \n\n2. Process Safety Information (PSI) \n\n3. Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) \n\n4. Operating Procedures \n\n5. Training \n\n6. Contractors \n\n7. Pre-Startup Safety Review \n\n8. Mechanical Integrity \n\n9. Management of Change \n\n10. Incident Investigation \n\n \n\nDescription of Five Year Accident History (40 CFR ?68.155(d))\n\nSpontex has experienced one RMP reportable accident, which occurred in September of 2006.  This incident involved an independent contractor cleaning a carbon disulfide tank for removal and ultimate disposal of this tank.   During this cleaning process, a contractor employee most probably ignited a flash fire using a non-intrinsically safe flash light, which resulting in that contractor employee receiving burns to his body.   This contractor employee later died from the injury that he sustained associated with this flash fire.  \n\n \n\nDescription of Emergency Response Program (40 CFR ?68.155(e))\n\nSpontex has developed a detailed emergency response plan to address all of the requirements found in 29 CFR 1"

This system has been reviewed in the design phases using HAZOP analysis methods to ensure that all of the hazards that can be engineered out from this system have been engineered out prior to installation.\ntion."
