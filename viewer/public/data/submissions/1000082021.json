The purpose of Saputo's Emergency Action Plan is to ensure employees know and understand what to do in the event of an emergency to minimize injuries and property damage. The plan includes various aspects of an emergency including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, and notification of local emergency response agencies. Specific employees are trained and certified as medical responders. Employees are trained in evacuation, hazard communication, and chemical safety. In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect pertinent changes.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program. Recommendations resulting from the PHA, compliance audits and mechanical integrity inspections will be addressed in a timely manner. In addition, regular interaction with Saputo Corporate - Department of Refrigeration Services, Department of Environmental Affairs, Health & Safety and Risk Group will improve compliance and overall plant safety."
