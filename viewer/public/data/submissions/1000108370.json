Public receptor information was obtained using facility\u0092s knowledge of surrounding area.  No environmental receptors are affected by an alternate release of denaturant.  \n\nSince the facility qualifies as a Program 3 due to the close proximity of public receptors, Process Safety Management has been completed for this facility.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\nPlease review the first section of this Executive Summary for the general accidental release prevention program information.\n\nTAP\u0092s maintenance department performs regular preventative maintenance inspections, as required by the manufacturer\u0092s recommendations and/or State and Federal regulations. Monthly visual inspections are performed and quarterly leak detection monitoring is performed and reported per NDEE requirements.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\nTAP has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including a Health and Safety Plan and Facility Response Plan. TAP has evacuation and response procedures for fires, explosions, spills, etc. outlined in the facility\u0092s Emergency Action Plan. The Plans listed as part of this Executive Summary have been prepared in accordance with the applicable regulations, as necessary.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\nTAP provides safety training to its employees and contractors on an annual basis.

The regulated substances stored at the facility are anhydrous ammonia and a flammable mixture \u0096 natural gasoline (denaturant).\n\nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE SCENARIOS:\nWorst Case Scenarios:\nFlammable Mixture (Denaturant): The flammable mixture stored onsite is natural gasoline, typically referred to as denaturant. Natural gasoline is used onsite to denature ethanol prior to shipment offsite. Denaturant is stored in an aboveground steel tank. The located is located in a diked containment structure that contains an impermeable liner with gravel overlay. A worst case MSDS was used to determine RMP applicability. The worst case scenario used is the release of the entire contents of the denaturant tank, causing a vapor cloud explosion. RMP Comp was used to determine the worst case distance to endpoint; the model results were 0.7 mile radius. Of the entire tank contents, only a portion was used in the RMP Comp model due to the breakdown of regulated constituents under CAA Section 112(r). Population data was obtained using Circular Area Profiling Software (CAPS) which incorporates 2020 U.S. Census Data. Public receptor information (i.e. schools, hospitals, etc.) was obtained using Google Earth.  No environmental receptors are affected by a worst case release of denaturant.\n\nAlternative Scenarios:\nFlammable Mixture (Denaturant):  The alternate scenario used for the flammable mixture is the release due to a tanker truck loadout spill, causing a vapor cloud fire. The endpoint used was an over pressurization of 1 PSI, a worst case option.  Denaturant deliveries at the facility typically occur during normal business hours with a facility staff member overseeing loadout operations \u0096 therefore a release at the loadout area could be ceased within minutes by manual overrides.  The loadout area also has a catchment basin with underground piping to secondary containment of th"

This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training for the proper operation and maintenance of plant equipment and preventative maintenance programs.\n\nTAP has emergency response policies in place that are addressed in the facility\u0092s Health and Safety Plan; Industrial Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan; Spill Prevention, Controls, and Countermeasures Plan; Facility Response Plan; and Emergency Action Plan. Most of the listed Plans require a minimum of annual training in order to keep employees educated on emergency response procedures in place at the facility. All new employees are required to undergo training on emergency response procedures prior to initiating responsibilities onsite.\n\nTAP participated in a Full Scale Exercise with the Southwest Planning, Exercising, and Training Region on August 21, 2010, funded in part by the U.S. DHS, Hitchcock County, and TAP.  The purpose of the exercise was to bring together the hospitals, EMS, fire, law enforcement, public sector and emergency management agencies that would have responsibility in responding to a mass casualty event.  TAP has a final After Action Report detailing the exercise onsite for review by EPA during normal business hours. Additionally, another community planning training is scheduled for June 20, 2024 with Trenton Fire and Rescue. \n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES:\nTAP ethanol plant is located in Trenton, Hitchcock County, Nebraska.
