ACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION & EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:  We at Brenntag Mid-South, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety and protection.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance and employee training associated with the processes at this facility.  It is our goal and objective to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If an accidental release were to occur, Brenntag has coordinated emergency response activities with the Jefferson County Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Louisville Fire Department.\n\n2.  THE STATIONARY SOURCE & THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:  BrenntagA?s primary activities encompass chemical repackaging, warehousing and distribution.  Currently, there are three regulated substances present at this facility that exceed the Threshold Quantity (TQ) as defined within 40 CFR 68.130. \n\n3.  THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:  Our facility has taken necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements as set forth under 40 CFR Part 68.  In addition, the two regulated substances are also subject to OSHAA?s Process Safety Management regulation as set forth under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of our release prevention program that are currently in place at this facility.\n\na).  Process Safety Information:  Brenntag maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all regulated processes.\n\nb).  Process Hazard Analysis (PHA's):  This facility conducts comprehensive PHA's to ensure that hazards associated with each regulated process are identified and controlled efficiently.

PHA's are reviewed prior to the implementation of any process change that involves the regulated substance; immediately following an accidental release or if an incident has occurred that could have resulted in an accidental release.  At a minimum, PHA's are revalidation every five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.   \n\nc).  Operating Procedures:  For the purpose of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Brenntag maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdowns, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup following a turnaround.  Operating procedures are regularly evaluated and are accessible to all applicable employees involved within each regulated process.\n\nd).  Training:  Brenntag has a comprehensive training program to ensure that employees are competent in the operating and safety procedures associated with the each regulated process. New employees receive basic training in process operations and safety procedures, followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided whenever there has been a change in the process or at a minimum once every 3 years.\n\ne).  Mechanical Integrity:  Brenntag conducts inspections and maintenance on process equipment to ensure on-going equipment integrity.  Qualified personnel receive specialized training to ensure that process equipment is properly inspected and maintained.  Any equipment deficiencies are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nf).  Management of Change:  Written procedures are in place at Brenntag to manage change in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Applicable Brenntag personnel whose job task "

Pre-Startup Reviews:  Brenntag conducts, when applicable, pre-startup safety reviews for new processes and modifications to existing processes.  These reviews are conducted to verify that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup of the process.\n\nh).  Compliance Audits:  Brenntag conducts compliance audits to determine whether the provisions, as set forth under the RMP regulation, are being adhered to at this facility.  These audits are conducted at least every three years as required per this regulation.  Corrective action, resulting from the audit, will be implemented in a safe and prompt manner.\n\ni).  Incident Investigation:  Brenntag will investigate any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the mitigating circumstances surrounding the incident, as well as, to identify any corrective actions that need implemented to prevent such incident from reoccurring.  All incident investigations are retained for a minimum of five years as required per this regulation.\n\nj).  Employee Participation:  Brenntag truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facilityA?s implementation efforts to this standard.  \n\nk).

Due to our stringent release prevention policies and employee training, there have been no accidental releases during this period.\n\n5.  Emergency Response Plan:  Brenntag has developed a written emergency response plan to address the potential for accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including spill response and cleanup, first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public.  This plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes that have taken place within our facility.  Our emergency response plan has been coordinated and verified with the Jefferson County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). \n\n6.
