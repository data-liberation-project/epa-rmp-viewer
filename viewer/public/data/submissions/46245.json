The RMP is required under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program codified in 40 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 (40 CFR 68).  Refining operations are primarily conducted in Areas 1 and 2, which are on contiguous properties.  BWC also has delayed coking operations in Area 3 (EPA Facility ID 1000 0014 9662), which is not adjacent to Areas 1 and 2.  A separate RMP submittal has been prepared for that area.\n\nThe purpose of the Risk Management Program is to identify and prevent potential accidental releases of specific \"regulated substances\", or hazardous chemicals idenfied by the EPA, that have the potential to cause harm to the public and the environment.  BWC has various \"regulated substances\" in quantities above the threshold amounts.  \n\nThe remainder of the Executive Summary is organized as follows:\n\nSection 1: Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at BWC\nSection 2: Overview of Regulated Substances at BWC\nSection 3: Worst Case Release Scenarios and Alternative Release Scenarios\nSection 4: BWC Accidental Release Prevention Program\nSection 5: Five-Year Accidental Release Summary\nSection 6: Emergency Response Program\nSection 7: Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSection 1:  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at BWC\n\nEquipment at the various units is designed, operated, and maintained in full compliance with applicable internal engineering standards, accepted industry codes, or industry standards.  Systems and procedures are in place to control changes in process technology, facilities, operating procedures, and maintenance procedures in order to provide for continued safe and reliable operations.\n\nAll employees at BWC have the responsibility to protect the en"

Regular expansion and improvements of facilities have occurred over the years by different owners, including the integration of an adjacent refinery in 1986 that doubled gasoline production.  In 1998, the refinery became a part of Equilon Enterprises, LLC, a joint venture of Shell Oil Company and Texaco Inc.  Shell Oil Products US acquired Texaco's interest in 2002.  On March 16, 2005, Big West of California, LLC acquired full interest in the refinery.\n\nBWC refines crude oil into a number of consumer products, including gasoline, diesel, gas oils, liquified petroleum gases (LPG), ammonia (for local agricultural use), and coke.\n\nTable 1 lists the covered process units that are subject to the federal Risk Management Program, defines the appropriate RMP program level, and identifies the regulated substances handled in these units.\n\n\nTable 1\nSummary of Covered Process Units - BWC Areas 1 and 2\n\nCrude Vacuum Unit \n(Units 10, 11, and 12) \nPhysically separates crude oil into intermediate and final products by boiling the crude oil and condensing the vapors (i.e., distillation).\nFederal RMP Program Level: Level 3\nRegulated Toxic Substances: None\nRegulated Flammable Substances: Ethane, Propane, Isobutane, Butane, Isopentane, Pentane\n\nHydrogen Generation Unit (Unit 20) Manufactures high purity hydrogen for consumption in the hydrotreaters, and the hydro"

This methodology was used because the RMP rule sets forth specific criteria that must be followed for modeling the worst-case scenarios, including very conservative, simplified assumptions about the nature of the releases and the resulting emission rates into the air.\n\nThe EPA has defined the worst-case release scenario as one that results in the greatest distance from the point of release to a specified \"endpoint\".  The endpoint for toxic substances is a specified concentration, and a specified overpressure from a vapor cloud explosion"

For a regulated flammable substance, the worst-case scenario is one where the total quantity of the regulated flammable substance in the largest vessel or pipe is assumed to vaporize and instantaneously result in a vapor cloud explosion.\n\nA summary of the worst-case scenarios for BWC Areas 1 and 2 is provided below.  As required by the RMP rule, the results are shown for one vessel containing a toxic substance (ammonia) and one vessel containing a flammable substance (flammable liquid).

These scenarios are more realistic than worst-case scenarios for assessing the potential hazards posed by process units and developing emergency response plans.  Although these scenarios may be unlikely to occur, they are physically possible and reasonably feasible.  \n\nEPA OCAG procedures were not used for modeling the alternative release scenarios.

Process Safety Information (PSI), which addresses chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, limits for specific chemical inventories, and equipment design information, was compiled for each process unit.\n\nPSI is used in process unit hazard analyses, inspection, maintenance, and training activities.  This information is kept current by management of change and pre-startup safety review procedures, which are discussed further in this section.\n\nThis information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n4.2  Process Hazards Analysis\n\nBWC conducts process hazards analyses (PHAs) to ensure that hazards associated with process units are identified and controlled.  Under this program, each process is systematically examined by a multi-disciplinary team to identify hazards that could result in an accidental release of a regulated substance and to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage those hazards.  SBR used, and BWC has adopted, the hazard and operability study methodology as the refinery's primary process hazards analysis technique.  Some of the revalidation was performed using the \"what if\" and risk matrix methodologies.

A walk through was conducted in 1996 by a qualified engineering company.  The objective of the seismic assessments was to provide reasonable assurance that a release of a regulated substance having off-site consequence would not occur as a result of a major earthquake.  The results and findings from the seismic review are documented and retained in the computerized tracking system.\n\n4.3  Operating Procedures\n\nBWC has developed and implemented written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in each process.  The written operating procedures address the various modes of process operations such as unit startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process.\n\nThese procedures are used as references by experienced operators and for consistent training of new operators.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them to reflect changes made through the Management of Change process and through annual certification.\n\n4.4  Training\n\nBWC's general policy requires operating personnel to be trained in the safe operation of facilities, handling process upsets, emergency response, and personal safety.  Employees who understand the process and how to safely operate a process can significantly decrease the number and severity of incidents.  \n\nRefresher training for all operations and maintenance employees in Safety, Health, and Environmental subjects and operating procedures (as appropriate) is provided at varying intervals, as required. \n\n4.5  Management of Change\n\nA Management of Change (MOC) review is required for modifications to facilitie"

The requirements for Management of Change are documented in a written procedure, and MOC-related information is kept for the life of the process unit.\n\n4.6  Pre-Startup Safety Reviews\n\nThe purpose of the Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) is to ensure safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nBWC has a comprehensive hazard identification and mitigation program to ensure process safety.  This program includes periodic process hazard analyses, investigations of near misses, and audits of processing units.
