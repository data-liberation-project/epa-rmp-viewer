      "SummaryText": "The Town of Gilbert Water Treatment Plant uses chlorine in quantities above the reporting quantity; triggering the requirement to prepare and submit a Risk Management Plan. The original plan was submitted in 1999. This Plan is the 5-year update, as required by the regulations. As part of the plan update, the process hazard analysis and off-site consequences were also updated. There were no changes to the risk rating identified during the process hazard analysis. The chlorination process presents a risk with a remote likelihood of occurrence and a minimal impact. The off-site consequences was updated using  RMP*CompTM. The endpoint radius was reduced from 3.0 miles to 1.3 miles. This is also consistent with the endpoint radius cited in Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants (May 2000) for chlorine in one-ton cylinders. The population figure within the 1.3 mile radius was also revised to more accurately reflect the conservative, estimated population receptors within the 1.3 mile radius (5,000 people) rather than the entire population of the Town of Gilbert (90,000 as reported in the 1999 Plan). \n\nThe chlorination system is located within a well, ventilated building. It is equipped with automatic and manual controls. In an emergency, the chlorination system would shut down and the air inside the room would be evauated through the air scrubber system. The facility has not had an accidental release from the covered process. The facility is secured from public access and  is staffed by at least one water treatment plant operator at all times."
