Facility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Massey Railyard is owned by Dow and is separated from the South Charleston Plant by the CSX Railroad property, highway and other local businesses. The Dow Massey Rail Yard is used to temporarily store tank cars for eventual processing at the South Charleston Plant. The railyard is managed by the South Charleston Plant, but is not considered contiguous by EPA definition with the South Charleston Plant. The CSX Railroad property sits between the Massey Railyard and the South Charleston Plant. No chemical transfer takes place at the Massey Railyard.  Covestro has a contract with Dow to use the Dow Massey Railyard to store chemical raw material and product railcars until they are needed in the Covestro South Charleston Plant or shipped to other destinations in the case of Polyol products.  \n\nACN is a raw material for making various grades of Polyether Polyols. Covestro stores railcars containing acrylonitrile (ACN) at the Dow Massey Railyard.  Our ACN suppliers own all of the ACN railcar fleet. Covestro owns the ACN material inside the ACN Railcar(s) once it is loaded into the railcars by the acrylonitrile supplier and exits their facility by purchasing agreement.  CSX delivers the ACN railcar(s) to the Massey Railyard for a typical storage period of 1 to 30 days.  Once CSX places the ACN Railcar(s) in the Massey Railyard, the ACN railcar(s) is no longer under active shipping papers.  Upon request from Covestro and Dow, CSX transfers the ACN Railcar(s) from Massey Railyard, through the CSX railroad property, onto the South Charleston Plant to the Covestro ACN unloading station within the South Charleston Plant.  The South Charleston Plant is owned by Dow and Covestro is a tenant at the facility. Covestro leases part of the South Charleston Plant for its operations and stores 8-15 ACN railcars at the Massey Railyard during a typical month.  The DOW Massey Yard is not required to be cove"

There are nine UTLX employees and no Covestro or DOW employees located at the DOW Massey Railyard.  \n\nIn summary the Covestro portion of DOW Massey Railyard has one (1) RMP listed toxic chemicals and no flammable chemicals. The RMP toxic chemical was modeled using worst case release parameters as a screening exercise to determine the distance to toxic endpoint.   \n\nc.  Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe South Charleston Plant complies with all elements of the EPA RMP Rule.  There are safety procedures, standard operation emergency procedures, accident investigations, hot work and line opening permits, extensive training programs, on-site emergency response teams, vessel inspection programs, and trained personnel both in the salaried and hourly workforce.  \n\nd.   Five Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no releases in the past five years with off-site consequences.  Since the initial implementation of the RMP rule there have been no offsite impacts from release of RMP chemicals from the DOW Massey Railyard. \n\ne.  Facility Emergency Response Program\n\nThe South Charleston Emergency Response System consists of volunteer emergency response teams from Covestro and the host company that work rotating shifts and straight days.  The goal is to have between 3 and 6 emergency squad members always available on shift and this group is supplemented by straight day people, call outs and the South Charleston Fire Department which is located within 1/2 miles of the facility.  The Covestro and host site emergency squad people receive approximately 16 to 24 hours of on-site training annually with some disciplines receiving off-site training as well in specialized subjects, such as fire fighting, rescue, incident command and Hazmat.
