INTRODUCTION\n\nThis Executive Summary briefly reviews the major elements of the Risk Management Plan as it pertains to Cordova - 3M Company.  We take seriously our safety, health, environmental, and regulatory responsibilities to our employees and to the community.  As an operating unit of 3M, we share in a tradition of environmental, health and safety responsibility going back through much of the company's history.  3M was an early pioneer in pollution prevention and created its environmental policy in 1975.  Since 1990, 3M has cut its worldwide volatile organic air emissions 92 percent, and releases to water 84 percent. \n\n\n2.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION and EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIt is our goal to prevent accidental releases of regulated and other materials through the proper design, installation, operation and maintenance of our manufacturing processes and the proper training of our employees.  If, despite our efforts, such a release should occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control the effects of the release until the Cordova Fire Department and/or other emergency response organizations arrive. We maintain an excellent working relationship with the emergency responders to ensure rapid and effective response. \n \n\n3.  THE STATIONARY SOURCE and THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nWe use two regulated substance at our facility in a quantity regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program.  3M employees are trained and experienced in working with these substances and 3M contributes to their safety by providing high quality manufacturing processes, equipment and maintenance programs. \n\nThe following regulated substances are used at Cordova - 3M Company:                                                                                   \n- Hydrogen Fluoride (HF), a non-f"

PROGRAM TO  PREVENT ACCIDENTAL RELEASES\n\nAt Cordova - 3M Company, we take great care to prevent accidents, including those not covered under the EPA's Risk Management Program.\n\nWe have programs in place to address accidental releases as required by EPA, Process Safety Management requirements from OSHA, and all notification requirements of EPA's Emergency Response and Community Right To Know regulations.\n\nSome of the process controls we have at Cordova - 3M Company are; vents, relief and check valves, scrubbers, manual and automatic shutoffs, interlocks, alarms and procedures, emergency power, grounding equipment, rupture disks, purge systems, recycled cooling water, refrigeration and, building air pressure to act as secondary containment.  Mitigation systems in use are: sprinkler systems, dikes, fire and blast walls, neutralization, deluge systems, fire hoses, water cannons, dilution fans, blowdown tanks, flame arrestors and emergency squad.  Additionally, we have process area detectors, roof cameras and fluoride monitors.\n \nBeyond government requirements, we have our own standards for continuously improving safety at our plant.  Following is a brief description of the steps we take to prevent accidental releases:\n\n   4.1 STORAGE VOLUME REDUCTION - At Cordova - 3M Company, we examine opportunities to reduce the volume of chemicals stored on our site, thereby reducing the potential impact of an accident involving those chemicals.\n\n    4.2  PROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION - At Cordova - 3M Company, we maintain a record of safety information that h"

The information is used in process training for employees and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.  The information is reviewed periodically for any appropriate improvements and updated as required.\n\n    4.3  PROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS - With the support of 3M specialists, we conduct comprehensive studies to ensure that potential hazards associated with certain hazardous processes are identified and controlled effectively.  A team of qualified personnel conducts these studies with expertise in engineering and process operations. These studies are revalidated at regular intervals of no more than five years or whenever significant changes are made in affected operations.  Findings from the hazard analysis are presented so that they can be addressed in a timely manner.\n\n    4.4 OPERATING PROCEDURES - To run our manufacturing processes safely, we maintain written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. \n\n    4.5 TRAINING - At Cordova - 3M Company, we have a comprehensive training program to ensure that employees who are operating hazardous processes understand and are well trained in the correct operating procedures.  Refresher training is provided. \n\n    4.6  MECHANICAL INTEGRITY - We conduct and document maintenance checks on hazardous process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes, but is not limited to; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and instrumentation, and pumps.
