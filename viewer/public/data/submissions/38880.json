The facility stores up to 1,279,985 pounds (lbs.) of \"regulated flammable substances\" contained within the NGL in a single process.  The flammable mixture includes a mixture of methane, ethane, propane, isobutane, N-butane, isopentane and N-pentane.\n\nProcess Controls are in place at the facility, to prevent or minimize an emergency release, including various automatic and manual shutoffs, alarms, vents, relief and check valves, excess flow devices, and grounding equipment.  In addition, the facilty is equipped with UV/IR detection and LEL/HAM (Hazardous Atmosphere Monitors).\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario was assumed to be the release of the total quantity of the 44,000 gallon propane bulk storage tank forming a vapor cloud within the lower and upper flammability limits which detonates.  For flammable substances, the endpoint is overpressure of 1 pound per square inch for vapor cloud explosions.  Under EPA requirements the WCS assumes weather conditions that allow the chemical to travel as far as possible, and further assumes that none of the facility's mechanical controls or safety systems are functioning.  Based on these assumptions, the WCS vapor cloud explosion could potentially effect nearby residences, commericial and industrial areas with an endpoint of 0.30 miles.  The process controls mentioned in the previous paragraph minimize the potential for the WCS to occur.  After reviewing all of the possible alternative case release scenarios a release involving a pool fire of flammable mixture from a ruture in a loading line pipe connected to the bulk storage tank was slected.  The alternative release scenario distance to endpoint for the above-describe release was calculated at 0.1 miles from the facility.\n\nThe facility complies with "
