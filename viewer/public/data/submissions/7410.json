These maintenance and inspection recorders are continuously revised by\n     the contractors in the event of equipment design modification and/or changes in standards of safe \n     operations.\n\n     The ammonia cold storage system components installed in accordance with all applicable existing laws,\n     ordinances, regulations, standards, and good engineering practices to the best knowledge of the\n     facility management.\n\n     A.  Ammonia Cold Storage System\n\n           1.  Passive Design Features that Minimize Risk of AHM Release\n\n                a.)  Pressure Relief Valves:\n                      As described in Section lll, Testing and Maintenance Schedule, Pressure relief valves are \n                      located on the receiver, compressor, and suction accumulators throughout the system.\n                      Additionally, all pressure relief valves are vented to a water diffusion system to prevent\n                      atmospheric release of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n                b.)  Mechanical Room Location:\n                       The mechanical room of the ammonia cold storage system is located at the back of the \n                       facility.  The room is enclosed and can only be accessed by the locked service  doors.\n                       These enclosures limites accessibilty to personnel and minimizes the possibility of impact\n                       or damage by careless equipment operation.\n\n    "

      "SummaryText": "            c.)  Cooling Coils and Evaporator Piping Location:\n                        The piping and all of the cooling coils are located above the bin storage room and packed\n                        box storage room, out of reach of all normal operational machinery minimizing the possibility\n                        of damage by careless equipment operation.\n\n                d.)  Ammonia Piping and Receiver Insulation:\n                       The system piping and receiver vessels are insulated to increase system efficiency and \n                        reduce the risk of system overpressure due to excessive heat gain.  Additionally, piping\n                        is located on the roof of the facility to minimize the posibilty of damage by routine equipment\n                        operation and to provide greater accessibility for maintenance and inspection.\n\n                e.)  Pressure Equalized Dump Trap:\n                      The system design incorporates a pressure equalized liquid ammonia dump trap that drains\n                      liquid ammonia from the main suction Accumulator, equalizes pressure with the high pressure\n                      receiver, then drains liquid ammonia by gravity back into the high pressure receiver.  This\n                      sub-system minimizes the possibilty of liquid ammonia reaching the compressor which may\n                      cause excessive wear and/or damage and subsequent release.\n\n \n           2.  Active Design Features that Minimizes Risk of AHM Release\n                \n                a.)  Compressor High Discharge Pressure Cut-Off Switch:\n                       Each compressor is equipped with a high discharge pressure switch which shuts down the \n                       compressor.  High discharge pressure could be caused by a condenser malfunction, \n                      non-condensable gases entrained in the system, or a closed valve in the compressor \n                      discharge line.

Liquid Level Controls in Accumulators:\n                       Solenoids valves controlled by float switches maintain the liquid level in the accumulators.\n                       When the liquid ammonia level in the accumulator is low, a liquid float switch opens the \n                       solenoid valves to establish ammonia flow into the accumulator.  When the ammonia level in\n                       the accumulator reaches operating capacity, the liquid level float switch de-energizes the\n                      solenoid valve which stops the ammonia flow.\n\n                c.)  Compressor Controls:\n                       In addition to the system control stated previously, the compressor is equipped with the \n                       following controls functions:\n \n                       1.)  Low suction pressure cut-off switch\n                       2.)  High discharge pressure cut-off switch\n                       3.)  Lubricating oil low pressure cut-off switch\n\n                d.)  Electonic System Controls:\n                      The entire system is computer monitored and controlled.  In the event that any operational\n                      parameter is exceeded, the control system identifies the severity of the fault, shuts down\n                      the relevant system component and notifies maintenance personnel on a 24 hour basis.  In\n                      the event of failure of the electronic control system, the system will shut down.  The entire \n                      system can be controlled and diagnosed via telephone and personal computer.\n           \n           3.)
