Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Dakota Plains Cooperative in Sanborn, North Dakota are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement the appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. We also coordinate our response efforts with the Sanborn City, ND, Fire Department, which provides additional emergency response information and expertise.\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled Our facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous ammonia stored in a 30,000-gallon tank, eight 1,450-gallon nurse tanks, and thirty-two 1,000-gallon nurse tanks at our facility in Sanborn, North Dakota (Figure 1).  The maximum amount stored is 62,560 gallons (321,933.8 pounds) at 85% standard maximum storage capacity including the capacity of the on-site nurse tanks.   The largest single storage vessel at our facility contains 131,223 pounds at 85% standard maximum storage capacity.\n\n  3.

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source:\n\nProcess Safety Information\nDakota Plains Cooperative maintains a detailed data base of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes (Appendix E).\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts routine, comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards that maybe associated with our processes are identified and controlled effectively.  Any findings from the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nDakota Plains Cooperative maintains written operating procedures to ensure that activities within our covered processes are conducted safely.  These procedures address various modes of operation; the information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to all operators involved in the processes (Appendix B).\n\nTraining\nDakota Plains Cooperative has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that all employees who are involved with operating processes and procedures are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nDakota Plains Cooperative conducts documented maintenance checks on process equipment to\nensure proper operation.  Maintenance checks are conducted by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Examples of process equipment that would receive maintenance checks include:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner (Appendix C).\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Dakota Plains Cooperative to manage changes in process\nchemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nDakota Plains Cooperative conducts compliance audits on a regular basis to determine whether the plan's provisions, set out under the 40 CFR part 68, are being implemented.  Any non-compliance issue discovered during the audit is promptly corrected.\n\nEmployee Participation\nDakota Plains Cooperative truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP, particularly information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\n  5. Five-year Accident History\nDakota Plains Cooperative has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, no accidental release has occurred during this period.\n\n  6. Emergency Response Plan\nDakota Plains Cooperative maintains a written emergency action plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan addresses all aspects of emergency response including first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, and in the event of an accidental release, Farmers Union Oil Company will contact local emergency response agencies and the public (Appendix A).
