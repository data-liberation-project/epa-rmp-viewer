Use of this guidance ensures that industry standards and common hazards associated with the ammonia refrigeration are considered and addressed. (See the Risk Management Plan, available from the Environmental Protection Agency, for details on the offsite impacts; due to National Security concerns, the U.S.\r\nGovernment has advised the regulated community not to disclose the actual numerical data in the Executive Summary.)\r\n\r\nThrough our PSM/RMP program, Giant Eagle American Seaway perpetually looks for improvements to ensure the safety of its covered process, its employees, the public, and the environment.  This program is designed to protect not only the facility and its employees, but everyone around the facility from potential ammonia incidents, releases, and exposure. Safety of the covered process is ensured through a combination of coordination and correspondence with local authorities and emergency planning committees, release prevention measures (inspections, operating procedures, preventive maintenance on ammonia-related equipment), substantial safety systems for the covered process and throughout the building, emergency action procedures, proper training, and a commitment to continued improvement and safety."

Emergency information is communicated to the local emergency planning committee and local emergency response personnel.\r\n- Incident Investigation: Covered process incidents are thoroughly investigated to determine the cause of the incident and identify and document suitable response actions to prevent future incidents.\r\n- Compliance Audits: Every 3 years, Giant Eagle examines the PSM/RMP and safety program in detailed to identify opportunities for improvement, as well as document recommended corrective actions and how each action is implemented.\r\n- Trade Secrets: Giant Eagle observes the requirement of trade secrets to ensure complete access to all relevant facility and process information, regardless of trade secret stat"

      "SummaryText": "Like most food storage facilities, Giant Eagle American Seaway uses anhydrous ammonia in our refrigeration system.  Ammonia is an optimal refrigerant for the refrigeration cycle.  Because of its moderate toxicity and flammability in higher concentrations, ammonia is considered a hazardous substance.\r\n\r\nGiant Eagle American Seaway is committed to maintaining a safe manufacturing operation for its employees, the surrounding community, and the environment. The covered process refrigeration system obeys all local building, fire, and industry-consensus codes and standards, as appropriate.  This covered process also complies with the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration Process Safety Management Standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and Environmental Protection Agency Risk Management Plan Standard (40 CFR Part 68).\r\n\r\nGiant Eagle's priority is to prevent and mitigate accidental releases of hazardous materials, instead of merely responding to incidents.  The PSM/RMP program includes elements that address:\r\n- Employee Participation: Involvement of affected employees in all appropriate facets of the PSM/RMP program.\r\n- Process Safety Information: Maintenance of current, accurate process system information, as well as information relating to the safety of ammonia so\r\nthat employees are knowledgeable and informed.\r\n- Process Hazards Analysis: Completion of detailed studies of Giant Eagle's specific refrigeration system to identify both the hazards and safeguards to mitigate and prevent the hazards from occurring.\r\n- Operating Procedures: Provision of written operating procedures to help employees stay within the intent and safe operating limits of the process equipment.\r\n- Mechanical Integrity (Maintenance and Quality Control): Established, comprehensive program of inspections and preventive maintenance to\r\nensure ongoing integrity of process equipment and to prevent mechanical failures from occurring.\r\n- Training: Employees are trained in safe operation and maintenance"
