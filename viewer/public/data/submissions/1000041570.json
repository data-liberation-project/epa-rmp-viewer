There is also a Vision of Zero initiative with the goal of achieving zero incidents of any kind--- zero injuries, zero accidental releases of chemicals, zero impact on its neighbors.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe Arch Rochester facility has had no chemical release incidents of risk management regulated chemicals that resulted in on site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage or had any off site impact in this five year period.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe facility maintains a comprehensive emergency response plan that is coordinated with the Monroe County emergency response plan.  The site's plan provides essential planning and training for effectively protecting the employees, the public, and the environment on an ongoing basis and during emergencies.  \r\n\r\nPLANNED SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS\r\n\r\nThe Arch Rochester facility is committed to the continual improvement of its safety and environmental programs and to the achievement of the Vision of Zero.  \r\n\r\n   +Enhanced incident investigation and root cause analysis/drill down and specific corrective actions to prevent reoccurance of any safety or environmental incident.\r\n   +Reporting, tracking near miss incidents and investigation/corrective actions for serious events.\r\n   +Increased physical observation/behavioral based safety observations to eliminate at risk employee and contractor behaviors.\r\n   +Enhanced contractor safety qualification/performance evaluation.\r\n\r\nCERTIFICATION\r\n\r\nThe undersigned certifies that to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, the information provided in this Risk Management Plan is true, accurate, and complete.\r\n\r\nSignature: James Bentinck-Smith\r\nTitle: Plant Manager\r\nDate: June 13, 2014"

      "SummaryText": "te release scenario for each toxic chemical handled.  The Arch Rochester facility handles one toxic chemical, chlorine, regulated by the EPA risk management regulation.  Chlorine is used as a raw material and is received in 90 ton railcars.  The maximum inventory of chlorine on site would be approximately 360,000 pounds. Arch does not handle any of the EPA listed flammable chemicals.\r\n\r\nFollowing are the worst case and alternate release scenarios for chlorine at the Arch Rochester facility.\r\n\r\nWORST CASE\r\n\r\nAs required by the EPA Risk Management regulation, the worst case is presumed to be a release from the largest vessel or container. For this site, the largest vessel is the railcar that the chlorine is received in.  Thus, using the assumptions required by the rule, the worst case release would be 180,000 pounds of chlorine released to air in a 10 minute period with a wind speed of 1.5m/sec.  \r\n\r\nArch has implemented many safety layers to ensure that such an out right failure of a railcar should not occur.  Examples include:\r\n\r\n   +Substantial construction of chlorine railcars per ASTM codes.\r\n   +Regular preventive maintainance of chlorine railcars and ancillary equipment.\r\n   +Excess flow valves installed on each car to minimize a release.\r\n   +Chlorine monitors in chlorine handling areas to give early warning of a releas.e\r\n   +Written operating procedures for handling and unloading railcars.\r\n   +Highly trained/certified operators that perform handling operations.\r\n\r\nALTERNATE RELEASE\r\n\r\nThe alternate release of chlorine assumes a leak and subsequent vaporization of chlorine from the 2-chloropyridine manufacturing process.  Therefore, the alternate release would be the entire contents of the chlorine process piping system released due to a piping or gasket failure.  This incident would result in a release of approximately 667 pounds of chlorine with the assumption that it would take eight minutes for the operator to be alerted by the chlorine monitor system an"

Introduction of a new chemical manufacturing process requires qualification/certification of both the physical plant and human factors/elements.  High standards are maintained throughout each stage to insure compliance with all applicable safety and environmental regulations.  This certification process is known as  Safety in Engineering, Technology, Constuction, and Operations or the SETCO process.\r\n\r\nAll of these elements work together to prevent accidents when handling chemicals. Arch is committed to provide a safe work place for its employees and a safe environment for its neighbors. Arch"
