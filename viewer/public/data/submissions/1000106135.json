The primary function of the Air Liquide Electronics U.S. LP (ALEUS) facility at 3322 Road N NE is to supply bulk gasses to our customer via pipeline on a 24 hour, 365-day basis. Bulk gasses other than hydrogen are inert and non-regulated by this program (nitrogen, argon). \n\nThe facility manufactures hydrogen by process of catalytic reformation.  During the process of manufacturing hydrogen, methane is combined with steam at high temperatures in a two-phase reaction to generate hydrogen and water. Hydrogen is stored in liquid form in stationary bulk tanks and transported in gaseous form via pipeline to the on-site customer.\n\nThe ALEUS stationary source located at 3322 Road N NE, includes two 2,673 cubic foot (20,000 US gallon) vacuum-insulated cryogenic, horizontal) tanks of liquefied hydrogen, two 4,000 cubic foot (30,000 US gallon (horizontal) tanks of hydrogen gas, and small amounts of hydrogen within the process vessels and piping.\n\nThe chemical specific accidental release and accident prevention steps are those used to mitigate risk from flammable gases. Employees are consulted and trained on the process using standard operating procedures. The equipment was des"

Documentation pertaining to the design of the process and recommended maintenance / integrity inspections are followed.\n\nProcess hazard analysis by HAZOP has been used to identify potential concerns and ensure mitigation to low levels of risk per ALEUS policy.\n\nWhen contractors are used on the site, rigorous selection and training specific to the site is performed to ensure potential hazards of contractors are mitigated.\n\nA hot work program in conjunction with a Safe Work Permit system is used to lower risk from hot work.  A Management of Change process is used for any alterations to the system.\n\nAn incident investigation process applied at multiple facilities in different geographic areas facilitates the timely review of all similar systems operated by Air Liquide ensuring identified risks are mitigated.\n\nAll employees are trained on the site\u0092s emergency action plan, which includes the assistance of the local fire department and the LEPC.\n\nAudits of the system are conducted periodically and a pre-startup review occurs prior to startup after any significant change.\n\nThis facility complies with the EPA accident prevention rule, the OSHA PSM standard, and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. The covered bulk tanks were designed / installed and is maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and Washington state law.\n\nIn addition, the Air Liquide Electronics U.S. LP (ALEUS) facility at 3322 Road N NE utilizes safety equipment such as:\n-\tGauges and internal piping to ensure the bulk tanks are operated at or below maximum allowable working pressure capacity\n-\tOverpressure relief valves for pressure vessels per ASME code\n-\tFail-closed emergency shut-off valves\n-\tRelief valves on compressor piping\n-\tProcess alarms and interlocks in the downstream processes, sensitive to: flows, steam to carbon ratios, pressures, temperatures, and levels\n-\tManual emergency shutdown system\n-\tNearby water cannons (commonly called monitors)\n-\tManual isolation valv"
