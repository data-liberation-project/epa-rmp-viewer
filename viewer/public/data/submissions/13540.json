Employees receive training in safety and operations as we strive to minimize the potential release of product due to human error.                                                             The facility is located on approximately one acre, one block west of our main offices,  contains the anhydrous ammonia storage tank, an oil storage shed and diked fuel storage.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, transferred and stored, and redistributed as a fertilizer to our farmer owners.  Our maximum quantity stored at any time is 120,000 pounds, or 14,380 gallons.                                                                   The worst case release scenario would be to have all the ammonia released from the tank and reaching a toxic endpoint of 200ppm at 1.10 miles from the storage tank.  As an alternative release scenario in the event of equipmentfailure, the amount of ammonia released before mitigation would reach a toxic endpoint of 200 ppm at .40 mile from the tank.  White River Cooperative has instituted procedures for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia as required by OSHA and the Indiana State Chemist.  We have not had a release resulting in any of the criteria stated in 40 CFR 68.42 within the last five years.  Our Emergency Response Plan is in place and has been reviewed with current employees and they have been trained in the procedures.  All new hires will receive this training prior to any exposure to ammonia.  Local agencies and emergency responders have received training in the hazards associated with responding to an anhydrous ammonia incident.  White River Cooperative has policies in regards to equipment maintenance and the handling and transportation of hazardous materials, including anhydrous ammonia.  We will utilize periodic inspections to maintain compliance and improve safety for all employees and th"
