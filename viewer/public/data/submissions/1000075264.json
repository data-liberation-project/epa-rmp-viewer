To ensure proper treatment of the wastewater prior to discharging to the savannah river, chlorine is injected into effluent flow to disinfect and kill pathogens that may be Present in the effluent flow. The disinfection feed rates varies from 100 lbs. per day to 700 lbs. per day, depending on the effluent quality and demand. The chlorine control system consists of four cylinder mounted vacuum regulators. These regulators will stop chlorine gas flow if there is a break in the vacuum system supply lines, mitigating offsite impact.\n\n\n\nThere are several chlorine leak detectors in the chlorine system located in the process area and storage site perimeters, when a chlorine leak is detected, the leak detectors activate visual and audible alarms to alert the plant personnel.\n\n\n\nResponsibilities:\n\nThe Treatment Administrator has overall responsibility for ensuring that the Process Management Plan is followed, reviewed and updated.\n\n\n\nThe Operation Superintendent will be responsible for Employee Involvement, Employee Training, Emergency Preparedness, Compliance Audits, Process Hazard Analysis, Management  Changes, Process Safety Information, and Operating Procedures and Practices.\n\n\n\nThe Maintenance Superintendent will be responsible for Contractors, Pre-startup Safety, Mechanical Integrity, Monthly Maintenance Scheduling and Non- routine Work Authorization.\n\n\n\nTo reduce the risk and magnitude of potential releases, written procedures for the safe handling and operation of the chlorination system have been implemented. \n\n\n\nIn addition, work performed on equipment subject to cause a release requires a minimum of two personnel; personnel are also required to wear a Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA)and/or air supplied via \"Breathing Air\" stations located at the chlorine tank area throughout the course of work associated with chlorination equipm"

Any major work performed on the chlorination system is limited to daytime only to reduce the possibility of a chlorine release and to ensure sufficient personnel are immediately available should a release occur. \n\n\n\nQuarterly Chlorine release drills are performed by management. In addition the City of Savannah's Fire Department's HAZMAT team visits the facility and assists in some drills. \n\n\n\nThe Savannah Fire Department Haz-mat division surveys the chlorine system and storage area annually. The Haz-Mat division is located about five minutes from the President Street WQCP."
