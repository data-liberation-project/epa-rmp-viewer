This philosophy involves ensuring each and every employee and contractor is accountable for their own safety, as well as that of the community around them.  The company adheres to all applicable federal, state, and local laws to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all. \nEmployees complete a thorough training program that enables them to address emergency issues as they arise.  This preparation includes standard operational, emergency operational, and release prevention training.  In addition, periodic refresher courses help to keep operators' problem-solving abilities up to date and in sync with our recurring safety improvements.  Regular internal audits provide an excellent checks and balances system for monitoring these high standards that we set.\nThe Contingency Plan which includes the Emergency Action Plan (EAP) includes specific instructions for employees and contract personnel to follow in the event of an accidental release.  Activation of this plan will place in motion a series of events specifically designed to minimize the impact of the release on employees, the surrounding community, and the environment.  As an integral part of the EAP, the Facility actively participates in the dome storage area mutual response group, Petal Dome Mutual Aid (PDMA).\nPDMA is made up of eight LP-Gas and natural gas facilities and transportation companies operating in the immediate area.  PDMA was established in the late 1970s, and along with the Forrest County Emergency Management District, Civil Defense, has successfully worked with the surrounding community emergency response agencies and local and state governmental agencies to provide efficient, timely response for emergency situations in any of the participating facilities.  \nThe Facility is located on the east side of U.S. Highway 11, north of Petal, Mississi"

The facility consists of eight (8) 30,000-gallon liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), two (2) 42,000-gallon LPG storage tanks and one (1) 2,500-gallon propane tank, truck and rail loading/unloading stations, and related pumps, compressors, valves and piping.  Propane, butane and the flammable gas mixtures (LPG ) are the regulated substances processed, handled and stored in this process.  In addition to the fixed tanks on site a maximum of 18 full rail rail may be on site for offloading with a maximum capacity of 30,000 gallons each.  Potassium hydroxide, a corrosive material is used in the onsite treater towers which is used intermittently to process either propane or butane in an amount greater than ten thousand (10,000) pounds.  Once exhausted the disposal of the caustic is a large enough quantity that the site is deemed a large quantity generator.   The Facility is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation.  \nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMP) is to provide information about operations at the Facility, the programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, the emergency response plans in case an accidental release should occur, five (5) year accident history, and planned changes to improve safety at the Facility.\n\nSeveral mitigation measures are in place to greatly reduce the chance that such an event could ever occur.  Essentially, the facility complies with the EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes/regulations.  This flammable gas facility is designed, installed and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state laws.  Also, the Petal facility has in place an active SPCC plan developed in accordance with 40 CFR 112.7 and a Process Safety Management program in accordance with CFR 29 1910.119.\nPotential flammable gas releases have been reviewed with our employees and with local emerg"

Because the processes at the plant are regulated by the EPA's RMP regulation and are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the Accident Prevention Program.\n\nEmployee Participation\nActive employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the Facility's PSM program are important steps toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals.  Employee involvement will help to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are implemented.  Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues.  The Facility strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs.  These programs include regularly scheduled multi-terminal safety meetings which are made up of a cross section of employees and supervision, tail-gate safety meetings, participation/representation at the PDMA meetings, and special training programs (Emergency Response Training, First Aid, etc.).  \n\nProcess Safety Information\nComplete and accurate written process safety information concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to an effective PSM and RMP program and to completing and maintaining a Process Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (PFMEA).  Process safety information is useful to the operators, the team performing the PFMEA, those in charge of training, contractors, those conducting pre-startup safety reviews, and those in cha"

The Facility keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The NGL Supply Engineering Department is assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  The reference documents and their location are readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.  Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns, and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the Facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition). The Facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).  The Facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as evaluating proposed changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (PFMEA)\nThe Facility has a comprehensive program to help"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  The Facility primarily uses the PFMEA method to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.    Implementation of mitigation options in response to PFMEA findings is guided by a relative risk ranking assigned by the PFMEA team.  All approved mitigation options in response to PFMEA team findings are tracked until they are completed.    Reviews are conducted at least every five (5) years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  \n\nOperating Procedures\nThe Facility maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process.  These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.  Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.

New employees receive basic training in Facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every three (3) years.  This training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\nThe Facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules, and (6) inform Facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. \n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\nThe Facility conducts a PSSR on any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.

The PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.  \n\nMechanical Integrity\nThe Facility has well-established practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment.  The basic aspects of this program include (1) training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting equipment deficiencies when identified, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.  The Terminal does not have its own Maintenance personnel but relies on established contractors.  The contractors receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency action plan, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they perform their jobs in a safe manner.  Scheduled preventive maintenance helps ensure that work is performed in a timely and consistent manner.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or facility management will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.  Another integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Facility incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment"

Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping and equipment are opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\nThe Facility has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation \nThe Facility promptly investigates all incidents that result in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to gather the facts, determine the root cause, and develop corrective action to prevent the reoccurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The invest"

Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until completed. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five (5) years, so that the reports can be reviewed during future PFMEA revalidations.\n\nCompliance Audits\nTo help ensure that the Accident Prevention Program is functioning properly, the Facility periodically conducts audits to determine whether procedures and practices required by the Accident Prevention Program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three (3) years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Facility management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's finding are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two (2) most recent audit reports are retained.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nNo incident resulting in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage has occurred at the Facility within the last five (5) years.  Although the company takes pride in that record, we place daily emphasis on our prevention and safety programs to reduce the risk of accidents and ensure this record continues.  \n\nEMERGENCY ACTION PLAN INFORMATION\nThe Facility maintains a written EAP within their Contingency Plan, which is in place to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment.
