The treatment plant is located approximately 1.75 miles NE of\r\nthe community.\r\n  \r\n  Its six man staff operates a superpulsator surface water treatment plant under the guidelines of\r\nthe Iowa\r\n  Department of Natural Resources. The process treatment flow is as follows:\r\n  \r\n  Oxidation using Potassium Permanganate & Chlorine Dioxide utilizing a baffled mixing,\r\ndetention tank.\r\n  \r\n  Flocculation and sedimentation using PAC and polymers for floc formation utilizing both rapid\r\nand slow\r\n  mixers and two superpulsator up flow clarifiers.\r\n  \r\n  Filtration using a dual bed sand and carbon filter. The GAC helps with removal of inorganics,\r\nfarm chemicals,\r\n  taste & odor precursors.\r\n  \r\n  Following filtration sodium hydroxide (caustic soda) is added to adjust the pH to control\r\ncorrosion in the\r\n  distributio"
