The program includes Classroom, OJT, and computer-based training. Employees are tested to demonstrate competency.\n\nManagement of Change: Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  \n\nIncident Investigation:  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts concerning an incident or near miss and to develop corrective actions to prevent recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  \n\nCompliance Audits: Audits are conducted on a regular basis to ensure that the facility is in compliance with applicable RMP / PSM / SIP procedures and regulations. \n\nFive-year Accident History:\n\nThe Markham Gas Processing Plant has experienced one release in the last five years.  The accident involved a spill of approximately 200 gallons (~1050 lbs) of natural gas condensate.  The condensate did not leave the plant boundaries and no offsite injuries were related to the accident.  \n\nEmergency Response Program Information:\n\nThe Markham Gas Processing Plant maintains a written emergency response program to protect employees, contractors, public and the environment from hazards associated with accidental releases of regulated substances. The program consists of procedures for responding to releases of regulated substances, including the possibility of associated fires or explosions. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, if a rele"

The program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the gas plant processes.  Emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process. The overall emergency response program for the Markham Gas Processing Plant is coordinated with the Matagorda County Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes attending periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials and industry representatives.  The Markham Gas Processing Plant has 24-hour communications capability with the Matagorda County LEPC. The Plant conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nIn response to the most recent Process Hazard Analysis, the Markham Gas Processing Plant is verifying the adequacy of existing safety equipment and installing new safeguards wherever necessary."

      "SummaryText": "Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nThe employees at the Markham Gas Processing Plant are strongly committed to EMPLOYEE, PUBLIC, and ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY.  The commitment is demonstrated by conforming to our Process Safety Management program and various resources invested in accident prevention. Mock emergency drills are conducted monthly and specific training of our personnel is required in order to eliminate the occurrence of possible hazards.  These goals are achieved with every project design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement the appropriate controls to prevent any possible release of our regulated substances to the surrounding public domains, waterways and/or animal habitats.  The Emergency Response Plan (ERP) utilized at the Markham Gas Processing Plant includes designated procedures mandated by the Williams management group.  These specific procedures are for notification of agencies, evacuation of public receptors and response of trained personnel to control and contain a release.\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated substances:\n\nThe Markham Gas Processing Plant processes raw natural gas into pure methane, ethane, propane, and other natural gas liquids. The raw material is received by pipeline and the finished product is transported by pipeline.\n\nMaximum inventory quantities of regulated substances in the facility are:\n\nMethane     44,000 lbs                Butanes     19,000 lbs\nEthane       37,000 lbs                Pentanes    16,000 lbs\nPropane     26,000 lbs\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\nThe Markham Gas Processing Plant has implemented all the elements of a Program 3 Risk Management Plan (RMP) and all the elements of OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management (PSM) program. The plant has also implanted all the elements of Williams Midstream\u00bfs System Integrity Plan (SIP), which contains additional environmental, health, and safety standards. Key element of these pr"
