With the exception of some minor modifications this 650 ton per day of glass production facility operates as originally started up in 1975.  The only 112r listed material stores at the facility in quantities above trigger levels is sulfur dioxide which is received in low pressure one (1) ton cylinders (Maximum of six (6) cylinders).  AFG also utilizes 150  pound cylinders of sulfur dioxide for another portion of the process.  The maximum number of 150 pound cylinders of sulfur dioxide on site is four (4).   No flammables or below threshold 112r materials have the potential to travel to an endpoint beyond the plant boundary (460)  feet from storage area to plant boundary) under winds of 1.5 meters/second.\nFor the Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) which would be released as a gas, the endpoint for a worst case scenario  under winds of 1.5 meters/second with two (2) entire 2000 lb. cylinders released over a ten minute period is 3.1 miles. The alternate scenario is a release of 60 pounds over a one hour period.  Sixty pounds per hour is the most gas, which can be released as the result of a failure of the regulator for the cylinder or the piping between the cylinder and the manifold.  A sixty (60) pounds per hour release has a end point of <0.1 miles from the source and therefore will not result as an off site impact.  The nearest residential area is 0.8 miles from the plant boundary with no schools, churches, other commercial operations or government owned facilities within 1.5 miles of the facility.\nThe facility has developed and tested the SO2 cylinder handling and SO2 gas application system standard operating procedures.  The adherence to these procedures makes any release very unlikely.  There have never been more than a few pounds of SO2 released since placed in service at the plant.  These minor releases result from cyl"

If AFG is not successful in isolating the release point, the sulfur dioxide supplier will perform the isolation/repair."
