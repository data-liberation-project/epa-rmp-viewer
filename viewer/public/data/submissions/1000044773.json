Health, safety, and the protection of the working environment are the direct responsibility of management, and consequently form an integral part of the duties of all Managers and Supervisors.

Outokumpu is committed to compliance with all statutory obligations concerning health, safety, and the working environment, which apply in each country of operation.\r\n\r\nOutokumpu produces hot rolled stainless steel plate. Stainless steel plate is received as either direct to gauge or cogg plate.  The cogg plate is cut on a hydraulic shear into lengths ranging from 50 to 490 inches, depending on the order.  The rolled finished s of the cog plate range from 3/16 to 6 inches thick up to 120 in"

      "SummaryText": "ches wide and 420 inches long.  The cut cogg plate is then heated in natural gas fired furnaces and rolled to finish gauge.  The rolling process can require heating of the coggs up to three times before reaching finished gauge.  After rolling, the plates are annealed to improve the internal structure of the plate.  The plates then move to the finishing department.  The plates are shotblasted to remove the scale, oxidized steel, that forms on the surface during annealing.  The plates are then flattened and cut to their final length and width.  The next process for the plates is pickling followed by final inspection and placement in the warehouse for shipment to customers.  The processes of concern are two (2)6,500 gallon above ground storage tanks (ASTs) containing a 70% solution of Hydrofluoric Acid.  This acid is used in the pickling operation.  Plates are placed in the acid to assist in removing scale oxidation from the steel surface.  Outokumpu has identified a worst-case scenario for the hydrofluoric acid AST vessel that involves the release of all of the hydrofluoric acid over a 10 minute period (67,681 lbs).  The AST is equipped with high-level alarms, double-walls with interstitial monitoring equipment and alarms, manual and automatic shut off valves, pressure relief valve, and is located in a concrete containment area.  The alternative scenario for Outokumpu is for the vessel to leak due to a puncture from facility equipment.  It was estimated that a puncture of 4 inches would occur with the liquid column height above the puncture at six (6) feet.  If this alternative scenario occurred, 67,600 lbs. of hydrofluoric acid would be released at a rate of 196 gallons per minute.   \r\n\r\nOutokumpu Employees are trained in proper handling of Hydrofluoric Acid.  If a spill should occur, the emergency coordinator for Outokumpu will contact the local police department, New Castle Police Department, to report the spill.

If harmful vapors are released, the emergency coordinator shall notify the local authorities of this condition and will help advise or evacuate persons downwind from the site as necessary.  Outokumpu has a training program to ensure that all facility personnel are familiar with the proper handling of hazardous material emergencies by familiarizing them with emergency procedures, emergency equipment procedures, emergency equipment, and emergency systems."
