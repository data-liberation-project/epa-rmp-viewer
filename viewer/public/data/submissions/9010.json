BOX 153\nSPEERY, IOWA 52650\nNEW LONDON FARMERS COOP LOCATION\n \nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:  DANIEL ANLIKER, MGR.\n\n1.  THE FACILITY POLICY\n\n     The owners, management, and employees of the CENNEX/LOL AG.CO. are committed to\n      the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should\n      occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities,  to mitigate\n      any release and minimize the impact of the to people and the environment.\n\n2. FACILITY INFORMATION\n    \n     The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\n     Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application by the farmer or \n     custom application by the cooperative.  And for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop\n      production nutrients,\n\n     The maximum quantity stored would be 61,800 pounds in one 12,000 gallon storage tank.  We do \n     not receive anhydrous by rail.\n\n3. THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\n\n     The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released\n      as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would  52,530  pounds, which represents\n     the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to\n     the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.84 miles.\n\n     The alternative release scenario based  on the most likely potential incident of a release from a break  \n     in  transfer hose.  The distance the endpoint is .68 miles.\n\n4. THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM.\n\n     The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of\n     Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by  The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the\n     standards of the U."

THE FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n     There have been no accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused\n     any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted   \n     in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.   THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM.\n\n      THE FACILITY HAS:\n\n      a.    A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CRF 1910.38;\n             The plan was written by Regulator Consultants, Inc., Horton, KS.\n\n      b.     Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know\n              information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA)\n\n      c.     A written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29, CFR 1910.120\n              including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n\n7.    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n       Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to \n       assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia\n       safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\n \n                                                                                 \n     "
