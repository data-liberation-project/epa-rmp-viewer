Johanna Foods, Inc. has operated its ammonia refrigeration system following its RMP Program. The RMP Program was developed in 1991 to comply with New Jersey's Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act. The Standard Operating Procedures, Preventative Maintenance Program, Management of Change Program, Emergency Response Plan, and other elements of the RMP Program have developed over the years to further improve the safety, reliability, and risk reduction of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\n                      Johanna Foods, Inc.\n\n\n\n     Johanna Foods, Inc. has three production plants on one site. The Juice Plant packages chilled juice products in half gallon, quart and pint paper containers that require refrigeration for processing and storage. The Aseptic Plant packages juice products in Brik Pak containers (drink boxes) in a variety of sizes and flavors that requires refrigeration for processing but not for storage. The Yogurt Plant packages yogurt products in cup containers of various sizes, styles, and flavors that require refrigeration for processing and storage. Anhydrous ammonia is the regulated chemical that is used as the refrigerant. The quantity of anhydrous ammonia contained in the refrigeration system  on site varies up to 65,000 pounds. The anhydrous ammonia is not consumed or produced by the refrigeration system. The refrigeration system circulates the anhydrous ammonia converting it from a liquid to a vapor to create cooling, then condensing the vapor back to a liquid to be used again. \n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention\n\n\n\n     Johanna Foods, Inc. has operated its ammonia refrigeration system following its RMP\n\nProgram developed in 1991 to comply with New Jersey's Toxic Cat"

All equipment is checked daily using checksheets from the S.O.P.'s Steady State\n\nOperations section. The Preventative Maintenance Program requires checksheets to inspect all\n\nrefrigeration equipment in greater detail every six months, yearly testing of all safety\n\ninterlocks and controls, and a five year schedule to replace safety relief valves. Any\n\nmodification to the system is performed following the Management of Change Program. The\n\nM.O.C. requires a dispersion analysis to determine if the change could cause offsite impact or\n\nnot. Offsite impact would result in performing a risk assessment of the change to identify all\n\nhazards and items to further reduce the risk of a release. All EHS operators are trained in all\n\naspects of the RMP and annual refresher training is performed high lighting any changes to\n\nprocedures or equipment.\n\n\n\n                   Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\n     There have been no reportable accidents.\n\n\n\n                    Emergency Response Plan\n\n  \n\n     Johanna Foods, Inc. has an Emergency Response Plan that addresses emergency situations including an anhydrous ammonia release. This description will address procedures for an\n\nanhydrous ammonia release. There are procedures to follow for anyone who discovers a potential release to notify the Johanna Foods, Inc. guard shack. The guard would notify an EHS operator,\n\nby radio, to investigate the potential release. If the EHS operator finds a release he sounds the ammonia release evacuation alarm that sounds in the effected area. The site personnel evacuate the area, lead by an Evacuation Coordinator (EVC), who upon meeting at the designated evacuation area, conducts a headcount. The guard also follows procedures to notify the Emergency Response Coordinator (ERC), or an alternate, to command the Emergency Response Team (ERT). The ERT members at the effected area do"

The ERC radios the EVC by radio for the result of the headcount and informs the response team of any missing personnel to search for. The ERC follows the Emergency Response Plan which\n\nincludes procedures on how to contact local emergency responders such as police, fire department, rescue squad, and LEPC. Once all personnel are accounted for the EHS operators of the ERT start to isolate the release and monitor the area. The ERT is made up of EHS operators, production operators who have first aid training, and various maintenance personnel to assist in an emergency. Site personnel are trained annually on the evacuation procedures. The ERT is trained annually on the procedures of the Emergency Response Plan and the use of Emergency Response Equipment. One rollout drill is conducted per year.\n\n\n\n       Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\n     Johanna Foods, Inc. follows the RMP to maintain the refrigeration system in a safe manner. Any additions to the system are performed using the Management of Change procedure to ensure that all new equipment is installed in the safest configuration. The five year Risk Assessments also analysis all equipment and procedures to ensure that all actions are taken to reduce the risk of any accidental releases."
