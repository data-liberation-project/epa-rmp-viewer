The bleached pulp portion uses a kraft pulping process and supplies fiber to the fine paper manufacturing facility as well as manufacturing baled market pulp.

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\n\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\n\n\nThis scenario assumes the rupture of a full, 140,000 gallon tank containing a 1% chlorine dioxide solution and the vaporization of the released solution.  The tank has dikes present to mitigate the extent of the release.  The model suggests the off site consequences would be in the area defined by a circle with the radius of 4.78 miles from the source (mill).\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\n\n\nThe scenario assumes a 1% chlorine dioxide solution process pipe leak.  This leak results in the release of the contents of an eight (8) inch pipe, 250 feet in length.  The scenario assumes no mitigation, and a release of 55 pounds of chlorine dioxide that is vapoized from the liquid release.  The models suggests the area impacted by the off site consequences would be defined by a circle with the diameter of 1.3 miles from the release site (mill).\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n\n\n* Process safety information\n\n* Process hazard analysis\n\n* Operating procedures\n\n* Training\n\n* Mechanical integrity\n\n* Management of change\n\n* Pre-startup review\n\n* Compliance audits\n\n* Incident investigation\n\n* Employee participation\n\n* Hot work permit\n\n* Contractors\n\n\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.

The following is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five years:\n\n\n\n2/21/07  Approximately 312 gallons of chlorine dioxide solution was released as a result of a contractor vacuum truck backing into and breaking a line supplying chlorine dioxide solution to the sand filter and paper machine areas.  The spill was contained and neutralized with thiosulfate in the secondary containment structure.  The process was shutdown and the line repaired. Approximately 1.45 lbs volatilized into the atmosphere.\n\n\n\n9/9/11 At approximately 7:50 am, an employee entered a restricted area while responding to a plant wide power outage.  While in the restricted area, a chlorine dioxide gas release occurred that exposed the employee to chlorine dioxide gas (less than 1 pound released).  The employee was hospitalized for 24 hours as a precautionary measure.  As a result of the incident, the standard operating procedure (SOP) was revised regarding PPE required for employees in the restricted area during and while responding to plant wide power outages or upset conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of Accidental Chemical Releases\n\n\n\n2007  one (1) accidental release\n\n2011  one (1) accidental release\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the community emergency response plan.  \n"
