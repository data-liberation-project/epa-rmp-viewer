Executive Summary\r\n\r\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\r\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\r\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR \u00a768\r\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR \u00a75189\r\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.119\r\n\r\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\r\n\r\nThis program is intended to be a living document. As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Sun Valley Packing has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \r\n\r\n1.1 Sun Valley Packing, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\r\n\r\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Sun Valley Packing has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following process which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \r\n\r\nProcess Name           | Process Chemical           | Process Quantity(lbs.)\r\nAmmonia Refrigeration    Anhydrous Ammonia            41,000\r\n\r\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses and physical property damage.\r\n\r\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.

In this system, high pressure liquid from the two (2) high pressure receivers is piped to multiple accumulators. Each accumulator is equipped with an expansion valve which expands the high pressure liquid into a low temperature and pressure liquid as it enters the accumulator. Each accumulator feeds bunker mounted or ceiling suspended evaporator coils located throughout the facility. The evaporators contain a set of continuous coils through which the low pressure liquid flows. Due to the low pressures and temperatures maintained in the evaporator, the liquid refrigerant absorbs a great deal of heat from the surrounding area and evaporates. To increase the rate of heat removed, the evaporator uses an electric fan to move warm air over the coils of cold liquid ammonia. Once the liquid has evaporated to form low temperature and pressure vapor, it travels back to the accumulators, through a suction return line, and into the two (2) main suction accumulators. Any remaining liquid falls to the bottom of the vessels and is fed by gravity into the transfer vessel. Inside the transfer vessel, the liquid rises in"

From the main suction accumulators, the remaining low pressure vapor is piped to the suction inlet on the reciprocating and screw compressors.\r\n \r\nThe system also includes direct expansion (DX) ceiling suspended evaporator coils. In DX evaporators, high pressure liquid is supplied from the high pressure receivers directly to the evaporators. Each evaporator is equipped with an expansion valve which reduces the pressure and temperature of the liquid as it enters the evaporators. Once the liquid has evaporated to form low temperature and pressure vapor, it exits the evaporators and is returned to the main suction accumulators.\r\n\r\nThe compressors compress the low pressure vapor, and it exits through the discharge outlet as a high pressure and high temperature vapor. The vapor is then sent to evaporative condensers where it is cooled and liquefied. The condensers use air and water to cool the warm ammonia as it passes through a series of tubes within the condensers. As the cooling medium of air and water draws the heat from the vapor, the refrigerant condenses into a liquid and flows to the high pressure receivers. The receivers serve as a holding tank for the liquid refrigerant being fed to the low side, and holds the bulk of the refrigerant in the system when it is not operating.  \r\n \r\nSafety Systems\r\n\r\nOne (1) ammonia detector is installed inside Machinery Room 2. The sensor is set at the California OSHA permissible exposure limit of 25 ppm and will activate an audible alarm and strobe outside the machinery room.  \r\n\r\nMachinery Rooms 1 and 2 are equipped with a roof-mounted emergency ventilation fan. The emergency ventilation system can be controlled manually by the ON/OFF switch located outside the secondary door to Machinery Room 1. Additionally, the speed of the fan can be controlled via a dial located next to the ventilation switch.\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Control Box was installed in a"

Each reciprocating compressor has numerous safety devices to protect the compressor and the associated equipment. All ASME vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves. The high side of each system relieves at 250 psig while the low side of each system relieves at 150 psig. All pressure relief valves vent to the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe two (2) main suction accumulators are each equipped with a high level float switch that is wired to shut down the compressors in the event of a high level situation. This prevents liquid ammonia from entering the compressors.\r\n \r\nProcess Classification\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at Sun Valley Packing consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping.

These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \r\n\r\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\r\n\r\nSun Valley Packing has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\r\n\r\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\r\n\r\nSun Valley Packing's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\r\n- California Emergency Action Plan - Title 8 CCR \u00a73220\r\n- Federal Emergency Action Plan - Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.38 \r\n- California Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) - Title 8 CCR Title 8 \u00a75192(q)\r\n- Federal Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) - Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.120(q)\r\n\r\nStrategically, we will respond minimally to a release.

Nevertheless, Sun Valley Packing continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\r\n\r\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Sun Valley Packing's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Sun Valley Packing's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\r\n\r\nSun Valley Packing has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\r\n\r\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Sun Valley Packing has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\r\n\r\nFor the future, Sun Valley Packing now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a living document. It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Sun Valley Packing employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Sun Valley Packing will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety."
