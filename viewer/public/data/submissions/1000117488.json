      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nAccidental Response Program and Emergency Response Policies\nAll State prepared the RMP to satisfy regulatory requirements for anhydrous ammonia refrigeration processes at the facility. In the unlikely event that a chemical release does occur at the facility, All State personnel are trained in the appropriate measures for notifying emergency response agencies of the situation. All State relies on emergency services provided by the Mokelumne Fire Department and other emergency responders in the event of an emergency. All State will continue to improve safety through the implementation of the prevention program elements of their RMP.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\nAll State is located at 6011 East Pine Street in Lodi, California. The facility is approximately 0.87 miles east of State Highway 99 and 260 yards south of state Highway 12. The facility is located in an area of Lodi zoned for agriculture, commercial and industrial use. The properties along East Pine Street are predominantly low-density residential housing, commercial, orchards and farmland. All State processes, stores, packages and ships fruit primarily cherries and pears. The facility NAICS code is 115114 (SIC 0723) Post Harvest Crop Activities (except Cotton Ginning). Anhydrous ammonia is used in the facility\u0092s refrigeration systems. The All State Packers refrigeration system contains an ammonia inventory of approximately 13,750 pounds. The Rivermaid Trading system contains approximately 15,470 pounds of ammonia. Both the All State and Rivermaid systems provide cooling to the cold storage rooms and hydrocooler units. \n\nRelease Prevention Program\nAll State has incorporated safety features in the ammonia refrigeration systems to prevent system or process failures and to mitigate potential releases. The predominant safety concern with closed-loop ammonia systems is an inadvertent buildup of pressure exceeding pressure ratings or capacities of equipment due to ammonia expansion."

      "SummaryText": "The All State ammonia systems are continuously monitored by automated control systems that shut down components if deviations from normal operating conditions occur. Further, the systems are equipped with pressure relief valves (PRVs) on pressure vessels that discharge to a diffusion tank.\n\nAll State implements administrative controls in place to maintain safe operation of the refrigeration systems that include programs for process safety information, operating procedures, training, emergency actions, hot work, lockout/tagout, contractor safety, incident investigation, mechanical integrity, management of change, pre startup safety review and compliance audits.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nNo reportable release of ammonia have occurred during the past 5 years from the All State facility.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nAll State has a written an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that covers hazardous material releases. All State employees will not respond to ammonia or methyl bromide releases but will evacuate personnel to designated assembly points and wait for emergency responders to arrive. All State will rely on outside responders from the Mokelumne Rural Fire District and the San Joaquin County HazMat Team for mitigation of releases. The EAP details the steps for required notification of outside agencies that notify the public and states that the All State Emergency Coordinator will be in charge until such time as an outside responding agency assumes the Incident Command role. All State management will oversee evacuation and remain in control until Mokelumne Rural Fire District personnel arrive, then Incident Command will be assumed by the senior Mokelumne Rural Fire District official at the scene. The Mokelumne Rural Fire District Incident Commander will be responsible for issuing notices for public evacuation and/or sheltering in place, if necessary. All State management will be responsible for making initial contact with Mokelumne Rural Fire District via 9-1-1; San Joa"

      "SummaryText": "quin County Environmental Health Department; California Office of Emergency Services, National Response Center for significant accidental releases. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nChanges to improve safety at the facility are ongoing. The recommendations suggested by the process hazard analysis (PHA) revalidation team in December 2020 and January 2021 to improve safety include:\n\u0095\tImproving interlocks for hydrocoolers and heat exchangers;\n\u0095\tImproving cutout testing records;\n\u0095\tUpdating operating procedures; and\n\u0095\tUpgrading compressor control panels.\n\nAll State recognizes that the RMP is a continuous process for evaluating, monitoring, and improving anhydrous ammonia handling operations at its facility. As such, this document and related attachments and program elements will evolve as All State continues their ongoing focus and dedication of risk minimization and safety improvement for their employees and surrounding community. All State will submit revised information if a change occurs that is considered significant and requires resubmission under the regulations. However, minor improvements/modifications to the RMP, related attachments, and program elements will be incorporated consistent with All State internal review practices, and All State will maintain the most current versions onsite. Thus, the most current version RMP and related documents and elements maintained onsite may vary slightly from the information in submittals made to EPA and other regulatory agencies."
