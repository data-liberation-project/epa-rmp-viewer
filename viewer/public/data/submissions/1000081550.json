It is our belief that those things that contribute to safe operations also improve quality and reduce costs.   This commitment to safety can be seen in the investment of resources made for accident prevention.   These efforts include employee training and a systematic approach to safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.   Our policy is to implement effective controls to prevent foreseeable releases of dangerous substances.  To supplement these controls, additional safeguards are provided to reduce the impact of a release should one occur in spite of all precautions.   Plant employees and managers are trained to take appropriate action in an emergency to protect the welfare of the public, our employees and the surrounding environment.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Fort Worth Plant is a specialty surfactant manufacturing facility located at 611 East Northside Drive in Fort Worth, Texas.  The plant is situated on approximately 5 acres in north Fort Worth.  The immediate area surrounding this plant is natural gas wellhead to the north, industrial development including Ferro Corporation and residential zoned areas lie to the west, commercial/residential-zoned areas to the south, and the Trinity River to the east.\r\n\r\nSpecialty surfactant manufacturing has been conducted at this location since 1974.  This facility makes a variety of specialty surfactants that are used in industrial and agricultural applications throughout the world.  The plant is operated 24 hours per day, seven days per week.

This product was first produced in 1978 and has remained a leader in the dispersants market to this day.    A variation of this product using a more heavily condensed feedstock is also produced and offered to niche markets where its special performance characteristics meet particular needs in the agriculture and crop protection sectors.  Both product's manufacture are carried out in two reactors vessels especially suited for this type of operation.    The finished products are  water-based surfactants with highly efficient dispersant properties.   Specific applications include agricultural product formulations to retard sedimentation of water dispersible granules such as herbicides, insecticides, and fungicides.    \r\n\r\nIn the same unit, formaldehyde is diluted in water to a concentration less than 1% and blended with another water based surfactant to abate an unusually strong odor.    These uses and process areas were identified during either during the initial evaluation of this facility's inventory of raw materials, finished products, and process intermediates or have been noted subsequent to that evaluation.   The facility's use of regulated substances in a process equal to or greater than the listed threshold quantities are listed below.  The processes themselves use relatively small quantities of formaldehyde but are subject to regulation due to their connection to the larger storage tank.

Applicable checklists are used to verify various aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of equipment fabrication and installation, and serves to assure that other accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\r\n\r\n     Mechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nThe Fort Worth Plant assures the mechanical integrity of critical operations equipment such as pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and safety systems through its mechanical integrity program.   The basic aspects of the program include:  (1) training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\r\n\r\nMaintenance personnel receive training in (1) overviews of the process and its hazards, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and 5) safe work practices to help ensure that they perform their jobs in a safe manner.  Equipment deficiencies, once identified, are corrected prior to further operation of the equipment, or a management team will determine and prescribe what how the equipment may continue safely in operation.\r\n\r\nAs part of the mechanical integrity program, quality assurance measures are incorporated into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper material and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\r\n\r\n     Safe Work Practices\r\nThe Fort Worth Plant employs widely accepted safety work practices and incorporate eight (8) Life Saving Rules into these Life Critical Procedures.   These safe work practices used include (1) lockout procedures for control of hazar"

These procedures are used by all personnel involved in both user and non-user maintenance activities.\r\n\r\n     Management of Change\r\n\r\nThe site's management of change program is intended to review and evaluate changes to process chemistry, operating conditions or limits, equipment, and procedures before changes are made so as to prevent unexpected adverse impacts.    The management of change program uses a quantitative risk assessment to determine the significance of the change.   This risk level assessment determines the levels of authorization required to approve the action.   Design review checklists are used to evaluate different types of changes to prevent new hazards being created or equipment changes which are not suited to the service as it exists in the process.   Another feature of the management of change program is that is verifies and documents that procedures, records and equipment information are updated and that personnel affected by the change are informed of and trained in the change.\r\n\r\n     Incident Investigation\r\n\r\nAll incidents that result in, or could have reasonably resulted in, a release of a hazardous material, a fire or explosion in a covered process area, major property damage, adverse environmental impact, or serious personal injury be reported and promptly investigated.  By investigating accidents and near misses, important lessons are learned.   Corrective actions can then be implemented to prevent similar events in the future.   Incident investigations are documented and recommendations tracked to their completion.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years to facilitate their use during PHA updates and revalidation.\r\n\r\n     C"

      "SummaryText": "ompliance Audits\r\n\r\nTo assure that the goals of the accident prevention programs are met, program performance is periodically evaluated in the form of compliance audits.   An audit team reviews records and documents to determine the degree of program compliance.  Compliance audits will be conducted at least every 3 years.   Audit team findings are documented and presented to plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to audit findings are tracked until they are complete.   The two most recent audit reports are retained.\r\n\r\n     Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe risks associated with this process described earlier in this executive summary require proper management to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances in this facility.  Those steps are briefly explained in the following paragraphs.\r\n\r\n     Specialized Safety Features\r\n\r\nThe Fort Worth plant has engineered safety features on those units which process regulated hazardous chemicals to (1) Prevent a release through early warning of impending upsets, and/or (2) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in this process:\r\n\r\n     Release Prevention Systems\r\n\r\n1. High level probes with alarms\r\n2. Flow controllers with automatic shutoffs\r\n3. Pressure relief devices on piping, tanks, and reactor vessels\r\n4. Check valves to prevent reverse flow through piping\r\n5. High temperature and pressure warning systems on the reactor vessels\r\n\r\n     Release Containment/Control\r\n\r\n1. Dikes and diversion systems contain spills and limit the surface area of the spill pools.\r\n2. Manually operated valves are used to permit isolation of the processes as needed.\r\n3. Remotely operated emergency shut-off valves for formaldehyde off-loading transfers may be used in the event of a off-loading accident to halt a release.\r\n4. Tank Truck unloading bays have secondary containment dikes to contain any spilled liquid and limit pool .\r\n\r\n     Releas"

The plan consists of procedures for responding to a release of formaldehyde.  These procedures address notification and emergency signals, specific containment actions, and proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel following an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the plant has procedures to address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment.  All visitors and contractors receive some level of orientation to instruct them in emergency signals and actions to be taken during an emergency.   More than half of the production employees are trained to Hazardous Materials Operations level to apply defensive measures to hazardous materials emergencies.  These personnel are sufficiently trained to deal with most hazardous materials emergencies that might occur in this facility.  In the event of more serious emergencies, the same personnel are trained and prepared to assist the efforts of other emergency response personnel"

      "SummaryText": "in a variety of support roles.  All employees are trained as first responders at the awareness level and in procedures for cleaning up small spills based on their work assignments.\r\n\r\nOverall emergency response programs are coordinated with the Fort Worth Fire Department.  This coordination includes briefings and information sharing to address specific concerns in the event of an incident at the plant and drills to practice skills.  The Fort Worth Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with the Fort Worth Fire Department.   This department has the capability to communicate to all state, federal and county agencies and may draw on whatever resources or equipment are needed to effectively manage emergency operations (i.e., fire-fighting equipment, manpower, ambulances, hospitals, law enforcement, and HAZMAT operations).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating a quick response to an incident.   The Fort Worth Plant conducts drills annually to assess personnel readiness, proficiency and the effectiveness of emergency response plans.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nThe Fort Worth Plant is constantly striving to improve process safety, quality, and efficiency.   On significant planned improvement will be to enclose the fourth side of tank diking around the formaldehyde storage tank.  Current diking diverts any spilled material into an adjacent secondary containment pit.  Enclosing the primary diking around the storage tank will greatly reduce the surface area of any large spill thus reducing potential offsite impacts."
