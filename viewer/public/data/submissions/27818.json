These accidental release prevention programs are comprised of administrative and engineering controls dedicated to the facility process.\n\nAdministrative controls incorporate detailed, process specific standard operating procedures which include start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, safe operating parameters, consequences of deviations, hazard information, special safety precautions, emergency operations and emergency shutdown.  Minrad provides extensive training and certification for all employees involved in process operations.\n\nAdditional administrative controls include the following written programs:  Spill Prevention Plan, On-Site Emergency Response Plan, Hazardous Materials Off-Site Response Plan, coordinated with the Northampton County Emergency Management Agency, (LEPC), as well as, Hazard Communication and Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals (PSM) programs.  These programs provide employees and responders with detailed instructions and information governing hazardous materials and emergency responses at the facility.  Minrad provides initial and refresher training, drills where applicable, and confirmation of understanding relative to these written programs for all affected employees.\n\nEngineering controls include dedicated, hard piped material transfer systems, automatic fail-closed and redundant valves, overpressure burst disk protection with audible alarms, emergency stop systems, high and low level detection equipment with alarms and dedicated process vent and emergency air pollution control equipme"

      "SummaryText": "nt.  Routine inspections, preventative maintenance and equipment replacement are also conducted for facility processes.\n\nMinrad is located at 3950 Schelden Circle in the Lehigh Valley Industrial Park IV.  The Industrial Park is located in the City of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, in Hanover Township, Northampton County.  The exterior grounds of the facility consist of paved parking and driveway areas surrounded by lawn and landscaping.  Properties immediately surrounding the facility include ABEC to the North, Ondra Huyett Associates to the West, and Prestige Gift Box Systems, Corp. to the East.  The South side of the property is bounded by a vacant lot.\n\nThe facility site consists of 3.96 acres occupied by two buildings.  One, a single story 26,500 square foot building consisting of offices, manufacturing area, packaging area, laboratory, warehouse and maintenance with an attached, walled, 9,000 square foot concrete utility pad.  The utility pad houses the facility refrigeration equipment, raw material storage and air pollution control equipment.  The second is a detached, single story, 600 square foot building used for storing flammable liquid raw materials.  There are no threshold quantities of flammable liquid materials stored or used anywhere at the facility.\n\nBoth Minrad buildings are protected by supervised automatic sprinkler systems, emergency alarm pull stations which mobilize fire, police and Minrad facility responders when activated, and security alarms to alert police of unauthorized entry.\n\n Minrad maintains and adheres to specific, detailed handling and use insructions for operating processes which use these hazardous materials.  These instructions provide general accidental release prevention through both technological and management policies.  Key elements of the prevention program include limiting the quantities and use of these materials, inspection and leak testing prior to use, equipment maintenance, automatic and redundant valves, emergency stops an"

      "SummaryText": "d alarm systems.  The facility also maintains special equipment for managing cylinder emergencies.  Hazard assessments and risk analysis were conducted for the facility as it is subject to and compliant with OSHA's PSM rule relative to these hazardous materials.  Additional assessments were conducted for the facility Spill Prevention Plan and Emergency Response Plan.  These assessments aid the facility in identifying potentitals for accidental releases and recommendations or corrective actions necessary to further reduce this potential.\n\nDuring the past five year period, there have been no subsequent accidental releases of any materials.\n\nMinrad has implemented and maintains two emergency response programs.  The Facility Emergency Response Plan is an on-site plan designed to aid in the management of a facility emergency.  The plan contains detailed information, employee responsibility and actions required, lines of authority and emergency contact information.  This plan sets specific guidelines for a variety of emergency contigencies and is rehearsed through unannounced drills.  As a part of this plan, the facility emergency alarm system automatically notifies police and fire personnel to respond when activated.  As a planning facility, Minrad also maintains a Hazardous Materials Off Site Response Plan with the Northampton County Emergency Management Agency and Hanover Township Volunteer Fire Company # 1.  This plan coordinates the efforts, identifies lines of authority and provides contact information for off site responders during a hazardous materials emergency.\n\nAs part of Minrad's ongoing commitment, improvements in safety are a continuing process.  Minrad encourages employee participation amd recommendations for procedural, process and administrative improvements.  These recommendations are reviewed, revised if applicable, and implemented where a positive safety benefit analysis exists."
