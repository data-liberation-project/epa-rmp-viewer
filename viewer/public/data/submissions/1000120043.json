It is Monogram company policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws. If an emergency were to occur, it is company policy to notify the Wilmington, MA Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. Fire suppression equipment and training has also been provided to the operations personnel at the facility.\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\nMonogram Gourmet Foods is a standard Ammonia refrigeration facility containing anhydrous ammonia gas liquefied under pressure. The ammonia changes state from a liquid to a gas and back to a liquid. It does not chemically change; it is not consumed and does not wear out. It continuously circulates throughout the system.\n\n\nOff-site Consequence Analysis:\nThe worst case release scenario modeled/estimated is the release of 11,271 lbs (consiering a vessel at 80% full). The duration of the release would be 10 minutes, occurring within the machine/engine room, in contact with outside air. The estimated distance to toxic endpoint is about 1.2 miles in all directions, considering a 25 PPM radius. The terrain is urban.\n\n\nThe alternate release scenario modeled/estimated is a 10-minute release of ammonia from a PRV exterior to the building. The release rate is 61.3 pounds per minute. The estimated distance to toxic endpoint in this scenario is about .09 miles in all directions.\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\nThe Monogram Gourmet Foods facility has developed and implemented all of the elements of the EPA 40 CFR Part 68 Accidental Release Prevention Requirements, Program 3 Risk Management Plan (RMP) and the OSHA 29 CFR Part 1910.119"

The PSI also incorporates information provided by the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) standards/guidance. The PSI includes the hazards of ammonia used in the refrigeration process and process equipment data. The process safety information will be updated whenever process changes are made using management of changes and pre-startup safety reviews.\n\nAccurate and complete process safety information enables the Monogram employees involved in operating and maintaining the food processing facility to identify and understand the hazards of the refrigeration system. Process safety information is used to conduct process hazard analysis on the existing system.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA):\nMonogram Gourmet Foods is committed to performing a detailed hazard analysis of its refrigeration system to identify, evaluate, and control hazards involved in the processes. The entire process is systematically examined to identify potential hazards, controls in place to manage these hazards, and recommend additional controls, as appropriate.\n\nThe Monogram Facility uses the What-if-Checklist PHA methodologies, which are conducted by a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience, engineering expertise and PHA facilitator training. The PHA team identifies and evaluates potential hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures.\n\nAs a minimum the Monogram Facility will perform periodic PHA reviews or revalidations every 5 year"

The Monogram Gourmet Foods PSM Plan and written operating procedures address steps for each operating phase, including, initial start-up, normal operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, and normal shutdown. The written operating procedures describe ammonia safety systems and their functions. The operating procedures state the operating limits including the consequences of deviation and the steps required to correct or avoid the deviation and are reviewed and certified annually for current practices and accuracy.\n\nSafe Work Practices and Procedures:\nMonogram has developed and implemented safe work practices in accordance with the OSHA 29 CFR Part 1910 requirements that include methods for controlling facility entry, presence and exit of support personnel, lockout/ tagout procedures to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, personal protective equipment, fire protection, electrical safety, hot work procedures and permits for work with the potential for generating ignition sources in the presence of flammable or combustible material.\n\nTraining:\nMonogram has developed and implemented formal operator and maintenance training programs.\nInitial training insures that new or reassigned personnel are trained in an overview of the process and opera"

Additionally, any new units added at the Monogram facility, which is considered PSM covered processes, will also require a PSSR to be performed and documented.\n\nMechanical Integrity:\nMonogram has developed and implemented procedures to maintain the on-going mechanical integrity of critical refrigeration process equipment in accordance with OSHA Standard 1910.119, Process Safety Management (PSM), as outlined in the facility PSM Plan.
