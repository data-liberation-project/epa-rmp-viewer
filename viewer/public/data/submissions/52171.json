The facility latitude and longitude are 40? 2? 13.06? N and 109? 27? 9.56? W, respectively.\n\nThe Stagecoach Plant is designed to process 150 million standard cubic feet of gas per day.  The gas is delivered from pipelines and various compressor stations.  To reduce the dew point of the gas, the facility uses a propane refrigeration system to chill the inlet gas, which first flows through a slug catcher to remove bulk liquids from the gas stream.  Ethylene glycol (EG) is injected into the inlet stream to help prevent formation of hydrates.  Natural Gas Liquids (NGL) are removed and processed to meet industry specifications. Condensate also removed in the process is stabilized and removed from the site for disposal.   \n\nThe Stagecoach Gas Plant stores flammable mixtures of methane, ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes (NGL) in four 60,000-gallon pressurized tanks.  Methane, ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes are listed in 40 CFR 68.130 as regulated flammable substances.  The threshold quantity for regulated flammable substances is 10,000 pounds.  The maximum inventory of NGLs at the Stagecoach Gas Plant is 240,000 gallons or 830,000 pounds of regulated flammable chemicals (based on an average NGL density of 4.5 pounds per gallon).  The NGL storage process is therefore subject to the risk management program rule.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThe facility is newly constructed and no accidents involving regulated substances that resulted in onsite injuries, significant property damage, or offsite response have occurred since startup.\n\nPrevention Program\n\nQuestar Gas Management Company is committed to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, opera"

However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain and control the release.\n\nBecause the process at the facility that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nQuestar compiled a written PSI before conducting a PHA. The PSI must include information pertaining to the hazards of highly hazardous chemicals used or produced by the process, the technology of the process, and the equipment used in the process.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\nThe Stagecoach Gas Plant conducted a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) to help ensure that hazards associated with the various Stagecoach plant processes are identified and controlled. Within the PHA program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. The PHA included an evaluation of routine and non-routine modes of operation for potential equipment failures, human errors, and process upsets that could result in a catastrophic consequence. \n\nQuestar held PHA study sessions in January 2008 to identify process hazards associated with the\nStagecoach plant.  The methodology and content of the PHA met the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119(e). As required, the study team was composed of participants with expertise in engineering and process operations.  The team met for a total of seven days over a two-week period.\n\nThe results of the PHA yielded 69 HAZOP recommendations as well as seven Human Factors/Siting/Global Issues "

Catastrophic release of a highly hazardous chemical (regulated flammable substance);\n2. Injuries or fatalities to workers and the public resulting from catastrophic hazards;\n3. Equipment damage resulting from catastrophic hazards;\n4. Environmental impacts exceeding permitted levels.\n\nThe following issues were addressed in the recommendations:\n\n? Improving or providing additional equipment/control related safety features;\n? Improving human reliability through hardware or operating procedure improvements;\n? Conducting further investigation or engineering to confirm that the anticipated hazard scenarios are credible and warrant the given recommendation.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nQuestar developed and implemented written operating procedures that address: steps for each operating phase such as start-up, normal operations, shut-down, operating limits, and safety and health considerations.
