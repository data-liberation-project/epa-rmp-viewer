It is our corporate and company policy to provide every employee a safe and healthy workplace. Our corporate safety policy provides guidance for implementation, operation and review of the standards that govern the Ammonia Refrigeration Systems that use anhydrous ammonia or any other highly hazardous chemical that are defined by the threshold planning quantities of the Federal and/or State standard. This includes any of the operational facilities that manufacture, store and distribute product in the company. \n\nThe personal health and safety of each employee is our first concern and top priority.  Management will provide a safe and healthy workplace to the greatest degree possible.  Our efforts for personal safety and health shall be in keeping with the highest standards.  To accomplish this, management will provide all reasonable safeguards to ensure safe working conditions.\n\nThe Kohler Mix Specialties of Minnesota, LLC facility is located in the City of White Bear Lake, Minnesota.  The facility employs approximately 140 full-time associates.  Our primary products include extended shelf life and aseptic dairy and non-dairy food products.  The refrigeration system is used for processing and cold storage of dairy food products. \n\nTHE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe ammonia release occurred on August 13, 2005 around 8:15pm.  At that time the actual quantity of the release was unknown.  During the next four days we analyzed the systems, equipment, and incident involved during the August 13th release.

The gas, produced by the volatilization of the released liquid, was released to the air above the roof.  Some of this gas was drawn into the facility through ventilation units on the roof, and was eventually all discharged to the exterior through air exchange and exhausting of the plant.\n\nThe investigation identified that the ammonia level float failed and the 200-ton chiller filled with ammonia liquid.  Heated glycol entered the chiller shocking the system.  There was little headspace in the chiller vessel and the pressure rose quickly.  The ammonia gas had nowhere to expand and the result was the lifting of the relief valve dissipating the excess pressure.\n\n251.7 pounds of Ammonia A?anhydrous was released.  Release volume was provided and calculated by our refrigeration contractor American Industrial Refrigeration, with reference to Chemical Exposure Index Guide Dow Chemical, 2nd edition 1993.  The volume was determined by relief valve liquid quantity discharge possible during a 30 second release.  The formula consisted of the following inputs: A? inch diameter relief valve, 37.2 pounds of Liquid Pressure, 150 pounds of gas pressure, and 30 second release.  The total was also crosschecked versus our relief spill puddle diameter to assure quantities were accurate.  Both calculations were within 10 pounds of each other, and we reported the higher of the two being 251.7.  \n\nAmmonia vapor was identified outside the facility and 911 called.  Immediately following calling 911 the supervisor on duty gathered employees in the plant lunchroom, which was a known safe area, and made the appropriate emergency contacts to other plant management.  Once the local emergency response teams showed up they "

Headcounts were taken to assure all employees were out, with the exception of a small crew of 5 maintenance persons who were assisting the local response teams in identifying the issue.  Once the response teams were well in place these remaining employees joined the rest of our employees at the evacuation point.  The local response teams then took complete control of the situation, along with gathering input, knowledge, and assistance as necessary from our management staff during the emergency response.  Only after the building was determined safe were our employees allowed back into the facility.  Immediately following the incident the facility was toured and monitored throughout the night to assure no further issues arose.  The release completely gassed off on the roof and did not require any clean-up, removal, or transportation.\n\nEmergency services were called around 8:30 pm and local emergency services responded.  The White Bear Lake Fire Department notified the Minnesota Duty Officer at 8:50pm, during the initial response to the release.  The National Response Center was notified of our release the night of the release, on August 13th at 10:27pm.  \n\nThe facility was fully evacuated following the release and no one was aloud to return until full assessment and response was completed to determine the plant safe.  The evacuation occurred on August 13th at 8:30pm and ended at 12:05am on August 14th.  There were no deaths involved in the release.  There were two employees, one delivery truck driver, and one responding police officer that experienced respiratory irritation from inhalation of the ammonia vapors.  During the evacuation, the two employees and truck driver were removed to fresh air.  None were unconscious.

Both facilities were down wind of the plant.\n\nPreventative Action Taken - The action taken to prevent a new occurrence is listed below:\n1. Pressure relief valves were replaced.\n2. Ammonia level float was replaced.\n3. Control systems were inspected and were functioning properly other than the float that was corrected when the float was replaced.\n4. Ammonia float and level inside chiller is inspected during rounds.\n5.

Specific associates are trained and certified as emergency responders. All associates are trained in evacuation, hazard communication, and chemical safety.  Our emergency response plans are filed and reviewed by OSHA.  The general procedure is as follows:\n\n1. Immediately notify the Emergency Response Team over the paging system or radio.\n2. If the NH3 problem is deemed to be serious, then \"9-9-1-1\" (for the Fire Department) will be called by the Emergency Response Team.  \n3.
