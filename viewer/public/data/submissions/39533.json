The maximum storage quantity of Anhydrous is 51,405 lbs.  The facility has a written emergency response plan and has provided state and local authoritites the emergency planning and community right to know information as required under SAFA Title III.\n\nWorst Case Scenario - A maximum of 140,196 lbs of Anhydrous Ammonia could be released in a gaseous state over a duration of 10 minutes at 14,020 lbs/min into the urban area surrounding the plant up to 1.10 miles to endpoint.  The offsite consequences could include less than 10 residential individuals.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - A transfer hose failure on Anhydrous Ammonia has the potential to release 26,638 lbs of product in a gaseous state over 2 minutes at a rate of 13,319 lbs/min  in the area surrounding the plant up to .59 miles.  The offsite consequences would include affects on approximately 4 individuals.  \n\nThe owners, management and employees at the facility are prepared to work with local fire department and other authorities to minimize the impact of any release to the community and the environment.  The facility has had no such release in the past 5 years.  Complying with safety standards for the storage and handeling of Anhydrous Ammonia and completing regular maintenance on the equipment at the facility will continue to prement any accidental releases at the S D Fertilizer and Spraying plant at Fairmont, Nebraska."
