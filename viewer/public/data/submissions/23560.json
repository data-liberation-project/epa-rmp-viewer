Any work-related injuries/illnesses, incidents, or near misses are documented and investigated to determine if corrective action is needed.\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\nThere has been no accidental releases of either RMP regulated substance, in excess of the material's respective reportable quantity, from the RMP covered production processes within the last five years.\n\n\nWorst-Case Scenario\nIn accordance with EPA's Risk Management regulation, the worst-case scenario estimated to result in the greatest distance to a specified toxic endpoint has been identified.  The worst-case case scenario consists of a release of 11,200 pounds (900 gallons) of chloroform through the rupture disk vent line of a 1,000-gallon reactor to the roof of a production building.  The release is considered to occur during the distillation of the chloroform where the chloroform in the reactor is heated to 60o C (elevated temperature).  The 60' x 100' roof of the building serves as a dike and limits the exposed surface area of the pool and thus reduces the releases rate to 983 pounds per minute.  Using worst case weather conditions as specified by EPA, the distance to chloroform's toxic endpoint of 0.49 mg/L is 1.6 miles.  This result is based on the instructions and calculations included in EPA's Risk Management Program - Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis.\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios\nTwo alternative release scenarios have been identified for chloroform and formaldehyde that would be more likely to occur.  The alternative release scenario for chloroform involves the release of 68,200 pounds (5,487 gallons) of chloroform at 25o C (ambient temperature) into a diked area resulting from the failure of a 2 pipe located at the bottom of a 5,700 gallon capacity bulk storage tank. A concrete dike around the tank limits the exposed surface area of the pool and thus reduces the releases rate to"

This result is based on the instructions and calculations included in EPA's Risk Management Program - Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for formaldehyde involves the release of 72,000 pounds (8,000 gallons) of formaldehyde at 25o C (ambient temperature) into a diked area from the failure of a 2 pipe located at the bottom of an 8,000 gallon capacity bulk storage tank. A concrete dike around the tank limits the exposed surface area of the pool and thus reduces the releases rate to 4.7 pounds per minute.

This result is based on the instructions and calculations included in EPA's Risk Management Program - Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis.\n\n\nEmergency Response Procedures\nThe ROC State College plant has a comprehensive emergency response plan in place in the event that an accidental chemical release occurs.  The facility has a written emergency plan as required by various regulations.  The plant is equipped with an internal alarm system that is designed to notify plant employees in the event of a release.  The majority of the plant employees have been trained to the HAZMAT Technician level as defined by OSHA and are EPA certified.  This training allows employees to actively stop releases and take aggressive actions to prevent spread of a release.  The initial training is reinforced by monthly training on various emergency response topics such as SCBA operation, spill cleanup and decontamination procedures.  \n\nPeriodically, the ROC State College plant participates in a county wide drill sponsored by the Centre County LEPC.  Other organizations participating include the local fire department, emergency medical servi"

Additionally, ROC's Corporate EHS Department has adopted the philosophy that each ROC plant develop, implement and mature its safety program to mirror the framework of the OSHA VPP STAR initiative and ISO 14000."

      "SummaryText": "The R\u00dcTGERS Organics Corporation (ROC) State College, PA plant custom manufactures organic chemicals for a variety of industries including the agricultural, coatings and plastics industries.  The State College facility is located on a 39-acre site in State College, Pennsylvania.  The original plant was built in 1958 and has expanded over the years.  The product mix at the facility changes frequently due to the nature of the custom manufacturing business.\n\nThe State College plant currently stores and uses two chemicals listed on the toxic substance list above the threshold quantity in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations.  These chemicals are formaldehyde and chloroform.\n\nFormaldehyde is used in the production of an agricultural product and handled at the facility in a 37% aqueous solution.  The aqueous solution, known as formalin, is received via tank truck and is stored in an 8,000 gallon, insulated above ground storage tank within a dike.\n\nChloroform is a pure solution that is also used in the production of an agricultural product.  Chloroform is received via tank truck and is stored in a 6,700 gallon above ground storage tank within a dike.\n\n\nAccident Prevention Program\nR\u00dcTGERS Organics Corporation policy on accidental release prevention is to use multiple safeguards or layers of protection to minimize the likelihood of an accidental chemical release at its manufacturing facilities.  These layers of protection consist of safely designing, building or modifying facilities or equipment, training workers extensively, safely starting and restarting production operations, safely operating facilities and managing change, regularly inspecting and maintaining equipment and regularly reviewing and auditing plant systems.\n\nThe first layer of protection consists of safely designing, modifying and building facilities or equipment.  Equipment design and installation are completed per established design and construction standards such as the American Society of Mecha"

An initial process hazard analysis is conducted on the equipment design and operating procedures to help identify possible problem areas.  Safety systems are then designed into the manufacturing process to eliminate or at least minimize the possibility of worker exposure, fire or a chemical release.\n\nThe second layer of protection is training operators and contractors extensively.  New chemical operators complete a week of safety training before working in the plant.  Before a new process is started at the facility, operators are trained in proper operating procedures and process safety information.  The process training is updated every three years.  Training is reinforced by on the job training including evaluation by observation and demonstration.  Monthly safety training meetings are held to cover OSHA and EPA mandated topics.  Contractors also receive safety training before working at the State College facility.\n\nThe third layer of protection is safely starting and restarting plant operations.  A pre-startup safety review is completed before a new process is started and after a major modification is made to a process to ensure all necessary work has been completed prior to process startup.\n\nThe fourth level of protection is safely operating a production facility.  Detailed operating procedures are written for operators to follow and record necessary data and to detail safe operating limits for process parameters.  Fitness for duty is well defined through alcohol and substance abuse policies.  A management of change procedure is in place to control and evaluate changes before they are made to the operating procedures or process equipment.\n\nThe fifth level of protection is regularly reviewing and auditing plant systems.  Process hazard analyses are redone every five years for each production process.  Plant systems are routinely audited either by the ROC's Corporate EHS Department, regulatory agencies"
