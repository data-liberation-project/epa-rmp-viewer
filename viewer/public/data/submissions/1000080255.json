The facility produces chlorine, potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, hydrogen, and cogenerates electricity for in-plant use and sale.  The OxyChem Taft facility employs 202 full-time employees. \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source (40 CFR 68.155(a))\n\n\n\nOxyChem is committed to operating the Taft Plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public, and the environment.  The facility was approved for the OSHA Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) Star designation in May 1994.  We have continued to qualify for renewal of this award since then.\n\n  \n\nThe OSHA VPP Program sets performance-based criteria for a managed safety and health system, invites sites to apply, and then assesses applicants against these criteria. OSHA's verification includes an application review and a rigorous onsite evaluation by a team of OSHA safety and health experts.  The Star designation recognizes facilities for employers and employees who demonstrate exemplary achievement in the prevention and control of occupational safety and health hazards the development, implementation and continuous improvement of their safety and health management system.\n\n\n\nThe Taft Plant's commitment includes systems for the safe operation of processes to prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances.  This program conforms to the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule), and the OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program a"

One substance produced at Taft is regulated under the EPA Risk Management Plan (RMP):  Chlorine (CAS Number 7782-50-5).\n\n\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps (40 CFR 68.155(d))\n\n\n\nThe OxyChem Taft facility's prevention program has been prepared so that it conforms to both OSHA Process Safety Management and the EPA Risk Management Plan regulations.  The site's prevention program is documented, routinely reviewed, updated as necessary, and addresses several elements including:\n\n\n\n?    Process Safety Information\n\n?    Process Hazard Analysis\n\n?    Operating Procedures\n\n?    Training\n\n?    Mechanical Integrity\n\n?    Management of Change\n\n?    Pre-Startup Review\n\n?    Compliance Audits\n\n?    Incident Investigation\n\n?    Employee Participation\n\n?    Emergency Response\n\n?    Hot Work\n\n?    Contractors\n\n\n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History (40 CFR 68.155(e))\n\n\n\nThe OxyChem Taft facility has had one incident which meets the criteria in 40 CFR 68.42(a) within the past five years.  It was a less than one-pound release of chlorine that caused an on-site injury.  No others onsite were affected and no one offsite was affected.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program (40 CFR 68.155(f))\n\n\n\nThe OxyChem Taft facility has established a written emergency response plan and maintains an emergency response team trained in these emergency response procedures.  All plant personnel are trained in evacuation procedures and in-plant drills are conducted periodically.  The drills are used to gauge the response time of the Emergency Response Team, to test the plant employee accountability program, and to activate the plant's Emergency Command Center.  In addition, the OxyChem Taft facility has developed a Special Situations Plan which is a program designed for responding to emergencies that may impact areas beyond the im"
