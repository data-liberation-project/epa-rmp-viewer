Emergency response policies include mitigation when possible within the abilities and training of the plant staff.  Should these efforts be insufficient, further intervention would be in active cooperation with community planners and first responders.  \n\n\n\nSethness Products has been an active member of the Clinton County Local Emergency Planning Committee and involved in Environmental managers' meetings.  Once every two years, the local fire department is invited to facility for training and familiarization where new drawings and updates are given to them for review and comments. \n\n\n\nTwo aqueous ammonia tanks exist that hold up to 212,654 pounds of 29% Aqueous Ammonia at ambient temperature.  Distribution piping containing 29% Aqueous Ammonia contributes a negligible amount of additional volume. \n\n\n\nSethness Products Company has had no accidental releases of aqueous ammonia in the last five years.  \n\n\n\nThe programs in place to prevent releases focus primarily on prevention by design and maintenance.  The facility personnel work in concert to insure that design and system components are optimized for safe operation.  All proposed changes are reviewed by plant engineering staff to insure that system integrity is not compromised.  During this review, all activities such as inspection or maintenance are specified and integrated into plant operations.  Given the small facility staff, outside experts frequently provide or review designs for changes to the systems.  In addition to an aggressive safety program based on Job "

      "SummaryText": "Safety Analysis, the facility is in compliance with the Process Safety Management (PSM) rules.  The plant safety program assures that management, engineering, and operations are informed of the hazards posed by 29% Aqueous Ammonia, and the actions required to maintain the system in safe condition.  The safety program has the full support of labor and management.\n\n\n\nIn the unlikely event of a release, facility personnel would assess the seriousness of the problem and take appropriate action.  Actions would include evacuation of the facility, notification of emergency first responders, and if required, a call for help to the Quad Cities Hazardous Materials Team.  In order to provide rapid response to a problem, Sethness employees have been trained in the early detection of small leaks and catastrophic events that could result in large releases.  Employees, upon detection of incidental leak conditions, have training and equipment to make emergency repairs.  In the event of catastrophic failure due to a flood or vessel failure, activation of the community response plan would be the primary response.  \n\n\n\nThe emergency response plan is designed to assure the safety of employees.  Once safety of employees is assured, abatement of the release will be addressed.  Preventing hazardous concentration of vapors is the primary goal.  This will be accomplished by repairing faulty or damaged equipment, or the application of \"bandages.\"  Should the problem have the potential to be beyond the capability or training of facility personnel, further mitigation and response will be coordinated with local first responders and (if necessary) the Quad Cities Hazmat team.\n\n\n\nSethness Products is open 24 hrs per day, 7 days per week.  Certain holidays may cause nobody to be on site, but a member from maintenance inspects and records important information in person at facility 365 days per year.  Inspection of aqua ammonia containment is one of these items.\n\n\n\nThe aqueous ammonia system has be"
