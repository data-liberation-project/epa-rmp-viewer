      "SummaryText": "Newfield Exploration Company produces oil and gas from the Greater Monument Butte Field located in the Uinta Basin in Uintah and Duchesne Counties in north eastern Utah.  Approximately 11 million standard cubic feet per day (MMSCF/D) of natural gas is handled by Newfield's Monument Butte Compressor Station. The gas is rich in hydrocarbon liquids to the extent that is exceeds specifications for gas pipeline transportation and sales.  The Monument Butte Compressor Station uses a Joules-Thomson (JT) unit to condense and remove heavy hydrocarbons out of the gas stream to meet required gas pipeline specifications.  The liquid hydrocarbons are removed and stored in a 23,500 gallon aboveground pressure vessel.  The liquid hydrocarbons are then transported via high pressure tanker truck to a fractionation facility for further processing.\r\n\r\nThe Monument Butte Compressor Station is located eight miles south of the city of Myton, Utah.  The station is located at SE/SW Section 25, Township 8S, Range 16E, Myton, UT, 84052 in a remote area surrounded by oil field well sites.  There are no public receptors in the area.  The Newfield field office is located approximately four miles northwest of the compressor station in Section 10 T4S, R1W.  The compressor station is normally unmanned; however, the facility is inspected daily by Newfield personnel and tanker truck personnel.  \r\n\r\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at your facility.\r\nThis facility complies with NFPA-58 requirements for LP-Gas storage, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to isolate and shutdown operations and stay away until the situation is safe.  Liquid hydrocarbons will also be removed if possible without endangering personnel.  Once the site is determined to be safe, equipment will be repaired.  The Myton Volunteer Fire Department will not respond to any emergency at the station unless requ"

The liquid hydrocarbons are stored in a 23,500 gallon aboveground pressure vessel.\r\n\r\nThe worst-case release scenario.\r\nNewfield utilized the EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance For Offsite Consequence Analysis as a reference to conduct the scenario analysis. Specifically, Newfield used the TNT-equivalent method detailed in Appendix C of this document. There were no public receptors within the determined radius of impact.\r\n\r\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\r\nThe facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes are regulations. The NGL system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law.\r\n\r\nFive-year accident history.\r\nIn the last five years, this site has not had a release from a covered process that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\r\n\r\nThe emergency response program.\r\nIn the event of an emergency, it is our policy to initiate the site's emergency response plan.  The compressor stations will be shutdown and isolated.  People will be kept away from any potential hazardous situations, such as any potential fires or explosions"
