We use a combination of accidental release programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, Including:\n\n                 A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's regulation\n\n                 A summary from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n\n                 An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n\n                 A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n\n                 An overview of our emergency response program\n\n                 An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurrinng and\n\n                 adversely affecting our employees, the public and the environment\n\n                 The certifications that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide\n\n                 The detailed infromation (called data elements) about our risk management program\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nOur facility produces polyurethane foam seat pads and backs for the automotive industry using a variety of chemicals and processing operations. In our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial release:\n\n\n\nTOXICS\n\n\n\nToluene Diisocyanate (TDI). Our facility has one 15,000 gallon storage tank to handle the TDI. TDI is a main component of the chemical mixture used to formulate "

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls amd mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\n\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\n\n\nOur Worst-case Release Scenario would be a catastophic failure of the 15,000 gallon storage tank. This would involve the involuntary release of up to 15,000 gallons of TDI to the diked area located inside our building.\n\n\n\nThe release rate calculated by RMP*COMP was a value of 0.00655 lbs/min.  This release rate was rounded to 0.1 lb/hr in order to have a release rate that would not be printed as zero.  Also, the evaporation time calculated by RMP*COMP was 23,300,000 minutes.  However, the RMP Submit Program will only accept a time that is less than 10,000 minutes. The evaporation time for this process was entered as 9,999 minutes.\n\n\n\nBy using the EPA's RMP*Comp modeling program, it was determined that the endpoint distance for a catastrophic failure is less than the distance to the nearest receptor.\n\n\n\n\n\n    GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nWe maintain a number of programs to help prevent accidental releases and ensure safe operation. The accident prevention programs in place include:\n\n\n\n        1. Employees that can handle the bulk truck unloading of the TDI receive advanced training on the truck unloading and storage systems.\n\n       2. We developed internal checklists that are used for every unloading procedure. These checklists reduce the risk of an accidental release.\n\n       "

The storage tank is equipped with a high level alarm and sight gages to prevent overfilling the tank.\n\n       5. Inventory records are kept at the plant and are checked before the truck is unloaded into the tank. This verifies that the tank can accommodate the truck.\n\n\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases. Our company and\n\nour employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nWe will keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.\n\n\n\nThe following is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five years:\n\n\n\nWe have not had a significant accidental chemical spill occur at our facility since the facility has opened.\n\n\n\nIn the event that a significant spill does occur, we will conduct a formal incident investigation to identify and correct the root causes of each event.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning. Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting the workers, the public and the environment during emergency situations. Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the community emergency response plan.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nAs there has not been any accidental chemical releases from our facility that has caused an offsite impact, we are not required to plan any changes to our program.\n\n\n\nCERTIFICATIONS\n\n\n\nBased on the criteria in 40 CFR 68.10, the distance to the"
