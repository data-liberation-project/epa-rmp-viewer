      "SummaryText": "The City of Aberdeen Water Works is a program 2 facility using chlorine gas liquefied by pressure for the disinfection of drinking water. This is the only regulated substance handled at the facility, and emergency action measures are in place in the event of the accidental release of the chemical. Located almost 7 miles northeast of Aberdeen, the plant is in a rural setting and has had no major accidental releases of chlorine in its 81 years of operation at this location. The exceedingly remote possibility of releasing chlorine gas to the atmosphere in its most extensive case would involve a one-ton cylinder venting its entire contents over the course of 18 minutes. The cylinders are enclosed within the walls of the building and the facility is surrounded by dikes which will contain the heavier-than-air gas. Downwind safety calculations using a north wind involves a 3 mile area that includes the residents of the Prairiewood residential community.  Immediate notification to the Brown County Dispatch, Aberdeen Fire Department, and the Brown County Emergency Management Office turns the situation over to trained emergency responders.  This is first step in the accidental release policy of the water treatment plant; additional steps are then taken to secure the safety of plant personnel and others within the concerned area. The alternate release scenario (most probable accidental release mechanism) chosen for planning purposes would produce an endpoint of the chemical plume no more than 0.1 miles in any direction from the facility (within the borders of the plant grounds). The plant accidental release prevention program involves strict adherence to maintenance procedures, inspections, and rotation of chlorine feed equipment components. Operational and emergency chemical training is also a very important part of our ongoing prevention program. Chemical release reviews are part of our routine training program, including survivability procedures for plant personnel. Our exc"
