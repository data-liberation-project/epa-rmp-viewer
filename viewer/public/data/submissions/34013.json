M G Industries has developed Safety, Health and Environmental guidelines that have been incorporated in a comprehensive program defined as Quality Operating Procedures. These procedures are the minimal standards for M G Industries operations, including the Jessup, MD cylinder gas production facility.\r\n\r\nThe objective of the program is to achieve an acceptable level of performance in the prevention of the losses to the organization which include but are not limited to accidents, injuries, illnesses, product liabilities and regulatory non-conformities. To be effective, this management system must be totally integrated in which all levels of employees are involved and held accountable.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate authority for instituting an effective EHS Program rests with the senior management of each operating group. Through their words and more importantly through their actions, senior management sets the tone for loss prevention throughout M G Industries. While senior management set the tone, middle management must create the uniform support and nurture the desired culture to influence the EHS Program. This strong management commitment culminates with the day to day responsibilities of implementing and managing the Quality Operating Procedures by 'line management' (supervisors and lead personnel). Local management is accountable for the effective management of this program through their organization's performance as related to loss prevention and regulator"
