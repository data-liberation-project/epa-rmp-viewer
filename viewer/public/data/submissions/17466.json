(Croda) seeks to provide a safe work environment for their employees as well as ensure the safety of individuals offsite.  In addition, Croda is keenly aware of the potential environmental impacts of their operations and they are committed to minimizing the negative effects of their processes on the environment.\nAccording to EPA 40 CFR 68, part 68.155, the Executive Summary should contain the following items:\na) The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source.\nb) The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\nc) The Worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenarios(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\nd) The general accident release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\ne) The five-year accident history.\nf) The emergency response program.\ng) Planned changes to improve safety.\nA. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nCroda, Inc. has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our process.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\nB. Description of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nCroda, Inc. is a worldwide supplier for the personal care, household, pharmaceutical, and manufacturing industries. There are five substances regulated by the EPA RMP Rule that is found above threshold quantities at the site, including: \nMaterial    Toxic or Flammable, per EPA Guideline    Endpoint, per EPA Guideline\nEthylene Oxide    Toxic gas    0.09 mg/l\nPropylene Oxide"

Five-Year Accident History\nThe Croda Mill Hall Site is very concerned about maintaining a safe work environment for their employees and preventing any negative impacts on the surrounding community.\nThere has been one accident in the last five years, however, it was not due to a chemical release, but rather a vessel explosion resulting in localized consequences. Human error caused the incident.  Design changes to the process were made as a result.  This incident caused:\n7 2 on-site injuries\n7 No known onsite deaths or significant property damage\n7 No known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\nF. Emergency Response Program\nCroda in Mill Hall, PA maintains a written emergency response program that is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release.
