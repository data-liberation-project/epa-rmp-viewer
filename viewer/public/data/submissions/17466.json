In addition, Croda is keenly aware of the potential environmental impacts of their operations and they are committed to minimizing the negative effects of their processes on the environment.\nAccording to EPA 40 CFR 68, part 68.155, the Executive Summary should contain the following items:\na) The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source.\nb) The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\nc) The Worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenarios(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\nd) The general accident release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\ne) The five-year accident history.\nf) The emergency response program.\ng) Planned changes to improve safety.\nA. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nCroda, Inc. has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our process.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\nB.
