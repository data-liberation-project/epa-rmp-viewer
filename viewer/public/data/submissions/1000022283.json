      "SummaryText": "Hunter Panels located at 2000 Summit View Drive in Smithfield, Pennsylvania manufacturers rigid polyisocyanurate foam insulating panels for use in commercial and industrial roofing applications.  The company employs approximately 75 people at the facility in a non-union environment.  Hunter Panels occupies a 200,000+ square foot facility in Fayette County, Pennsylvania.  The facility is located the Fayette Business Park.  Facility boundaries include Route 43 to the west, railroad to the south, and open land and other industrial facilities to the east and north.\r\n\r\nThe polyisocyanurate foam insulating panels are produced by reacting a polyol (POLY) in a blend including a flame retardant and catalyst with polymeric diphenylmethane diisocyanate (ISO).  Pentane material is used as an expanding or blowing agent in the production of the panels.  Different varieties of pentane material can be used including various blends of n-pentane, isopentane, and cyclopentane.  Isopentane and n-pentane are regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule with a 10,000 pound threshold.  Cyclopentane is not regulated under the RMP Rule.  Hunter Panels is also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard in 29 CFR 1910.119 for all three isomers of pentane and maintains one plan to meet both the RMP and PSM requirements.\r\n\r\nThe facility receives a liquid pentane blend via tank truck and stores it in a 25,000-gallon aboveground pressure vessel for use in the production process.  This volume equates to a pentane material storage capacity of 131,000 to 148,000 pounds depending upon which pentane blend is used.  Throughout the RMP and Process Safety Management (PSM) documentation at the facility the combination of various isomers of pentane is simply referred to as pentane.  No distinction is made to exclude a possible cyclopentane portion of the blend from the RMP component of the regulations.  For purposes of the Risk Management Plan submittal a maximum of 148,000 poun"

      "SummaryText": "ds of n-pentane and 148,000 pounds of isopentane are addressed.  Please note that 148,000 pounds is the maximum amount of the combination of the three isomers of pentane that could be present at the site at any one time.  For example, if the current blend is essentially isopentane and 148,000 pounds of isopentane are on-site, virtually no n-pentane would be on site at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe process with respect to PSM and RMP regulations starts with the unloading of pentane into the storage tank and continues through the point where cured panels are cut to .  Process steps include transfer of pentane to a metering skid, injection of pentane at high pressure into a polyol blend, and reaction of the POLY with ISO, using pentane as the expanding agent, to form foam on top of a substrate.  The chemical mixture and substrate are drawn into the laminator oven, where the mixture adheres to the substrate and a top-sheet as the solid foam is formed.   At the crosscut saw station, the sheet is cut into long panels and the edges are trimmed to a precise 4-foot width.  The long panels then move to a gang saw station where additional crosscutting reduces the panels to the desired lengths, typically 4 or 8 feet.  At this point of the process, production of the foam panels using the pentane blowing agent is complete representing the end of the process that is covered under the PSM and RMP regulations.\r\n\r\nHunter Panels maintains a detailed emergency action plan in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.38.  The Plant Manager serves as facility coordinator for implementation of the emergency action plan. Employees are trained to respond to minor accidental releases at the facility.  Hunter Panels maintains a relationship with an off-site emergency responder for large scale environmental emergencies.  The plan is coordinated with local emergency responders.\r\n\r\nThe worst case release scenario for a volatile flammable liquid is defined as the detonation of a vapor cloud of the entire contents of t"

At Hunter Panels the worst case scenario would be the vaporization and subsequent detonation of the entire contents of the 25,000 gallon pentane storage tank.  Ten percent of the flammable vapor in the cloud is assumed to participate in the explosion.\r\n\r\nRMP Comp Version 1.07 was used to estimate the distance to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint for the worst case release scenario.  The distance to the endpoint was estimated to be approximately 0.1 miles.  This may affect a neighboring industrial facility and a rail spur.  There is no residential population within the 0.1 mile radius.\r\n\r\nAn alternate case release scenario with possible off-site impacts is a pool fire involving the release of pentane from a hose rupture during the unloading process.  The release rate is 888 lbs per minute into a diked area and it is assumed that the flow of pentane is not stopped until the tank truck is empty (51 minutes).  RMP Comp Version 1.07 was used to estimate the distance to the heat radiation endpoint of 5 kilowatts per square meter as 0.1 miles.  This may affect a neighboring industrial facility and a rail spur.  There is no residential population within the 0.1 mile radius.\r\n\r\nHunter Panels has taken precautions to ensure that the potential for an incident involving pentane is minimal.  Prevention measures include a comprehensive preventive maintenance program, detailed unloading procedures, daily inspections, extensive operator training, and pre-startup inspections for the pentane process.  The RMP program includes the following additional sections that are in practice at the facility.\r\n\r\n\r\nA\u00bf\tManagement System\r\nA\u00bf\tEmployee Participation\r\nA\u00bf\tProcess Safety Information\r\nA\u00bf\tProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nA\u00bf\tOperating Procedures\r\nA\u00bf\tTraining\r\nA\u00bf\tContractors\r\nA\u00bf\tPre-startup Safety Review\r\nA\u00bf\tMechanical Integrity\r\nA\u00bf\tHot Work Permit\r\nA\u00bf\tManagement of Change\r\nA\u00bf\tIncident Investigation\r\nA\u00bf\tCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nBecause of the prevention measures in place the occurrence"
