(PPG) Delaware facility is a part of the Performance Coatings Strategic Business Unit within PPG and produces primarily Automotive Refinish coatings and resins.  The facility produces both solvent-borne and waterborne coatings and also an automotive electronic disposition coating which is used to prevent corrosion.  The PPG Delaware facility has one regulated process, which is the storage and use of Acrylonitrile in the facility?s Tank Farm area and used in resin production.  Since Acrylonitrile is maintained above the threshold quantity of 20,000 pounds.  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nThe PPG Delaware facility complies with OSHA?s Process Safety Management Rule (29 CFR 1910.119), applicable Ohio and federal EPA regulations, and applicable Coastguard and Department of Transportation requirements.  PPG also follows the Responsible Care? Codes of Management Practice, including the Responsible Care? Community Awareness Code of Management Practice.  PPG?s own EH&S Requirements Documents, such as Emergency Response Planning & Follow-up and Addressing Community Concerns, require each manufacturing plant to have a pro-active community awareness and emergency response program to handle emergencies that might happen in that facility.  All of these activities form an integral part of PPG?s overall Environment, Health and Safety Policy, whose goal is to ?market, distribute and manufacture products globally in a responsible manner that protects employees, neighbors, customers and the environment.?\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nTrained personnel and environment, health and safety measures are included in all phases of the PPG Delaware operation.  Detailed engineering and design standards are used in all phases of the design and modification process.  These standards may include national c"

Employees at the facility receive job-appropriate training.  Training includes periodic retraining, as necessary.   Safety, environmental, operating and training procedures are subject to annual reviews, at a minimum, and updates, as appropriate.  Additional systems are in place to review proposed changes and assure that any new training requirements are met.  Process Hazard Analyses are used to assure a detailed review for hazards in each operating unit on a minimum frequency of five years, and when major modifications are made to the process.  For processes not covered under the PSM standard, hazard assessments are used as needed.  Training occurs on a regular basis, and procedures are reviewed annually.\n\nThe PPG Delaware facility has an array of maintenance and inspection programs that minimize the possibility of equipment or piping failures.  Periodic equipment inspections are performed to assure the equipment integrity as defined by the Steel Tank Institute (STI).  Equipment inspections utilize procedures such as proof testing where safeguard systems are forced to function in a controlled manner.  This assures that the safeguards will function if they are ever needed.  Preventive and predictive maintenance programs are utilized and can include vibration monitoring, infrared images to detect differences in temperature, inspections by independent experts, inspections by insurance specialists and a root-cause analysis program. Maintenance personnel and supervisors are included in many of the training and testing programs that the operators utilize.  Additional training and procedures have been developed for activities that are specific to maintenance.  \n\nFive-year accident history:\n\nThere have been no releases in the past 5 years that resulted in an on-sit"

The plan includes procedures for responding to an acrylonitrile release, evacuating employees, notifying the local police and fire department, as well as the hospital, if needed.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nPPG is committed to the process of continuous improvement.  This commitment extends beyond production issues into the environmental and safety aspects of all operations. Changes in control instruments are made on an ongoing basis, as necessary, to assure that the most reliable and effective controls are used.
