Each level of management is directly responsible for the implementation of the OPPD accident prevention program and responsible for the safety performance of their employees. An active safety management team comprised of members from all departments and all levels of management participates in process hazard analysis and safety implementation review. OPPD has a comprehensive training program that includes training of on-site hazardous waste operations and emergency response (HAZWOPER) personnel to the 29 CFR 1910.120 technician level. In addition, OPPD conducts ammonia general awareness training and training for contractors as to the hazards of ammonia and their responsibilities in emergency response.\n\nOPPD\u00bfs Nebraska City site is a coal fired power plant. This site is located in a rural, sparsely populated section of Otoe County. The plant uses one listed toxic chemical, anhydrous ammonia, above threshold quantities. Anhydrous ammonia is stored and used in the operation of the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) pollution prevention system. Upon analysis of the Worst case scenarios, anhydrous ammonia was potentially released in quantities sufficient to reach off-site receptors via air dispersion routes. \n\nThe worst case scenario included the release of chemical from the ammonia storage which is a high volume storage vessel. Ammonia's worst-case release volume was 53,300 pounds that being the entire quantity of the ammonia storage tank. Based on the criteria in 40 CFR 68.10, anhydrous ammonia does potentially reach offsite residences at a distance of 4.5 miles that being the toxic endpoint for anhydrous ammonia\u00bfs worst case scenario radii, and 1.5 miles for the alternate case scenario.\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia process is a new process associated with the construction of a new power plant (NC2) and consequently does not have an accid"

Additional measures were necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accidental release and these measures included coordination with the potential off-site emergency responders and near-by municipalities. Active mitigation includes an emergency shut off system and excess flow valves. In the event of fire, explosion, or release of the regulated substance, anhydrous ammonia: entry within the distance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to public emergency responders. Therefore, public emergency responders that are not HAZWOPER trained as technicians will not enter the area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated in the RMP. These issues will be discussed annually during the emergency response training.\n\nThe alternate case scenario involves the release of anhydrous during tanker truck unloading as a consequence of 3 inch inner bore diameter pipe break or release from a pressure relief valve associated with this piping. The anhydrous ammonia is delivered to the receiving loop of the system which is maintained at a pressure less than or equal to 300 psi. The calculations for the anhydrous ammonia alternate scenario portray the release of anhydrous ammonia assuming a release rate of 1800 pounds per minute. Response time for the on-site HAZWOPER personnel given donning requirements for personal protective equipment and assemblage of response teams is estimated to be 10 minutes. Even with these estimates, the alternate case toxic endpoint radii does reach public receptors and residences. These assumptions are very conservative given the realization that the overpressure would be shutdown as soon as a tanker truck spill was occurring.  However, assuming multiple failures -- including failure of the anhydrous ammonia overpressure shutdown system; this alternate scenario has been developed.\n\nAlarm systems and emergency response are dir"

Re-entry with personal protective equipment including respiratory protection and monitoring instrumentation is required if the ambient atmosphere ammonia levels exceed 25 parts per million. Emergency response is coordinated with the Nebraska City Fire Department, Otoe County Emergency Planning Committee, and the Fremont County Emergency Planning Committee. A written Emergency Response Plan is provided to these emergency response organizations. Both emergency response and emergency medical procedures are documented and are emphasized during emergency response training on-site. Spill response kits are available onsite to be used by the on-site HAZWOPER technician trained personnel to handle spills that exceed those associated with normal operations and maintenance activities. OPPD is continually evaluating the hazards of operation and proceeding to fully integrate OSHA (for the contractor work force), EPA, and State of Nebraska requirements.  Additionally, OPPD plans to install a deluge water suppression system to further improve mitigation capability. \n\nThe anhydrous ammonia use constitutes a Program Level 3 and OPPD has a Program Level 3 Prevention Program for anhydrous ammonia."
