The Facility Policy\n\n    The owner, and employees of Barr Farms, are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of  \n    anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the  \n    local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to  \n    people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information.\n\n   - This facility is a privately owned commercial farm.\n   - Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production  \n     nutrients. \n   - The maximum quantity stored would be 92,000 pounds.  The maximum quantity handled would be the  \n     storage tank of 92,000 pounds.\n\n3. The accidental release prevention program.\n\n    The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of  \n    Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the   \n    standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111,  \n    \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".\n\n4. The Five-year Accident History \n\n   a. There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n   - Have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility: nor to our knowledge,  \n     have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or  \n     environmental damage.\n\n\n5. The Emergency action program.\n\n   a.  The facility is included in the community emergency response plan developed under 42 U.S.C. 11003.\n        This is the hazardous material plan developed and maintained by our Local Emergency Planning\n        Committee (LEPC).\n\n   b.  Barr Farms has elected not to respond and has coordinated the emergency response with LaPorte\n        County "
