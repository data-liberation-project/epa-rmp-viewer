The information resides in a controlled electronic system that is updated regularly.  All Process Safety Information (PSI) is verified at each scheduled process hazards analysis.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazards Analysis:\n\nEvery five years, process hazards analyses (PHAs) are conducted in each process.  The HazOp method is used to conduct PHAs.  Findings are identified, prioritized and then promptly corrected.  The information is shared with personnel who are impacted by the findings.  The action items and completion schedules are available through the electronic system.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\nOperating procedures that address normal and abnormal operating situations are in place.  Deviations from established operating limits and the consequences of these deviations are clearly identified and easily referenced.   The procedures are reviewed annually to assure accuracy.\n\n\n\nTraining:\n\nTraining on these operating procedures is ongoing to assure that operators know and understand the safe operation of their unit and that they understand the necessary actions for abnormal situations.  Employee training is documented and tracked through a network system.  The system allows specific training needs to be identified as well as tracks the completion of required modules. \n\n\n\nContractor Safety:\n\nControl of contractor activity in operating areas is well established.
