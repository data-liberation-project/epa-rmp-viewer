      "SummaryText": "e and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario were identified and analyzed to determine the distance to endpoint for each assumed release. To perform the required offsite consequence analysis for the facility, the very conservative EPA RMP*Comp model was used. \n\nThe worst case release scenario involves the complete rupture of one 35,000-gallon storage tank. A maximum release of 160,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia over a 10-minute period was considered. The released quantity was not limited by a system of administrative controls. Under worst case meteorological conditions of Class F stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, ammonia could travel up to 4.4 miles before reaching the specified toxic endpoint level of 0.14 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative case release scenario involves the release of 19,400 pounds of ammonia over 30 minutes from the failure of a tank flange gasket. Under typical meteorological conditions of Class D stability and 3 m/s wind speed, ammonia could travel up to 0.2 miles before reaching the specified toxic end point level of 0.14 mg/L.\n\n \nIV. Description of Release Prevention Program\n\nProcess Safety Information - DP&L maintains documentation of safety information concerning chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs and specifications associated with the process.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis - DP&L conducted detailed analyses of the process to ensure that hazards associated with the process were identified and controlled effectively. The What-If analysis methodology was used to assess the potential hazards of the process. The study was conducted by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, control logics, and process operations. Findings resulting from the analysis were addressed. The What-If analysis was conducted on September 5-6, 2001, and a pre-startup safety review was conducted on April 5, 2002.\n\nOperating Procedures - DP&L has established and maintains procedures"

Any corrective actions required as a result of the audits will be promptly and safely implemented.\n\nIncident Investigations - Any incident that results in or could reasonably result in a significant release of a regulated substance is promptly investigated. Procedures ensure that investigations are undertaken to identify the circumstances leading to the incident.  Corrective action will be taken to ensure that the situation leading to the incident does not reoccur. All investigation reports will be retained for at least 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation - DP&L believes in a team approach to process safety management and accident prevention. Employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees have access to all information developed through implementation of the RMP, including information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\nContractors - DP&L develops partnerships with contractors to effectively conduct business and operate generation facilities, especially in maintenance and construction activities. Prior to selecting a contractor, DP&L evaluates the qualifications of the contractor including their safety performance.

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\n\nEnvironmental protection and enhancement are essential elements of DP&L's integrated resource management philosophy. DP&L exhibits progressive environmental leadership in managing its generating stations for the public benefit, including the production of reliable, competitively priced power. DP&L also assures that employees are aware of their environmental responsibilities, use effective environmental processes, and are held accountable for performance. \n\nDP&L management and employees will be responsible for maintaining compliance with environmental requirements and striving for environmental excellence in performing their respective duties. We will assure environmental protection and reduce risks to our employees and to the communities in which we operate through review of new developments, safe technologies, operating procedures, and emergency preparedness. All activities are conducted in accordance with current environmental and health and safety regulatory requirements.\n\nII. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe affected facility houses a selective catalytic reduction process to reduce the emissions of nitrogen oxides to the atmosphere.  The process contains an anhydrous ammonia storage facility, including two 35,450-gallon storage tanks with supporting unloading equipment, vapor compressors, piping to convey the liquid ammonia, vaporizers to convert ammonia from a liquid to a gas, and a gas dilution and injection system to inject ammonia into a selective catalytic reduction emission control system.\n\nThere is only one regulated substance at the facility - anhydrous ammonia. With two 35,450-gallon storage tanks, the maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia in the storage facility at any time is 322,000 pounds and the maximum amount contained in the largest single vessel is 161,000 pounds.\n\nIII.

It is the definition of response used in the OSHA HAZWOPER standard in 29 CFR 1910.120(a)(3).  \n\nThe standard defines \u00bfresponse\u00bf as \u00bfa response effort by employees from outside the immediate release area or by other designated responders \u00bf to an occurrence which results, or is likely to result, in an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance.\u00bf  This definition specifically excludes responses to incidental releases, which are those \u00bfwhere the substance can be absorbed, neutralized, or otherwise controlled at the time of release by employees in the immediate release area, or by maintenance personnel.\u00bf  Also excluded are those releases of hazardous substances \u00bfwhere there is no potential safety or health hazard.\u00bf  Such hazards include fire, explosion, or chemical exposure.  If the release of chemical is substantial or clearly growing in size, the leak is no longer considered incidental and employees should not respond unless they are specifically trained in response procedures and the facility has an emergency response program that meets the requirements of 40 CFR 68.95. \n\nOSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.120(q)(1) states that \u00bfEmployers who will evacuate their employees from the danger area when an emergency occurs, and who do not permit any of their employees to assist in handling the emergency, are exempt from the requirements of this paragraph if they provide an emergency action plan in accordance with Section 1910.38(a) .  .  .\u00bf   This part of the standard describes the elements of an emergency action plan.  These are (1) emergency escape procedures and emergency escape route assignments; (2) procedures to be followed by employees who remain to operate critical plant operations before they evacuate; (3) procedures to account for all employees after emergency evacuation has been completed; (4) rescue and medical duties for those employees who are to perfo"
