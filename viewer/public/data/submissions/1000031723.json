The following areas are addressed in this summary:\r\n\u00bf\u001fAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\u00bf\u001fStationary Source Activities and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\u00bf\u001fWorst-Case and Alternative-Case Release Scenarios\r\n\u00bf\u001fPrevention Program\r\n\u00bf\u001fFive-Year Accident History\r\n\u00bf\u001fEmergency Response Program\r\n\u00bf\u001fPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\nCool Pacific Land Company Inc. is committed to complying with all of the regulatory requirements of the EPA\r\nRisk Management Program. Cool Pacific has developed their Risk Management Plan / Process Safety\r\nManagement (RMP/PSM) / CalARP Manuals to document policies and address the implementation of these\r\nregulations. The PSM sections pertain to the prevention of accidental releases and include the Process Hazard\r\nAnalysis study and procedures for operating, training, maintenance, emergency response, and others. The\r\nRMP sections pertain to management systems and include the Hazard Assessment (Offsite Consequence\r\nAnalysis) Report.\r\nFederal regulations require reporting when there is a release of ammonia exceeding 100 pounds in 24 hours.\r\nState regulations require reporting when there is an accidental release of ammonia or a threat of accidental\r\nrelease of ammonia. Cool Pacific interprets this regulation as any release which poses a threat of injury above\r\nand beyond minor irritation to anyone.\r\nAll releases and near misses are to be recorded using the incident investigation forms. All releases are to be\r\nmonitored and all readings recorded. All releases and near misses are to be reviewed to develop procedures\r\nthat may prevent future incidents.\r\nAny release of more than 25 ppm may result in immediately shutting down the ammonia system depending on\r\nthe location of the release.

Releases less than 25 PPM shall result in immediately calling the Operations Manager\r\nand the Refrigeration Manager, if not on site, for instructions.\r\nThere are additional full time supervisory and operational employees such as tube operators at this facility in\r\naddition to the Refrigeration Manager that have been trained to conduct visual and audible inspections of the\r\nammonia system on a regular basis. They are instructed to report any condition that could result in an ammonia\r\nrelease immediately. An example would be excessive rust on piping or tanks. Unusual noise or ammonia\r\nodors. This team activity is the core of Cool Pacific's prevention program.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE ACTIVITIES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\nThe Cool Pacific Salinas facility provides product cooling, and short-term storage for produce.\r\nThe facilities are located in an industrial area of Salinas on a contiguous property. Ammonia is used as the\r\nrefrigerant in the Main Plant, Cooler ,Vacuum tube and Hydro Cooler Refrigeration System, Loading Dock and\r\nRoom 6 Refrigeration System, and Ice Generating Refrigeration Systems. The ammonia quantity in the MainPlant System and the Loading Dock System are interconnected by piping. The total ammonia inventory in these\r\ntwo systems exceeds the Federal and State thresholds.\r\nIn addition to the Interconnected Process 1 Main Plant and Dock Systems, the Process 2 Ice Generater system\r\nwhich is less than 10,000 lbs is located on the property. Other than this paragraph, the Ice System is addressed\r\nin the EPA RMP submission as a Level 2 second process ; and in the RMP as required by the California\r\nAccidental Release and Prevention Program (CalARP). Cool pacific has developed this program for Process 2\r\nas a Level 3 program to be consistant and reduce confusion.\r\nThe refrigeration systems are direct, mechanical closed loop refrigeration systems.

Additional modifications and updates will be completed in 2012.\r\n\r\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\r\nThe regulation requires that the Worst-Case Release Scenario use the ammonia quantity in the largest vessel\r\nor pipe.\r\nNOTE: It is important to consider that the Worst-Case Scenario is extremely unlikely to occur since this\r\nscenario does not consider any safety features of the system - in either design or operation. In addition the\r\nMain Plant System and The Dock System although combined for the Worst Case Scenario are separated by\r\nvalves being normally closed. Furthermore as the refrigerant escapes pressure will decrease reducing the\r\nrelease rate. The scenario parameters are established by the regulation to provide uniformity for dialog between\r\nthe industry, community, and regulatory agencies.\r\nThe regulation allows the facility to select the Alternate-Case Scenario which is more probable.\r\n\r\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nCool Pacific's Prevention Program is described in the RMP/PSM Manual. The RMP Prevention Program is\r\nequivalent to OSHA's Process Safety Management Program (PSM). The Prevention Program implemented by\r\nCool pacific is essential to help prevent or minimize the effects if a release occurs.\r\nKey objectives of Cool Pacific's Prevention Program are briefly described below:\r\n1) Maintain current and complete refrigeration system technical information. (Addressed under the Process\r\nSafety Information Element)\r\n2) Provide thorough team evaluation of the refrigeration system. The evaluation considers a number of\r\npotential problems including: mechanical problems, human errors, and external events (e.g., earthquakes). All\r\nsafety recommendations developed by the team are reviewed and addressed by Cool Pacific. (Addressed\r\nunder Process Hazard Analysis Element).\r\n3) Written procedures and policies that establish how the refrigeration system should be operat"

(Addressed under Operating Procedures, Mechanical\r\nIntegrity, and Incident Investigation Elements.)\r\n4) Certification of refrigeration operators to safely operate the refrigeration system. Cool Pacific certifies\r\noperators following completion of operator training and Cool Pacific's confirmation of the operator's ability to\r\napply what they have learned. (Addressed under Training Element.)\r\n5) Employee involvement in the Prevention Program. This is addressed on two levels. First, refrigeration\r\nequipment operators participate in the planning and evaluation of the Prevention Programs (e.g., Process\r\nHazard Analysis study team, writing and/or reviewing operating procedures, Incident Investigation team, etc.).\r\nThis involvement encourages ownership of the Prevention Program and positively affects the operators' day-today\r\nactivities.\r\nSecond, all Cool Pacific employees (direct hires and contract) at this facility receive ammonia awareness\r\ntraining. Additionally, they have access to the RMP/PSM information. These activities improve the overall\r\nsafety of the employees. (Both levels are addressed under the Employee Participation Element)\r\n6) Implementation of additional measures when changes are planned (procedural or mechanical). These\r\nmeasures begin before any changes are made and may include a Process Hazard Analysis, operator training,\r\nand Process Safety Information updates plus other measures required by Cool Pacific's Management of\r\nChange Procedure.\r\nIf a mechanical change is required and for maintenance contracts, Cool Pacific has a procedure for selecting a contractor based on the company's experience and safety history. Additionally, if welding, grinding, or other \"Hot\r\nWork\" occurs close to the refrigeration system, a Cool Pacific Hot Work permit is required. The purpose of the\r\npermit and the associated Hot Work procedure is to minimize the possibility of a fire.\r\nFollowing completion of a mech"

Top and mid management are trained to the (300 PPM)\r\nAir Purifying Respirator level. Responders will assist outside agencies during larger releases.\r\nDetailed plans (emergency action plans) have been developed to assist responding facility personnel. All areas\r\n(zones) inside the building can be brought under control within 20 minutes of any ammonia emergency or\r\nbreakdown if personnel are on site. Small releases can be brought under control immediately.\r\nThe emergency release response plan for all releases is to gain access to the shut down or isolation valves and\r\nswitches for the system with the release. If the system shut down areas are within the ammonia release area\r\nthe entire ammonia system may be shut down if appropriate. The appropriate shut down switches are\r\nidentified.\r\nThe Federal and Califor"
