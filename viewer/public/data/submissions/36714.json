      "SummaryText": "EUGENE/SPRINGFIELD METROPOLITAN WPCF\nRISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY \u00a7 68.155\n\nACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION \nThe Eugene/Springfield Metropolitan Water Pollution Control Facility (WPCF) places a high priority on safety.  The WPCF has an active Safety Committee consisting of union represented staff and managerial staff working together to provide a safe, healthy workplace.  Our Safety Committee has been in place since plant startup in 1984.  The overall safety record of the WPCF is very good.  Operational staff responsible for handling the regulated chemicals is very experienced and well trained.  All equipment at the facility is on a computerized preventive maintenance schedule.  WPCF management provides strong support for safety and readily provides all tools and personal protective equipment to ensure compliance with written safety procedures.  \n\nFACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nThe WPCF operates a conventional activated sludge wastewater treatment facility.  The facility went on line in 1984 and treats wastewater from a region that includes Eugene, Springfield, and the unincorporated areas of River Road and Santa Clara. The WPCF plant is sited on approximately 100 acres in northwest Eugene.  The site is bounded on the east and south by the Willamette River.  \n\nAs a part of the wastewater treatment process the toxic chemicals chlorine and sulfur dioxide are used to disinfect and dechlorinate the plant effluent before discharge to the river.  The facility was constructed with an enclosed chemical storage building equipped with a chemical scrubber system.  In the unlikely event of a chemical leak, the scrubber system will neutralize either chlorine or sulfur dioxide before it can escape to the atmosphere.  \n\nThe maximum inventory for chlorine is listed as 20 one-ton cylinders (40,000 pounds) and eight one-ton cylinders (16,000 pounds) of sulfur dioxide.  Actual inventory at any given time is much less.  Typically the facility will have about fourte"

      "SummaryText": "en (14) tons of chlorine and five (5) tons of sulfur dioxide on site.  Our standard operating procedure is to have only one cylinder of chlorine and sulfur dioxide in use at one time.  All other cylinders are either not connected or left isolated by a series of valves including the main tank valve.  Equipment used to feed the chemicals is designed specifically for the task and are constructed of compatible materials.  A strict management of change process and strong preventive maintenance program maintains the system integrity.\n\nThe facility uses about 120 tons of chlorine and about 42 tons of sulfur dioxide per year.  Shipments of the chemicals are received via trucks and flatbed trailers.  The current supplier is Jones Chemical out of Tacoma, Washington.  On the average, deliveries to the facility occur about once every 3 weeks.  \n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION\nThe Wastewater treatment facility has been in compliance with the OR-OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) rule since the enactment of the rule in 1992.  The development of the PSM documents included most of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) efforts required under the new RMP rules.  The facility is equipped with redundant safety systems including leak detectors and continuous monitoring by a Distributed Control System (DCS).  The DCS is monitored by operations staff 24/7.  Video surveillance cameras are positioned inside and outside the containment structure so the console operator can monitor tank change procedures and visually verify conditions around the area. An intrusion alarm system is in place. The leak detectors, scrubber system, and chemical process equipment are included in the computerized preventive maintenance program that includes frequent calibrations, testing, re-builds, and replacement.  Work rules are in place to direct staff and contractors in safe work practice.The structure has been evaluated by the Fire Marshall and a determination was made that fire hazards are minimal and no"

      "SummaryText": "sprinkler system retrofit was needed.  The structure was also recently given a seismic evaluation and retrofit modifications have been made to the roof of the scrubber room.   \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nNo accidental releases have occurred during the past five years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe emergency response program at the facility has been in place for many years.  The program uses the Eugene Fire Department's HAZMAT response team.  A comprehensive procedure is in place to notify the HAZMAT team via the 9-1-1 dispatch center.  The facility is equipped with an audible alarm system to notify plant staff in the unlikely event of a release.  The alarm system includes flashing lights on the exterior of the containment structure, facility-wide audible alarms using modulated tones for different alarm functions, and a Public Address (PA) system.  Traffic control gates can be used to prevent access to the area.   This includes the recreational vehicle dump site which can also be addressed using the PA system and surveillance cameras.  The system is tested on a preventive maintenance schedule.  \n\nTraining drills are conducted by the Fire Department on a scheduled basis.  The 9-1-1 dispatch center uses a Community Emergency Notification System (CENS) for the purpose of providing public notification.  The wastewater facility is enrolled in the CENS program to notify area residences should the necessity ever arise.  The HAZMAT team uses the Incident Command protocol, and the decision to implement public notification would be made by the Incident Commander on the scene.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nThe facility has not determined a need to install any additional safety systems at this time.  \nThe RMP and PSM have been included as components to our ISO 14001 Environmental Management System (EMS).  The EMS takes documented controlled steps to ensure continued review and improvement of the PSM program.  The facility is also taking the necessary steps to obtain OSH"
