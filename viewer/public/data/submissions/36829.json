      "SummaryText": "-INTRODUCTION-\nThe Cognis Corporation, Kankakee, Illinois, facility considers protection of employees, the public and the environment to be its most important responsibility.  A key element of its protection program is the development and implementation of plans to prevent accidental chemical releases.  In addition, if an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to respond in an organized and effective manner.\n\nThe Cognis Corporation, Kankakee, Illinois, facility accident prevention and emergency response programs have been developed in accordance with federal and state regulations, industry standards, and coordination from Kankakee County emergency response organizations.  Although the facility's programs have been highly successful - the facility has never had a significant chemical release - the facility continually seeks ways to improve its prevention and response programs.\n\nThis document, the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the facility, was prepared to comply with federal regulatory requirements regarding the prevention of accidental chemical releases (40 CFR Part 68 Accidental Release Prevention Requirements).  The purpose of the regulation is to reduce the potential for an accidental chemical release and strengthen emergency response planning at the facility and within the community.  The RMP describes the incident at the facility which would have the most catastrohpic effects (the worst case) and several scenarios of lesser magnitude (alternative cases).  Although it is highly unlikely for the worse case described in the report to occur, worst case information is provided to support conservative emergency response planning.  In this way, the community is well prepared to respond to the lesser magnitude scenarios which are more likely to occur.\n\nAreas that could be impacted by an accidental chemical release were identified using PHAST software.  PHAST is a very sophisticated, EPA-recognized program specifically designed for accidental ch"
