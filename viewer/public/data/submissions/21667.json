Orienta Location\n\n\n\nCertification for the Risk Management Plan Program 2, Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n     To the best of the undersigned's knowledge. The following information \n     submitted is true, accurate, and complete.\n\n     _________________________          _________________________\n     Signature                                                         Printed Name\n\n     _________________________          _________________________\n       Title                                                     Date\n\nA risk management plan has been implemented at Johnston Grain Company's Orienta facility to provide a contingency plan in the event of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  This plan has been developed to prevent accidental release through responsible handling and proper storage of the product.  Johnston's will also ensure that employees receive the necessary training and that proper safety equipment is provided.  Johnston's will also make sure that the surrounding community is aware of our preparedness in the event of an accident.\n\nJohnston's Orienta facility is a full service, country elevator, which sells feed, seed, fertilizer, as well as agricultural chemicals.  The only substance subject to regulation under RMP and above the threshold quantities is anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed from our facility as a crop fertilizer only.  Our facility has one  storage tank that has 30000 gallons capacity and is filled to only 85%, this equals 140000 pounds of ammonia. We also have 20, 1000 gallon Nurse tanks also filled to a maximum of 85% full at our location.  The combined capacity of all tanks at this location is 50000 gallons, or 233,333 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. \n\nThis facility has a \"site safety coordinator\", all Johnston coordinators are given training to monitor the day to day safe work activities, maintain the required regulatory record keeping, conduct s"

The site safety coordinator acts as the location's emergency contact. \n\nAs required by EPA guidelines the following worst-case release and alternative release scenarios have been devised.\n\nWorst Case Scenario:\n\nOur worst cast scenario is the loss of the total contents of the 30000 gallon storage tank, when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), released as a  gas over 10 minutes, resulting in total vaporization.  The maximum quantity released would be 140000  pounds.  According to DEGADIS modeling, this release (distance from point of dispersion to 200 PPM) would have off-site impacts, and would travel 1.2 miles.  It should be noted that Johnston's has never had a release of an entire stationary anhydrous ammonia storage tank from any of its facilities.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario:\n\nThe most common alternative release scenario from our facility would be in the failure of a 1-inch transfer hose and release of approximately 2901 pounds of anhydrous ammonia over a two-minute period.  Under the worst weather conditions the contents would travel .22 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  It should be noted that Johnston's has not had a release of this type from any facility in the past.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with ASTM standards and ASME codes.  This facility complies with the ANSI K61.1 standards, OSHA (29 CFR 1910.111), EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, and all applicable federal, state, and local codes and regulations.\n\nOur ammonia system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, and manual shutoffs.  The load-out risers used for the purpose of filling the nurse tanks are protected by excess flow valves to s"

All main storage tank valves are locked when not is use.\n.\nOur ammonia facility is inspected on a regular basis with maintenance and preventative maintenance scheduled and documented.  Liquid and vapor valves, hoses, excess flow valves, gauges, and relief valves are replaced when necessary and according to the guidelines in the ANSI standards.\n\nTraining is provided to all employees at least annually, whenever there is change in the process, or whenever competency with the regulations is questioned.  The training consists of classroom lecture, current videos, testing and certification, and on the job training.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nThere have been no accidents involving anhydrous ammonia that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, including evacuations on or off site.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our ammonia system, it is our policy to notify the local community fire department and request that they respond to the emergency.  In preparation for this, we have coordinated with all of the local agencies by providing information and offering tours to ensure that they are familiar with and are properly prepared for an incident at our facility.  This will help ensure that the community has the strategy for responding to and mitigating the threat posed by an ammonia release.  This complies with the requirement for our facility to be included in the community emergency response plan prepared under EPCRA and coordinated with our LEPC.  \n\nJohnston Grain has an Emergency Response and Contingency Plan for our facilities that include provisions for public notification, initial medical care, evacuations, and LEPC coordination.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nWe do not plan to make any changes to the physical site.  We will continue to provide our employees with ongoing annual training to ensure that they are current with safe ammonia transfer and handling proc"
