All applicable procedures of the EPA Prevention Program are adhered to.  Dole Fresh Vegetables' emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans which are tailored to the facility and to the emergency response services available in the community.  It is also in compliance with EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\n\n\nThis facility previously consisted of a Value Added Facility of Dole's which prepared to cool, clean and package fresh vegetables, primarily for salads.  These processes are no longer operational at the facility and chlorine is no longer used or stored at the facility.  \n\n\n\nThe entire facility is now designated as a facility that cools, stores and distributes product for shipment.  The ammonia systems for both facilities are considered separate processes.  Anhydrous Ammonia is stored at this location.  The Value Added Facility uses 30,000lbs of anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration.  The Cooler uses 26,000 lbs of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n-High level of training of the operators\n\n-Preventive Maintenance Program\n\n-Use of State-of-the Art process and safety equipment\n\n-Performance of a process hazard analysis of equipment and procedures\n\n-Implementation of an auding and inspection program\n\n\n\nChemical specific prevention steps include availability of proper PPE worn by the operators during connection/disconnection of ammonia supply, and awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of this toxic substance.\n\n\n\nThe facility has its own emergency action plan.  This plan includes an emergency response decision tree and notification plan.  Emergency response drills and drill evacuations are conducted at least twice a year; emergency operations and response are also reviewe"
