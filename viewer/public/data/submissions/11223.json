Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at the Sale Ranch Gas Plant are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  However, if such a release were to occur, we are completely coordinated with Stanton Fire Department, which provides trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activity is operation of a Natural Gas Processing Plant.  We have seven regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Methane, Ethane, Propane, Butane, Isobutane [Propane, 2-methyl], Pentane, and Isopentane  [Butane, 2-methyl-].  The regulated substances at our facility are components of the natural gas feed to the plant, the extracted liquid product, and the residue natural gas.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Methane at our facility is 18,000 lb while Ethane, Propane, Butane, Isobutane [Propane, 2-methyl], Pentane, and Isopentane  [Butane, 2-methyl-] are present at our facility in maximum quantities of 87,000 lb, 170,000 lb, 110,000 lb, 28,000 lb, 44,000 lb and 37,000 lb, respectively.\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo evaluate the worst case and alternative release scenarios, we have used EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.

      "SummaryText": "vide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances involves a catastrophic release from the \"Gas Plant and Associated Operations\" process.  The scenario involves the release of 203,809 lb of a flammable mixture containing Ethane, Propane, Butane, Isobutane [Propane, 2-methyl], Pentane, and Isopentane  [Butane, 2-methyl-].  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the maximum distance of 0.47 miles is obtained, corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances involves a release from the \"Gas Plant and Associated Operations\" process.  The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Explosion.  The scenario involves the release of 62,170 lb of a flammable mixture containing Ethane, Propane, Butane, Isobutane [Propane, 2-methyl], Pentane, and Isopentane  [Butane, 2-methyl-].  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 PSI overpressure is 0.21 miles.\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out in EPA's RMP (Risk Management Plan) regulations (40 CFR Part 68).  The Sale Ranch Gas Plant is subject to OSHA's PSM (Process Safety Management) regulations (29 CFR 1910.119).  We also have an air operating permit under Title V of the Clean Air Act.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nThe Sale Ranch Gas Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment d"
