This is done in accordance with the USEPA regulations under 40 CFR Part 68 and with the corresponding regulations under OSHA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material and if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to Rohm and Haas employees, the public and the environment.  This objective will be accomplished by utilizing general good operating procedures, providing appropriate training to all employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary, with the local emergency response providers.  Rohm and Haas?s management is committed to providing the resources necessary to implement this policy.\n\nFacility Description\nRohm and Haas is located in Ringwood, Illinois and operates primarily as a manufacturer of specialty chemicals.  Four chemicals, ammonia, vinyl acetate, vinylidene chloride, and toluene di-iscoyanate are utilized at the facility in sufficient quantities to be subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68, RMP.\n                                                                                                                                                                            Consequence Analysis\nThe Risk Management Program requires facilities to evaluate the impact of a release of the regulated chemicals under well-defined conditions.  Two types of releases must be considered; first, a ?worst case? must be examined and secondly, a release that is more likely to occur.  These incidents are known as the worst case and alternative re"

      "SummaryText": "lease scenarios. \nThe regulations require that the worst case consider the effects of the rupture of a vessel (or pipe) that contains the maximum amount of the chemical that is being examined.  The chemical is then presumed to evaporate (if released as a liquid) and dissipate as it moves away from the release site.\nThe regulation defines the conditions under which the evaporated material dissipates.  Conservative assumptions are made regarding the temperature, wind speed and the tendency for ?mixing? to occur in the atmosphere.  The assumptions used are such that the predicted concentration of the chemical represents an over estimate of what would actually occur.  \nThe alternative release scenario is one that is considered to be more likely to occur.  The alternative release scenarios provided within this RMP have been developed by considering the following: previous incidents at the facility (e.g., hose leaks, seal failures, safety valve releases) that have involved chemicals, items that have been identified through the HAZOP process and those associated with the chemical industry in general.  The RMP regulations provide for the use of assumptions influencing dispersion that are more likely to occur during an alternative release scenario. \nThe worst case consequence analysis that was performed for each compound indicated that there is a potential for concentrations to exceed the endpoints defined by the regulations in the event of an incident.  For example, a catastrophic release of vinylidene chloride from the storage tank (defined by the RMP regulations as the worst case) would impact the surrounding community.  \nThe alternative release scenarios that were developed for each chemical regulated under the RMP regulations indicated that the Impact zone would be significantly reduced by comparison to that predicted for the worst case release scenario.  Given that the alternative release scenarios represent events more likely to occur, the reduced impact area is one m"
