The management and employees of the Ringold facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of Acetylene. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate the any release and minimize the impact of the release to the community and the environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The facilities primary operation is the manufacturing, storage and distribution of Acetylene. Acetylene is delivered in trailers containing a large number of cylinders manifolded together or manufactured by the addiotion of Calcuim Carbide into water in a reactor vessel. A chemical reaction takes place and the Acetylene is compressed into cylinders containing an inert filler material and acetone. The Acetylene dissolves into the acetone in the cylinder. Each cylinder is checked for weight of Acetylene to insure that they have the proper amount of product. Cylinders are removed from the fill lines and placed into storage for shipment.
