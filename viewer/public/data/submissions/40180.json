Acetylene is delivered in trailers containing a large number of cylinders manifolded together or manufactured by the addiotion of Calcuim Carbide into water in a reactor vessel. A chemical reaction takes place and the Acetylene is compressed into cylinders containing an inert filler material and acetone. The Acetylene dissolves into the acetone in the cylinder. Each cylinder is checked for weight of Acetylene to insure that they have the proper amount of product. Cylinders are removed from the fill lines and placed into storage for shipment.
