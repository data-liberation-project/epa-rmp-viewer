This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident protection, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nThe Thomasma No. 8 Facility, located approximately 17 miles south of Mirando City in Zapata County, Texas, produces natural gas liquids from natural gas.  These natural gas liquids are comprised primarily of pentane, propane, butane, and heavier hydrocarbons, some of which are regulated flammable substances.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThere are no toxic chemicals stored at the Thomasma No. 8 Facility above the EPA Threshold Quantity.  The threshold quantity is the level set by the EPA for each toxic or flammable chemical which if stored at the site requires compliance with the EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations.  Generally, if the amount of a substance stored on-site is less than the threshold quantity, there is little danger to the public.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nBecause the process at the Thomasma No. 8 Facility which is regulated by the EPA RMP rule is not subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation, no additional steps for accidental release prevention are required.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidental releases at the Thomasma No. 8 Facility that have occurred in the past 5 years that have resulted in offsite effects.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATON\n\nEmergency response procedures have been coordinated with the Zapata County Fire Department.  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incid"

However, the facility continually looks for improvements, both to the process and to safety issues at the facility.  Our company is very active in promoting coordination between the local emergency response agencies and our facility personnel.  Ongoing communication between our facility and the emergency responders is a integral part of our operations."
