This review used U.S.G.S maps as a data source.\nPopulation within the area of potential impact was calculated using the most recent census as well as on site observation and visual count of homes and businesses in the path of any Plume. All offsite consequences were calculated using the EPA Risk Management Guidance for Wastewater Plants.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThis Facility has not experienced an offsite accident in the past Five Years.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Facility maintains up to date Safety Information in the form of Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS).\nInventory in the form of Chlorine is maintained at level at or below the intended maximum quantity on hand.
