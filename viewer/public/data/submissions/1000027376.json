              "Description": "Management System ? U.S. Oil, a division of U.S. Venture, Inc., has a management program in place that assigns overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the RMP Program at Fox River Terminal to a qualified individual or position of responsibility. It clearly delineates accountability and responsibilities for any elements where responsibilities are delegated.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information - Up-to-date process safety information is maintained for use by employees operating the covered process in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.65, including the following:\n\n\n\n- MSDS for butane that contains toxicity information, permissible exposure limits, physical data, reactivity data, thermal and chemical stability data and synergistic effects from mixing process flows.\n\n-Process chemistry and maximum intended inventory data for the covered process.\n\n-Safe operating limits and evaluation of consequences of deviations from these limits for the covered process.\n\n- Covered process equipment information consisting of materials of construction; piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs); electric classification; relief system design and design basis; ventilation system design; design codes and standards employed; and safety systems (interlocks,).\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) - A PHA has been performed for the Program 3 covered process at U.S. Oil Fox River Terminal in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.67. The PHA was performed using the What-if/Checklist method and the HAZOP method. The PHA identified the hazards associated with butane and the covered process; causes of potential accidental release scenarios; safeguards used to prevent accidental releases; and methods used to detect, monitor or control accidental releases. Any critical issues identified during the PHA have been documented and resolved in a timely manner. The PHA will be revalidated and updated once every five years following completion of the initial PHA.\n\n\n\nOperating procedures - Detailed and up-to-date process operating procedures have been developed and are maintained for the butane storage and blending process in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.69. Operating procedures provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involving a covered process in a manner consistent with process safety information and are readily accessible to employees involved in a covered process. Operating procedures will be reviewed and certified annually to ensure that they remain current and accurate.\n\n\n\nOperating procedures cover each operating phase of the covered process including initial system startup, normal operation, temporary operations, emergency shutdown and conditions that require them, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup following a turnaround or emergency shutdown. Operating procedures also incorporate or reference relevant process safety information including the following:\n\n\n\n- Process operating limits (including consequences of deviations and steps to correct or avoid such deviations) - Safety and health considerations (including properties and hazards of covered chemical, precautions necessary to prevent exposure, control measures to be taken upon physical contact or airborne exposure, quality control for raw materials, and control of regulated substance inventories).\n\n- Safety systems and their functions.\n\n\n\nTraining - New employees working with a covered process will receive initial training in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.71. The training includes an overview of the process and emphasizes process operating procedures, safe work practices, health and safety hazards, and emergency operations including shutdown. \n\n\n\nRefresher training is provided at a minimum of once every three years to all employees working with the covered process. Documentation is maintained for each employee to ensure that he/she received and understood the required training.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity - A mechanical integrity program has been developed in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.73 for covered process equipment. Employees involved in the maintenance of the covered process receive additional training, which includes an overview of the process, its hazards, and applicable procedures to ensure that the employee can perform the job in a safe manner.\n\n\n\nWritten procedures have been developed to ensure that the covered process equipment is properly maintained, tested, and inspected at regular, scheduled intervals and that such activities are thoroughly documented. Maintenance, inspection and testing procedures and frequencies are consistent with applicable manufacturer's recommendations and follow accepted engineering practices. Any equipment deficiencies identified during maintenance, inspection or testing are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change (MOC) - A written MOC procedure has been implemented to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and operating procedures for the covered process in accordance with 40 CFR 68.75. The MOC procedure does not apply to \"replacements in kind\" which are defined as replacements that satisfy the original design specifications (e.g., replace a pressure reducing valve with a new identical valve supplied by the original equipment manufacturer).\n\n\n\nPrior to introducing a change, the MOC procedure is implemented to ensure the following:\n\n\n\n- The technical basis for the change and its impact on health and safety have been fully evaluated;\n\n- Affected operating procedures and applicable process safety information have been updated accordingly; and\n\n- The schedule for implementing the change has been developed and required authorizations have been obtained.\n\n\n\nThe MOC procedure requires that all employees involved in operating or maintaining the modified process be informed of the change and trained accordingly prior to startup of the modified process.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) - PSSRs are performed in accordance with 40 CFR 68.77 for new covered processes and for modified covered processes when the modification is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information. The PSSR confirms the following prior to introducing a regulated substance into a process:\n\n\n\n- Equipment and construction satisfy design specifications;\n\n- Safety, operation, maintenance and emergency procedure have been developed and are adequate;\n\n- A PHA has been performed for new covered processes, and all critical recommendations have been resolved or implemented prior to startup;\n\n- The MOC procedure has been completed for the process modifications; and \n\n- Training for all employees involved in operating or maintaining the new or modified process has been performed.\n\n\n\nCompliance Safety Audits - RMP Program compliance is confirmed through safety audits that are performed at least once every three years in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.79. The audits are completed by at least one person knowledgeable in the process. A report of the findings is to be generated following the audit, and all deficiencies and/or recommendations are promptly addressed and the resolution is documented. The two most recent safety audit reports are maintained at the facility.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation - Specific incident investigation, reporting, and documentation procedures have been implemented and are followed in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.81.  These procedures are enacted in response to any incident involving a covered process that did or could have reasonably resulted in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. Under EPA RMP, a catastrophic release is defined as a major uncontrolled emission, fire, or explosion, involving one or more regulated substances, that presents imminent and substantial endangerment to public health and the environment.\n\n\n\nThe incident investigation procedure is initiated as soon as possible and no later than 48 hours following an incident. A team is established to perform the incident investigation and always includes at least one person knowledgeable in the process, a contract employee if the incident involves work by a contractor, and other persons with appropriate qualifications to investigate an accident.\n\n\n\nFollowing the investigation, a written report is prepared that summarizes the following information at a minimum: date of the incident; date the investigation began; description of the incident and any contributing factors; and any recommendations resulting from the investigation. When completed, all affected personnel, including contract employees, review the report. Incident investigation reports are to be maintained at the facility for a minimum of five years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation - A written employee participation plan has been implemented that provides employees with access to PHA and all other information developed under the RMP regulation in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.83. The employee participation plan describes employee participation in conducting PHA and in implementing all other RMP elements.\n\n\n\nHot Work Permit - An authorization and permit program for hot-work operations has been prepared and implemented for hot work conducted on or near a covered process in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.85. The permit is used to document that fire prevention and protection standards in 29 CFR 1910.252(a) have been implemented prior to beginning the hot-work operations. Also, the permit lists the date(s) authorized for hot work and identifies the equipment to be worked on or near.\n\n\n\nContractors - A contractor safety program in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.87 covers all contractors performing maintenance or repair, turnaround, major renovation, or specialty work on or adjacent to a covered process. The safety performance of each contractor is evaluated prior to selection. Each contractor employee is informed of the known potential fire, explosion hazard related to work on a covered process as well as the relevant provisions of the emergency response program. Procedures are in place to control the entrance, presence, and exit of contract employees in covered process areas. Periodically, the performance of the contract owner or operator is evaluated while working in or adjacent to a covered process.\n\n\n\n",

If a fire emergency were to occur, it is the facility's policy to notify the Green Bay Fire Department, (distance to closest fire station from terminal is 1.4 miles by road) as well as the Brown County Local Emergency Planning Committee, as necessary.  All personnel at this facility are 40-hour HAZWOPER certified and receive annual hazardous materials refresher training.  \n\n\n\nThe U.S. Venture, Inc. - U.S. Oil Fox River Terminal is a bulk petroleum terminal that stores refined petroleum products, including gasoline, diesel oil, and denatured ethanol.  Two pressurized, 30-gallon, above ground storage tanks, as well as butane blending equipment have been installed and will begin operating at the facility in April 2012.  The maximum quantity of butane that will be stored onsite is 51,000 gallons, which exceeds the 10,000 pound threshold quantity, thus subjecting the facility to RMP requirements.  \n\n\n\nThe process covered under Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations consists of the butane blending system, which includes the two storage tanks and associated piping. The facility's worst case scenario is the failure of one of the system's 30,000 gallon storage tanks when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% at 77 Degrees Fahrenheit) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. The resulting distance to the endpoint (1PSI overpressure) extends off-site 0.4 miles and includes public receptors. The facility's alternate (most likely resulting in off-site impacts) release scenario is a vapor cloud explosion. The resulting distance to the endpoint (0.1 miles at 1PSI overpressure) extends off-site, but affects no residential areas. The U.S. Venture, Inc. - U.S. Oil Fox River Terminal complies with the U. S. Environ"

To date, this facility has never had an accident involving butane that has resulted in deaths, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place. In the event of an emergency involving the U.S. Venture, Inc. -  U.S. Oil Fox River Terminal's butane blending system, it is the policy of the facility to initially contact the Green Bay Fire Department and request their assistance.  The facility emergency response plans have been coordinated with the fire department and the Brown County LEPC. The Green Bay Fire Department is aware of the butane blending process.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, U.S. Venture, Inc. is updating the facility alarm system so that in the event of a butane related emergency, a different alarm will sound than in the event of an emergency in other areas of the terminal.  (The alarm is tied into the emergency shut-down for the butane equipment.)  A camera will be installed to monitor any activities at the butane offload skid and all components of the butane storage and blending process will be enclosed in a locked, fenced area, restricting access to authorized individuals.\n\n"
