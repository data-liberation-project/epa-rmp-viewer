This\ncommitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training\npersonnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our\nprocesses. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of\nregulated substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control\nand contain the release.\n\nThe A&M gas plant, located 5 miles south of FM 60 on FM 50 in Burleson County Texas,\nseperates condensate from a stream of natural gas. Some of the chemicals produced include\nethane, propane, butane and other natural gas liquids.  The plant also stabilizes condensate\ntrucked in from field locations.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThere are no toxic chemicals stored at the A&M gas plant above the EPA Threshold Quantity.\nThe threshold quantity is the level set by EPA for each toxic or flammable chemical which if\nstored at the site requires compliance with the EPA's Risk Management Program regulations.\nGenerally, if the amount of a substance stored on-site is less than the threshold quantity, there is\nlittle danger to the public.\n\nThere are several flammable substances stored at the site above the 10,000 pound threshold\nquantity for flammables. Examples of flammables at the site include ethane, propane and butane.\nThe worst-case scenario associated with a release of flammable materials is a vapor cloud\nexplosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of a 83,000 gallon storage tank containing natural\ngas liquids (condensate). Based on EPA analysis, the distance away from the plant affected in this\nworst-case scenario would be approximately 0.60 miles.  \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe A&M gas plant has a very active accident prevention program in place, primarily based on\nthe "

A summary of some of the accident\nprevention programs that are in place follows.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe A&M gas plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe\noperation of the processes. These documents include material safety data sheets for all chemicals\non-site, up-to-date process and instrumentation drawings, equipment data sheets on all vessels\nand equipment and process parameter safety limits. This information, in combination with written\nprocedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance\nactivities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety\nfeatures in the process are not compromised.\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe A&M gas plant has a very comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the\nvarious processes are identified and controlled. Each process is systematically examined to\nidentify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. The\nwhat-if/checklist analysis technique is used to perform these evaluations. The analyses are\nconducted using a team of people with operating, maintenance, engineering and safety experience.\nThis team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process, as well as accident prevention and\nmitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures\nwhen the team believes such measures are necessary. All approved recommendations from the\nPHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. \n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate\nsignificantly from the original design and to ensure that new technology is used where\nappropriate, the A&M gas plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.\nThese periodic reviews will be conducted at least every 5 years.\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe A&M gas plant maint"

These procedures are used as reference by experienced operators, and provide a basis\nfor consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and certified\nas current and accurate.\n\n\nTraining\n\nOur employees at the A&M plant have an average experience of 18 years. This level of experience\nprovides a great level of expertise throughout the facility. Ongoing training is accomplished\nthrough routine safety meetings, scheduled training in new processes and refresher training on\noperating procedures. \n\n\nContractors\n\nThe A&M gas plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased\nmaintenance or to assist with specialized projects. Contractors are advised about safety and health\nhazards, emergency response requirements and safe work practices prior to their beginning work.\nIn addition, the company evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the\nselection of a contractor. Gas plant personnel routinely monitor contractor performance to ensure\nthat contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe A&M gas plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain our equipment in a\nsafe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include inspections, tests and\ncorrections of identified deficiencies. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that\nequipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment operates within acceptable limits. If\na deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back\nin service or they will determine what actions are necessary to ensure safe operation of the\nequipment.\n\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe A&M gas plant has long-standing safe work practices to help ensure worker and process\nsafety. Examples of these include lockout/tagout to ensure isolation of energy sources for\nequipment that is being worked on, a"

These procedures (and others), along with training of affected\npersonnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed\nsafely.\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe A&M gas plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.\nThis system requires changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology\n(including operating conditions), procedures and other facility changes be properly reviewed and\nauthorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are\nin place to manage any new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been\ncompromised by the change. Operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary\ntraining on the change.\n\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe A&M gas plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have\nresulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss or\npersonal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective\nactions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.\n\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at the A&M gas plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe\noperation. The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of\naccidental releases of specific regulated substances in the facility.\n\nThe A&M gas plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2)\nquickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of a release.
