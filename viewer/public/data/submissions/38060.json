In\r\nresponse to the congressional mandate, EPA promulgated the Risk Management Program Rule\r\n(RMP Rule).\r\n     The RMP Rule identified covered facilities on the basis of use/storage of threshold quantities\r\nof any of a long list of chemicals (see 40 CFR Part 68.130, Table 1) and required those facilities to\r\nsubmit to EPA a completed RMP by June 21, 1999.  Further, the RMP Rule requires that all covered\r\nfacilities must review all aspects of their respective plans and re-submit to EPA RMP updates every\r\nfive years thereafter as long as a facility is covered by the Rule.\r\n\r\nFINDINGS (as of June, 2004)\r\n     A second compliance audit and a hazard review was completed in June, 2004 for the City of\r\nWestwego's water treatment plant  as required by the RMP rule and the appropriate offsite\r\nconsequence assessment (OCA) modeling was re-visited  done as well.  No significant problems\r\nwere noted by those efforts.  The OCA continues to predict a very small impact area such that area\r\nresidents/occupants should have little to no concern relative to the subject facility.\r\n     A dress rehearsal of the implementation of the Emergency Response Plan component of the\r\nsubject facility's RMP was held on June 18, 2004 to ensure that the first responders, e.g., local police\r\nand fire department personnel were properly trained and coordinated for first response conditions\r\nand circumstan"
