These changes include:\n\n-  Updating the the RMP pursuant to the requirements of 40 CFR 68, Section ? 68.190(b)(5) due to a change in the facility's Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI) operating scenarios and the associated TDI vapor control system.  A revised Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) and hazard review was conducted in anticipation of this change, which occurred in August of 2004.\n-  Correcting the RMP Program Level for TDI operations based out of existing Low Pressure Storage Tank D-15-22.  Previous RMP submittals from the Stolthaven Houston Terminal indicated that TDI storage and handling was a RMP Level 3 Process.  In fact, because TDI operations at Stolthaven Houston are not subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements, and they are not presently eligible for RMP Program Level 1 coverage, the TDI covered process at Stolthaven Houston is subject to Program Level 2 coverage as described in 40 CFR 68, Section ? 68.10(c).\n-  Deleting Epichlorohydrin storage and transfer from Stolthaven Houston's RMP as this covered chemical is no longer handled above threshold quantities on site.\n\n\n?68.155(a):  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nAt Stolthaven Houston Inc. we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes involved in chemical storage and distribution in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public and to protect the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n- A description of our facility and use"

These products are received into the Stolthaven Houston Terminal by various modes including tank truck, rail car, barge, and/or marine parcel tanker (ship), are stored for a period of time per customer requirements, and then are subsequently transferred off-site through one of more of the above-referenced transportation modes.  In addition to the two listed RMP chemicals currently stored on-site, Stolthaven Houston performs periodic intermodal (IMO) transfers between ISO Tank Containers and rail tank cars (with no associated storage) of Isoamylene, which contains up to 16 percent of 2-Methyl-1-Butene, a RMP regulated flammable chemical.  Stolthaven Houston also performs preiodic direct transfers from rail cars to moored marine vessels of Crude Piperazine, which contains up to 20 percent of 1,2-Ethylenediamine, a RMP regulated toxic substance.  Direct transfer of TDI from marine vessels to rail tank cars is also performed at Stolthaven Houston.  Note that the Stolthaven Houston Terminal does not perform any chemical processing operations, and no chemical manufacturing is conducted on-site.\n\nThe following chemicals handled at Stolthaven Houston have been identified by the EPA as having the potential to cause significant off-site consequences in the event of a substantial accide"

      "SummaryText": "ials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five (5) years at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal which resulted in injury:\n\nOn the morning of August 21, 2002 an employee of a construction contractor working at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal was sprayed with Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI), a RMP covered chemical.  The incident occurred as the contract employee attempted to remove a blind flange located on a pump discharge line on the facility's TDI circulation system.  The construction company's foreman was verbally instructed by Stolthaven Houston personnel to remove only the insulation from the exterior of the TDI circulation piping in two locations so that an electrical contractor could later terminate the system's heat tracing; the blind flange in question should never have been removed.  Miscommunication between Stolthaven Houston Inc., the construction contractor's foreman, and the contractor's employee under the foreman's supervision was determined to be the root cause of this incident.\n\nThe blind flange had TDI product behind it that was acidentally released as the contract employee attempted to remove the flange from the system.  The affected individual was taken to the Stolthaven Houston Terminal's safety building where he was decontaminated in a safety shower.  The patient was placed on high flow oxygen and his vital signs were checked every 5 minutes until EMS arrived.  He was then transported to the East Houston Regional Medical Center via ambulance, where the patient was treated, and later released and approved for return to work.\n\nAs a result of the incident investigation, safe work permits at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal are now issued with detailed written instructions describing the work to be performed.\n\nBetween 3 and 5 gallons of TDI was released during this incident.  Due to the relatively small amount of TDI liquid released during the incident in question, and because TDI has an extremely low vapor pressure (0.0002 pound per square inch at 68"

F) there were no off-site impacts from the referenced TDI release, and no environmental damage resulted from this incident as the release occurred in a primary contained area.\n\nAll incidents at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal are formally investigated as part of our facility's ISO Quality Management System to identify and correct the root cause(s) of the events and to implement appropriate corrective actions for continuous improvement.\n\n\n?68.155(e):  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting employees, the public, the environment, and company assets during emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the community emergency response plan and the North Channel Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\nAn Emergency Action Plan (EAP) is maintained which provides guidelines to respond to various emergencies such as fires, hazardous material spills, personal injuries, and property damage that may originate at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal.  \n\n\n?68.155(f):  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe following is a list of improvements that are implemented at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal to prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\n\n- PHA and adaptation of PHA recommendations\n- Continuous improvement through the facility's ISO 9001: 2000 Certified Quality Management System (QMS)\n- Employee Suggestion/Experience Feedback Program"
