      "SummaryText": "Accidental release and emergency response policies at the Elan facility are summarized in an Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that is prepared in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.38.\n\nThe stationary source is a above ground storage tank that contains the regulated chemical ethyl chloride.  Ethyl chloride is listed as a regulated substance due to its nature as a flammable gas.  \n\nThe worst case release scenario the maximum of ethyl chloride that results in a vapor cloud explosion.  Utilizing the EPA software RMP-Comp, the estimated distance to 1 psi overpressure as a result of the worst case release scenario is calculated.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario simulates a release from a 250 gallon reactor tank.  Utilizing RMP-Comp, the estimated distance to 1 psi overpressure from a vapor cloud explosion resulting from a release was calculated.  Public receptors within the distance of the overpressure end point include industrial areas and the Passaic River.  \n\nThe general accidental release prevention program for the Elan facility includes employee training, pressure relief valves, and interlocks.  \nThere has not been a reportable release of ethyl chloride in the past 5 years.  \n\nThe emergency response program is coordinated with the Newark HAZMAT Team, local fire department, and emergency health care professionals.  \n\nPlanned changes to improve safety include continued employee training and the installation of a lower explosion limit meter,reinforcement of blast walls and automatic temperature control devices.  Elan has incorporated into their standard operating procedures  non-destructive testing of the weigh tank and piping used in the ethyl chloride process."
