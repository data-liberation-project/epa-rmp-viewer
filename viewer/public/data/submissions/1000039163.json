The commitments are documented in the revised company safety policies and procedures.  Zeco management stresses safe operations in employee training programs which include refresher training and updates to any changes made in the industry.\r\n\r\nDescription of Process\r\n\r\n     Zeco Inc. stores sanitation, soaps and intervention chemicals used in the food safety industry.  These chemicals are used throughout the industry for many different applications such as general cleaning of equipment and bacterial intervention.  Intervention involves the use of Peracetic acid applied to protein carcass to eliminate bacteria and other pathogens that could potentially cause harm to the public.  \r\nPeracetic acid is delivered by truck in individual vented IBC totes and L99 HMWPE Resin drums to the warehouse storage location. Product is off loaded by forklift and staged in one location within the warehouse awaiting purchase, pickup and delivery.  The process is a basic inbound delivery with staging of the product and then re-loading for outbound deliveries to the customer.\r\nZeco uses trained fork lift operators to move the product throughout the process.  The product containers are not opened for any reason.  Zeco employees do not participatein emergency response actions.  In the event a spill should occur, all employees are instructed to evacuate and notify the local fire department. \r\n\r\nWorst Case Scenario\r\n\r\n\tAn accidental release of the total amount of Peracetic Acid stored is believed to be unlikely due to the individual co-located storage methods used.  Potential total release would be in the event of natural disaster, fire, or structural collapse.  The calculated endpoint is 2.3 miles with public receptors within the distance to the endpoint.  The facility contains a 24 hour monitored fire al"

      "SummaryText": "arm system in which the Chattanooga Tennessee Fire Department would respond in case of emergency.\r\n\r\nAlternative Release\r\n\r\n\tPotential release of Peracetic Acid is determined to be by fork truck operator error by means of puncturing the product container with the forks of the mobile unit.  Estimation of the forks entering the lowest point of the container, with a release rate of 16.6 lbs/min at release duration of 6160 mins was calculated.  In the event of such release, all employees are instructed to evacuate and notify the local fire department.  \r\n\r\nMaintenance\r\n\r\n\tPre-shift inspections are performed by the fork truck operator.  Any deficiency is noted and put on schedule for repair.  If any deficiency is found to compromise the safe operation of the unit, the unit is placed out of service and scheduled for repair.  It is not permissible to alter or disable any safety feature placed on the unit by the manufacturer.  Material Handling Equipment Inc. (MHI) of Chattanooga TN is contracted to perform maintenance and repairs on the fork trucks keeping the units safe to operate.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\n       Required annual safety training is performed in coordination of current written safety programs. Written safety programs and policies were updated in 2011 to reflect changes in requirements and best practices in the industry. All employees are required to undergo general safety training and function specific training prior to beginning the job.  Management is always open to and seeking new techniques and methods to improve the overall safety, and reducing any environmental impact of our process."
