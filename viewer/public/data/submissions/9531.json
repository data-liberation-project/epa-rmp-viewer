The facility is new, having operated for approximately 1 year at the time of this plan submittal.  ASiMI occupies an 250-acre plot, which is located aproximately 7 miles southwest of Butte, Montana on Rick Jones Way.  The neighborhood is predominantly uncultivated land.\n\n\n\nProcess Overview \n\nThe ASiMI facility in Butte, MT is comprised of three different production units: 1) Silane, 2) Poly Reaction, and 3) Product Finishing.  \n\nThe Silane Unit, through a series of chemical reactions and separation steps, converts metallurgical silicon and hydrogen to a high purity silane gas.  Ammonia refrigeration is used in the separation steps and for silane refrigeration.  Intermediates produced in the silane unit are trichlorosilane and dichlorosilane.  Some of the silane will packaged in tube trailers and modules once a loading facility is constructed and temporarily stored prior to sale.  The Poly Reaction Unit uses the majority of the silane and converts it into hydrogen and polycrystalline silicon.  The hydrogen is recycled back to the Silane Unit and the polycrystalline silicon is forwarded to the Product Finishing unit for mechanical processing and packaging. \n\nThere is one covered \"process\" as defined by the RMP regulations at the Butte facility.  This process includes the Silane and Poly Reaction production areas which are interconnected, a refrigeration unit contained within the Silane production area,  and the future silane module storage area which will be adjacent to the Silane production area.  Together these areas are identified as the Polysilicon Manufacturing process.\n\nThis risk management plan uses \"predictive filing\" to account for variables in the total quantities of chemicals at the facility, and for planned changes to the facility.  With predictive filing, the maximum quantity of chem"

All RMP applicable chemicals at the source except ammonia are classified as flammables.  Ammonia is classified as a toxic. \n\nIn addition to the above RMP-covered chemicals, Advanced Silicon has identified other potentially hazardous chemicals which could have either onsite or offsite impacts.  Risks from both these non RMP-covered chemicals as well as the RMP-covered chemicals are minimized using similar design standards, procedures, controls, mitigation measures, and emergency response procedures.   Advanced Silicon is also working with the local Department of Emergency Services and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) to coordinate emergency planning and emergency response for all potentially hazardous chemicals.\n\nWorst-Case Scenarios:\n\nFour hypothetical worst-case flammable scenarios and one hypothetical worst-case toxic scenarios were identified and developed for the facility in accordance with RMP standards:\n\nThe full hydrogen storage tank releases its entire contents, 8,500 pounds of hydrogen, which explodes with 10% explosion efficiency and no mitigation.  The calculated distance to 1-psi overpressure is 0.23 miles.  Public receptors within that radius are uncultivated fields, with no population.\n\nA full liquid silane storage tank releases its entire contents, 23,000 pounds of silane, which explodes with 10% explosion efficiency and no mitigation.  The calculated distance to 1-psi overpressure is 0.23 miles.  Public receptor"

This release consisted of less than 1 ounce of trichlorosilane.  There were no known on-site or off-site impacts, although two contractor employees working in the facility at the time alleged irritation from the release and much later sought medical treatment.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAdvanced Silicon's accidental release prevention program is based on the following essential elements: \nhazard reviews of equipment and processes, preventative and predictive maintenance programs, a management of change program, operator job certification and"

Loss of utilities is protected against through the use of installed and routinely tested back-up systems.  Engineering and design standards ensure materials and equipment meet industry specifications.  Advanced Silicon is known as an industry leader in silane handling safety.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nAdvanced Silicon's emergency response program has been coordinated with the local Department of Emergency Services and LEPC.  The program includes information on locations, quantities, and associated hazards of materials at the facility, as well as fixed and portable methods for containment and/or suppression of spills and releases, internal and external notification and communications procedures, alarm systems and evacuation plans.  The facility itself is designed with numerous mitigating features, including containment and diking, deluge systems for fire and vapor suppression, strategically-placed fire hydrants and fire monitors, and emergency scrubber systems.  Automatic and manual shutdown systems as well as automatic isolation valves are in place.  Back-up firewater pumps are installed.  Emergency equipment is routinely maintained and tested.  In addition, Advanced Silicon maintains a highly skilled emergency response team on-site 24-hours a day.  The team performs realistic monthly drills and exercises, covering a variety of response scenarios such as spill containment and cleanup, vapor suppression, fire fighting, and response to injuries.  The team routinely attends professional fire-fighting training to stay current with fire-fighting techniques.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAdvanced Silicon continues to seek and identify opportunities to improve safety t"
