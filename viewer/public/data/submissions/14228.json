The facility is equipped with a refrigeration system that contains anhydrous ammonia, C.A.S.#7664-41-7.  Ammonia is the sole regulated substance with regard to the aforementioned regulations.  The maximum quantity of ammonia in the system is 7200 pounds.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention\n\nReleases are prevented by a combination of engineering and administrative controls.  Engineering controls include automated system shutdown when safe parameters are exceeded.  Administrative controls involve manual isolation and shutdown procedures to be performed by trained personnel.  The system is also equipped with pressure relief valves that operate to prevent damage to system components should pressures reach unsafe levels.  Operation of pressure relief valves will result in a controlled release of refrigerant.\n\nWorst Case and Alternate Scenarios\n\nComputer air models were run based on a worst case release scenario involving the catastrophic structural failure of the system receiver.  The receiver contains the largest quantity of ammonia in a single vessel.  Results of the model indicate that the toxic endpoint in this scenario would extend to a distance of .4 miles from the release site.  The urban character of the facility location indicates that surrounding residential population impact is minimal.  Primary receptors are retail, office and temporary lodging occupancies.  One environmental receptor, the Mississippi River, was identified within the radius defined by the toxic endpoint.  Likely alternate scenarios resulted in a toxic endpoint of less than ."

      "SummaryText": "1 miles.\n\n5 Year Accident History\n\nThe facility has experienced no immediately reportable releases of ammonia in the last five years\n.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program and Policies\n\nWritten emergency response procedures are maintained at the facility.  All employees are trained to act based on their pre-assigned roles during emergency situations.  A fully trained and equipped on-site emergency response team will mitigate unplanned releases.  In addition, Brown's Velvet has a contractual agreement with a third party response contractor to be notified of an uncontrolled release event.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety at the facility include an aggressive inspection program and regular replacement of deteriorated system components.  In all cases, improved process technology is employed where feasible.  Existing levels of employee proficiency are enhanced by regular training and response exercises.\n"
