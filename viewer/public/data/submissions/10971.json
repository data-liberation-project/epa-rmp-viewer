      "SummaryText": "The Gary Wastewater Treatment Plant collects methane from its primary digesters, compresses the gas and stores it in a metal sphere.  The sphere holds 222,000 cu. ft. of methane at 50 psi.  The worst case scenario release of methane would impact an area 0.2 miles from the sphere.\n\nAccident prevention will focus on training and following local and state fire codes.  The facility will also implementing a routine inspection program.  The current operations and maintenance program will also be followed.  \n\nEmergency response responsibilities will be coordinated with the Gary Fire Department.  Onsite Shift Supervisorl will be responsible for evacuating the area.  The shift supervisor will also act as the onsite contact with the fire department during an emergency.  Emergency response by onsite personnel will be limited to closing appropriate valves in the methane detection system, if it can be safely accomplished.  No other emergency response action will be performed by onsite personnel.\n\nThe facility will work to improve the methane system safety by upgrading the equipment when possible."
