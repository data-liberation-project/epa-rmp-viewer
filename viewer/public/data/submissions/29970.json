      "SummaryText": "The Phenix City Wastewater Treatment Plant is a 7.75 MGD trickling filter plant.  The average daily flow treated is approximately 5.0 MGD.  The facility is located at the end of State Docks Road in Phenix City, Alabama.  This treatment facility is designed to substantially reduce the amount of CBOD, suspended solids, ammonia, and coliform bacteria contained in the treated water returned to the Chattahoochee River.  After flowing through pretreatment facilities, primary settling basins, trickling filters, aeration tank, and secondary clarifiers, the flow reaches the final stage of treatment called disinfection.  The disinfection process requires the use of two hazardous chemicals.  The two chemicals are chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  Because of the large amounts required, enough of the chemicals must be stored onsite to support the demand of the system.  The amount ranges from 6000-12000 pounds.  The area in which chemicals are stored is ventilated, and is equipped with a dual point leak detection device.  A minimal leak will be detected and the unit will then actuate the alarm system which includes a floor level exhaust fan, exterior alarm bell, exterior emergency lights, and a remote alarm located in the operations building to warn plant personnel of a possible emergency situation.  This facility is equipped with self contained breathing apparatus and Chlorine Institute emergency chlorine repair kits for ton cylinders.  The plant personnel are all trained professionals and are frequently instructed on safe and correct operational and emergency procedures.  No accidents have occurred as a result of the use or accidental release of either chlorine or sulfur dioxide in the past 10 years.  A worst case scenario release of either of these chemicals could result in the possible evacuation within a 0.9 mile radius of the plant.  The local fire department is aware of the location and effects of both chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  In the event of a worst case leak, the Phenix"
