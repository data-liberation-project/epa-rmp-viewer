      "SummaryText": "Intercities Cold Storage is located at 1075 Oak Street in Pittston, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania.  The facility provides commercial cold storage warehousing for industry.  Products housed in cold storage at the facility consist of various types of perishable foods.  These products are temporarily stored and then removed from the facility by commericial trucks.  Forklifts are used to load and unload the trucks.  Currently, there are sixteen storage freezers at the facility.  Of these sixteen freezers, three are chilled with freon and thirteen are chilled with anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThe building covers approximately 130,000 square feet.  The three freon chilled freezers have two compressors that circulate freon to air units inside the freezers.  Freon is circulated through pipes that are located along the interior walls and ceilings of the freezers.  Approximately 500 lbs of Freon are stored and circulated between the two compressors.\n\nThe thirteen anhydrous ammonia freezers receive ammonia from a mechanical room located along the west side of the building.  Inside this room is an ammonia cylinder that contains approximately 15,000 lbs of ammonia.  Compressors located in this room circulate ammonia to air units inside the freezers.  The mechanical room also houses controls for freezer operations that includes a computerized control program (MYSTIC) networked with Triple A Security Systems to detect leaks and notify facility personnel.  The piping that transfers the ammonia to air units runs along the outside of the roof of the building and connects into the air units located inside the freezers.  Ammonia gas recirculates from the air units through three condensers which is then recycled back into the system.  The condensers are located on the roof of the mechanical building.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nAreas where ammonia spills and leaks may occur would include the mechanical room, air circulation units and piping.

      "SummaryText": "the mechanical room, a large scale release of gas or liquid would be possible here.  A ventilation fan in the mechanical room is present to vent ammonia from the building if a large scale release occurred.  Venting would prevent a dangerous concentration concentration of ammonia gas from accumulating in this room.  This fan is automattically controlled by the (MYSTIC) computer systemand can also be manually operated.  The piping runs along the top of the building and enters air circulators through the roof.  An ammonia gas or liquid spill would most likely occur from the piping or air circulators.\n\nThe computer control system conducts constant monitoring of the ammonia cooling system and provides automatic emergency action by shutting down all or parts of the freezers if a release occurs.  This automatic shutdown would not apply to a catastrophic release in the mechanical room.  In the event of a release, plant personnel are not trained to handle an ammonia release.  The plant employees will be evacuated to a predetermined point outside of the building depending on wind direction.  Intercities has hired an outside contractor, Datom Products, Inc. to handle any releases or spills on the property.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no chemical release at the facility in the last five years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nIntercities plant personnel are trained to evacuate the building in case of a spill or release.  The facility personnel are not trained to handle and ammonia release.  Intercities has a contract with Datom Products, Inc. of Dunmore,Pa, a certified Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency Haz Mat Team, to respond to any chemical emergencies at the plant.  The release should be able to be controlled by the computer system from any computer modem off site.  If this is not possible, Datom would patch the leak any way possible.  Notification to the public of any danger would be handled through the Luzerne County EMA.\n\nIntercities coordinates the re"
