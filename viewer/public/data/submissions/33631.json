To ensure that our water remains safe throughout the distribution system to every tap, the Lake Hartwell Filter Plant adds a small amount of chlorine as a disinfection agent.\n\nThe concentrated form of chlorine is liquefied and stored in one ton containers. Before it is mixed with water, chlorine can be extremely hazardous if released to the air.  \n\nAnderson Regional Joint Water System is committed to protecting its employees, the public, and the environment from any accidental releases of hazardous materials used at its facilities.  We have implemented safety, environmental protection, and risk management programs to prevent hazardous materials releases.  If there is an accidental release, we will immediately call for emergency response to minimize the effect of the release and notify the public of any actions necessary to ensure public protection, through county emergency management agencies.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Steps\n\nAnderson Regional Joint Water System is committed to personnel safety, public safety, continued reliable operation and regulatory compliance.  Based on this commitment, the Water Operations Manager has assumed overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the Risk Management Program.  The Water Operations Manager has also clearly defined accountability and responsibility for each of the prevention program elements to meet both EPA and OSHA Process Safety Management requirements.\n\nTo ensure a worst-case or alternative release scenario does not occur, the Lake Hartwell Filter Plant maintains a release prevention program with the primary focus of protecting plant employees and the public from the hazards associated with an accident or release involving chlorine.  The multifaceted program includes the use of:\n\n-- vacuum feed of chlorine to minimize t"

The plant has maintained an excellent safety record and we know of no accidental chlorine release throughout its more than 30 year operating history .  \n\nEmergency Response\n \nIn the event that a chlorine release does occur, the Lake Hartwell Filter Plant has an emergency response program that coordinates emergency response with the Anderson County LEPC. If such a release did occur, plant personnel would contact the Anderson County LEPC who would dispatch a trained HAZMAT team to the site to handle the chlorine release. \n\nMaintaining A Safe Operation\n \nThe Lake Hartwell Filter Plant continually works to safely manage the hazards of chlorine to protect employees and the community we serve.
