      "SummaryText": "Ormond Beach Water Treatment Plant\n\nBackground\nThe City of Ormond Beach Public Works Department ? Utilities Division, owns and operates an 8.0 MGD water treatment plant (WTP) serving approximately 14,100 customers and a service area population of 50,800 people ( based on 2000 census).  \n\nThe Ormond Beach WTP uses chlorine as a disinfection agent and stores as much as 16,000 lbs of chlorine gas in one-ton cylinders. The City of Ormond Beach developed a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the chlorine chemical storage and feed facilities in June 1999, in accordance with 40 CFR 68 and 29 CFR 1910.119 (OSHA Process Safety Management Standards). The EPA Chemical Accident Protection rule (40CFR68) applies to any process that involves more than 2,500 pounds of chlorine (gas) and the OSHA Process Safety Management standard (29CFR1910.119) applies to any process that involves more than 1,500 pounds of chlorine. The City?s RMP was submitted to EPA using the agency?s RMP Submit program.\n\nA compliance audit of the Ormond Beach WTP RMP was conducted in May 2004, in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 68.79.  The audit concluded that the Ormond Beach Utilities Division was in general compliance with the RMP prepared in June 1999.  \n\nThere have been no chemical release incidents at the WTP in the past five (5) years.\n\nRMP Summary\nThe Ormond Beach WTP RMP is organized as follows:\n\nSection 1 ? Introduction\n\nThis section provides a general overview of the WTP RMP components and requirements.\n\nSection 2 ? Program Management Procedures\n\nThis section describes the management elements of the RMP, including definition of personnel roles and responsibilities, employee participation, pre-startup safety review including checklists, Management of Change procedures and forms, incident investigation procedures, inspections and compliance audit requirements, on-going program maintenance, including updates and development of continuing improvements, and RMP public information procedures used by"

Process Safety Information\n\nThis section provides a thorough presentation of the physical properties, chemistry and hazards associated with chlorine, and descriptions of the chemical storage and feed process technology, and equipment.  Applicable requirements for material of construction, ventilation, monitoring, design code compliance, and safety systems are described.\n\nSection 4 ? Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nHazard analyses for the chlorination and sulfur dioxide systems were conducted by the Utilities Division Staff using the ?what-if checklist? methodology.  The PHA developed in June 1999, as a part of the City?s original RMP submittal was reviewed in May 2004, as part of the RMP re-submittal and found to be adequate.  The majority of the recommendations made in the 1999 PHA have been implemented, with only a few minor exceptions.  \n\nThe potential impacts of possible future chlorine release were analyzed in accord with the guidance that USEPA set in its Risk Management Program Guidance for POTWs.  The analysis determines the distance at which the plume would dilute to a concentration at which people would suffer no serious permanent harm, but would voluntarily go to the hospital for evaluation.  The ?toxic endpoint? for chlorine is 0.0087 milligram per liter. For the worst case scenario, it is assumed that a ton container will completely empty in ten minutes.  Although highly unlikely, this is the worst possible case for the plant.  In the worst possible case, the EPA table yields a ?distance to toxic endpoint? of the 1.33 miles for the type of landscape (urban) in which the plant is located.  Within the 1.33 mile radius of the plant, there are schools, a hospital, recreation areas, commercial/office sites, and residences.  An estimated 9,900 people live within a 1.33 mile radius of the plant, based  on population projections using 2000 Census data.  \n\nThe potential impacts of a more likely possible chlorine release was analyzed in ac"

      "SummaryText": "cord with the guidance that USEPA set in its Risk Management Program Guidance for POTWs.  The City evaluated a release involving a break in a chlorine transfer line attached to a ton container operating in the vapor transfer mode.  The valve on the chlorine ton container (which has a diameter of 5/16?) would constrict the flow.  The EPA method shows a chlorine release rate of 15 pounds per minute and a ?distance to toxic endpoint? of 528 feet for the type of landscape (urban) in which the plant is located.  There are four residences and an estimated 10 people located within 0.1 mile radius of the chlorine storage area.  \n\nSection 5 ? Employee Training\n\nThis section describes the City?s employee training program for the safe use and handling of chlorine. Ormond Beach has developed and conducted regular, structured training for Ormond Beach employees covering various aspects of the chlorine storage and feed facilities and processes. Training record forms document the training conducted and employees receiving the subject training.  The training record forms are kept on file at the WTP.\n\nSection 6 ? Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for Chlorination System\n\nSection 7 ? Safe Work Practices\n\nThese two sections provide a thorough description of the processes, specifications and operating procedures for the chlorine chemical system.  The SOPs are developed in a ?step-by-step? format and include procedural checklists to ensure operator conformity with the procedures.  The SOPs included in the RMP document address start-up, shut-down, inspection, temporary operation, emergency procedures, trouble-shooting, cylinder deliveries, system maintenance, safe work practices for handling chlorine, and working in and around chlorine facilities.\n\nSection 8 ? Contractor Safety Program\n\nPre-qualification requirements for all contractors working in or around the chlorine facilities are included in this section of the program document.

Emergency Response Program\n\nThis section documents the procedures to be followed to control process upsets and chemical leaks.  The ERP provides procedures to be followed by water personnel for handling minor control process upsets and/or chemical releases.\n\nFor major control process upset or chemical releases, the ERP calls for the Ormond Beach HAZMAT team (division of the City fire department) to be the first responders. After notifying the HAZMAT team of a major release occurrence, WTP personnel are to evacuate the area and allow HAZMAT personnel to take the appropriate emergency response and public notification actions.\n\nAlso included in this section are contact names and phone numbers for notification of authorities, plant site evacuation plan for major releases, and post-incident reporting requirements.  \n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Process Safety\n\n1.The City is currently in the design phase of an expansion to the water treatment plant which will include conversion of the chlorine gas system to a liquid sodium hypochlorite storage and feed system. The elimination of the chlorine gas system will significantly diminish the risk to WTP employees and eliminate the risk to individuals residing, working and recreating within the current 1.33 mile radius chemical release impact area.\n\nIt is anticipated that the conversion will be complete by December 30, 2006.  After successful implementation of the liquid disinfection system and shut down and removal of the gas system, the City will submit a letter to the RMP Record Center to de-register the WTP.\n\n2.Water Plant staff will improve program documentation as described in the RMP, including:\na)Cylinder unloading checklist;\nb)Cylinder change-out report and checklist;\nc)Equipment status log sheet ( to be completed during operator rounds);\nd)Equipment testing and maintenance activities;\ne)Recording hydrostatic test dates on Cl2 cylinders received from th"
