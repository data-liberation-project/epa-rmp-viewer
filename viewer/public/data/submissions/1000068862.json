If a significant release should occur, we will conduct a formal incident investigation to identify and correct the root cause(s) of the event.\r\n\r\nWe also gather information on other significant incidents at other facilities, and implement changes if necessary in our facility to prevent incidents.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe facility has an Emergency Response Plan which has been integrated with the local community Emergency Response Plan. All employees and contractors are trained in the plan prior to commencement of work. Our program provides the essential training and planning to effectively protect employees, the public, and the environment in emergencies.  The Emergency Plan is tested twice a year to insure that it is current. The facility Emergency Response team also is a member of the Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA), a consortium of area companies that coordinates and help each other during emergencies in which the individual plant's resources may not be sufficient to effectively handle the response.\r\n\r\nRecent Changes to Improve Safety:\r\n\r\nThe facility recently updated its Ethylene Oxide equipment and installed new safety and control systems, reducing the possibility of a release.\r\n\r\nIn summary, Clariant is committed to the safe operation of our facility, and we take the actions necessary to ensure the safety of our employees, members of the community, and the environment."

Training is conducted each year in safety and chemical processing, and operators must recertify on the systems they operate every three years.\r\nContractors are selected for their safety record and maintenance capabilities\r\nAll processes undergo extensive safety analysis by teams of engineers, chemists, plant operators, and maintenance personnel before beginning operation. Systems are reanalyzed at least every five years.\r\nAll plant modifications and procedure changes undergo a management of change process that involves operators, maintenance, engineering, and chemists in a safety review\r\nHazardous materials handling procedures\r\nEthylene oxide and sulfur dioxide equipment and storage tank inspection, certification and maintenance program\r\n\r\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.
