SARA LEE Foods \u00bf New London\u00bfs operations include the processing of meat products (hot dogs, sausages, hams and deli meats) for public consumption packaged under the familiar brand names of Hillshire Farm and Deli Select.  SARA LEE Foods \u00bf New London has been in operation at this facility for over 50 years providing quality meat products and over 1,000 jobs to the local community.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nSARA LEE Foods \u00bf New London is committed to protecting the health of its employees, the surrounding community, and the environment; therefore it is SARA LEE Foods \u00bf New London\u00bfs policy to manage a safe and healthy workplace, protect the environment, and maintain compliance with safety, health, and environmental regulations: 40 CFR 68 as well as Occupational Safety and Health Organization (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations promulgated as Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations Chapter 1910, Section 119 (29 CFR 1910.119), and OSHA\u00bfs Hazardous Operations and Emergency Response regulations (29 CFR 1910.120).\n\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nSARA LEE Foods \u00bf New London is required to maintain low temperatures in the food processing areas of the plant that are within standards required by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to ensure quality in the final products.  SARA LEE Foods \u00bf New London uses anhydrous ammonia (a 112(r) regulated substance) as a refrigerant to maintain the 500,000 ft2 facility within the required range of operating temperatures.

Both a worst-case scenario and an alternate-case scenario were developed.\n \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is designed and constructed in accordance with ANSI/IIAR 2-1992 Standards for Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigerating Systems.  To prevent and mitigate accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia, SARA LEE Foods \u00bf New London has implemented several precautionary measures, such as process/equipment controls, standard operating procedures, preventative maintenance programs, employee training and audit programs.  \n\nSARA LEE Foods \u00bf New London maintains a \u00bfno odor\u00bf policy.  The \u00bfno odor\u00bf policy instructs employees that detect an ammonia odor to call the Utilities Maintenance staff and the Utilities Maintenance staff must respond immediately to the call to address the situation.\n\nSARA LEE Foods \u00bf New London has implemented and is in compliance with OSHA\u00bfs PSM regulations and as such, has evaluated and engineered for anhydrous ammonia releases.   Some of the controls installed to prevent catastrophic releases of ammonia are process equipment (vents, pressure relief valves, backup pumps, and manual shutoffs) and automated controls (automatic shut-offs, ammonia leak detection system, and electrical distribution system grounding).
