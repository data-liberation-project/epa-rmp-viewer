Accidental release prevention and Emergency response policies.\nIn this facility, we use isopentane, isobutane, and ethane, which are considered flammable by the EPA. The same properties that make isopentane, isobutane  and ethane valuable as blowing agents in our manufacturing processes also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions when handling them. These precautions are in place to prevent the unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the treat to our personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the treat to members of the nearby community. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and State rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle isopentane, isobutane, and ethane. This combined with the safety devices inherent in the design the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our employees help insure the safety of our employees and our community. Our emergency response program is meant to comply with the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Law (Hazardous Materials Release Response Plans and Inventory Act). FP International's response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.  \n\n2) The stationary source and regulated substance handled.\nA)  At our  Atlanta facility, FP International collects and recycles post consumer and industrial polyethylene for the use in manufacturing of our product. During the Cushion-Lite process blowing agents (a 50% - 50% mixture of ethane and isobutane) are injected into a polyethylene melt as it is extruded. In the frozen bead process isopentane is used as the blowing agent. Two above ground storage tanks (isobutane storage) 6,500 gallons each, one above ground tank 6,000 gallons tank (isopentane storage) and 2 storage trailers (ethane storage) 5,000 gallons each are used to separately store the blowing agents"

      "SummaryText": ". \nB)  The regulated substance handled at this facility is ethane, isobutane and isopentane. \nC)  The maximum amount stored at this facility is 112,000 pounds. \n\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternate release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance  for each reported scenario.\nRMP Comp used for modeling.\nA) Worst Case Scenario:\nA failure of the largest above ground isobutane storage tank,(6,600 gallons) when filled with the greatest amount allowed would release 27,407 pounds of isobutane. Per NFPA policy we limit the maximum filling capacity of each tank to 90% at 60 degrees F. It is assumed that the entire contents are released as vapor which finds an ignition source, which results in a vapor cloud explosion. \nThe distance to the end point of 1 psi for the worst case scenario is 0.2 miles.\n\nB)  Alternative scenario: \nA pull away causing failure of a 25\" length hose on the largest above ground isobutane storage tank (6,600 gallons). The manually operated shut off valve will stop the flow of isobutane. Although it is unlikely, if the vapor reaches an ignition source it would result in a vapor cloud fire.\nThe estimated distance to lower flammability limit is < 0.1 miles.\n\n\n\n \n4) The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps.\nThis manufacturing facility complies with the EPA's Accident Prevention Rule and with all applicable State Codes and Regulations. This facility was designed in accordance with NFPA-58and NFPA - 30.\nAs part of our Corporate Injury Illness and Prevention Plan all employees receive training covering the following aspects of health and safety; safety philosophy, general safety rules, reporting safety hazards, emergency procedures and hazardous communications. In addition to the training received upon initial training, further training is given if any employee is exposed to a hazard previously unrecognized, or if any employee is reassigned to a job"
