The Facility Policy\n\n    The owners, management, and employees of Reddy Ag Service, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n  - The primary activity at the facility is the storage and sale of anhydrous ammonia to farmers.\n\n  - Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application.\n\n  - The maximum quantity stored would be 182784# in our forty two - 850 gal nurse tanks.  The maximum quantity handled would be 198603#.\n\n3. The Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario\n\n    a. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a nurse tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 4352 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.1 miles.\n\n    b. The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential accident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .41 miles.\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n     The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\"\n\n5. The Five-Yea"

The Emergency Response Program\n\n    The facility has:\n    a. a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n    b. provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know         \n        information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n    c. a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 191.120,\n        including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n    Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
