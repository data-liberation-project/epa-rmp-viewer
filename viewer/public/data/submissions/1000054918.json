The facility, along with one other wastewater facility, serves a population of approximately 35,670 according to the U.S. Census Bureau 2010 population estimate (www.census.gov). The facility contains two one-ton cylinders of chlorine. The two one containers are interconnected to the system. Personnel oversee the facility 24-hours a day and conduct daily inspections of the chlorine building. The facility houses emergency air and power supply. Self-Contained-Breathing-Apparatuses (SCBA) is stored in the office. \n\n\n\nRMP regulations for Program 3 processes require the performance of a consequence analysis for one worst-case release scenario, estimated to create the greatest distan"

The quantity present in a vessel will be released as a gas over 10 minutes for toxic substances that are normally gases at ambient temperature and handled as a gas or a liquid under pressure. The RMP*Comp32 results indicate that the maximum distance needed for the concentration of chlorine to reach the toxic endpoint (0.0087 mg/L) as a result of a 10-minute release of 4,000 pounds of chlorine is 1.9 miles. The total potentially affected population with the entire area of the circle is estimated at 21,867. \n\n\n\nOne alternative release scenario was selected for the offsite consequence analysis, since chlorine is the only regulated toxic substance used at the facility. The scenario selected involves the rupture of the flexible connections to a one-ton container. This failure results in the release of the entire container's contents over a period of 15 minutes. This is equivalent to a release rate of 267 lbs. per minute. The RMP*Comp32 dispersion modeling results indicate that 0.3 miles is the maximum distance for the concentration of chlorine to reach the toxic endpoint (0.0087 mg/L). The total potentially affected population within the entire area of the circle is estimated at 151.\n\n\n\nPopulation estimates are based on 2010 U.S. Census Bureau data from ALOHA and MARPLOT. Most of the growth in Weslaco has occurred outside of the 1.9-mile radius. \n\n\n\nA search of MARPLOT Satellite and Topographic maps did not identify any offsite impacts of environmental receptors within the endpoint. Environmental receptors include natural areas such as national or state parks, forests, or monuments officially designated wildlife sanctuaries, preserves, refuges, and federal wilderness areas.\n\n\n\nNo accidental chlorine releases have occurred at this facility.\n\n \n\nChemical-specific prevention steps include availability of Self-Contained-Breathing-Apparatus"

All equipment was inspected during the Process Hazard Analysis. It was determined that the chlorination facility was designed, built and operated in accordance with applicable codes and industrial guidelines. Continuous inspections as to the integrity and the condition process are made daily by Weslaco Wastewater Plant personnel.\n\n\n\nThe City of Weslaco emergency procedure addresses potential emergencies that can reasonably be expected to occur at the facility. Effort has been made to identify potential cause and consequence scenarios; however, it is possible that an event could occur that has not been foreseen. The Program Hazard Analysis and the Hazard Assessment are examples of this effort. The emergency procedure complies with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements. Weslaco Wastewater Treatment Plant personnel are not the first responders, although the employees are trained in response techniques and notification of other first responders in the event of accidental chlorine releases. The first responders are Chemical Response and Remediation Contractors, Inc. and the Weslaco Fire Department.\n\n\n\nThe City of Weslaco has developed and implemented an emergency response program for the purpose of protecting public health and the environment.  The City of Weslaco Fire and Police Departments reviewed the facility's emergency response program. Both departments are members of the Hidalgo County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). The program includes an emergency response decision tree and a notification plan. Emergency response drills, drill evaluations, and emergency operation and response procedures are reviewed annually"
