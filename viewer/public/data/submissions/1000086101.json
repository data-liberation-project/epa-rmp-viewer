OIMS are the cornerstone for continuous improvement in our safety-related systems.  These systems are evergreen and are in a continuous state of improvement, usually through many small steps.  Some examples are the recommendations from our hazard and risk reviews and any incident investigations.\n\n\n\nThe BWCP remains an American Chemical Council Responsible Care facility for its effective safety and health management programs.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Infineum BWCP, located in Linden, N. J., operates several processes to produce additives for engine oils and transmission fluids.  While the additive products are not regulated as hazardous by the EPA, some of the raw materials are regulated as toxic or flammable under the EPA.  Our regulated toxic materials are Anhydrous Ammonia; Chlorine; Hydrogen Chloride; and Vinyl Acetate.  Our regulated flammable material is mixed C4 hydrocarbons (n butane and butenes).\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe BWCP uses OIMS, which covers all aspects of our operations that could affect the safety or health of our employees or public neighbors.  This system was developed by ExxonMobil Chemical Company in 1992.  Even after the BWCP became part of a new company, Infineum, in 1999, OIMS continues to be used as the formal Operations Integrity System.  In 2006, Lloyd's Register Quality Assurance (LRQA) reviewed the practice of the site OIMS and evaluated it against the international standard for Environmental Management Systems (ISO 14001).  After an extensive review, Lloyd's concluded that the \"design of the environmental components of OIMS has embraced the intent behind ISO 14001 and has addressed all of the individual ISO 14001 system elements\".  They went on to say, \"At the Bayway Chemical Plant, individuals at all levels demonstrated a high level of personal commitment t"

It is the opinion of Lloyd's Register Quality Assurance that the environmental management components of Infineum's OIMS have addressed all the requirements of ISO 14001:2004\".  This commitment has never changed.\n\n\n\nThe OIMS system meets all the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency Risk Management Program (EPA RMP), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration Process Safety Management Standard 29 CFR 1919.119 (OSHA PSM) and the New Jersey Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act (NJ TCPA).  The system also exceeds all regulatory requirements by incorporating periodic management review of performance measurements for each practice to evaluate whether each practice is working as planned and what improvements might be made.  The Infineum BWCP is a member of the Chlorine Institute and the American Chemical Council Responsible Care program.\n\n\n\nEach of the EPA areas is described in greater detail below and in the Data Element Section.  Due to the ongoing nature of our safety program, the dates associated with the various activities in our accident prevention program are constantly being updated. \n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nInfineum encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  An annual plan is developed for employee participation.  This includes weekly safety meetings for operations and maintenance personnel, weekly safety audits, meetings of the Operations Integrity Committee (OIC) and site-wide, full day, interactive safety workshops.  Infineum also conducts Health, Safety, Security and Environmental (HSSE) training days for process and mechanical colleagues on an annual basis.

Not only is it necessary to provide for the well-being of the plant workers and equipment, but also to protect the community from any harm resulting from an in-plant accident.  The role and objectives of the OIC recognize this broader involvement.\n\n\n\nThe general objectives of the OIC are as follows:  \n\n?    Help anticipate hazards and work with operations to avoid them.\n\n?    Promote improvements in \"safety\" matters throughout the plant. \n\n?    Help develop and maintain a realistic and credible plant-wide HSSE policy that reflects this broader definition.\n\n?    Monitor and provide continuity for HSSE standards and procedures and monitor progress in plant programs aimed at a more secure workplace.  These standards consist of the applicable codes and industry standards (e.g. ASME, API, NFPA, Chlorine Institute) as well as ExxonMobil's Design Practices, ExxonMobil's Global Practices, and Mechanical Standards.\n\n\n\nEmployee participation is further amplified in the Operations Integrity and Safety Committee (OIAC).  This safety committee meets monthly and is represented by experienced colleagues in management and labor areas.  The Plant Manager and Union Labor executive committee member co-chair the OIAC, which focuses on HSSE programs and systems including security.  Key HSSE personnel are included in the monthly agenda to report on on-going programs and initiatives.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\n\n\n\nThe Infineum BWCP keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.

When combined with written procedures and trained personnel, this information provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities.  This information is also used in evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nThe Infineum BWCP has a comprehensive program of PHAs.  Within this program each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage the hazards.\n\n\n\nThe Infineum BWCP performs a PHA in the form of a Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study using the industry-wide standard Guideword HAZOP methodology.  HAZOP analysis is widely recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough PHA.

To comply with the Best Practices Standards at TCPA/DPCC Chemical Sector Facilities, November 21, 2005, the site performed and completed an initial IST review of the TCPA covered facilities, which incorporates all the EPA covered facilities as well, and which were then reviewed and approved by NJDEP in March 2006.  The site submitted the IST reviews to NJDEP in August 2008 to comply with N.J.A.C. 7:31-4.12 (a).  Updates to the initial reviews are performed in conjunction with PHA revalidations.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe BWCP maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as startup, shutdown, normal, and emergency operations.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators, and they provide a consistent basis for training new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change system.\n\n\n\nThe BWCP has identified critical safe operating limits for process parameter"

This information, along with written operating procedures is readily available to operators in the process and to other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nHot Work and Safe Work Practices\n\n\n\nThe BWCP has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  All safe work practices are contained in the site Health, Safety and Environmental Manual that is available electronically from every personal computer.  Examples of safe work practices include: energy isolation for equipment being worked on (Lockout/Tagout), procedures for the safe removal of hazardous materials before opening process piping/equipment (work permit), hot work permit/procedure to safely manage spark-producing activities, vehicle entry into process areas, confined space entry permit/procedure, and job safety analyses to identify and mitigate hazards associated with maintenance tasks.  These practices (and others), along with training, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.  Unit-specific safe work practices are in the Unit standard operating manuals (SOPs), which are available electronically.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nThe BWCP has implemented comprehensive training for all employees involved in operating a process.  The initial training for new hire Process Technicians (PT) is done in 2 Phases.  Phase 1   Orientation, is done in a classroom setting with emphasis on topics from the HSSE Manual.  Phase 2 - Field Training with Mentor, is on-the-job with emphasis on Process unit manuals and procedures.  New hire PTs complete both Phases while PTs who are just newly assigned to a different Unit Post complete only Phase 2.  All PTs are trained to the 24-hr Hazmat technician level.\n\n\n\nFollowing Orientation and whenever a newly assigned PT begins training on a new Unit Post, the trainee PT is assigned a qualified PT (Mentor) who provides on"

Each Process Post has a curriculum of online Knowledge Tests and Job Performance Measures (JPMs) that must be completed by each PT trainee prior to the final evaluation, which is an oral field walk-thru by Unit supervision.  Successful completion of all requirements results in awarding a Final Qualification certificate. \n\n\n\nProcess Technician refresher training is documented for each PT and consists of classroom training (annual), and Unit-specific training (1 to 3 years).  HSSE Day (annual classroom) serves as the annual Hazmat technician refresher training as well as a general safety refresher of Job Safety Analysis, Hazcom, SPCC/DPCC, Work Permits, Confined Space, Energy Isolation, Hearing Conservation, PPE, Access to Medical Records, Fall Protection, and Fire Safety.  Unit-specific refresher training consists of online knowledge tests that cover standard operating, critical, and emergency procedures.  Refresher test cycle varies according to topic and ranges from 1 to 3 years.  Respirator Fit testing, Air Purified Respirator (APR) and SCBA refresher training are done on an annual basis in the field in a separate training session.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nWork performed by contractors at Bayway is managed consistently with, and is a part of the overall OIMS.  Contractors are required to utilize the same procedures to perform work as Infineum colleagues.  These procedures are documented in the HSE manual.  Contractor administration procedures are developed, coordinated, and implemented by the Plant's Contractor Administration Team (CAT), which is made up of representatives from Safety, Training, Maintenance, Projects, Operations, Purchasing, and representatives from the contractor's workforce.\n\n\n\nContractor Administration begins with the Contractor Selection Procedure.  The procedure includes an annual qualification of contractors by the CAT that allows specific contractors to be considered for work.  This process inc"

The review team also evaluates the Contractor's past performance in meeting training requirements, the effectiveness of their ongoing program to promote HSE awareness, and general feedback on work performance including input from the Bayway Safety Survey system.\n\n\n\nIt has been the practice at Bayway to use union trained labor where craft skills are required.  Selected Contractors must then have agreements to utilize trained and qualified union labor that have received their craft training in state certified union craft training programs.\n\n\n\nSpecific training for the individual contract worker is accomplished by a twofold approach of Contractor training and Owner Orientation.\n\n\n\nThe Contractor, utilizing information provided by Bayway via the contract exhibit F, \"Safety and Health Administrative Instructions for Contractors\" and the HSE manual, inform, train, and evaluate each employee.  This training information includes familiarization with the hazards of regulated substances found at the BWCP and the Emergency Response Plan.  Work procedures as prescribed by the HSE manual (e.g. Work Permit System) are also covered.  The contract employees are also requested to advise the appropriate Infineum associate of any unique hazards provided by their work or any hazards that they find while working.  The expected method for this communication is the Work Permit System.  In the [rare] occasion that a Contractor performs work within the Preventive Maintenance Program, the Contractor is also required to train, inform, and evaluate their employee on this system.\n\n\n\nPrior to beginning work in the plant, the Contractor employee must successfully complete the Bayway Safety Health Administrative Instruction for Contractors (SHAIC) training, which is the Owner's safety orientation session.

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup and personnel are trained prior to placing the equipment in service.  This review procedure provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all the approved Management of Change and that all supporting systems is operationally ready.  PSSRs are also conducted on field changes as part of the Management of Change process when PSI is revised.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity/Preventative Maintenance\n\n\n\nThe Bayway Preventive Maintenance and Inspection Program is centered on a computer data base and software called SAP R3.  The computer contains technical data on piping, fixed equipment, machinery, pressure relief devices, and instrumentation and specifies the preventive maintenance frequencies and procedures required for each individual piece of equipment.  Equipment breakdown and repair history are also recorded.  Some older historical records will remain in a paper-based file.\n\n\n\nFixed equipment inspection intervals for all equipment are developed on a systematic basis that includes historical data and current non-destructive inspection results.  A quarterly inspection planning report is generated showing the equipment that is scheduled for inspection during the current year and what has not yet been completed.\n\n\n\nThe fixed equipment inspection techniques in use comply with our own standards and applicable industry standards"

The intervals between inspections of these devices are set based on criticality of service and analysis of the historical data.  The list of safety and environmentally critical instrumentation is periodically reviewed to ensure effective coverage.  Monthly reports are generated showing the status of equipment that is scheduled for inspection that month and year-to-date, and any equipment whose inspection may be overdue.\n\n\n\nSemiannual HSSE metrics for each operating area are reviewed with the BWCP Site Operations Integrity Committee (SOIC).
