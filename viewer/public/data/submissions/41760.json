      "SummaryText": "The Hillsborough County Water Department (HCWD) has an accidental release prevention policy integrating technology, established procedures and management practices into an unified approach to risk management.  The HCWD operates a number of water and wastewater treatment facilities throughout unincorporated Hillsborough County, Florida.  All applicable procedures of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection and the Florida Department of Community Affairs are followed.\n\nSouth County Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant.\n\nThe Souht County Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant is located at 520 Teco Road, Ruskin, Fl  33570.  The site is at the North end of Teco Road and is adjacent to Interstate 75, northwest of the I 75 & SR 674 interchange.  In addition to the treatment facility, the complex includes wastewater transmission facilities, a reclaimed water system and a pumping facility.  The surface water discharge facility is located off site.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios identified as worst case release and alternative scenario.  The first scenario is defined by the EPA, which states the owner or operator shall assume the maximum quanitity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over ten minutes due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as more likely to occur than the worst case scenario.\n\nThe HCWD utilized the EPA lookup tables for Risk Management Compliance.\n\nThe worst case scenario at South County Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant involves an unspecified failure of a single one ton container of chlorine.  Using the EPA lookup table for worst case scenario, the toxic endpoint is 2.9 miles.  The EPA specified conditions assume the release of the entire amount as a gas in a ten minute period, use of the one hour ERPG-2 guidelines as the toxice endpoint and consideration of the population wi"

      "SummaryText": "thin a full circle with radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance.  EPA set these conditions to facilitate the performance of the offsite consequence analysis.  The HCWD believes the EPA assumptions to be unrealistic.\n\nA.  Only a fraction of the compressed liquified chlorine released to the atmosphere flashes to vapor.  The remaining liquid forms liquid droplet aerosols.  This results in the formation of a dense chlorine cloud consisting of vapor and liquid droplets, with the dispersion characteristics significantly different than a cloud of chlorine gas.\n\nB.  Only the population within an elliptical plume extending downwind of the release point is potentially affected.  The plume area, or footprint, is approximately six percent of the area of the full circle.\n\nThe general HCWD release prevention program is based on several key elements.\nTraining of staff.\nPreventative maintenance program.\nState of the art process and safety equipment.\nAccurate, effective operating procedures.\nHazard review of equipment and procedures.\nIn house inspection program.\n\nChemical specific prevention steps include the availability of Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) worn by the operators during connection/disconnection of chlorine containers, awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine and the presence of chlorine detection systems.  The facility maintains a chlorine repair kit on site."
