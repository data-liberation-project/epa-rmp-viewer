      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - The Milwaukee brewery falls under the Risk Management regulation because the quantity of refrigerant (anhydrous ammonia) in the refrigeration system exceeds the threshold quantity.  In order to maintain a safe working environment, the brewery has developed procedures, plans and policies for the operation of the ammonia process and for dealing with unexpected accidental releases.  The Milwaukee Brewery has implemented a process safety management program, which enhances safety by regular maintenance and inspections, hazard analysis, compliance audits, employee and contractor training, employee participation, ammonia monitoring/detection, and other activities.  The brewery also maintains a Hazardous Materials Response Team complete with state-of-the-art emergency response equipment.  The team is trained to quickly and effectively respond to a release of hazardous material.  The facility also has emergency response procedures and plans to promote chemical safety in the event of an emergency situation. \n\n\n\nSupporting documentaion for the worst-case an alternative release scenario is included in the Hazard Assessment. \n\n \n\nIn the previous five years, the MillerCoors facility has not had any accidental releases, which resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage from the ammonia process.\n\n\n\nThe MillerCoors Milwaukee facility is also subject to the Process Safety Management regulations under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).  As a result of these regulations, the MillerCoors Milwaukee facility has implemented a program to further enhance process safety which involves operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity (maintenance related issues), pre-start-up-review, management of change, compliance audits, incident investigation, employee participation, hot work (welding) permits, and contr"

      "SummaryText": "actor safety.\n\n\n\nThe facility's emergency response program consists of the following core elements; 24 hour monitoring by ammonia refrigeration specialists, stationary ammonia detection devices, hazard communication training for all employees on anhydrous ammonia, an emergency response plan, a hazardous material response team, ammonia response drawings, and coordination with local authorities and emergency response units.  \n\n\n\nThe emergency response plan at the MillerCoors Milwaukee facility contains information and procedures relative to initial response, evacuation, fire response, chemical releases, severe weather, bomb threats, facility specific information (site maps/drawings, security, communication system, emergency organization), emergency/spill prevention, post emergency procedures, training summary, and administrative management of change.  \n\n\n\nThe emergency response plan for the facility has been submitted to the Milwaukee County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  Additionally, the Milwaukee Fire Department Hazardous Materials Team serves as a backup to the Miller Hazardous Material team along with additional backup emergency response contractors.\n\n\n\nSafeguards for the ammonia covered process have included expansion of ammonia detection devices to improve coverage in each of the equipment rooms, and tunnels, and   updated the controls on ammonia chillers, and engine room ventilation."
