As a new company, formed as a result of a divestiture from Dow Chemical, we have a long history of excellent safety performance. Our commitment to maintain that performance is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Should a release occur, we would rely on the highly trained emergency response personnel onsite to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also coordinated with City of Midland Fire Department, which can provide additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\nB.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the manufacturing of specialty chemicals and plastics.  We are wholly contained within The Dow Chemical Company Midland, Michigan Operations Site.  We have 3 regulated substances and 2 covered processes present at our facility.  These substances are listed in Table 1 below.\n\n\n\nTable 1:  Regulated chemical substances at Trinseo, LLC, Michigan Operations Site.\n\n\n\nMaterial\n\nAcrylonitrile\n\nAmmonia solution (>20% concentration)\n\nVinyl Acetate Monomer\n\n\n\nC.

Numerous types of information are available to supplement safety information.  Some of these would include, Material Safety Data Sheets for materials used on site, equipment and engineering design specifications, and applicable reactive chemicals testing.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  For initial screening and risk evaluation The Dow Chemical Fire and Explosion Index, The Dow Chemical Chemical Exposure Index, and a Reactive Chemical and Process Hazard Analysis are conducted on a defined schedule.  These listed methodologies are supplemented when needed with analyses that may include some of the following:  What if Analysis, Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP), Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), and Fault Tree Analysis.  A team of qualified personnel undertakes the studies with expertise in engineering and process operations.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Trinseo, LLC Michigan Operations maintains written operating procedures.
