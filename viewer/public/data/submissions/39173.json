The facility has a training program, which includes both internal and external emergency responders.\n\nThe emergency response procedures at this facility ensure emergency response coverage 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  There are also adequate provisions for coordination with outside agencies, such as the North Lawrence Fire Department, the LEPC and OPTECH Environmental Services in the event of an emergency.\n\n2.0    Process Description and Regulated Substance\n\nThe Kraft Foods North Lawrence facility produces blended yogurt and cottage cheese.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for the primary process at this facility is 311513 and 311514.  The facility is also capable of packaging yogurt and cottage cheese products.  Several areas of the facility are refrigerated to preserve the food products.\n\nAmmonia is the only Kraft Foods North Lawrence regulated substance under 40 CFR 68.  The ammonia is utilized as a refrigerant for the cooling of yogurt, cottage cheese and dairy ingredients and is located in various locations in the facility.\n\nKraft Foods North Lawrence exceeds the 10,000 pounds threshold according to 40 CFR 68.  The quantity of ammonia presently stored on site is approximately 18,000 pounds.\n\nAmmonia is classified as a Group 2 refrigerant per ASHRAE Standard 34-1989.  Its distinctive pungent odor is very noticeable to most people, even in small quantities.  Ammonia is flammable in a very narrow and high range of concentration with a high ignition temperature.  Ammonia is not toxic, but can be corrosive to the human tissue.  Ammonia is readily absorbed into the moisture of the skin and at high concentrations can cause burns.

The OSHA PSM program for prevention meets the EPA requires for a RMP Program 3 Prevention Program and therefore makes the facility compliant with 40 CFR 68.\nThe PSM program contains thirteen (13) elements, which must be executed.\nEmployee Participation ? The purpose of this element is to ensure all employees have a voice in the PSM program and the operations of the ammonia equipment.  \nProcess Safety Information ? The purpose of this element is allowing all process hazards to be identified and understood.\nProcess Hazard Analysis ? The purpose of this element is to identify, evaluate and control process hazards using a systematic approach.\nOperating Procedures ? The purpose of this element is to develop, implement and maintain clear instructions for the safe operation of the ammonia system.\nTraining ? The purpose of this element is depending on role, personnel who may come in contact with ammonia, operate, maintain or clean ammonia refrigeration equipment understand applicable health hazards and be able to perform work safely.\nContractors ? The purpose of this element is to ensure all contractors either directly working on or just in the facility understand the hazards of ammonia.\nPre Startup Safety Review ? The purpose of this element is to ensure safety and design issues are considered before hazardous materials are introduced to the process or system.\nMechanical Integrity ? The purpose of this element is to ensure the continued integrity of the process equipment and minimize the potential for catastrophic release.\nHot Work P"

The purpose of this element is to minimize the impact of incidents by investigating the root cause of each incident or near miss.\nEmergency Action ? The purpose of this element is to ensure the facility has adequate means of addressing incidents as they occur.\nCompliance Audit ? The purpose of this element is to verify that PSM procedure and practices are adequate and being following and identify areas for improvement.\n\n4.0    Five Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases at this facility in the last five years.\n\n5.0    Emergency Response Program\n\nThe North Lawrence facility has a combination emergency response plan which addresses the accidental discharge of hazardous substances and hazardous waste in to the environment, measures to be taken to prevent an accident, countermeasures to be taken in the case of an accident and procedures for containing and limiting the duration of the emergency measures to be employed for further protection of employees responding to an emergency, as well as other plant personnel.\n\nThis plan incorporates the SPCC plan, by reference, which includes the location, types and amounts of chemicals stored on site, notification procedures, and countermeasures to be taken in the event of a spill.\n\nThis plan also incorporates established procedures to notify appropriate agencies and company personnel in the event of an emergency.\n\nOur comprehensive emergency response plan is designed to protect our employees, environment and the community and among other things requires that: all nonessentia"
