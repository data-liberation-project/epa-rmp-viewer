      "SummaryText": "     The stationary source is considered the entire Sodus Cold Storage Company, Inc. facility located at 50 Maple Avenue in Sodus, New York. The stationary source is involved in cold storage of cheese, apples, and other perishale food products. Ammonia liquified under pressure is the only regulated chemical exceeding a threshold quantity under 40 CFR Part 68.\n     The worst-case scenario release involves a complete release from the two vertical, high pressure reciever tanks which are located directly adjacent to each other and are interconnected by very short pieces of piping. This includes an unmitigated release of 12,000 pounds of ammonia over a ten minute period. The endpoint distance of 1.32 miles was calculated using Exhibit 4-4 in the Chemical Emergency Preparedness and Prevention Office's document \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration (40 CFR Part 68)\".\n     The alternative release scenario involves the venting of the largest releif valve from the ammonia refrigeration system. The orifice of the relief valve is 1.25 inches in diameter and the release occurs at a pressure of 180 PSI. Refering to Exhibit 4-6 in the Chemical Emergency Preparedness and Prevention Office's document \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration (40 CFR Part 68)\", an endpoint distance of 0.35 miles results. The total duration of the alternative release was designated as two minutes resulting in an ammonia release of approximately 7,450 pounds.\n     Sodus Cold Storage Company, Inc. proactively uses the OSHA Process Safety Management program required under 29 CFR 1910.119, in conjunction with the additional off-site considerations covered in the 40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D, as in accidental release prevention program. These documents are considered working programs and are used by facility personnel as the procedural standards for preventing accidental releases.\n     Emergency response policies for the facility include an integration of the plans requi"

Integration of these programs for the Sodus Cold Storage facility increases the usefullnes of the emergency preparedness activities by decreasing the burden associated with maintaining multiple programs. In general, Sodus Cold Storage performs only very minor emergency response measures with properly trained in-house personnel, however, local emergency response agencies handle all major emergencies. Community notifiaction policies are in place in the event of an emergency with potential off-site impacts.\n      One of the most important aspects of the prevention program is adherance to the mechanical integrity portion of the PSM Program, using specific standards established for the ammonia refrigeration industry by the device manufacturer and/or the Internation Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR).\n      There have been no reportable accidents during the previous five (5) years.\n      The emergency response program follows the company emergency response policy for the facility which consists of an integration of the plans required under 29 CFR 1910.38(a) \"Emergency Action Plan\", 40 CFR Part 355 \"Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know\", 29 CFR 1910.119 \"Process Safety Management\", and 40 CFR Part 68 Risk Management Program\". An integral aspect of the emergency response program is the emphasis placed on the proper employee training.\n      All ammonia system piping will be adequately marked where not already done. Enhanced piping identification can assist in mitgating the consequences of an ammonia release."
