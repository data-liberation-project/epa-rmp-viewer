The Facility Policy:\r\n\r\nThe owners, management and employees of Twin State, Inc.,  are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training of all persons that work with ammonia.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department, and Franklin County LEPC, and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\r\n\r\n2. Facility Information:\r\n\r\nThe primary activity at the facility is the distribution of fertilizer products. Twin States Inc., facility has one regulated substance at the facility - anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in a horizontal bullet-tank designed for this purpose.  The fertilizer product, anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and used in the process of making anhydrous ammonia-based fertilizers as a nutrient for crop production. \r\n\r\nConsistent with the compliance guidelines of 29CFR Part 1910 and 40 CFR Part 68, this facility has developed a management system to minimize consequences associated with the process of making anhydrous ammonia-based fertilizers. \r\n\r\nThe facility produces two versions of nitrogenous fertilizer from anhydrous ammonia. \r\n\r\nThe first process uses anhydrous ammonia with phosphoric acid (68%, CAS No 7664-38-2). This process utilizes TVA Pipe Reactor technology to neutralize the phosphoric acid with ammonia. The result liquid product is an ammonium polyphosphate fertilizer, NPK: 10-34-0. This product is marketed to retailers.\r\n\r\nThe second process mechanically blend-reacts anhydrous ammonia with 10-34-0.  This process occurs in a mixing tank.  Water and soluble potash in various amounts (recipes) are used to produce various grades of liquid fertilizer.\r\n\r\nTwin States Inc. has Standard Operating Procedures (SO"

This program provides plans and information that will assist emergency responders in the event of accident at the facility.\r\n\r\nFinally, the management system provides procedures and plans to assist employees in conductions both routine and non-routine plant operations, to identify potential hazardous situations, and to respond to actual emergencies.\r\n \r\n3. Accidental Release Prevention Program:\r\n\r\nThe facility is in compliance with the provisions of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\" and our state regulations covering anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\nThe facility personnel are committed to the safety of our employees, public and the environment. This commitment is demonstrated by continually improving policies and practices intended to prevent releases of hazardous substances. In the unlikely event of a release, we have an emergency action plan in place to minimize potential effects.\r\n\r\n4. The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario:\r\n\r\nIncluding administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario.\r\n\r\nThe Fertilizer Institute TFI/DEGADIS-generated Lockup Tables were used to perform offsite consequences analysis. The following two paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios:\r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario involves the catastrophic release of anhydrous ammonia. In the scenario, ammonia would be released to atmosphere over a 10-minute period. The gaseous ammonia is released at Class F stability with 1.5 m/s wind-speed. \r\n\r\nThe alternative-case scenario involves the release of ammonia over a 2-minute period. The release is assumed to be controlled by excess flow valves, emergency shutdown and/or emergency procedures. Weather conditions are assumed to be neutral.\r\n\r\nThe facility has taken steps to comply with accidental release prevention.\r\n\r\n5. The Five-Year Accident History:"
