      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe Henry County Water and Sewerage Authority has owned and operated water and wastewater treatment facilities within Henry County, Georgia for thirty years.  During this time the Authority has utilized chlorine gas for the disinfection of the treated water and wastewater.  To date there has been no reportable incident, over the ten-pound release, that has affected the health and safety of the employees or the communities where these facilities operate.\n\nWith the safety and welfare of its employees and the community at the forefront,  the Henry County Water and Sewerage Authority has developed a Risk Management Plan.  This plan has been submitted to all local emergency services to provide a comprehensive response to all possible scenarios related to the release of chlorine gas.  This plan to assure an orderly and complete response to issues that could arise in the utilization of chlorine gas\n\n\n\nSCOPE AND PURPOSE OF THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nIt is the policy of the Henry County Water & Sewerage Authority, Towaliga River Water Treatment Facility, to protect all workers and the community around this facility against known and anticipated hazards during the course of work operations as well as any emergencies arising at the plant.  Additionally, a site specific Emergency Response Plan has been  developed to ensure that all coordination with outside organizations including the National Response Center, the Georgia State Emergency Response Commission, Henry County Emergency Response Management, law enforcement, the Henry County Fire Department, Henry Medical Center, and emergency medical technicians is assured.\n\nWith the careful enforcement and execution of this Emergency Response Plan, in the event of an emergency release of hazardous gases at this facility, the harm to workers, the public and the environment will be minimized.  The Emergency Response Plan will address community planning and communication, how this facility will interact with local"

The valve could fail or rupture, resulting in the release of the contents of the cylinder.  If this occurs, a major release could occur and this is the worst case scenario for an emergency response at the Site. The gas could not be stopped by shutting off a valve, and the use of a B Kit for repairs would be in order.\n\n2.\tThe schedule 120# steel feed lines (approximately 15\u00bf of line) could develop a pin-hole leak, crack or break.  This could result in the release of a significant amount of chlorine gas very quickly depending on the extent of the break in the line.  This, too would constitute a worst case scenario for emergency response.  However, a leak here could be stopped by shutting off a valve.\n\n3.\tInside the control room there are a few potential break/leak points for the release of chlorine gas, including approximately 10 feet of pipe runs with numerous valves, elbows, tees and joints where leaks could develop.  The piping lines that carry the chlorine into the eductors could develop a leak or rupture, releasing chlorine gas into the air.  This could constitute a worst case scenario for emergency response.\n\n4.\tNormal operations could result in an emergency response.  Hooking up the new chlorine cylinders to the manifold could result in a release"

A release in this area could be quickly detected by this sensor and an alarm would sound that can be heard throughout the facility, grounds and office building, as well as the visual alarm indicators.\n\n\nLoss of Utilities\n\nAt this facility, the loss of utilities including electricity will not increase the potential for a release of chlorine gas.  \n\n\nThreatening Weather\nIn the event of dangerous weather such as a hurricane or tornado, all plant personnel and onsite visitors will gather at the designated rally point.\n\n\nBomb Threat Procedures\n\nMost bomb threats are telephoned in and are usually hoaxes.  It is still important to take all bomb threats seriously.  The person answering the phone must get as much information as possible from the caller.  The bomb threat work sheet is contained in Appendix 11 of this document.\n\nUpon completion of the bomb threat work sheet, the person taking the call will immediately notify the ranking supervisor.  The ranking supervisor will make the determination whether the call is a credible threat or if it is uncertain as to whether it is a credible threat.  If it is credible, the facility will be evacuated.  The bomb squad will be called, and if time permits, a search of the facility will be undertaken in an attempt to find the bomb.  If it is uncertain as to whether the threat is credible, the ranking supervisor will inform employees of the threat and make a decision as to what further action needs to be taken.\n\nBomb threats received through the mail must also be taken seriously.  Employees should use the precautionary procedures posted on the main bulletin board prior to opening all mail.\n\n\nLINES OF AUTHORITY\n\nS. David Whitson, P"

This senior official has the responsibility for controlling the operations at the Site.  Initially, David Whitson  will serve as Incident Response Commander.  As more senior officers arrive (i.e., the Fire Chief, State Law Enforcement Official, etc.), the position is passed up the line of authority.  All emergency responders and their communications are coordinated and controlled through the senior official in charge of the ICS assisted by the senior official present for each employer.\n\nDavid Whitson reports to senior management, Lindy Farmer, General Manger of the Henry County Water & Sewerage Authority, and Mr. Farmer reports to the Henry County Manager, Linda Angus.\n\nAll employees at the plant are trained at the level of First Responder Awareness.
