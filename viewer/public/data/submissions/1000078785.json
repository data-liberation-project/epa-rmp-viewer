Since the last resubmission in 2014, one RMP chemical (anhydrous ammonia) has been removed from the site, and aqueous ammonia substituted for it.  Another chemical (phosphorous oxychloride, POCl3) has been removed completely.  Modeling has been updated to reflect this change.\n\nTh\n\n\n\nI.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies applicable to Eastman Chemical Company Tennessee Operations are summarized in the Eastman Chemical Company Responsible Care&reg; Policy which states in part: \"Eastman has adopted Responsible Care as the cornerstone of our global HSES policy which states our commitment to conduct our business consistent with all applicable laws, regulations, sound HSES practices and Responsible Care principles.\"  The policy goes on to state that \"We pledge [t]o make continual progress toward our goal of no accidents, injuries or harm to human health and the environment from our products and operations and to be transparent in reporting our health, safety, environmental and security performance.\"\n\n\n\nOur safety process consists of 5 main steps:\n\n?    Hazard identification, prevention and control\n\n?    Safe design and construction\n\n?    Safety and health education and training\n\n?    Employee involvement, accountability, and responsibility\n\n?    Systematic evaluation for continual improvement\n\n\n\nDetails of our accident prevention efforts are contained in the Eastman Kingsport Site Safe Practices Manual and the Process Safety Practices Manual, comprehensive documents detailing specific practices, procedures, and expectations to ensure the safety of our employees, our contractors, our community, and the environment.\n\n\n\nTennessee Operation's emergency response plans and strategies are described in the E"

      "SummaryText": "astman Kingsport Site Emergency Plan.  This plan specifies the responsibilities and duties of Eastman personnel during emergencies and potential emergencies.  These responsibilities and duties provide for the prompt mobilization of company resources, including both personnel and equipment in an emergency.  \n\n\n\nThese plans are regularly reviewed and updated.\n\n\n\n\n\nII.    Description of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nPrimary Activities\n\n\n\nEastman Chemical Company is a leading international chemical company that produces more than 400 chemicals, fibers, and plastics.  Eastman does not sell consumer products, but Eastman supplies other producers with materials for products used by consumers.  Founded in 1920 in Kingsport, Tennessee, as a unit of Eastman Kodak Company, Eastman Chemical Company was spun off in 1994 and is now an independent, publicly held company traded on the New York Stock Exchange (ticker symbol EMN).

      "SummaryText": "I.    General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nTNO utilizes layers of controls to protect people and the environment.  This approach includes, but is not limited to, the following elements:\n\n\n\n?    Designing for Safety\n\n\n\n-    Designs are analyzed for safety prior to installation, and periodically thereafter, in accordance with the requirements of the RMP Regulation.  All RMP covered processes are Program 3 processes.  \n\n\n\n?    Operating Safely\n\n\n\n-    All operators, mechanics, and contractor personnel who work within the plant are trained and qualified in accordance with applicable federal, state, and local regulations.\n\n-    Automated safety systems are used extensively to prevent the accidental release of chemicals due to misoperation or process upset.\n\n\n\n?    Maintaining Safe Operations/Auditing our Operations\n\n\n\n-    Process systems undergo routine inspections to ensure proper labeling, equipment condition, etc.  Discrepancies are corrected before further use or in a safe and timely manner when necessary means are taken to assure safe operation.\n\n-    Audits are conducted every three years per the requirements of 40 CFR 68.79\n\n\n\n?    Training\n\n\n\n-    Operators are initially trained on the specifics of the process they will be running and receive refresher training at least every three years.\n\n-    Supervisors responsible for directing process operations are also trained appropriate to the supervisor's responsibilities.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the elements described above, the Eastman Kingsport Site is a State of Tennessee Volunteer Star site.  The Volunteer Star program, administered by the State of Tennessee Department of Labor, is Tennessee's version of the federal Voluntary Protection Program (VPP), a cooperative effort between employers and OSHA to improve worker/workplace safety and recognize outstanding safety performance and programs.  \n\n\n\n\n\nIV.    Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nTNO has had no RMP reportable incidents involving any of the listed chemicals within the past five-year reporting "

A computerized modeling system is available to Eastman emergency response personnel to predict the concentration and location of any vapor cloud resulting from a release\n\n2.    Emergency response is coordinated with local agencies as needed/appropriate.  Eastman maintains good working relationships with local emergency response organizations.\n\n3.    Eastman's emergency response crews use a tiered emergency response plan to enhance reaction time and effectiveness.  For vapor releases that might impact the community, a direct phone line to city and county central dispatch services who are responsible for community emergency notification is available\n\n4.    Emergency response personnel are regularly trained to ensure compliance with applicable federal, state, and local requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\nVI.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nImprovement plans fall into three primary areas:\n\n\n\n1.    Hazard Analysis-Routine assessment to identify potential hazards and implement corrective action will be done in accordance with applicable regulations.\n\n\n\n2.    Incident Investigation-Prompt, thorough investigation of all significant incidents and near-misses will be conducted using root cause failure analysis (RCFA) techniques, and learnings will be shared with others, as appropriate.\n\n\n\n3.    Benchmarking-Through our trade association, the American Chemistry Council (ACC), and through other cooperative efforts, such as the Center for Chemical Process Safety (CCPS), Eastman continually evaluates its safety programs and processes against the best in the world, with the goal of continual improvement.\n\n"
