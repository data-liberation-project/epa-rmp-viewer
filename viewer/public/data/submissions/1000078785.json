              "Description": "Designing For Safety\n\n- The storage tanks are in a containment area designed to safely prevent spills from reaching the public.\n\n- Ammonia detectors at the railcar unloading station and storage tanks provide notification of leaks in these locations.\n\n- The tanks are equipped with pressure relief valves to prevent overpressurization of the tanks.  \n\n- The distribution header system is designed with excess flow stations that automatically close if an excess flow is present, preventing a large unwanted release.  \n\n- The unloading system consists of closed loop piping to minimize releases to the atmosphere.\n\nOperating Safely\n\n- The railcar is visually inspected before it is unloaded.\n\n- Personnel verify that the storage tanks can hold the entire contents of the railcar before the transfer is started.\n\n- Operating procedures require continual operator attendance during ammonia transfers to the storage tanks so reaction time to leaks is minimized.\n\n- Trained personnel continually monitor the ammonia system; a leak may be found by a detector or by an easily detectable odor. \n\n- The operators, mechanics, and contractor personnel who work within the ammonia system are trained and qualified in accordance with applicable Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations.\n\n- Any changes to operating procedures or equipment are reviewed for potential impact on health, safety, and the environment using the Management of Change Process.\n\nMaintaining Safe Operations/Auditing Our Operations\n\n- The ammonia system is inspected on a routine basis to ensure the mechanical integrity of the equipment, piping, instrumentation, interlocks, and ESDs (as applicable).  Any discrepancies or defects are corrected before further use or in a safe and timely manner when necessary means are taken to assure safe operation.\n\n- Operators are initially trained on the process.  Refresher training is completed at least once every three years.\n\n- The area leak detection system is routinely checked by Certified Instrument Analysts.\n\n- The fire protection system is inspected, tested, and maintained per NFPA 25.\n\nAuditing Our Operations\n\n- Audits are completed at least once every three years in accordance with PSM/RMP requirements.",

Since operating procedures require continual operator attendance during weigh tank charging periods, reaction time to leaks is minimized.\n\n- Administrative controls are in place to make sure there is always room in the tank to transfer the entire drum of phosphorus trichloride.\n\n- Operators, mechanics, and contractor personnel who work within the process are trained and qualified in accordance with applicable Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations.\n\n- Any changes to operating procedures or equipment are reviewed for potential impact on health, safety, and the environment using the Management of Change Process.\n\nMaintaining Safe Operations\n\n- The weigh tank loading line is visually inspected every time it is used.\n\n- The weigh tank system is inspected on a routine basis to ensure the mechanical integrity of the equipment, piping, instrumentation, interlocks, and ESDs (as applicable).  Any discrepancies or defects are corrected before further use or in a safe and timely manner when necessary means are taken to assure safe operation.\n\n- Operators are initially trained on the process.  Refresher training is completed at least once every three years.\n\n- The fire protection system is inspected, tested, and maintained per NFPA 25.\n\nAuditing Our Operations\n\n- Audits are completed at least once every three years in accordance with PSM/RMP requirements.",

It is possible to manually vent vessels in this system to the flare.\n\nOperating Safely\n\n- Operating procedures require continual operator attendance during transfers to the storage tank so reaction time to leaks is minimized.\n\n- The operation of the storage tank system is continuously monitored using a distributed control computer system. \n\n- During transfers, all vehicular traffic near the unloading station is stopped by barriers and gates.\n\n- The storage tank is isolated with redundant manual valves which are only opened when propylene is charged and an operator present.\n\n- Operators, mechanics and contractor personnel who work within the process are trained and qualified in accordance with applicable Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations. \n\n- Any changes to operating procedures or equipment are reviewed for potential impact on health, safety, and the environment using the Management of Change Process.  \n\nMaintaining Safe Operations\n\n- A visual inspection of all lines and equipment is periodically completed.  \n\n- The propylene system is inspected on a routine basis to ensure the mechanical integrity of the equipment, piping, instrumentation, interlocks, and ESDs (as applicable).  Any discrepancies or defects are corrected before further use or in a safe and timely manner when necessary means are taken to assure safe operation.\n\n- Operators are initially trained on the process.  Refresher training is completed at least once every three years.\n\n- The area combustible gas leak detector system is routinely checked by Certified Instrument Analysts.\n\n- The fire protection system is inspected, tested, and maintained per NFPA 25.  \n\nAuditing Our Operations\n\n- Audits are completed at least once every three years in accordance with PSM/RMP requirements.",

              "Description": "Designing For Safety\n\n- The Department of Transportation (DOT) approved shipping container is made of heavy gauge steel. \n\n- A cover at the end of the cylinder protects the cylinder valves.  The cylinder valves are recessed to prevent the valves from being damaged.  \n\n- The HF cylinders are not equipped with thermal or pressure relief devices.\n\n- The HF cylinder is stored in a concrete cubicle.  There is protected access to the HF cylinder, making a break in the cylinder improbable.\n\n- The HF cylinder cubicle is equipped with emergency shutdown systems which will mitigate releases.\n\n- HF detectors at the HF cylinder cubicle and in the production facilities provide notification of leaks in these locations and activate water systems to prevent HF vapors from traveling out of the immediate area.\n\n- Piping used for transferring HF to the process is a special thick walled corrosion resistant material.\n\nOperating Safely\n\n- A fire inside the HF cylinder cubicle is very improbable because no flammable material is stored in the area; therefore, overpressurization of a cylinder to dangerous levels is highly unlikely.\n\n- Only one full cylinder and one partially full cylinder of HF is normally allowed on-site.  There is no other on-site or off-site inventory of HF.  The HF cylinder is delivered by the vendor directly to the HF storage cubicle.\n\n- Leaks are easily detected visually and by smell.    \n\n- The HF transfer supply line between the HF cubicle and the production facilities is purged clear between additions of HF.  The HF addition step is a small component of the batch cycle.   \n\n- The HF addition is DCS controlled. \n\n- The HF addition is a low pressure addition which is well below the design criteria of the piping system.\n\n- Procedures require two operators to be present when connecting or disconnecting an HF cylinder.\n\n- DSC interlocks and ESD systems (both software and hardwired) are in place to ensure the safe handling and addition of HF and to safely terminate an HF addition should a release occur.\n\n- Operators, mechanics, and contractor personnel who work within the HF system are trained and qualified in accordance with applicable Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations. \n\n- Any changes to operating procedures or equipment are reviewed for potential impact on health, safety, and the environment using the Management of Change Process.\n\nMaintaining Safe Operations\n\n- Flex hose connectors to the process are routinely inspected to be in good condition as part of the operating procedure. \n\n- The HF cylinder/process piping connection and the HF reactor system are routinely pressure checked for leaks to ensure the integrity of the system. \n\n- HF detection systems are routinely calibrated.\n\n- The HF system is inspected on a routine basis to ensure the mechanical integrity of the piping, instrumentation, interlocks, and ESDs (as applicable).  Any discrepancies or defects are corrected before further use or in a safe and timely manner when necessary means are taken to assure safe operation.\n\n- Operators are initially trained on the process.  Refresher training is completed at least once every three years.\n\nAuditing Our Operations\n\n- HF cylinders undergo a safety inspection by the vendor on a routine schedule.  Discrepancies or defects are corrected before further use.\n\n- Audits are completed at least once every three years in accordance with PSM/RMP requirements.",
