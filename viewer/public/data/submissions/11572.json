The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.)To save lives.\n2.)To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.)To protect the environment.\n4.)To minimize property damage.\n\nDOT Foods maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe DOT Foods ammonia refrigeration system has been in operation since 1995.  Changes/modifications have taken place since the completion of the facility with an expansion in 1999.  The ammonia refrigeration process was designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.  The facility is located at 16301 Elliot Parkway, Williamsport, Maryland 21795.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses 15,000 pounds of ammonia for dock operations, warehouse cold storage, and freezer storage.  The majority of the system is located in the machine room including vessels and compressors.  The condensers are mounted on the machine room roof, the water tank is located in the existing machine room, and all of the evaporators are located in their respective cold storage rooms/areas.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe DOT Foods facility was designed and constructed in accordanc"

These safety features include ammonia sensors in the machine room as well as sensors in selected cold storage areas, and automatic shut down systems.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the machine room or on the machine room roof (condensers).\n\nAmmonia sensors are present in the machine room and cold storage areas.  The system shuts down if a concentration of 10,000 ppm is detected.  Once the renovation is complete in 1999, operators will have the ability to dial into the central computer and read the alarm from a portable computer.  \n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility will operate in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines.  In particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems.\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\nWorst Case Release Result Summary\nScenario Description: Release of the maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored in the +150 Recirculator - 11,000 pounds - in 10 minutes.  The Recirculator is located within an enclosure, therefore, passive mitigation measures were used.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used: 1.5 m/s and F stability for a rural area.  The EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration was used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm.  This scenario reaches off-site may affect population receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential scenario.\n\nAlternative Release Result Summary\nScenario Description: A 0.25 inch diameter leak of high pressure liquid ammonia for one hour.  The quantity of ammonia released in one hour at a rate of 134 pounds per minute is 8,040 pounds.  The meteorological conditions used were 3 m/s and D stability for a rural area.

There is no accident history at this facility.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nIf an ammonia release were to occur, the DOT Foods response is to call the fire department's HazMat team to help aid in the shut down of the plant.  Once the renovation is complete in 1999, operators will have the ability to dial into the central computer and read the alarm from a portable computer.  Ammonia sensors are present in the machine room and cold storage areas.  The system shuts down if a concentration of 10,000 ppm is detected.  During off-hours, the alarm is directed to an outside alarm company that calls the on-call operator.\n\nEmployees within the building are evacuated to a point upwind of the facility or shelter in place.  Evacuation drills are performed annually.  The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, and is reviewed annually to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis provided the mitigation measures outlined below to improve safety at the DOT Foods facility located at 16301 Elliot Parkway, Williamsport, Maryland and are scheduled to be complete by June 2000.\n\nR01 Verify that a warning alarm is present on the readout on the main computer which shows the ammonia concentration level in the machine room and the set point in which it alarms.
