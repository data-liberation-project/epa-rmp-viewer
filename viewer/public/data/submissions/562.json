      "SummaryText": "The Aurora Cooperative Elevator Company's accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  The Aurora Cooperative emergency response plan involves the response services available in the community.  Aurora Cooperative bulk Anhydrous Ammonia facilities have been strategically located to provide a local retail facility for this form of affordable nitrogen fertilizer for agriculture.  This location in Harvard, Ne. is made up of two (2) 30,000 gallon pressurized storage vessels and two loadout risers.  It serves the Central Clay County area.  This facility is normally unmanned, except during the fertilizer season, although the adjacent grain elevator and office facilities are normally manned during business hours.  The offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two anhydrous ammonia release scenarios, identified as \"worst case release\" and \"alternative scenario\".  The first Scenario is defined byEPA, which states that the \"owner or operator shall assume that the...maximum  quantity of the largest vessel...is released as a gas over a 10 minute period\", due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative release scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst case scenario\".  Atmospheric dispersion modeling has to be performed to determine the distance traveled by the anhydrous ammonia released before it's concentration decreases to a \"non-toxic\" level.  For this purpose, Aurora Cooperative has chosen to use RMP-Comp Version 1.05 to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint (.14 mg/l or 200 ppm) and to determine the population affected by a potential release by using maps extracted from Landview III software.  The worst case release scenario for the Aurora Cooperative anhydrous ammonia facility in Harvard involves failure of one of the two 30,000 gallon pressurized storage vessels while it contains 85% (maximum allowed capacity) of it's capacity.  The alternative rel"
