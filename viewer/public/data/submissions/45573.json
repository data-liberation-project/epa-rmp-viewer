      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nThis Risk Management Plan (RMP) updates the City of Weslaco Water Treatment Plant from a Prevention Program 2 to a Prevention Program 3 and includes the required elements of Process Safety Management (PSM). Operations Management International, Inc. (OMI), a private contractor, operates the plant. A water treatment plant operated by a private contractor is subject to Prevention Program 3, which encompasses the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) PSM standards. The contents of this RMP and PSM document the Weslaco Water Treatment Plant?s compliance with the Clean Air Act Section 112 (r)(7), 40 CFR 68, and 29 CFR 1910.119 for the protection of employees, the public and the environment.\n\nThis Risk Management Plan has been updated to include Process Safety Management. This involved the addition of sections on:\n?    Process Hazard Analysis \n?    Management of Change \n?    Pre-Startup Review\n?    Employee Participation Plans \n?    Hot Work Permits \n?    Contractors\n\nThe act of updating and resubmitting the RMP also involved a review or revision of the following:\n?    operating procedures\n?    training programs\n?    maintenance procedures\n?    equipment inspection\n?    Emergency Response Plan\n?    Emergency Response Training\n\n\nThe City of Weslaco Water Treatment Plant is located at Mile 5 West & Mile 9 North, Weslaco, Hidalgo County, Texas, at North 26.184334 Latitude and West -97.991154 Longitude. The chlorination area at the Water Treatment Plant is a loading dock that consists of a two-sided brick area that opens to the west and south and is located approximately in the middle of the facility. Six one-ton containers of chlorine are stored in the facility.  Only two of the containers are connected to the system at one time.  One is operational and the other serves as backup.  Emergency air supply and power are available.  The facility is staffed 24-hours a day and operators check the chlorination building daily. Self-Contained-Breathing-Apparatus (SCBA) are stored on-site"

      "SummaryText": ".\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis for the Water Treatment Plant includes consideration of two release scenarios for each parameter of concern (chlorine): \n\n1. A Worst-Case Release\n2. An Alternative Scenario\n\nThe following key elements outline the accidental release prevention program for the Weslaco Water Treatment Plant:\n$    High level of training of the operators;\n$    Preventive maintenance program;\n$    Use of state of the art process and safety equipment;\n$    Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators;\n$    Performance of a hazard review of equipment and procedures;\n$    Implementation of an audit and inspection program.\n\nThe facility has a Hot Work Permit procedure, a procedure for contractors working at the plant, an employee participation plan, and a Management of Change procedure. The facility also has a written Employee Participation Plan. Employees participate in the Process Hazard Analysis and have access to their training records and other information.\n\nChemical-specific prevention steps include operator use of available Self-Contained-Breathing-Apparatus (SCBA) during connection/disconnection of the chemical supply, awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine and the presence of a chemical detector.  An Agreement with Chemical Response & Remediation Contractors, Inc.(CRRC) has been made for assistance with emergency response.\n\nNo accidental releases of chlorine have occurred at the site in the past five years.\n"
