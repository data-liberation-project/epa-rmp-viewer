In 1988 the pressure feed system was replaced from a pressure system to a vacumm system. Also at this time, a chlorine leak detector and alarm system was installed.  Consulting engineers were Floan-Sanders Engineering of East Grand Forks, Minnesota.  Equipment supplier for this conversion was Feed-Rite Chemicals out of Fargo, North Dakota.  General contractor of the project was Smith Construction of Grand Forks, North Dakota. Most recently, a Chlorine Scrubber along with a building addition for the scrubber  was constructed. Project engineer was Floan-Sanders, Inc. of East Grand Forks, Minnesota and Advanced Engineering of Grand Forks, North Dakota.  General Contractor was Carlson Builders of Grand Forks, North Dakota.  Project was completed in the fall of 1999.",
