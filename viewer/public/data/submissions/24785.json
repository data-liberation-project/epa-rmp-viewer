The Emergency Action Plan (RAP) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the Aspen Distribution's PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nAspen Distribution maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\n\nAspen Distribution has coordinated emergency response efforts with the local fire department, Victorville Fire Department.  In the case of an ammonia-related emergency, it is the policy of Aspen Distribution to evacuate the employees and to allow the fire department to respond to the emergency (potentially with the assistance of trained facility personnel).\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nAspen Distribution began operation of the facility upon its completion in December 2001.  The ammonia system at Aspen Distribution consists primarily of vessels, compressors, condensers, evaporators and associated piping.  The majority of the equipment is located inside the engine room.  The system is a closed loop refrigeration system similar to a residential refrigerator.  There are no emissions or planned releases of ammonia.\n\nThe Aspen Distribution facility provides cold storage space and a docking area for candy items.  Ammonia sensors are located in the engine room, cold storage and dock areas that alert facility personn"

The ammonia detection system also has the capability to shut-off all electrical power to the engine room to eliminate the potential for an explosion.\n\nThe maximum intended inventory of ammonia is 20,000 pounds.\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\nWorst Case Release Result Summary\n\nScenario Description : Release of the maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored in a vessel (the Controlled Pressure Receiver has the capacity to hold a much higher quantity than the ammonia charge of 20,000 pounds) - 20,000 pounds in 10 minutes.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used: 1.5 meters per second wind speed, and F stability.  Since the CPR vessel is located inside, the enclosure of the building was considered a passive mitigation measure, reducing the effective release rate to the outside atmosphere by 55%.  The \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\" reference tables were used to determine the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm in urban conditions.  This release reaches 1.5 miles off site and may impact population receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release.\n\nAlternative Release Result Summary\n\nScenario Description : The alternative release scenario presented is similar to the worst case in that it is a liquid release.  The alternative release scenario chosen for this facility is that of a 0.25 inch diameter orifice leading to an airborne release, representative of a pump seal leak, a gasket rupture, pinhole leak due to corrosion, flange seal leak, valve bonnet seal leak, etc.  It is assumed that this release is from the high side of the system; therefore at a maximum pressure of 180 psig.  The release scenario is assumed to last one hour, thereby incorporating mitigation measures such as the ammonia sensors and system shutdown.\n\nEPA allows a facility to use typical meteorological cond"

For this scenario, a wind speed of 3 meters/second and neutral conditions, D stability, were used to find the distance the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm in an urban area.\n\nEPA's \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Facilities\", Exhibit 4-5 for D Stability, Wind Speed 3.0 Meters per Second, was used to find the downwind distance for the alternate release scenario. This release reaches 0.1 miles off site and may impact population receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Aspen Distribution ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with Cal/OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation and California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program. \n\nAmmonia detectors are strategically located in the engine room and evaporator warehouses.  In case of ammonia detection, visible and audible alarms will activate at the facility and at the off-site monitoring company.\n\nIn the event of a power failure, ammonia operations would automatically shut-down (solenoid valves close, compressors shut-down, condenser fans and water pumps shut-down, evaporator fans shut-down, etc.).  In the case of a power failure, a back-up generator with a minimum of two operating hours shall power the refrigeration control system, equipment room purge fan, evaporative condenser fan and water pump.\n\nThe system also incorporates a pressure relief line.  In the event of over-pressurization, vessels will vent through pressure relief valves to a common header which relieves to an outside water diffusion tank until the system pressure decreases sufficiently to reseat the valves.  This mechanism prevents vessels from rupturing in case they become over pressurized.\n\nAmmo"

The only composition change that occurs within the systems are phase changes, as ammonia is cycled through various stages of liquid and vapor, similar to a household refrigerator.  The refrigeration system is a closed-loop system without any regular emissions or releases.  Any leaks are noted and repaired immediately.\n\nIn addition to the 1997 Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility will operate in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines.  In particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems.\"\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nBecause this is a new ammonia refrigeration system, there have been no accidental ammonia releases at the Aspen Distribution facility within the last five years. \n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nAspen Distribution has an emergency action plan in effect at the facility.  The Emergency Action Plan (RMP) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document.  Emergency response activities are coordinated with the City of Victorville Fire Department and the local fire houses.  In case of a major ammonia emergency, the facility will first call 9-1-1 to alert the local Police and Fire Departments.  Other responders will be called as needed, including the City of Victorville Fire Department Hazardous Materials Division.  If a release exceeds the federal reporting quantity of 100 pounds for ammonia, the National Response Center will be called.\n\nAspen Distribution maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.

This document includes the results from the two elements: 1) the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study conducted October 24, 2001, and 2) a Facility Inspection conducted December 17, 2001.

All recommendations are scheduled to be completed by December 2, 2002.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nR01 Establish a training policy so that every employee at the facility has the following information: general ammonia awareness, what to do when an ammonia leak is observed, where to go when an evacuation is called for.\n\nR02 Establish an emergency action plan that includes facility personnel responsibilities during an evacuation.\n\nR03 Establish a preventive maintenance procedure to test and calibrate the ammonia sensors at the facility based on the manufacturer's recommendations.\n\nR04 Determine and implement methods for alerting all on-site personnel (including truck drivers) of an emergency situation that requires an evacuation.\n\nR05 Establish a policy to ensure that extraneous materials, especially flammables, are not stored in the engine room.\n\nR06 Ensure that all the pressure relief valves in the system are replaced or recertified at least every 5 years or any time on"
