              "Description": "NH3 Service Company in Santa Maria, Ca, utilizes anhydrous ammonia, phosphoric acid and water to create a neutral fertilizer solution(10-34-0).  Ammonia is unloaded via truck into a 14,039 gallon steel storage tank.  The ammonia is displaced via a 5 horse power pump through a 2-inch diameter steel pipe to a cooling unit.  Prior to the cooling unit, the 2-inch diameter pipe is reduced to a 1-inch diameter pipe.  The cooling unit consists of a U-shaped pipe, 2-inches in diameter.  The ammonia stream leaving the U-shaped pipe is split into two separate ammonia streams.  One of the streams is regulated by a percentage flow meter and flows past a pH sensor.  This ammonia stream terminates at a sparger in a 3,000 gallon steel mixing tank.                                                                    The other ammonia stream is regulated by a float type flow meter and recycles back through the U-shaped pipe.  This ammonia stream flows to a one-four heat exchanger.  The other stream passing through this heat exchanger is neutral fertiizer solution (10-34-0).  The ammonia stream leaves the heat exchanger via a 2-inch diameter steel pipe and enters another doublepass heat exchange.  The other stream in this heat exchanger is also the neutral fertiizer solution.  The ammonia stream leaves the second heat exchanger via a 1-inch diameter steel pipe and enters the pipe reactor.  Phoshoric acid is added via a 5 hp pump to the reactor and then flows into a 3,000 gallon steel mixing tank. A 5 hp propeller mixer and a scrubber are installed on the mixing tank.  A water jacket circulates water via the city of Santa Maria around the reactor and discharges into the scrubber and directley into the mixing tank.                                                                                      Between the truck of ammonia and the ammonia tank itself there are two pressure release valves.  The ammonia tank has two pressure release valves on top.  In the lines going from the ammonia tank to the 10-34-0 reactor there are 13 pressure release valves,  4 pressure gauges, 2 check valves, 1 inline pH sensor, and 1 temperature gauge.  On top of the 10-34-0 mix tank there is one scrubber.  The whole area drains into a sump.",

      "SummaryText": "NH3 Service Company is located in a very environmentally sensitive county. Agriculture in general is very heavily regulated in the State of California.  Therefore our company is ruled and guided by numerous government organizations, namely the State and County Agricultural Commissions, the State Board of Underground Water Conrail, Air Quality, County Hazardous Materials-Protection Services Division, and the Fire Department.  All these agencies inspect our facility and require training for our employees.\nNH3 Service Company was established in 1939.  It has been supplying local farms with custom blends of fertilizer and applying these fertilizers since that time.  In 1974 a 10-34-0 liquid fertilizer formulation facility was constructed. The system consists of a 14,000-gallon anhydrous ammonia storage tank, two heat exchangers, a pipe reactor, a 3,000-gallon mixing tank and other associated process piping and equipment.  The ammonia is combined with phosphoric acid and water in the pipe reactor to produce 10-34-0, a neutral fertilizer solution.  The 10-34-0 product is cycled through two heat exchangers and an air-cooling unit prior to being pumped to storage in eight vertical storage tanks at the site. The storage tanks are in their own dike-enclosed area.  The ammonia is stored in a 14,000-gallon steel storage tank with appropriate safety valves to control overpressure in the tank. There are excess flow valves to control leaks that could be caused by potential breaks in the piping.  The system operates at pressures of 35 to 150 psig and temperatures of 50 to 600 F.  \n Because anhydrous ammonia is considered an extremely hazardous material the County of Santa Barbara Department of Environmental Health required the company to prepare a Risk Management Prevention Program (RMPP) in 1993.  A team of NH3 Service Company and Science & Engineering Analysis Corporation (SEACOR) personnel performed a hazard and operability study (HAZOP).  A HAZOP report containing recommended p"

      "SummaryText": "rocess improvements was submitted. All the recommended improvements have been completed at this time.  In addition, an offsite consequence analysis was conducted and documented in a report, which was submitted separately.  A seismic assessment was conducted on the ammonia tank, the foundation of the ammonia storage tank and the system control building.  All of these documents are presented in the RMPP. The RMPP also contains auditing and inspection procedures, recordkeeping, the emergency response, and employee training. \nThe county also required a separate emergency response plan and chemical inventory.  In this document are the original facility and site maps, all chemical training programs, general safety rules, safety training, and recordkeeping; along with the facility evacuation plan, and shutdown procedures. All this information has been submitted to the local fire department, and is accessible to them in the firebox located on the front of the office. Lastly NH3 Service Company has a written injury and illness prevention program governed by the State and implemented by the County.  \nNH3 is very proud of its safety programs, and can report that there have been no accidents in the past five years related to the 10-34-0 reactor.  This is due in large part to an excellent training program, ongoing modernization of the reactor and its safety controls and little to no employee turnover."
