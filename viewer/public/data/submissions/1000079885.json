To accomplish this we integrate health, safety, and environmental planning into all business activities. This includes complying with applicable laws, responsibly managing risks, and working collaboratively with others in addressing health, safety, and environmental issues.\r\nIn the Momentive Safety Manual, the Safety Policy Statement clearly states that safety will not be compromised to achieve any other operational or business objective. This manual defines requirements and guidelines developed to prevent injuries and accidental releases.\r\nEmergency Response Policies included in the Safety Manual state that safety is the top priority in all emergency response situations. This policy refers to the plant Emergency Response Plan for specific procedures for handling releases of hazardous materials.\r\n2.Stationary source and regulated substances handled\r\nThe Springfield plant primarily makes formaldehyde solutions, phenol-formaldehyde resins, and urea-formaldehyde resins. The site includes two (2) formaldehyde manufacturing facilities, two (2) Urea-\r\nFormaldehyde/Melamine-Formaldehyde Resin Reactors, one (1) Urea-Formaldehyde/Ketone-Formaldehyde Resin Reactor and three (3) Phenol-Formaldehyde Resin reactors. Although some formaldehyde is sold, it is\r\nprimarily used on site as a raw material for various types of resins. Aqueous ammonia is used in small amounts as a raw material for urea-formaldehyde resins.\r\nThe regulated substances used in the plant and the maximum quantities stored are:\r\nFormaldehyde: 1,127,000 lbs.\r\nAmmonia: 25,500 lbs.\r\n3.Accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\r\nThe plant has a comprehensive process safety management program that is in compliance with the EPA Accidental Release Prevention Rule, the OSHA P"

This management system includes the Safety Manual, a list of site safety responsibilities, a file system to maintain\r\nrecords of compliance, and a monthly Safety Committee meeting, where a management control checksheet is used to verify that tasks were completed on schedule. The Site Leader has overall responsibility for this\r\nprogram.\r\nDesignated personnel are assigned to maintain and improve the safety of their units. Their duties include keeping operating procedures up-to-date, training operators so they can safely carry out these procedures,\r\nassuring that the plant is run safely on a daily basis, and when necessary, investigating incidents in their unit.\r\nAll employees participate in the safety program to improve safety and plant operation. Designated personnel also maintain the Operating Guide that includes process safety information, operating procedures, and a training certification program. Operators use this Operating Guide as a training tool and for reference. Their actions will prevent accidental releases by applying the information it contains.\r\nThe site conducts Process hazard analyses on an on-going basis to identify hazards and recommend safeguards that will prevent an accidental release. Recommendations resulting from the process hazard analyses are entered into an action items database to track the items to completion.\r\nA Management of Change (MOC) system assures that changes to plant equipment, procedures, or processes do not cause accidents. MOC initiates a safety review for equipment, procedure, and process changes, and may include a process hazard analysis. Changes to product formulations initiate a review by technical and plant personnel.\r\nA preventive maintenance program maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment.

Each month scheduled equipment inspections, tests, or servicing are performed. The schedule is based on plant experience to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release caused by equipment failure.\r\nThe requirements in the Safety Manual include safe work practices which prevent accidental releases. One important section describes safety measures for welding or other hot work, which includes a permit system\r\nto reduce the risk of fire. The Safety Manual also includes requirements for locking out equipment for maintenance. These procedures reduce the likelihood that a valve position or operation error will lead to a release.\r\nContractors who periodically perform work in the plant are given safety orientations to brief them on plant hazards and safety practices. Contractor safety programs and performance are evaluated prior to their\r\nselection for jobs that impact process safety.\r\nIncidents that cause or could have caused a release are investigated and recommendations are made to prevent recurrence. These recommendations may lead to improvements in equipment, procedures, operating conditions, or training.\r\nInternal Corporate Health, Safety and Environmental Audits are conducted periodically to maintain compliance with local, state and federal regulations. Regional Safety and Environmental professionals periodically review the health, safety, and environmental programs. Addressing recommendations from these audits and reviews keeps the Facility's Safety and Environmental programs effective.\r\n4.Five-year accident history\r\nIn the five year period from June 6, 2014 to June 4, 2019 there were no reportable off-site releases of regulated substances.\r\n5.Emergency response program\r\nThe plant Emergency Response Plan describes procedures for actual and threatened releases, including coordination with fire department responders.
