In the event of an emergency release of ammonia it will be necessary for some specifically assigned and properly trained employees to remain in work areas that are being evacuated long enough to perform critical operations. Before a maintenance employee enters a release area, they must first test the concentration of the release by using an ammonia detector. They must also operate in pairs. If the isolation is within their reasonable capabilities they may isolate the leak and shut down the system if needed.\r\n\r\nIn response to an ammonia release, Falls City Foods will not respond to releases of hazardous chemicals in an offensive manner. The facility does not have any employees trained at the HAZMAT Technicians or First Responders Operations Level.  However, in the case of a minor ammonia release, designated maintenance personnel are allowed to isolate or maintain the release.\r\n\r\nFalls City Foods has not had any accidental releases to report since the commissioning of the plant.\r\n\r\nThe worst case release scenario would be a release from HPR-2 in the Main Engine Room releasing 5,931 lbs of ammonia (80% full) for duration of ten minutes.

These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.   Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.  Our safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities.  Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.  \r\n\r\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.
