Accidental Release Prevention ~ Emergency Response Policies\n\nAble Electropolishing is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2. Description of the Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nAble Electropolishing specializes in the Electropolishing of mostly stainless steel parts for functional and decorative purposes. We have (1) RMP regulated substance present at our facility subject to Risk Management Planning. This substance is anhydrous sulfur dioxide (SO2), a compressed gas that is injected into wastewater treatment system, used for treating hexavalent chromium in our wastewater from our Electropolishing operations. SO2 is an efficient reducing chemical in treating the wastewater for chromium down to our regulated effluent limits prior to discharging the water to sewer.\n\n3. Worst-Case Release Scenario & Alternate Release Scenario\n\nThe maximum quantity of sulfur dioxide that would be released at our facility is 2000 Ibs. The sulfur dioxide we use comes in 1-Ton cylinders that compress and liquefy the sulfur dioxide under pressure for use in the wastewater treatment system. According to USE Pa's Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants using SO2, failure of a cylinder containing 2000 Ibs. of SO2 produces a scenario within a 1.3 mile distance to the endpoint. However, this worst-case scenario release is unlikely due to the controls Able Electropolishing has"

      "SummaryText": "in place. The alternate release scenario at Able Electropolishing has been based on a release scenario from piping/manifold failure at a valve, joint, or seal. Using USE Pa's Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants using SO2, this type of release produces a scenario within a 1060 ft. distance to the toxic endpoint.\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThere are two (2) cylinders on-line for our wastewater treatment system. These cylinders are isolated from each other by check valves and stainless steel ball valves. The system is designed to operate with one cylinder discharging and the other cylinder in reserve. There is a solenoid valve downstream from the cylinder(s) that is connected to a number of emergency shut-off switches located throughout the facility. In the event of a failure of the SO2 delivery system, these switches will cause the solenoid valves to automatically close and stop the flow of gas from the cylinder. In addition, there is a check valve downstream of the solenoid valve that will prevent the flow of SO2 in the line from reversing. These are just a few of the number of emergency shut-off procedures we have for the safe use of SO2 at Able Electropolishing. These practices are very important to our prevention program. Additionally, we comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management Rule, which means that safe handling and usage procedures of the SO2 are regularly reviewed and updated.\n\n6/15/99\n\nPage 1\n\n Risk Management Plan, Executive Summary (cont.) Able Electropolishing Co., Inc.\n\n5. Five-Year Accident History\n\nAble Electropolishing has been at this location for three (3) years. In that time, there have been no accidental releases of sulfur dioxide.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nAble Electropolishing has an Emergency Response Plan and Chemical Safety Contingency Plan in place that has been submitted to the Cook County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) since the facility opened. Annually, a li"

In addition, all employees are trained regularly on emergency actions such as spill control & countermeasure, and evacuations. Able Electropolishing Emergency Action Team is re-trained at least annually on detection and response to sulfur dioxide leaks and leak (kit) repair.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAble Electropolishing plans on conducting its next employee training session in August 1999. This training for employees is conducted in both English and Spanish.\n\n\n6/15/99\n\nPage 2"
