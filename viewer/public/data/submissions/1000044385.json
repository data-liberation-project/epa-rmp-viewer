All applicable procedures of 40 CFR 68.170 are addressed in the plan, which seeks to provide for employee safety, public health and response agency interaction.\n\n\n\nThe City of Dublin's Water Pollution Control Plant uses chlorine to disinfect the effluent wastewater before it is discharged into the Oconee River  and the effluent reuse to SPNewsPrint.  \n\n\n\nThe City of Dublin's Utilities Management Program includes the following key elements to mitigate the effects of potential chlorine release hazards.\n\n*   Operator Training\n\n*   Prevention Maintenance Program \n\n*   Process Specific Safety Equipment\n\n*   Safe and effective standard operating procedures, written with operator \n\nparticipation\n\n*   Hazard review of equipment and procedures \n\n*    Auditing and inspection programs.\n\n*   Comprehensive Management Program\n\n\n\nFurthermore, the Surface Water Plant and the Water Pollution Control Plant have an active environmental, health and safety program with the following elements specifically supporting the safe handling of chlorine and the chlorination process.\n\n*   Chlorine detectors\n\n*   Chemical Right to Know Program\n\n*   Personal Protective Equipment\n\n\n\nIn case of accidental release, the Laurens Emergency Planning Agency has an emergency response plan for the Water Pollution Control Plant.\n\n\n\nThe City of Dublin Utilities Department takes a proactive approach to risk management and emergency response.  Preventative measures will provide for the continuous improvement of communications and will maintain effective procedures for the safe handling of and timely emergency response to potential chlorine hazards."
