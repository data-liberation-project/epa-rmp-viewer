      "SummaryText": "Both the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Standard require all facilities with a threshold amount of 10,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia to comply with all applicable regulations under the 40 CFR Part 68 and 29 CFR 1919.119.  The Oklahoma City 59th Street Facility (Hattie Street) of Associated Wholesale Grocers, Inc. has a capability of holding 14,400 pounds in a single refrigeration system, which is above the 10,000 pound threshold specified by OSHA and EPA.  Therefore, the Oklahoma City 59th Street Facility (Hattie Street) is required to comply with OSHA and EPA requirements.\n\nAssociated Wholesale Grocers, Inc. has conducted a dispersion analysis of a potential incident involving a release of anhydrous ammonia, which is used as a refrigerant at the Oklahoma City 59th Street Facility (Hattie Street) location.  The primary activities at the facility are receiving and distributing grocery related products, which necessitates the need for keeping perishable items cool or at freezing temperatures or below.  The results of this analysis are to be used by the Oklahoma City 59th Street Facility in their emergency planning, response, and training activities.  An Anhydrous Ammonia Dispersion Analysis was performed to evaluate the potential impact of a release of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nTwo scenarios were developed for this analysis.  One scenario, considered the \u00bfworst case\u00bf event, is the loss of the total charge of anhydrous ammonia (12,000 pounds) in the refrigeration system during normal operations.  The ammonia is postulated to be released through a failed line located at grade level with no mitigation factors considered.  For the \u00bfworst case\u00bf event, the total charge of ammonia is to be released over a period of ten minutes.\n\nThe other scenario, which is considered to be the \u00bfalternative\u00bf event, is the release of ammonia from a broken line inside the building"

In this event, a release of 2,000 pounds of ammonia is postulated to occur through a two inch line, 100 feet long, over a ten minute period of time at ground level with no mitigation factors considered.\n\nFor the worst case scenario, it was determined that a release could travel approximately 3.344 yards (10,032 feet).  There are public receptors (residences, schools, recreational areas, and industrial/commercial buildings) in the potentially affected area.  There are approximately 13,147 residents within the potentially affected area.  There are no environmental receptors in the potentially affected area.\n\nFor the alternative scenario, it was determined that a release could travel approximately 369 yards (1,107 feet).  There are public receptors (industrial/commercial buildings) in the potentially affected area."
