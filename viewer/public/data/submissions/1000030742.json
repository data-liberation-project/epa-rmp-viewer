If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Milaca Fire Department, or other authorities, to minimize the impact of the release to people and the enviroment.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous amnonia and loading nurse tanks for delivery to the farm for application.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop nutrients.\n\nThe maximum quantity stored would be 230,188lbs. in one 30,000, 19, 1000 gallon nurse tanks. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a transport truck vessel containing 53,000 pounds.\n\nThe worst case scenario would be the release over ten minutes. The maximum quanity would be 118,000 pounds representing 85 percent of the largest tank capacity, as limited by design standards.\n\nThe alternate release scenario based on a two minute release is a release from a break in a three inch transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint in this case would be 1.5 miles.\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute , Inc and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Adminstration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of Anyhdrous Ammonia in past five years at this site.\n\nMille Lacs Soil Service has written action plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38; provided state and local authorities with emergency planning and community right-to-know information as rquired under SARA Title III (EPRCA).\n\nMille Lacs Soil Service Association will coordinate this plan with the emergency responders.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facilit"
