Chlorine is used  in  the  potable\nwater treatment process for disinfection.\n\nThe existing chlorination system utilizes gaseous chlorine and is\ncomprised  of  equipment in two main locations, the  Pretreatment\nChemical  Building  and  the Filter  Building  Head  House.   The\nprimary  chlorine supply for each location is a  single,  55  ton\nrailroad  tank car located near the Filter Building  Head  House.\nLiquefied  chlorine  is  supplied  from  the  rail  car  to  each\nequipment location.  At each location there are two to three, one\nton  containers  of  chlorine which are used as  back-up  to  the\nrailroad tank supply.\n\nChlorination   equipment  at  each  location  includes   chlorine\ncontainer  scales, an evaporator and chlorinators.   The  average\ndaily chlorine usage at the Akron WSP is approximately 2,000 lbs.\nper day.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe City of Akron Water Supply Plant's (WSP) approach to chemical\nsafety focuses on training and safety awareness.  Plant operators\nare   annually  trained  on  operational  and  safety   practices\nassociated  with  chlorine  and  chlorine  feed  equipment.   The\ntraining  program  currently utilizes videotape presentations  in\naddition  to presentations by local chlorine supply professionals\nto  routinely refresh operators' understanding and knowledge base\non   the   safe  handling  procedures  and  accident   prevention\nprocedures for chlorine.  The Akron WSP is a secure facility  and\nonly  authorized plant personnel maintain and handle the chlorine\ncontainers and feed equipment.\n\nBecause of the City's commitment to safety and implementation  of\nsafe  procedures  for  the  chlorine  facilities,  new  policies,\nprocedures  and  instructional programs have  been  develope"

      "SummaryText": "d  in\nconjunction with completion of this Risk Management Plan.  A new,\nupdated Emergency Response Plan has been prepared.  The City will\ncontinue  to coordinate with the City of Kent Fire Department  in\nthis   regard   and  will  have  better  defined  procedures   in\nconjunction  with  its participation.  A new management  program,\ntraining program and Operations and Maintenance Manual have  also\nbeen  developed and will be utilized by the WSP staff  to  safely\nmanage and operate the chlorine facilities in the near future.\n\nThe  City  is currently planning to eliminate the use of chlorine\nwithin  two  years.  Disinfection of the finished water  will  be\naccomplished  by  application of liquid sodium hypochlorite  upon\ncompletion of construction of a new Chemical Building.\n\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe  Akron  WSP  uses one 55-ton rail car along  with  a  back-up\nsystem utilizing one ton containers.  The one ton containers  are\nused only when switching the rail cars.  The chlorine piping from\nall  sources of chlorine are interconnected, thus making  it  one\nsource.  The piping conveys liquid chlorine to evaporators which,\nin turn, feed gas to the chlorine ejectors.\n\nThe  worst case scenario assumes the complete release of  the  55\nton  rail car within the prescribed 10 minute period.  The  model\nused   for  this  scenario  is  USEPA's  RMP  Comp.   No  passive\nmitigation  factors were used in the RMP Comp model as  the  rail\ncar  is  outside  when in use.  The outcome  of  the  worst  case\nscenario suggests that an area greater than 20 miles from the WSP\nmay be affected by the complete, instantaneous release of 55 tons\nof chlorine.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nBecause  the  Akron WSP uses the 55 ton rail car as  its  primary\nchlorine  source, the alternate case scenario assumes a  one-inch\npipe  failure  at  the  connection with the  railroad  car.   The\nscenario  assumes the entire 55 ton rail car is  released.   This\nevent  would  last  approximately 40 mi"

The  modeling  was\ncompleted  using  RMP Comp and no mitigation factors  were  used.\nThe outcome of this alternate case scenario suggests that an area\nup to 0.8 miles from the WSP may be affected.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL  RELEASE  PREVENTION  PROGRAM  AND  CHEMICAL  SPECIFIC\nPREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe  Akron WSP complies with the OSHA Rules and Regulations  with\nrespect  to the Accidental Release Prevention Program.   Chemical\nspecific  prevention steps include compliance with all  Ohio  EPA\nrequirements , Recommended Standards for Water Works,  1997  (Ten\nState Standards) and Chlorine Institute Standards and Regulations\nConcerning Chlorination Equipment and Facilities for Public Water\nSupplies.\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe  City  of  Akron  Water Supply Plant has  had  no  accidental\nreleases of chlorine in the past five years.  There have been  no\naccidental  chlorine releases in the known history of  the  plant\nwhich resulted in injury to off-site personnel or evacuations.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe  key element of the Emergency Response Program is the written\nEmergency Response Plan on file at the Water Supply Plant and  at\noffices of the City in downtown Akron.  The written Plan includes\na  Quick  Reference Guide which allows an operator to immediately\nand  positively  act in case of an observed or detected  chlorine\nleak.   The Portage County Local Emergency Planning Committee  is\nthe overall coordinator of emergency response services.  The City\nwill  maintain its current approach to first contact the City  of\nKent  Fire  Department in case of an emergency  as  part  of  the\nCounty's current program.  Additional notification procedures are\nalso defined.\n\nThe  Emergency  Response  Plan  includes  first  aid  procedures,\nmedical  management  of chlorine exposure information,  emergency\nresponse  training and pre-emergency coordination guidelines.   A\nsummary  of emergency chlorine leak response procedures  is  also\nincluded.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFE"

The City  plans  to  complete\nconstruction  of  a  new Chemical Building to  support  a  sodium\nhypochlorite  feed  facility.  Within the  next  two  years,  the\nchlorination  systems will be abandoned in favor of  disinfection\nby  sodium  hypochlorite.   The management  and  safety  concerns\nassociated with gaseous chlorine will thereby be eliminated.\n\n\n"
