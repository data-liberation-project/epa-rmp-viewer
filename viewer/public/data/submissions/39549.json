Description of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nVitafoam Incorporated is a flexible polyurethane foam manufacturing facility located in Greensboro, North Carolina.  As a result of the manufacturing process, the following regulated chemicals are present at the facility in quantities that exceed the threshold quantities specified by EPA regulations: toluene diisocyanate (TDI) (10,000 pounds).  The facility has one covered process that requires the facility meet Program 2 requirements of the Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations.  \n\nTDI is delivered to the facility via railcars and tank truck and offloaded into storage tanks.  In the process, TDI is used in the production of polyurethane foam. The facility manufactures polyurethane foam by the vigorous mechanical mixing of polyols with TDI along with water, catalyst and surfactants.  The resultant polymeric network is expanded with carbon dioxide which is formed in the reaction between the water and TDI.\n \nB. Accidental Release Prevention & Emergency Response Policies of Vitafoam\n\nVitafoam is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards.  Appropriate responses to releases of TDI are documented in the Section 7 of the Risk Management Program document.  Safety, environmental protection and risk management programs are fully implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response efforts.\n\nC. Release Scenario Discussion\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of the RMP regulations each owner or operator of a stationary source is required to perform the following offsite consequence analyses.\n? One worst-case release scenario to represent all regulated toxic substances held in excess of the threshold quantity.  A worst-case scenario was conducted TDI.\n? One alternative release scenario for each regulated toxic substance held in excess of the threshold quantity.  An alternative"

Five-year Accident History\n\nUnder the EPA RMP regulations, an accidental release is defined as a release of a regulated substance that \"resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\"  Within the past five years, Vitafoam has had no accidents that meet these requirements.\n\nE.  Management System\n\nVitafoam has a management program in place that assigns overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the Risk Management Program (RMProgram) to a qualified individual or position of responsibility.  It clearly delineates accountability and responsibilities for any elements where responsibilities are delegated.\n\nF. Prevention Program Elements\n\nSafety Information - Up-to-date process safety information is maintained for use by employees operating the covered process in accordance with 40 CFR 68.48, including the following:\n? The MSDS for TDI that contains toxicity information, permissible exposure limits, physical data, reactivity data, thermal and chemical stability data and synergistic effects from mixing process flows.\n? Maximum intened inventory of equipment used to store TDI.\n? Safe upper and lower temperatures, pressures, flows and composition.                                                                                  ?

The hazard review was performed using What-If/ Checklists.  The hazard review identified the hazards associated with the regulated TDI process; causes of potential accidental release scenarios; safeguards used to prevent accidental releases; and methods used to detect, monitor or control accidental releases.  Any issues identified during the PHA were documented and will be resolved in a timely manner.  The hazard review will be revalidated and updated once every five years following completion of the initial hazard review.\n\nOperating Procedures - Detailed process operating procedures have been developed and are maintained for each covered process in accordance with 40 CFR 68.52.  Operating procedures provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involving a covered process in a manner consistent with process safety information and are readily accessible to employees involved in a covered process.  Operating procedures are updated as needed whenever a major change occurs.                                                                                                                                                                                 \nOperating procedures cover each operating phase of the covered process including:\n? initial system startup, \n? normal operation, \n? temporary operations, \n? emergency shutdown and operations, \n? normal shutdown,\n? startup following a turnaround or emergency shutdown or major change that requires hazard review.  \n? consequences of deviations and steps required to correct or avoid deviations.\n? equipment inspections\n\nTraining - New employees working with a covered process receive initial training in accordance with 40 CFR 68.54.
