      "SummaryText": "PROCESS SUMMARY\nThe Reddy Ice-Landover plant #427, located at 7100B Old Landover Road in Landover, Maryland, is a manufacturer of ice for wholesale and retail distribution. The facility has a production capacity of approximately 240 tons of ice per day and utilizes approximately 14,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia (NH3) as a refrigerant for ice manufacturing and storage.\n\nThe refrigeration operation makes use of a standard design ammonia system. The system has numerous protective controls including: motor overload, high discharge temperature, high discharge pressure, low suction pressure, and low oil differential on all compressors; high level float switches on all accumulators: and approved safety relief valves on all applicable equipment, which discharge through common headers to a deluge tank.\n\nThe facility has two closed-loop refrigeration systems; the high-stage/ icemaker system and low-stage/ evaporator system. The two systems share a common discharge header, relief valve header, glycol supply and return lines, air purger, evaporative condensers, and high-pressure receiver vessel. Liquid ammonia is provided to the equipment directly from the receiver. In addition, the high side operates six 50-ton tube icemakers powered by three 200 horsepower single-stage reciprocating compressor packages. The low side equipment consists of seven air-cooling evaporators to provide refrigeration to the blast freezer, rake room, and ice storage vault, and two 100 horsepower single-stage reciprocating compressor packages. Each system utilizes an accumulator vessel to separate liquid ammonia from ammonia gas to be drawn back to the compressors.\n\nAn outside supplier delivers anhydrous ammonia to the facility to replenish the ammonia in the system, as required.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia, when properly used, has proven to be a safe and reliable refrigerant. The sharp odor of ammonia provides its own warning agent. Practically all accidents involving anhydrous ammonia can be avoided through "

The facility has multiple safeguards pertinent to the anhydrous ammonia process. These include exhaust purge fans, controls that shut down the compressors if operating limits are exceeded, and the capability of shutting down the entire system if required. Administrative controls are in place, which limit the storage vessels to less than their maximum intended capacities and operating levels.\n\nThe company has developed an emergency action plan that includes notification of emergency authorities/agencies and the public, evacuation of personnel, and first responder duties by trained facility refrigeration personnel.\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PREVENTION PROGRAM 3\nBased on the Reddy Ice-Landover facility?s ammonia inventory, location, and requirement to meet OSHA PSM standards, it has been determined the facility is subject to the Prevention Program 3 requirements. This accident prevention program is a way to make safe operations and accident prevention systematic throughout the facility. Reddy Ice Group corporate management and Reddy Ice-Landover management are committed to operating a safe and compliant facility for the protection of its employees, the public, and the environment. A Combined Process Safety Management/Risk Management (PSM/RM) Program has been developed to meet the accidental release prevention requirements of both EPA?s Risk Management Program (40 CFR Part 68) and OSHA?s Process Safety Management Standard (29 CFR 1910.119) under the Clean Air Act. The Combined PSM/RM Program contains thirteen elements, establishing requirements for employee participation, safety information, hazard analysis, pre-startup safety revi"

These elements are tied together by a management system to ensure plant-wide development, implementation and integration of all the Program requirements.\n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM\nA management system has been developed to oversee the implementation of the PSM/RM Program elements. The plant manager has been identified as PSM/RM Program Coordinator, with overall responsibility for developing, implementing and integrating the Program requirements. Under the PSM/RM Program, various responsibilities have been assigned to other individuals. The plant engineer is responsible for portions of the program closely tied to the refrigeration equipment and operation. Monthly safety meetings are conducted to present various safety topics and discussions and to address any safety issues brought up by employees during the month. \n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\nAs required by the Risk Management Program regulations, the Reddy Ice-Landover facility has conducted a hazard assessment including offsite consequence analyses (OCAs) for potential accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. The OCAs describe the potential offsite exposure to surrounding areas from an accidental release. A worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenarios were developed and calculated using the EPA RMP*Comp modeling program, and the potentially affected offsite population and facilities were identified.  \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe Reddy Ice-Landover facility has not had any releases that would require reporting as part of a five-year accident history.\n\nEMERGENCY PLANNING AND RESPONSE\nThe Reddy Ice-Landover facility operates under an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that includes procedures for: notifying plant personnel, the public, and local emergency responders; emergency evacuation/"

The plan is reviewed regularly for verification of data, and revised and updated as necessary to reflect changes in facility operations and personnel.\n\nAs required, the facility has coordinated emergency response activities with the Prince George?s County LEPC and Landover Fire Department, and has appropriate mechanisms in place to notify emergency responders if needed. The ammonia inventory is verified and reported annually to the state and local authorities, and the plant is incorporated into the community emergency response plan developed under 42 USC.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES\nThe Reddy Ice-Landover facility operates an ongoing program of facility preventive and predictive maintenance to identify and implement changes that may result in improved safety and operations. On a corporate level, Reddy Ice is continuing to implement ammonia diffusion/neutralization system installation at all plants and supporting the installation of additional ammonia detection, alarm, ventilation, and safety systems at its larger facilities."
