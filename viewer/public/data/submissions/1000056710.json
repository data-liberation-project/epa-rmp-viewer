This food processing facility has a formal worker safety program.  All employees are informed of hazards in the workplace.  Employees who work with potentially hazardous substances receive proper training in the handling of those substances.  This facility has procedures in place to safely remove employees from areas in the unlikely event that a hazardous substance release were to occur, and to put in place emergency notification and response procedures.\r\n\r\n2.   STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\n\r\nThis Daisy Brand facility is located at 3600 Geyers Chapel Road in Wooster Ohio.  Food ingredients are received, blended, pasteurized, and packaged.  Finished products are then chilled or frozen prior to distribution.  The regulated substance at this facility, anhydrous ammonia, is used in a closed-loop refrigeration system for product cooling and freezing. Ammonia is the most effective, energy efficient and environmentally safe chemical for keeping food at its proper temperature.\r\n\r\n3.   GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \r\nAND AMMONIA SPECIFIC PREVENTION\r\n\r\nAll Daisy Brand manufacturing locations comply with the OSHA Process Safety Management for Highly Hazardous Chemicals (PSM) standard relative to anhydrous ammonia. Therefore, this facility has programs to ensure proper operation and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system.  Further, refrigeration system operators have been trained and are knowledgeable in the safe operation of the refrigeration system.\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at this facility has been designed and constructed using good engineering practices and to conform to industry standards.  The system includes ammonia detection devices, an emergency shutdown switch located outside the main mechanical room, high- and low-level switches in pressure vessels, and"
