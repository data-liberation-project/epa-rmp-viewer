ACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION & EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:  We at Ulrich Chemical, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety and protection.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance and employee training associated with the processes at this facility.  It is our goal and objective to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If an accidental release were to occur, Ulrich has coordinated emergency response activities with the Vanderburgh County Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Evansville Fire Department which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of a release.\n\n2.  THE STATIONARY SOURCE & THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:  Ulrich\u00bfs primary activities encompass chemical repackaging, warehousing and distribution.  Currently, there are two regulated substances present at this facility that exceed the Threshold Quantity (TQ) as defined within 40 CFR 68.130 and two predictive filing regulated substances. \n\n3.  THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:  Our facility has taken necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements as set forth under 40 CFR Part 68.  In addition, four regulated substances are also subject to OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management regulation as set forth under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of our release prevention program that are currently in place at this facility.\n\na).  Process Safety Information:  Ulrich Chemical, Inc. maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all regulated processes.\n\nb).
