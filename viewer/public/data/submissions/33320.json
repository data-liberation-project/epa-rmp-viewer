The Village of Tequesta's proactive approach to implementing new policies for emergency management and accidental release prevention has been a keystone to their success over the years.  The gaseous chlorine system (Process) at the Village of Tequesta WTP has not had an accidental release since it went into service in 1973.  The current prevention and emergency response policies adhere to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Prevention Program and Emergency Response requirements as set forth under the 40 CFR 68 regulations.\n\n\n\nThe Village of Tequesta WTP is located in Tequesta, FL and utilizes a chlorine gas process via vacuum injection for the disinfection of water.  The Process is maintained in an enclosed structure.  The equipment in the Process is maintained per the maintenance procedures.  The gaseous chlorine is stored at the Process area in one-ton cylinders (2,000 pounds per cylinder).  The gaseous chlorine is liquefied under pressure when full.  The Process can have a maximum of 5 full cylinders on-site at one time.\n\n\n\nThe Village of Tequesta and its employees have an impeccable performance history regarding the handling, storing, maintenance and operation of gaseous chlorine.  The Village of Tequesta WTP is staffed by 6 full time employees.  The operational staff is state certified and is trained to safely handle, maintain, and operate the Process so that they comply with EPA 40 CFR 68 regulations.  The Process is designed by making use of the most recent technologies and Process specific design codes and standards.  The emergency response plans are documented and coordinated with the community emergency response officials through the Local Emergency Pl"

      "SummaryText": "anning Committee (LEPC).  The operational staff has been trained to react to a release according to these response plans.\n\n\n\nA gaseous chlorination system used within the Village of Tequesta WTP has yielded many benefits, including the prevention of water borne diseases.  While the treatment process has many risks associated with its use, the Village of Tequesta has an exceptional record regarding its history of accidents, yet remains observant regarding the attention to safety of the Process.  The Village of Tequesta has support this regulatory effort to inform the public in the general vicinity of the Village of Tequesta WTP of the risks associated with accidental gaseous chlorine releases since its inception.  The Village of Tequesta realizes that the Process potentially can become public health and environmental risk if an accidental release were to occur.  In recent months the Village of Tequesta has commissioned a study to review the possibility of converting the gaseous chlorine system to a sodium hypochlorite system.  The liquid chlorination system will eliminate the risk of a gaseous release and contamination to the public and environment due to the fact that the chlorine is in liquid form and not in gaseous form.\n\n\n\nIf you have any questions regarding the information presented in this summary, please contact the offices of the Village of Tequesta at 250 Tequesta Drive, Tequesta, Florida 33469, (561) 575-6200\n\n\n\n"
