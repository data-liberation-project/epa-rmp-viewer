Red Star underlines its commitment to the environment, focusing on the limitation of nuisance and the prevention of ecological risks.  This policy had made it possible to acquire a level of expertise recognized internationally.  It has guided research and targeted investments, reinforcing its will to improve the quality of life for everyone: employees, clients, consumers, and areas around its production sites.\n\n\n\nFACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES: The Red Star Yeast facility in Cedar Rapids, Iowa manufactures yeast for sale to the baking and brewing industries and retail consumers.  Anhydrous ammonia is used in the refrigeration process at the plant.  The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system has a total charge of 14,000 pounds of ammonia.  In addition, aqueous ammonia is used as a nutrient for the yeast manufacture.  Up to approximately 450,000 pounds of 30% aqueous ammonia can be stored onsite.  An anhydrous ammonia to aqueous ammonia conversion system has also been installed.  This process is supplied by an onsite 18,000 gallon anhydrous ammonia storage tank (approximately 100,000 pounds of ammonia).\n\n\n\nCHEMICAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM: The facility's overall approach and commitment to chemical safety is demonstrated by 1) the existing management, training, operating procedures and maintenance systems in place at the facility, and 2) the hazard assessment, prevention program and emergency response provisions implemented specifically for the ammonia refrigeration system, aqueous ammonia storage, and the anhydrous ammonia to aqueous ammonia conversion system as part of the RMP requirements.  The facility has implemented Program 3 Prevention Programs for the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration process and the anhydrous-ammonia-to-aqueous-ammonia conversion system and a Program 2 Prevention Program for aqueous "

      "SummaryText": "ammonia storage.  The prevention program provisions are specifically intended to minimize the probability and/or consequences of any accidental releases from these processes.  The facility prevention programs are ongoing systems based on periodic training, process hazard review, incident investigations, audits, procedure revisions, and RMP revisions and updates as required to reflect facility changes and RMP requirements.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:  The facility, in the past five years, has had one incident resulting in minor injuries to employees related to a release of aqueous ammonia. The incident was the result of a leak at a valve.  There have been no incidents in the past 5 years that resulted in deaths or significant property damage onsite. Additionaly, there have been no deaths, injuries, or significant property damage offsite.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM: An emergency action plan has been developed and implemented.  Staff at the facility are trained in First Aid, CPR, and fire extinguishers.  Red Star Yeast Co. employees will respond defensively and are not trained on the use of SCBA's.  The facility has coordinated its emergency response program with the City of Cedar Rapids Fire Department and a private spill response company to insure that any accidental release from the ammonia process will be appropriately addressed.\n\n\n\nCONTINUED SAFETY: The facility is committed to insuring its operations are safe and in accordance with all RMP requirements. The facility has an Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) manager responsible for RMP development, implementation and compliance.  This EHS manager insures that the appropriate changes occur as necessary to maintain/improve safety, conduct ongoing hazard reviews, training, audits, maintenance and that investigations will be conducted if required."
