The high speed vertical setting on the monorail mounted hoist should be disconnected, if possible.\r\nOutcome:  This recommendation was discussed with the monorail manufacture who states that there is no hazard, as the high speed setting factors in the chlorine component and therefore does not move at rate to cause a problem.  Further the disconnecting of this one component of the system was not recommended and would have voided any warranty on the monorail system. This issue is closed.\r\n\r\nThere is a potential of a caustic gas release in an unsafe manner from the exhaust stack. This is due to an inadequate rain cap.  The rain cap should be modified or replaced.\r\nOutcome: The rain cap has been reviewed by the Public Utilities Engineering Department, plant personnel, the equipment manufacturer and supplier. The existing original equipment is appropriate for this application. This issue is closed. \r\n\r\nThe current location of the header vacuum gauge and valves is a trip hazard. The header should be moved to a safer location to avoid potential falls, which could result in leakage at a valve.  \r\nOutcome:  Potential modifications are being reviewed.

This issue is closed.\r\n\r\nThere is a potential for a motorized switch over system to fail during transfer of chlorine containers in the scales. The motorized switch over system should be replaced with a pressure operated system switch over system or the system should be manually operated.\r\nOutcome:  In 2000, a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) was formulated to address this issue.  The SOP is now part of the updated Risk Management Plan.  This issue is closed.\r\n\r\nTo be completed by October 2000\r\nThe monorail system used to off-load chlorine containers requires that the containers eventually be rolled to their destination. The monorail system should be modified to allow off-loading of chlorine containers without rolling or implement a system that does not require rolling.\r\nOutcome: The vendor who now supplies chlorine utilizes a cherry-picker to off load the cylinders thus this issues does not come into play.  The vendor is Harcoss/Allied.  In the bid specifications, for future vendors a sentence has been inserted that states that the vendor must have bring the proper equipment onsite to avoid having to roll the containers to their location.

It is also the policy of the Collier County Water Department to work with surrounding community and local emergency response agencies, and promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork to provide an effective contingency plan in the event that a process incident occurs at the North County Regional Water Treatment Plant (NCRWTP).    The first responder to any incident at the NCRWTP is the Golden Gate Fire Department (GGFD).  The GGFD works in close relation with the NCRWTP being involved in annual reviews of the RMP documentation and frequent training sessions on site for the GGFD personnel.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\r\nThe primary activity at the NCRWTP is a municipal water treatment plant.  Chlorine is the only 40 CFR 68 regulated substance at plant.  Chlorine is used primarily as a disinfectant.  The maximum amount of chlorine on site at this facility is 24 tons.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\r\nCollier County is in compliance with 40 CFR 68. The County has conducted a comprehensive review of the chlorine system, as well as, administrative, technical, operating, and maintenance procedures.  In addition, all program elements have been reviewed by the County?s internal safety auditors (Risk Management Department) and found to be in compliance.\r\n\r\nThe County has both passive mitigation, an enclosed building and active mitigation, an emergency scrubber, to minimize the consequences of an accidental release.  The Risk Management Program addresses actions to minimize the lik"

The ERP for the NCRWTP specifically is attached to the RMP document as Attachment A to Chapter 9.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\r\nAs part of the Process Hazard Analysis that was conducted in 1999 a number of safety improvements were contemplated, the following provides a list of the items identified and steps taken to resolve each item:\r\n\r\nTo be completed by August 1999\r\nTo minimize the potential for product delivery trucks from damaging the buildings, equipment and roadway, improvements to the roadway must be made.  This work is current in progress.\r\nOutcome:  Bumpers were installed in December of 1999 and the loading area was widened in early 2000.  This issue is closed.\r\n\r\nChlorine containers must be rotated in the trunnions to properly align the valves prior to connection.  The wrench currently used is not adequate and procurement of this specialized wrench is recommended.\r\nOutcome:  Wrench was obtained in 1999 and one is kept on hand at all times. This issue is closed.\r\n\r\nThe wrenches used to connect/disconnect chlorine containers are the proper Chlorine Institute approved wrenches; however, they are old and worn.  Replacement wrenches should be purchased, and spare wrenches kept in stock.\r\nOutcome:  Wrenches were obtained in August of 1999 and spares are on the shelf as of this review.

The monorail should be lubricated with material that is compatible with chlorine use. \r\nOutcome:  The Water Department has a semi-annual maintenance contract with an outside vendor that requires this to be completed.  A report is provided to the Department and kept on file documenting that it has been completed. This issue is closed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo be completed by October 1999\r\nThere is a potential danger that the door to the building could shut while off-loading chlorine containers.  This could lead to dropping the container, causing possible injury to the employee, or otherwise compromising the integrity of the container. A door security system should be installed.\r\nOutcome: The door security should be installed and the potential for the door to close has been eliminated.  The work was completed in 2005. This issue is closed.\r\n\r\nTo be completed by November 1999\r\nThe existing vacuum regulators are old and require constant maintenance.  It is recommended that the regulators at this facility be replaced by November 1999 or earlier.\r\nOutcome:  The recommended work was completed in 1999 and as noted above a semi-annual contract is in place to ensure proper inspection and maintenance of the equipment is an ongoing effort. This issue is closed.\r\n\r\nA preventative maintenance and replacement plan should be developed and implemented for the vacuum regulators.
