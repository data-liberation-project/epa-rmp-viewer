              "Description": "\n\nTRANSFLO maintains a comprehensive Process Safety Management (PSM) program in compliance with 29 CFR 1910.119 for terminals handling LPG products.  The PSM program covers all 14 elements of the OSHA PSM regulations.  Program documentation is maintained on the TRANSFLO central electronic system and is accessible to terminal managers and operators. \n\n\n\nAll LPG transfer operations use the same transfer equipment, procedures with common products to transfer LPG products from rail tank cars to highway cargo tanks using portable transfer equipment.  A master process hazard analysis was conducted 10/22/14 by a qualified team of professionals meeting the requirements of the regulation.  This PHA used a Failure Mode Effect Analysis (FMEA) method.  Full documentation is maintained by TRANSFLO.  A site specific PHA using a Checklist method will be conducted to identify and address terminal specific hazards. \n\n\n\nMaximum product inventory is the contents of a single rail tank car.  Tank cars are not interconnected during this process and remain individual containers while on the terminal.  There is no process chemistry involved with this process.  The LPG products are not mixed or reacted in any way during handling.  \n\n\n\nA formal Pre-Start-up Safety Review (PSSR) will be held 9/5-6/18 with terminal management and operators to conduct hazard communication training, unit inspection and maintenance training and Work Instruction (operating procedures) training for the process.  The terminal Emergency Action Plan will be updated to reflect the hazards of these products.\n\n\n\nThis terminal is subject to current TRANSFLO policy and procedures including Employee Participation Plan, Management of Change procedures, Terminal Work Permit System (including hot work) procedure, accident reporting and investigation procedure as well as current TRANSFLO Operating Standards.\n\n\n\nTRANSFLO conducts internal compliance audits of all PSM/RMP terminals in a 3-year basis. This terminal will be scheduled for such an audit by 9/5/21.\n\n\n\nRefer to the PSM/RMP documentation available at the terminal and on the TRANSFLO Gateway for copies of these procedures and standards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

(TTSI) has prepared this Risk Management Plan (RMP) for operations involving Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) at their Philadelphia, PA facility.  The TTSI terminal provides transloading services of bulk products between rail and truck transportation modes.  The Philadelphia PA TRANSFLO terminal has been in operation since 19882.  The terminal is located at 3600 South Moore Street, Philadelphia, PA 19145.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\n\n\nTRANSFLO is committed to protecting the health and safety of its employees, contract operators, the surrounding community and the environment; therefore it is TRANSFLO policy to maintain compliance with 40 CFR 68.\n\n\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nTRANSFLO will handle liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) products at this terminal, transloading product between railroad tank cars and highway cargo trailers in quantities in excess of 8,000 gallons per cargo trailer which will exceed the 10,000 pound threshold quantity listed in 40 CFR 68, Appendix A.\n\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\n\n\nAs required by 40 CFR 68 Subpart B, TRANSFLO has evaluated a worst-case release scenario for LPG products using the parameters specified by the EPA.  TRANSFLO's worst-case release scenario is the rupture of a single railroad tank car with subsequent product release over a 10-minute period.  In developing the release parameters of the worst-case scenario, TRANSFLO has not considered any passive mitigation measures.  Using the EPA's RMP*Comp software program, it was determined that the distance to the toxic endpoint in this scenario has the potential to result in a release with offsite consequences.  The worst-case release scenario was developed following EPA regulations and is considered to h"

      "SummaryText": "ave an extremely low probability of occurrence.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\n\n\nTRANSFLO also evaluated several other release scenarios considered to have a higher level probability of occurrence (although a very low probability) based upon a review of over 10 years of incident data from chemical transloading operations.  This 10 year period included the safe handling of over 500,000 rail to truck chemical transloads.  After a careful review of both the worst-case and alternative release scenarios, TRANSFLO has decided to include one alternative release scenario into the RMP document.  \n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario identified by TRANSFLO is the failure of a product transfer hose.  In developing the parameters of Alternative Release Scenario 1, TRANSFLO considered the average response time of terminal personnel to control the release and safely shut the transfer unit down.   Using the EPA RMP*Comp software program and EPA's RMP offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance Document, the distance to the flammable endpoint in the alternative release scenario has the potential to result in minor site consequences at a distance much less than the worst-case scenario and would largely be limited to terminal property itself.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nTo prevent and mitigate accidental releases of LPG products, TRANSFLO has implemented several precautionary measures:\n\n\n\n?    TRANSFLO has developed standard operating procedures (SOP'S) for the Transloading of LPG products from railcar to highway cargo tank for use by trained and qualified personnel.\n\n?    TRANSFLO encourages contract operator employees to voice concerns, offer suggestions and contribute to procedures, policies and processes involving this product.  Employees are expected to follow established procedures until employee driven process changes are implemented, training conducted and communicated to all affected persons.\n\n?
