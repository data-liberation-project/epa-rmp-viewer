      "SummaryText": "CVC Specialty Chemicals (CVC) purchased the Maple Shade, New Jersey facility in June 1995 and began operations in June 1996.  CVC manufactures specialty epoxy monomers and resins based on epichlorohydrin chemistry.\n\n\n\nEpichlorohydrin is the only listed RMP and TCPA substance that is handled by CVC above the threshold quantity.  Epichlorohydrin is the basic building block used in epoxy manufacturing and provides the basis for the facility risk management and accident prevention programs.  Epichlorohydrin is handled at the facility in bulk in quantities that do not exceed 325,360 pounds.  Epichlorohydrin is stored in tote bins, one 15,000-gallon tank for fresh epichlorohydrin, three 2,000-gallon tanks for recycled epichlorohydrin, and two 1,500-gallon tanks for recovered epichlorohydrin.  Process equipment includes one 1,200-gallon reactor, one 2,000-gallon reactor, two 4,100-gallon reactors, and one 3,000-gallon holding tank.\n\n\n\nThe epoxy resins and monomers (modifiers) produced by CVC are used primarily in the specialty coatings industry.  Applications include civil engineering coatings such as floor coatings, tank and secondary containment linings, and structural steel primers.  Other common uses include adhesives, and specialty automotive and aviation coatings and composites.\n\n\n\nThe CVC facility is designed and operated to minimize the potential for safety and environmental impacts to employees and the surrounding community.  CVC has demonstrated a commitment to safety and environmental compliance by involving employees and third-party engineering firms in the principals of process safety management.  In 2017, CVC partnered with Delaware Technical Community College (DTCC) to provide 16 hours of process safety training for every operator in the plant.\n\n\n\nIn the past 5 years, CVC has had two serious incidents in the covered process area, as described below.\n\n\n\nOn May 10, 2016, an explosion occurred when trace amounts of xylene were being removed from the product dur"

This incident is not included in the TCPA/RMP 5-year accident history because the concentration of epichlorohydrin was less than 1%.  The explosion was caused by the presence of hydrogen peroxide in the process and the formation of an unstable organic peroxide.  Hydrogen peroxide has been removed from the facility as a corrective action to prevent recurrence.\n\n\n\nOn January 7, 2017, a batch of epoxy resin started foaming before the batch was complete and filled the vent system with foam.  Approximately 200 gallons of batch material with a nominal composition of 50% epichlorohydrin entered the vent system.  The foam eventually reached the scrubber and overflowed into secondary containment.  There were no serious injuries and no offsite impacts.  One of the factors that contributed to the formation of foam was high nitrogen flow going to the reactor.  The nitrogen flow control valve was replaced as a corrective action to prevent recurrence.\n\n\n\nThe CVC Maple Shade facility is operated as an RMP Program 3 facility.  Engineering and operational controls are described below.\n\n\n\nProcess safety information includes process flow diagrams, piping and instrument diagrams, electrical input/output diagrams, fire water system piping diagrams, equipment specifications, and chemical safety data sheets.\n\n\n\nThe most recent process hazard analysis (PHA) and layers of protection analysis (LOPA) was conducted in March 2017 using the hazard and operability study (HAZOP) methodology.  CVC hired an outside engineering firm to facilitate the PHA/LOPA.\n\n\n\nWritten standard operating procedures are updated on a regular basis and include procedures for startup, shutdown, normal operations, and emergencies.\n\n\n\nTraining is provided for new hires within the first 30 days of employment and refresher training is provided for "

Training topics include hazard communication, emergency response, safe work permits, personal protective equipment, respiratory protection, and use of portable fire extinguishers.\n\n\n\nMechanical integrity and preventive maintenance procedures are in place to assure the reliability of process equipment via testing and inspection, and a computerized work order system is utilized to keep records of equipment repairs.\n\n\n\nSafety and environmental incidents are documented and serious incidents are investigated to determine the root cause and identify corrective actions to prevent a recurrence.\n\n\n\nSafe work permits are utilized for hot work, energy isolation (lockout tagout), breaking lines, and confined space entry.\n\n\n\nContractors are pre-qualified, trained, and evaluated by CVC to ensure that they are qualified to work at the facility.  Contractors are required to follow CVC policies and procedures.\n\n\n\nManagement of change (MOC) includes a process change authorization checklist to assure that safety and environmental considerations are addressed.  Process change authorizations must be reviewed and approved by facility management.  Affected employees must be notified of process changes and trained if necessary.  Process safety information and standard operating procedures must also be updated as necessary.\n\n\n\nPre-startup safety reviews (PSSRs) are conducted prior to startup of new equipment or processes to assure that safety and environmental risks have been addressed.\n\n\n\nThe following projects are planned for improvement of the process safety management program at the facility.\n\n\n\nThe facility alarm system will be upgraded to enable the alarms to be seen and heard throughout the facility.
