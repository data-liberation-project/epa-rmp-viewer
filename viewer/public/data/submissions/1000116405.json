This facility is strictly a retail storage facility. \n1) The Facility Policy\nThe owners, management, and employees of K & B Ag Supply, LLC, are committed to the\nprevention of any accident releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Linn County Emergency Management Agency, the LEPC, the Fairfax Volunteer Fire Department, and other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n2) Facility Information\nThis facility was decommissioned in 2007 when all anhydrous ammonia storage tanks were removed from the facility. The current facility is a re-introduction of anhydrous ammonia bulk storage. The sole process occurring at this facility will be the storage & handling of anhydrous ammonia for retail sale to farmers as a crop nutrient.\n3) The Five-Year Accident History\nIn the last 5 years, there have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.\n4) The Emergency Action Plan\nThe facility has:\na) a written Emergency Action Plan, in accordance with the OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\nb) provided state and local authorities the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know\ninformation as required under SARA Title II (EPCRA);\nc) responses will be coordinated with Linn County Emergency Management / LEPC (PBX: 319-892- 6500) and the Fairfax Volunteer Fire Department (PBX: 911).\n5) Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nThe facility is newly constructed under current IDALS regulations & ANSI standards. Construction has also utilized best practices learned from the operation and management of three other anhydrous ammonia storage facilities owned by our sister companies. Safety will be an on-going process at this facility. Daily inspections and periodic eval"
