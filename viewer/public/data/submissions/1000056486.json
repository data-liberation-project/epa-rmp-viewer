Our goals are to have no accidents, no harm to people, and no damage to the environment. It is our commitment to provide a working environment that is safe by identifying hazards; designing and constructing our facilities according to recognized standards, procedures, and management systems; operating and maintaining facilities within the current design envelope; carefully selecting and training our workforce; managing changes to the organization, personnel, systems, procedures, and equipment; and maintaining emergency management plans to identify equipment, training, and personnel necessary to protect the workforce, public, and environment in the event of an incident.\r\n\r\nDescription of facility/Regulated substances handled\r\n\r\nThe INEOS O&P USA LLC - Chocolate Bayou Plant manufactures polypropylene plastic and olefins, including ethylene, propylene, and butadiene. Twenty-seven different flammable substances are held over the threshold quantity. All are hydrocarbons, ranging from hydrogen to pentane. These are present in the plant both in pure form and in mixtures. The site also has ammonia (conc. 20% or greater) that is considered a toxic substance. The ammonia inventory will be over the threshold quantity. \r\n\r\nThe Chocolate Bayou Plant operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. The facility has management representation 24 hours a day through the presence of a shift superintendent and several working team leaders. In section 1.8, we have listed J Burkhart as the emergency contact. Mr. Burkhart is one of four shift superintendents. The phone number for the emergency contact is the shift superintendent's office number.\r\n\r\nPrevention Program\r\n\r\nThe most effective part of preventing off-site impacts from hazardous chemicals is to reduce the amount of those chemicals stored"

This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \r\n\r\nThe PHA team's recommendations are forwarded to management for resolution. These recommendations are reviewed and all approved recommendations are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained. \r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Chocolate Bayou plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years as long as the process exists. The recommendations from these updates are also forwarded to management. Final resolution of the recommendations is tracked, documented, and retained.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe Chocolate Bayou plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures are developed/revised by experienced operators, supervisors and engineers as needed and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. The procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are revised as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process. \r\n\r\nAlso safe operating limits are maintained to provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower exceedences for specific process or equipment parameters.

Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, and (4) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Chocolate Bayou plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in chemical plant operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After the new operator demonstrates (i.e. through tests, skills demonstration, etc.) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every three years. All of this training is documented, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training. \r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe Chocolate Bayou plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contrac"

Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. Both hourly and management personnel participate as audit team members. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports along with the resolution of findings are retained.\r\n\r\nEmergency response\r\n\r\nOur facility has its own volunteer fire brigade to respond to emergencies. Personnel receive training in responding to industrial fires and other emergencies. The facility periodically conducts drills of our emergency response system. Emergency response is also coordinated with the LEPC.\r\n\r\nPlanned changes to improve safety\r\n\r\nImprovement in safety will continue to come from our hazard identification system: PHA, incident investigations, audits, employee input, and from lessons learned within INEOS and similar industries."

The plant has eliminated the use of some regulated toxic materials, including chlorine. \r\n\r\nThe facility is subject to the Program 3 prevention requirements of the EPA RMP rule, and to the OSHA PSM rule upon which those requirements were based. The facility reduces the possibility of a fire or explosion through several mechanisms. Process hazard analyses (PHAs) are done on a routine schedule for the process. Changes to the process undergo management of change (MOC) before implementation. The plant has an ongoing inspection program according to American Petroleum Institute (API) standards. Training programs and operating and maintenance procedures are also routinely reviewed. Operators are trained and certified initially and on a three-year interval. The facility has strict policies on controlling hazardous energy during maintenance activities. In the event of an upset, the facility has relief valves that discharge to a flare. For work that is performed by a contractor, procedures are in place to evaluate the contractor prior to work and to evaluate the contractor's performance on an on-going basis that satisfies the safety approval process. The plant reduces the possibility that a source of ignition might be present by maintaining hot work procedures and through proper classification of electrical equipment.\r\n\r\nFive-year accident history\r\n\r\nThe plant has had one accidental release as defined by the RMP regulation in the past 5 years. An accidental release of flammable materials mainly through the flares occurred on 09-18-15. The initiating event was a power loss to the facility due to a fault in the electricity grid; the equipment failure was external to the site.  The contributing factor was that power failure occurred at a time when alternate electric power line to the site was out of service for scheduled maintenance by power supplier.  The on-site impact was significant property damage due to the forced shutdown of"

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change. The system ensures that all documentation is updated and training completed prior to the commissioning of the change.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nThe Chocolate Bayou plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts, identify the root cause and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.

Our facility promotes employee participation through different established safety programs: VPP (Voluntary Protection Program), ESALT (Employee Safety Action and Leadership Team), PSC (Process Safety Committee), ERT (Emergency Response Team) amongst others.  Other examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team and incident investigation teams. Employees have access to all information created as part of the plant prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the prevention program are documented in the employee participation plan that addresses each prevention program element. In addition the plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and personal safety issues. These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety. The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management. \r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe Chocolate Bayou plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. The facility has documentation available showing the location of this information to help employees, contractors and visitors locate any necessary process safety information.\r\n\r\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs).

For process areas, the plant has documented safe-operating limits for specific process parameters (i.e. temperature, level, composition). The plant assures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (i.e., automated shutdown systems). In addition, information is available summarizing the consequences of deviation from these limits and the corrective actions to take. \r\n\r\nThe plant also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical ratings of equipment, piping and instrument drawings, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised. \r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\nThe Chocolate Bayou plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each part of the process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. \r\n\r\nThe Chocolate Bayou plant primarily uses the What If/Checklist analysis technique along with the Layer of Protection (LOPA) Analysis technique to perform these evaluations.

This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to work starting. In addition, the Chocolate Bayou plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations. \r\n\r\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\r\n\r\nThe Chocolate Bayou plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, equipment, procedures, and personnel are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented. In addition, PSSR's are completed prior to starting up a unit after it has been down for repairs, or a turnaround.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nThe Chocolate Bayou plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.
