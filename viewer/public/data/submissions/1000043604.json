Hisco has reviewed its obligations under EPA's Risk Management Program Rule (RMP Rule, Section 112r of the Clean Air Act).  In response to these requirements, Hisco notes that there are two obligations incumbent on the operations at its facility:\n\n\n\n1. ?112r(1) - Purpose and General Duty Clause - The essence of the general duty clause is that an owner/operator that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has a fundamental obligation to ensure a safe operation, and to have plans in place in the event of an accident to appropriately manage the situation.  Hisco takes this obligation very seriously, and intends to be not only a good neighbor but also a leader in community safety and emergency preparedness.\n\n\n\n2. Risk Management Plan - Hisco stores two materials e in excess of thresholds specified in ?112r. Even prior to the promulgation of the RMP Rule, Hisco management was very aware of the potential hazards posed by this storage, and  established programs to prevent any accidental releases and training for emergency response in the event of a release.  These programs are documented and described in this Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n\nChemicals are stored at Hisco prior to being distributed to other companies.  \n\n\n\nIn the past five years, Hisco has not experienced any accidents involving an RMP chemical at its facility. For planning purposes, Hisco has considered a very conservative (i.e., worst case) release scenario and a more realistic alternative release scenario.\n\n\n\nHisco has implemented safety precautions to prevent and mitigate releases.  Hisco has coordinated with local emergency responders including the Austin Fire Department.  Hisco's management is committed to:\n\n\n\n-Preventing accidents;\n\n-Training our employees in correct response procedures in the event of an accident;\n\n-Providing leadership to the community with respect to emergen"
