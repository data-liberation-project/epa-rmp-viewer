      "SummaryText": "Introduction\nThe Risk Management Program at J. Marchini & Son, Inc. complies with US EPA and Cal ARP requirements. J Marchini & Son, Inc. recently expanded it?s vegetable packing and cold storage facilities in Le Grand California by adding a new pre-cooler and cold storage. An existing portable vacuum tube was connected to the new flooded industrial refrigeration system with Anhydrous Ammonia as the refrigerant. It?s the only chemical onsite that is above thresholds and classified as Hazardous Chemicals. It?s a rural farming area several miles from small rural towns to the North (Le Grande) and South (Chowchilla).\n\nThe Ammonia refrigeration system has 3 screw compressors serving a flooded single temperature refrigeration system. Two evaporative condensers are elevated adjacent to the mechanical room.  Room evaporators are in bunkers on one wall. All room isolation valves are outside the rooms. Ammonia safety relief valves (SRV?s) discharge into a water filled diffusion tank with capacity to neutralize the entire NH3 charge. Refrigeration controls are PLC based with electric valve actuators. The mechanical room has Ammonia detection. The mechanical room ventilation has a continuous and emergency ventilation level that is activated by the control system or break glass switches at both doors. All critical isolation components are redundant, have fail-safe positions for power outages and can be operated manually if required. \n\nThe procedures for complying with the RM Program regulations are outlined by the following major steps:\n1.    Identify Covered Processes\n2.    Determine Program Level\n3.    Establish a Management System\n4.    Conduct a 5-year Accident History\n5.    Perform Hazard Assessments\n6.    Develop an Accident Prevention Program\n7.    Develop an Emergency Response Program and\n8.    Prepare a Risk Management Plan (RMP)\n\nPublication or sharing of OCA portions of RMP materials can be in violation of the Chemical Safety Information, Site Security and Fuels Regulatory Relief Act (PL106"

Marchini & Son, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  Our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training demonstrates this commitment.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities revolve around processing and storage of fresh Italian vegetable Radicchio.  This activity is consistent with SIC 0723/ NAICS 115114 post harvest crop activities. Anhydrous ammonia is the major regulated substance present at our facility.  The entire ammonia inventory is attributed to use as a refrigerant.  \n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nThe worst-case release scenario mandated by the RMP Rule is a standardized hypothetical situation intended to promote \"dialogue\". According to the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration \"The worst-case situation represents an extremely improbable (and for many facilities impossible) set of circumstances rather than a credible accident scenario. Release quantities and hazard distances derived there from for the worst-case scenario should not be used as a basis for emergency response planning.\"\n\nTo evaluate the worst case and alternative release scenarios for ammonia we have used the methodology given in the Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration by SAIC.  Details are not provided in the Executive Summary as required in recent rulemaking.\n\nAlternate case scenario has also been evaluated and included. \n\n\n4.
