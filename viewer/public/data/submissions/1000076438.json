This commitment is demonstrated by the design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\nThe Linde Gas Hammond, Indiana facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  The following sections briefly describe the covered process at the Hammond facility and the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nThe Hammond facility manufactures and stores acetylene.  Acetylene is put into storage cylinders of various sizes before they are sold and shipped from the facility.  The acetylene manufacturing/handling/storage process consists of chemical acetylene trailers, a medium pressure acetylene generator, and a high pressure cylinder filling area.  \n\n\n\nAcetylene is compressed using chemical acetylene stored on trailers that have acetylene cylinders manifolded together.  The trailers contain approximately 5,785 lbs of acetylene each and are connected to a common manifold.  The piping from the manifold runs underground to the northwest corner of the plant, and then runs above ground to the generator and compressor room.  The supply lines are equipped with pull away protection, flow reducing pressure regulators, 1.2\" orifice plates, large flash arrestor, and check valves to protect against reverse flow.\n\n\n\nThe acetylene generator uses calcium carbide to generate acetylene gas that is purified and piped to the high pressure cylinder fill area where it is compressed and routed through manifolds that are used to fill multiple cylinders.  \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Hammond facility maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes th"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If/Checklist (combined) and/or HAZOP. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of every two years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. The last PHA revalidation was conducted in August 2014.  A HAZOP of the Rexarc Solvent Replenishment Unit System was completed August 30, 2017.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Hammond maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.  The acetylene operating procedures were last reviewed on February 28, 2019.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nThe Hammond facility has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Refresher training is provided at least every year and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Hammond facility carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.

The electronic EMOC system is utilized to keep track all changes on site. We have dedicated responsible person to implement the changes. Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training for the modification.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nLINDE GAS, LLC. conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented at each PSM/RMP covered facility. These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.  The most recent compliance audit was conducted on 3/9/2017.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Hammond facility promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Hammond facility believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.
