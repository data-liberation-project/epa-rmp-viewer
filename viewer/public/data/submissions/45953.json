      "SummaryText": "Smith Dairy Products Company \u00bf Ice Cream Processing produces Ice Cream. Very flavorful Ice Cream, in fact we believe it to be Ohio\u00bfs best. Our process involves various types of products from milk shakes to five quart pails. To assure the fullest flavor it is necessary for our products to be frozen very quickly. This is accomplished wth the assistance of an ammonia refrigeration system. This system is regulated under the RMP rule.\n\nOur system operates in a \u00bfCarnot\u00bf cycle. This means the ammonia changes state from a liquid to a vapor and is then compressed to a vapor and reused in the system. Ammonia is neither added or removed in the process. It simply carries the heat away from our ice cream.\n\n\nThe facility maintains over the 10,000 pound threshhold limit of Anhydrous Ammonia on site as an operating level for the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nChemical Hazards for: Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nPermissible Exposure Limit  25 PPM for 8 hours\nShort Term Exposure Limit  35 PPM for 15 minutes\nImmediately Dangerous to Life or Health  300 PPM\nInhalation Hazard  1,000 PPM\nSkin Absorption Hazard  10,000 PPM\nLower Explosive Limit  16%\nUpper Explosive Limit  25%\nEPA Toxic Endpoint  200 PPM\nDOT Classification:  Non flammable gas\nUnited Nations Number:  UN 1005\n\nOur Worst case release scenario involved a release from our receiver. The receiver is located inside the facility and is protected from traffic and theft by the facility as well as our many security measures. The worst case release would result in the evacuation of a small population confined to the local area (less than 1 mile).\n\nAffected within this radius are schools , a city park, residential, commercial (retail), and industrial areas. \n\nOur alternate release scenario involves the leak of a vessel. This release results in a smaller release radious. This has an even smaller potential effect on the community.\n\n\nWe are constantly striving to increase the safety of our facility and processes. Since January of this year we have com"

      "SummaryText": "pletely revamped our Process Safety Management Program as well as our Risk Management Program.\n\nWe have added a PSM / RMP Specialist to our staff. This allows for more integration with our systems.\n\nSmith Dairy has established an in house emergency response team to quickly respond to and handle releases of Anhydrous Ammonia. The established steps include initial training under the OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.120 HAZWOPER'. The facility has also established annual retraining for all personnel that are on the HAZMAT Team as well as periodic spill drills and plant wide evacuation drills to assure all employees are prepared in the event of an emergency. Smith Dairy has also established training with the Fire Department personnel and community Local Emergency Planning Committee. These established plans and procedures shall be periodically reviewed to assure that they are current and up to date.\n\nDuring our most recent evacuation drill we were able to completely evacuate the facility and call a detailed role within minutes. A record we plan to break in the commoning years.\n\nWe have recently comleted a compliance audit, mechanical integrity inspection, and process hazard analysis. These activities have given us a list of potential improvements.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nSmith Dairy has trained the refrigeration operators and selected production and office personnel in Hazardous Waste Operation and Emergency Response \u00e629 CFR 1910.120. The trained personnel will access each release situation and determine the appropriate emergency response to initiate. This could be by simply tightening a packing nut or flange bolt or initiating a system shut down. Smith Dairy has  established written operating procedures for the ammonia refrigeration system and has included in those procedures the Emergency Shutdown and isolation in the event of a release. Smith Dairy has purchased Level B Chemical Suites, Self Contained Breathing Apparatus and other appropriate equipment to support the"

This team will coordinate their efforts with the outside emergency services to assure the safety of all.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nDuring the last five year periods we have had several minor leaks resulting mainly in odors around a valve or component. All of which are easily handles by our expert maintenance staff. No reportable releases have occurred at our facility since its construction.\n \n  \nThrough regular audits, training, maintenance, testing and inspection programs Smith Dairy has established a history of safe operation and that community emergency action plans are current and training with community services is done for a safe response in the event of an accidental release.\n\nWhat does the future hold? Lots of ice cream! As well as some very tasty safety changes. Our review of our processes continues. We are currently concentrating on site security as well as mechanical integrity. Employee participation continues to be a source of emprovement. Though its hard to improve on employee participation when we have the greatest associates in the world!"
