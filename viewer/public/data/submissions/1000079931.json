Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC), Marianas in accordance with directives from the Department of Defense and the Department of the Navy maintains, implements, and updates plans and instructions for the protection of worker health and welfare, and for the protection of the environment.\r\n\r\n2. The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe NAVFAC Marianas's U.S. Navy Reservoir Booster Pump Station (Building 1282) is located on Lower Harmon Road at the Naval Base Guam Munitions Site (NBGMS). This is a fully enclosed, concrete facility holding two (2) one-ton (2,000-pounds) chlorine gas cylinders for raw water disinfection of the Navy's drinking water system. The use of chlorine gas at this facility has been discontinued since August 2013 as part of a mitigation plan to reduce high levels of disinfection by-products (DBP) in the Navy's drinking water system. Only Buildings 1282 and 1284 exceed the respective 2,500-pound threshold limit for chlorine gas and require compliance with the CAA 122&reg; Risk Management Plan rule. All other Navy water wells have less than the 2,500 pound threshold of chlorine gas. Two chlorine gas cylinders secured with a diversion valve remain at the Reservoir Booster Pump Station (Building 1282) for back-up or emergency situations.\r\n\r\nLocated approximately 180 feet to the east of Building 1282 is Building 1284, a semi-enclosed, metal storage shed that holds eight (8) full one-ton and one (1) full 150 pound (lbs)chlorine gas cylinders. \r\n\r\nIn addition, there are forty (40) 150 pound chlorine gas cylinders which are  being used and stored at other Navy water wells.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.

These cylinders are housed within an enclosed structure and are equipped with automatic shutoff valves that would activate in the event of a leak and would further mitigate the potential release of chlorine gas to the surrounding environment. Specific equipment includes a gas leak detection system linked to mechanical vent and audible alarms.\r\n\r\nThe second worst case scenario (Worst Case ID 2) is for the adjacent chlorine gas storage area (Building 1284) and involves a potential release of a single cylinder maximum of 2,000 pounds of chlorine gas. The chlorine gas cylinders are stored in a locked, unmanned, semi-enclosed, metal structure with no additional mitigation measures. \r\n\r\nEPA's RMP*Comp software was used to determine the effects of these potential releases. In both of the worst-case scenarios for Buildings 1282 and 1284, the calculated distance to a toxic endpoint is 1.30 miles. The resulting chlorine gas cloud will reach an end-point concentration off-site; however, both facilities are located within a restricted access military installation, and situated in a low valley elevation where there are no public receptors within the 1.3 mile radius. Vicinity maps generated by Geographic Readiness Explorer(GRX)-software were utilized to determine if any potential public receptors are within the 1.3 mile toxic endpoint radius for both the U.S. Navy Reservoir Booster Pump Station Building 1282 (Figure 1) and the Storage Shed facility Building 1284 (Figure 2).\r\n\r\nAccess to both facilities (Buildings 1282 and 1284) is restricted to authorized Naval Base Guam Munitions Site (NBGMS) personnel only.
