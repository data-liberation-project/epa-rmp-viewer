The facility contains freezer warehouse spaces which are used to store frozen perishable products. The facility has nine truck loading and unloading stations and five railcar stations used for shipping and receiving of customer owned product. Warehouse storage spaces at the facility are maintained at a temperature of 0A?f or below. In order to maintain desired temperatures, a mechanical refrigeration system utilizing anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant is employed. The refrigeration system is a closed loop system; the ammonia is not mixed with any other chemical or used in any other process.\n\nFACILITY CONSTRUCTION: The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with various Mechanical and Building Codes in effect at the time of construction. These codes and guidelines outline requirements for the safe construction and operation of ammonia refrigeration systems.\n\nSAFETY FEATURES: The ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features. Examples include but are not limited to pressure relief valves, remotely controlled solenoids and stop valves, monitored ammonia detection system, automatic engine room ventilation systems, computerized refrigeration monitoring and control system with alarm and failure notification via auto-dialer, as well as trained and experienced operators. Much of the safety associated with the system is also inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system. For example, the facility operates in accordance with the OSHA PSM (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119) and EPA's RMP (Risk Management Program, 40 CFR Part 68) standards.\n\nMANAGEMENT COMMITMENT TO SAFETY: Management takes safety very seriously and mandates that the facility maintain a safe working environment for employees, visitors, neighbors, and"

Employees aid in gathering Process Safety Information, development and implementation of Operating Procedures, are members of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), aiding in the completion of recommendations from both PHA and Compliance Audits, and the screening process for hiring Contractors.\n\n2. Process Safety Information: Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs) have been developed showing all piping and major components of the ammonia refrigeration system. Valves and other components have been assigned unique identifiers. Information has been gathered to enable employees to identify and understand the potential hazards of the process. The Process Safety Information also includes a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for anhydrous ammonia, an ammonia inventory, materials of construction description, electrical classification document, pressure relief valve system design calculations, engine room ventilation design calculations, as well as other required documentation.
