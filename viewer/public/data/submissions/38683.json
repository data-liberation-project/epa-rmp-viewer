This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated processes. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible accidental releases of regulated substances. However, if such an accidental release does occur, we are coordinated with this facility?s Hazmat Team, Edgecombe County Fire Department, and the Edgecombe County Emergency Management Agency for emergency response support.\n\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nSara Lee Bakery?s operations include the manufacturing of frozen bakery products for public consumption packaged under the familiar brand names such as Sara Lee.  Ammonia  (Anhydrous) is the only RMP regulated substance present at this facility in a threshold quantity. It is utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-loop refrigeration system. The system?s purpose is to provide refrigeration and cold storage capabilities for our product. Due to the size and characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration system, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, this facility is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario have been completed as discussed in the following text.\n\nTo evaluate both the worst case and alternative release scenarios, EPA's Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres [ALOHA(R)] was utilized exclusively. The (ALOHA(R)) model is referenced in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance as an acceptable model for the mathematical approximation process. \n\nAs specified in the RMP Gui"

Public and environmental receptors that could possibly be affected by the scenarios were determined through the use of LANDVIEW 5 mapping system software and US Census Bureau 2000 data. \n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68. The Sara Lee Bakery is also subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119, as well as the EPCRA Section 302 and 311/312 notification/reporting requirements.\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nThe Sara Lee Bakery Emergency Response Policy focuses on evacuation of the facility in the event of an ammonia emergency, with the assistance local emergency response agencies performing rescue, firefighting, firs-aid, medical treatment, and other response functions. The facility maintains a written Emergency Response Plan to document specific procedures to be implemented in the event of various emergencies, including ammonia release. The Emergency Release Plan includes procedures for facility evacuation, as well as for notification o the local emergency response agencies, which are responsible for notifying the public. The plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within the facility that would require modified procedures.\n\n\nSara Lee Bakery has devised a comprehensive emergency response program, designed to protect both employees and the community in the event of a release. This program is fully described in a document entitled EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN (ERP) in order to facilitate response efforts in the event of an off-site anhydrous ammonia release.  Included in the plan are measures to be taken internally by Sara Lee Bakery as well as measures to be taken by off-site response agencies.  \n\n"

These personnel are trained in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120, Hazardous Operations and Emergency Response regulations according to their duties and function. These personnel also receive initial training and annual update training thereafter.   In addition, simulations of emergency releases with off-site effects are conducted periodically in cooperation of the Edgecombe County Emergency Management Coordinator to test the skills of Sara Lee Bakery's HazMat team.  Each simulation is critiqued and changes are made to the ERP as appropriate.  \n\nTo assure that the local governmental response agencies are familiar with Sara Lee Bakery's emergency response procedures, Sara Lee Bakery has provided copies of the ERP for review and approval by the local agencies. The following local agencies have reviewed and approved Sara Lee Bakery?s ERP:\n\nEdgecombe County Fire Department\nEdgecombe County LEPC\n\nTo plan for an ammonia release with off-site effects, Sara Lee Bakery's ERP includes procedures/equipment to mitigate the release, procedures to inform local response agencies, transportation maps for response agencies, evacuation route maps, and procedures for public communication.\n\nIn addition to the above local response agencies, Sara Lee Bakery has arranged emergency response backup and assistance with a local clean-up contractor.\n\nIn the event of an anhydrous ammonia release with off site effects, the general public will be warned using the following methods:\n\nBroadcast message via the Edgecombe County Central Dispatch\nPolice and fire vehicles equipped with public address\nDoor--to-door notification of residents (if time permits).\nContinuing Efforts to Improve Safety\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nSara Lee Bakery's aim is to provide a professional service as efficiently as possible while minimizing the use of toxic materials wherever and whenever prudent.
