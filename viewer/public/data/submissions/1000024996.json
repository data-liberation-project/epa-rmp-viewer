Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Brenntag Mid-South, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with the HENDERSON FIRE DEPARTMENT which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Distribution of chemical products.  We have 5 RMP regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Chlorine, Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous), Hydrofluoric Acid 70%, Anhydrous Ammonia and Aqua Ammonia.  Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide is received into Henderson in 180,000 pound railcars.  Anhydrous Ammonia is received into Henderson in 44,000 lb. tank trucks. These products are then repackaged in different  containers for distribution to customers and in the manufacture of Sodium Hypochlorite, Sodium Bisulfite and Aqua Ammonia.  Hydrofluoric Acid 70% is received from our supplier(s)in 500 pound poly drums and stored, warehoused and distributed to our customers.  Chlorine, Sulfur Dioxide, Hydrofluoric Acid, Anhydrous Ammonia and Aqua Ammonia are also used for resell to our customers.\n\n\n\nThe maximum intended  inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 1,800,000lbs. while Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous), Hydrofluoric Acid, Anhydrous Ammonia and Aqua Ammonia are present at our facility in quantities of 900,000 lbs., 17,000 lbs., 265,000 lbs.  a"
