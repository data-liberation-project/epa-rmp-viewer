Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at HVC Inc.  are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Chemical distribution..  We have 3 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Chlorine, Hydrogen fluoride/Hydrofluoric acid [Hydrofluoric acid] and Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous). All substances are stored for future shipment to our customers.\n\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations, the EPA's RMP*Comp(TM) and Chlorine Institutes pamphlet 162.  For alternative release scenario analyses we have employed the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations and Chlorine Institutes pamphlet 162.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Chlorine storage.  In this scenario 2000 lb. of Chlorine is released.  The chlorine liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.   At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 6.7 miles is obtained cor"

It is assumed that the gas valve on a ton remains open for one hour before the emergency team can stop the leak. The scenario involves the release of 760 lb. of .  Chlorine liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 60 minutes.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by Emergency response team on-site.  These active mitigation systems have the effect of minimizing the quantity released..  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L of Chlorine is 0.5 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) involves a release from Sulfur dioxide storage.  The scenario involves the release of 150.08 lb. of sulfur dioxide from a cylinder which falls over and shears off its valve.  Sulfur dioxide liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 3.2 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0078 mg/L of Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) is 0.31 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Hydrogen fluoride/Hydrofluoric acid (conc 50% or greater) [Hydrofluoric acid] involves a release from Hydrofluoric acid storage.  The scenario involves the release of 350 lb. of hydrogen fluoride when a drum is punctured .  Hydrofluoric acid liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as enclosure(s) are taken into account to calculate the scenario, having the effect of slowing the release of gas to the air.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.016 "

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nHVC Inc.  maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of every three years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 08/06/1998.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, HVC Inc.  maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nHVC Inc.  has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every two years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nHVC Inc.  "

Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at HVC Inc.  to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on 11/17/1998.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at HVC Inc. .  The most recent review was performed on 05/04/1997.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nHVC Inc.  conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.
