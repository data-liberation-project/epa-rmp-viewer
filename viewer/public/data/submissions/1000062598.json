Refresher training and emergency response drills are conducted on a periodic basis to ensure personnel are equipped, trained, prepared, and practiced in responding to ammonia emergencies.\n\n\n\nCBC Latrobe Acquisition, LLC utilizes preventative maintenance programs and site monitoring to continually evaluate its system and prevent any failures.  CBC Latrobe Acquisition, LLC continually involves operators, maintenance, and facility employees/staff in the ammonia system operations so that all are aware of the system's status and any ongoing work.  Additionally CBC Latrobe Acquisition, LLC has involved the local volunteer fire department and county haz-mat team (Team 0800) in planning and practicing emergency response.\n\n\n\nAs a demonstration of the CBC Latrobe Acquisition's, LLC facility's high degree of commitment to public safety and service, CBC Latrobe is taking action to decrease the risk of ammonia exposure to the public by working to implementing recommendations made during the Process Hazards Analysis and Off-site Consequence Analysis.\n\n\n\nThe stationary source and regulation substan"

The liquid is circulated as needed to the evaporators where heat is absorbed and removed from the medium. The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system is a closed loop industrial refrigeration system. The ammonia is not used or mixed in any manner with other chemical processes.\n\n\n\nThe \"Worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nA \"Worst-Case Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis\" and an \"Alternative Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis\" were performed identifying the public and environmental receptors within the toxic endpoint concentration radius of 200 ppm. The results are mitigated by the fact that all the vessels and the much of the piping are inside the CBC Latrobe Acquisition's, LLC building. A variety of administrative controls and computerized controls are in place to shut the system down when operating parameters and limits are exceeded.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific preventative steps\n\nThe basic elements of the Program 3 Prevention program have been developed and are now in place.

To prevent and/or minimize any potential future release of anhydrous ammonia, CBC Latrobe Acquisition, LLC is implementing a detailed Process Safety Management program (Preventive Program 3).\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program\n\nEmergency response is discussed in Section 5 of the RMP. CBC Latrobe Acquisition, LLC has a detailed Emergency Response Plan (ERP) for their facility. The purpose of this plan is to provide the means for rapidly determining the appropriate response for any emergency that many develop at the facility such as an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. CBC Latrobe Acquisition, LLC conducts scheduled drills of the emergency response plan. The Emergency Response Program is written, includes specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release, and includes information on emergency health care.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety\n\nCBC Latrobe Acquisition, LLC is incorporating and addressing any recommendations resulting from the Process Hazard Analysis, Offsite Consequences, and program audits. The flexibility of the program allows CBC Latrobe Acquisition, LLC to respond effectively to prevent or minimize any potential exposure of CBC Latrobe Acquisition, LLC (Latrobe, Pennsylvania) employees, the surrounding public, and/or the environment to a release of anhydrous ammonia.
