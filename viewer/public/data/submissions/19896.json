Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nCommonwealth Aluminum Lewisport, Incorporated is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is illustrated through the implementation of a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  Commonwealth Aluminum Lewisport, Inc. is continually establishing and revising corporate policies to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances into the surrounding communities and natural environments.  highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  \n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nCommonwealth Aluminum Lewisport, Inc. is classified as a secondary aluminum smelter whose primary activities encompass the melting and refining of scrap aluminum to produce aluminum ingot via direct chill methods; rolling ingots into aluminum rolls/products, and; performing coil coating processes on aluminum rolls.  This facility has one (1) regulated substance, chlorine, present above the specified threshold quantities as stipulated in 40 CFR 68. This regulated substance is utilized in the degassing and refining processes of molten aluminum in the Casting Mutual Recoginition Units (MRU).\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine (four one ton cylinders - 8,000 pounds) that can be affected at Commonwealth Aluminum Lewisport, Inc. resides in a remote location found in the South Casting MRU.\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offs"

The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from the South Casting MRU Chlorine Storage and Delivery System.  The scenario involves the release of 8000 pounds of Chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as enclosures are also taken into account to calculate the scenario.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 meters per second (m/s) wind speed, the maximum distance of 9.9 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 milligrams per liter (mg/l).\n\nOne alternative release scenario has been submitted for each toxic substance present in Program 2 and Program 3 processes cumulatively.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario for Chlorine involves a release from the Chlorine Storage and Delivery System of the South Cast House.  The scenario involves the release of 450.00 pounds of Chlorine in a gaseous form over a period of thirty minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as enclosures are taken into account to calculate the scenario.  In addition, the release is assumed to be controlled by an active mitigation measure, which include sprinkler system(s).  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L of Chlorine is 0.38 miles.\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nCommonwealth Aluminum Lewisport, Inc. has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR part 68, which are also governed under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Program (PSMP) as delineated by 29 CFR 1910.119.

The methodology used to carry out these analyses include \"what-if,\" \"check-lists,\" and a combination thereof.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of three years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Commonwealth Aluminum Lewisport, Incorporated maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after an outage.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nCommonwealth Aluminum Lewisport, Incorporated has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every two years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nCommonwealth Aluminum Lewisport, Incorporated carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.
