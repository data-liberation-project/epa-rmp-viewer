The VaporCatcher is designed to process tank vapors and recover liquid products from vapors by physical separation and refrigeration means.  The VaporCatcher is considered a small natural gas processing plant for regulatory purposes. NGLs recovered from this process are marketed for off-site sales.\n\n\n\nPioneer has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the company's efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel, quality assurance, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the process. Pioneer's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within their capabilities, and notify the necessary outside agencies. \n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe VaporCatcher at the Kodak North Pad is located approximately two miles southeast of Windsor, Colorado between Litho Park Drive and Howard Smith Avenue East (about fifty miles northeast of Denver, Colorado) and operates the vapor catcher process to produce the following products:\n\n\n\n1. Y grade mixture from natural gas (also known as NGLs)\n\n2. Light Residue Gas\n\n\n\nThe NGL product contains ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes, and heavier hydrocarbon components. The regulated flammable substances include these same components. This facility does not handle regulated toxic substances above their threshold quantities and there are no toxic release scenarios to consider.\n\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE A"

      "SummaryText": "NALYSIS RESULTS\n\n\n\nThere is one worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances at the site.  The scenario consists of a vapor cloud explosion involving 77,163 pounds of a flammable mixture contained in the 18,000-gallon NGL Tank. The WCS results in the largest impacted area with a 0.3-mile radius.\n\n\n\nThe site is located in an industrial area. The WCS has an offsite endpoint and would affect several adjacent businesses as an offsite nearby public receptor.  Pioneer has controls to prevent such a release and to manage consequences. Mitigation measures include relief valves, check valves, grounding equipment, and rupture disks. \n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for the flammable substances at the site is assumed to be a vapor cloud explosion resulting from the release of 10,159 pounds of NGLs from a pipe between the vapor catcher skid and the NGL tank. The release would occur from a break in the 1-inch pipeline that would involve 169 pounds per minute being released for 60 minutes before the leak was stopped. The ARS would impact a radius of 0.2 miles, which includes an offsite endpoint and nearby public receptor. \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe VaporCatcher at the Kodak North Pad is not covered by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Program since it can be operated remotely and Pioneer does not keep employees at its location. This results in the process being Program Level 2. The following sections detail how Pioneer complies with the Program 2 requirements for accident prevention. \n\n\n\nA. Process Safety Information/Process Controls\n\n\n\nPioneer keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These technical documents address the following:\n\n\n\n1. Chemical properties and associated hazards\n\n2. Necessary Block Flow Diagrams of the process\n\n3. Maximum intended inventories\n\n4. Upper and lower limits of process equipment\n\n5. Equipment design basis and config"

Sufficient information to assure good engineering practices\n\n\n\nChemical specific information, including hazard and emergency response/exposure considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDS).  For specific areas within the process, Pioneer has documented safety-related limits for specific parameters such as temperatures, level and composition in the operator's procedures manual.  The company maintains the overall process within these limits by using remote controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel and protective instrument systems such as automated shutdown systems. \n\n\n\nThe facility also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of the equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressures, temperature and electrical ratings.  This information, in combination with procedures and equipment operating history, provides a basis for inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed changes to safety features to ensure these are not compromised. \n\n\n\nB. Hazard Review\n\n\n\nThe VaporCatcher at the Kodak North Pad identifies and controls hazards associated with the RMP covered scenario.  This program systematically examines and explores for potential hazards, then establishes controls to put in place to manage the potential hazards.  The hazard review is conducted using checklists by Pioneer's employees and/or consultants who have operation, maintenance, engineering, and safety experience.  This review evaluates and makes recommendations to management of the potential hazards identified.  The findings are forwarded to Pioneer for review.  The approved mitigation options in response to the hazard review findings are tracked until they are completed.

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  Procedures will be periodically reviewed and annually certified as current accurate by management.

Training\n\n\n\nPioneer has implemented a comprehensive training program for employees involved in operating the covered process.  New employees receive basic training in process operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn specific duties and tasks.  A performance review and written test or hands on observation specific to the plant operations is administered and must be successfully completed during this training period.  After the operator demonstrates adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they are allowed to work independently.

      "SummaryText": "EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe VaporCatcher at the Kodak North Pad is a Non-Responding Facility as per 48 CFR 68.90(b). The company maintains written emergency procedures, which are in place to help protect employees and public safety as well as the environment.  These procedures identify steps to be taken in case of an accidental release. However, the VaporCatcher at the Kodak North Pad is an unmanned location and company personnel are not trained to be first responders to large fires and should a release occur from one of the vessels the facility would rely on the local fire department to respond.  \n\n\n\nEmployees receive training in the procedures to be followed when certain employees must remain to operate critical plant operations before they evacuate.
