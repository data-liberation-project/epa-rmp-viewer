Versacold Logistics Services is a company that has grown with a core guiding principle that \u00c2\u00bfwe do what\u00c2\u00bfs right\u00c2\u00bf.   This principle implies a commitment to provide a safe work environment above and beyond general regulatory requirements.   Reducing the risks and affects of ammonia releases is a primary consideration of the safety programs and planning that goes on during routine operations.  The company employee activities, including safety are subject to key performance indicators.  The organization measures results to constantly improve risk exposure.  The balance of productivity, minimized risk, safety compliance, environmental stewardship and profitability are all part of the measure of success. \nProcess safety program elements are built to overlap with employee health and safety training programs.  An employee emergency action and fire prevention plan is in place to provide safe egress and procedures for employees to follow during emergency situations, whether an evacuation or shelter in place.  Refrigeration employees and facility managers undergo at a minimum awareness level first responder training. Emergency response is provided by the Denver Fire Department in the event of an emergency situation requiring outside assistance.\n\nEfforts to minimize the risk of an accidental ammonia release are achieved by adhering to and exceeding compliance requirements with attention focused on employee training and the integrity of the ammonia process equipment.  PSM is adopted as the culture to manage the ammonia refrigeration system safely to avoid hazardous consequences associated with anhydrous ammonia releases.  Refrig"
