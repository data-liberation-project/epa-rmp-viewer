All elements of these standards have been combined to create one program document herein referred to as the ?RMP?.\n\nSaputo?s RMP is comprised of the following sections which are summarized below.\n\n1. Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n2. Stationary source and the regulated substances handled\n3. General accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention\n4. Five-year accident history\n5. Emergency response program\n6. Planned changes to improve safety\n\n\n1.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nSaputo is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also coordinated with the City of Tulare Fire Department, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n2.  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nOur facility's primary activity encompasses cheese manufacturing.  The plant is located at 901 East Levin Avenue in Tulare, California.  There is one RMP-regulated substance, anhydrous ammonia, used at the plant to provide refrigeration for production and warehousing.  The maximum in"

GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nSaputo maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the refrigeration process.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is a combination of the HAZOP study and theWhat-If/Checklist.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of (five years or when changes dictate).  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nStandard Operating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Saputo maintains written standard operating procedures (SOP).  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround for each system component.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\n\nSaputo has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that operators are competent in the SOPs associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least once every three years and more frequently as needed.  All training is to be validated and documented for each employee.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nSaputo performs documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operation.

Maintenance is performed by qualified personnel who have the appropriate training suited to their responsibilities.  Any identified equipment deficiencies are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Saputo to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose duties are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly notified and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Saputo Cheese USA.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nThese audits are carried out at least once every three (3) years to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  Any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nSaputo promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release.  These investigations are conducted to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent a future release.  All reports are retained for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nSaputo truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention and to recommend improvements.

      "SummaryText": "plementation of the RMP, including information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\nContractors\n\nOn occasion, Saputo hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is performed.  Saputo has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n4.  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nSaputo Cheese USA has had a good record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, no incidents have occurred between June 21, 1994 and June 21, 1999.\n\n\n5.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nSaputo developed an emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n\n6.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  Recommendations resulting from the recently revalidated PHA and the last Compliance Audit will be addressed in a timely manner."
