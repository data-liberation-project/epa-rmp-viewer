A forest products company with offices and operations around the world, MeadWestvaco's distinctive products manufactured for customers around the globe include paper, packaging, envelopes and specialty chemicals.\n\nMeadWestvaco's presence in Virginia began in 1899 when the company launched operation of its papermaking facility in Alleghany County.  The company was known as Westvaco until a merger with Mead in 2001. Since then, MeadWestvaco has invested extensively in its Alleghany Highlands operations.  Today, nearly 2,000 men and women work at MeadWestvaco's Alleghany Highlands manufacturing and research operations.\n\nA commitment to excellence in all aspects of its operations defines MeadWestvaco.  The company's Packaging Resources Group paper mill in Covington, VA is recognized worldwide for its technological sophistication and production of premium coated bleached paperboard.  Paperboard from the Covington mill is used for a variety of consumer packaging and printing applications including packaging cartons, aseptic and other liquid packaging, books and greeting cards.\n\nMeadWestvaco also sets the highest standards for workplace safety.  The company and its employees have worked consistently to build a strong and solid system of work practices and procedures to prevent accidents from happening.  MeadWestvaco remains committed to maintaining the integrity of a workplace safety program that is among the industry's best.  \n\nMeadWestvaco's Packaging Resources Group in Covington, VA has two substances that fall under the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention and Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The regulated substances handled at the source in excess of their applicable threshold qualities are chlorine dioxide (CAS No. 10049-04-4) and chlorine (CAS No. 7782-50-5).  There are five covered processes using chlorine and one covered process using chlorine dioxide.\n\nIn ea"

In that regard and as part of Process Safety Management, Process Hazard Analyses are completed for each covered process.  The most recent Process Hazard Analyses for chlorine and chlorine dioxide have been completed with all action items completed or in progress.  MeadWestvaco's safety programs are audited internally on a periodic basis and modified or upgraded as needed to help ensure positive risk elimination and prevention."
