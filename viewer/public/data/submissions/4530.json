Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.  \n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs help prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nGood Humor - Breyers operates an ice cream production facility in Richmond, VA.  The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing capabilities.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CSAS #7662-41-7) contained in the system is in excess of 10,000 pounds.  The maximum inventory in the system is 37,000 pounds.  Since an ammonia release from the system could pose a risk of offsite public impact and the system is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's RM program.\n\nC. Summary of Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case release scenario at the Richmond facility at the Richmond facility involves the release of 10,662 pounds of ammonia over a 10-minute period due to the failure of the high-pressure receiver.  This quantity represents the full capacity of the vessel, which is a conservative assumption as it may only be full twice a year during a substantial system pump-down. The scenario has been developed based on the method provided in the Risk Management Program (40 CFR 68) Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.  The worst case scenario takes into account the passive mitigation provided by the building.  \n\nThe worst-case release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:"

This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to ammonia spills and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures.  The program has been coordinated with the Richmond Fire Department and the Richmond LEPC.\n\nThe emergency response program consists of the following elements:\n\nOrganization Plan and Responsibilities \nCommunications Procedures \nDetailed Action Plans\nFirst Aid Procedures \nEmergency Medical Treatment Procedures\nEvacuation Plans\nDescription of Outside Assistance Available\nSite Re-Entry Procedures \nTraining Programs and Drills\n\nG.

The RMP was prepared by Primatech in accordance with the requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk  Management Program (RM Program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).\n\nThe information presented in this report reflects the data element requirements and numbering sequence of the final EPA RMP submission.  \n\nA. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nGood Humor - Breyers recognizes management's responsibility in protecting its employees, equipment, property, and the environment.  The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the Richmond facility.\n\nTo accomplish the Company's goal in controlling accidental losses, the facility has established a Plant Safety Program and a Plant Safety Team.  The objectives of the Plant Safety Program are to:  achieve maximum efficiency and safety performance, reduce losses associated which damage of property, and the economic burden resulting from injuries and accidents.\n\nOne of the activities associated with the Plant Safety Program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response programs which are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119), and EPA's Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).  The Engineering Services Manager is responsible for implementation of the Risk Management Program.\n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs is to prevent the occu"
