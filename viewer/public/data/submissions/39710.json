They are transported on roads, waterways, and railways and stored in substantial quantities at their point of use.  The City of Allentown's Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) uses chlorine, a strong bactericidal agent, to disinfect treated wastewater prior to discharge to the Lehigh River, which protects the river's downstream uses and public health.  Allentown has a firm commitment to the safety obligations and responsibilities associated with storing and using chlorine.  The seriousness and effectiveness of Allentown's commitment has been demonstrated in both its unblemished safety record and stellar environmental compliance record.  As required by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Risk Management Program (RMP), the following document describes the steps Allentown takes routinely to ensure the safety within the treatment plant, what could happen if there were an accident, and what procedures would be followed in the event of an emergency. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe City of Allentown's (COA) accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, trains staff on operation and maintenance practices, and uses tested management system practices.  All applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training recommendations, systems management approaches, and emergency response procedures.  The central focus of Allentown's response policy has always been and will continue to be proactive prevention.  The absence of any emergency due to a chlorine leak at the WWTP demonstrates the success of this approach.\n\nThis document summarizes Allentown's existing health and safety programs, the internal man"

The WWTP has prepared a detailed and comprehensive emergency response plan (ERP) to handle any potential accidental releases; the ERP is designed to safeguard both individuals on-site and off-site.\n\nAs a result of the detailed development of the areas noted, this document complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA's) Risk Management Program, under Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990, 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68. \n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substances Information\n\nThe WWTP, operating since 1928, is located at 112 Union Street in the City of Allentown.  Wastewater treated at the WWTP is disinfected with chlorine prior to discharge to the Lehigh River.  The treated wastewater meets all permitted standards. The facility is designated as an advanced secondary treatment plant.  The wastewater treatment process train includes preliminary screening, grit removal, comminution, primary settling, 2-stage biological treatment, intermediate settling, final settling, and chlorination before final discharge.  The WWTP is permitted to treat 40 million gallons per day (MGD) with a current average flow of 30 to 32 MGD. The facility currently stores chlorine, which is a regulated toxic substance under 40 CFR Part 68 - RMP.  The Plant's chlorine storage exceeds the listed threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds in the RMP Regulations.\n\nLiquid chlorine is brought to the plant via delivery trucks that drop off the ton containers at the chlorine loading/unloading area. The containers are unloaded with a specifically designed lifting hoist.  The ton containers are stored in a dedicated storage room adjacent to separate rooms housing chlorine delivery systems.

There are additional alarms monitoring pressure, temperature, and other parameters.  These alarms are annunciated at the local control panels; and more importantly, at the main operators' control station. In the case of a leak, the storage area has an audible alarm and red flashing warning light on top of the building.  In addition, evaporator shut-off and pressure reducing valves are designed to close if low evaporator gas temperature is detected; thus preventing liquid chlorine from reaching the gas piping system. The chlorination system also includes factory-set pressure relief valves and rupture disks to protect the integrity of the equipment should pressure rise. There is a sodium hydroxide based scrubbing system on-site designed to neutralize any accidental releases of chlorine.  \n\nFor the protection and safety of operational personnel, emergency showers and eye wash stations are provided at two locations near entrances to the chlorine building.  The chlorine building has Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBAs) mounted in a separate non-process room so they are easily accessible in an emergency.  The facility also includes other design features such as vision panels and panic bar doors to ensure safety of employees.\n\nThe chlorine building is equipped with a normal ventilation system that is controlled by operators at a switch at each entrance. Operational SOPs require initiation prior to entry. When the chlorine leak detector detects 2 ppm of chlorine in the room, the ventilator shuts down and a supplemental ventilation system activates, which removes air from the floor level (chlorine is heavier than air) and delivers it to the scrubber.\n\nEntrance to the WWTP is controlled at the driveway off of Union Street by a gate that is only open during normal working hours.

This information includes chlorine background information, material safety data sheets (MSDS), and chlorine reaction chemistry.\n\nEquipment safety information was meticulously compiled on the chlorine process.  Specifications for the process are collected in one place for easy reference.  Details such as maximum intended inventory; safe upper and lower temperatures; safe upper and lower pressures; and codes and standards used to design, build, and operate the processes are on file at the facility.\n\nProcedures are in place to trigger updates to safety information if there is a change in the process or operating parameters that makes existing information inaccurate.\n\nHazard Analysis \n\nIn 1999, a detailed hazard analysis (HA) was conducted with plant staff, engineering, and administrative staff for the regulated process.  The team consisted of process operating and maintenance experts and process design engineers.  The HA technique used was process checklist procedure, per acceptable approach guidance from EPA. The HA was lead by knowledgeable persons on the type of process being reviewed.  This review was updated within the required  five-year period (2004), or whenever there is major change in the process.  A list of actions to resolve any significant hazard review findings was prepared, and staff has implemented and documented these recommendations.
