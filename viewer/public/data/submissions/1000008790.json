      "SummaryText": "FACILITY DESCRIPTION\nThe North Texas Municipal Water District is a regional entity that treats water, wastewater, and solid waste for four counties in the north Texas area. The Regional Water Plant is located in Wylie, Texas at 810 North Highway 78. The facility is owned and operated by the North Texas Municipal Water District (NTMWD).\n\nCOMPLIANCE\nNTMWD maintains compliance with the U.S. Environmental Protection AgencyA?s (USEPA) regulations for the prevention and mitigation of accidental releases of extremely hazardous substances under section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.   Facilities covered by the regulations (40 CFR 68) are required to implement a risk management program and submit a description of the program (called a risk management plan, or RMP) to USEPA.  \n\nThe Regional Water Treatment Plant (WTP) falls under this regulation because of the onsite storage and use of chlorine and ammonia.  The amounts stored for both chemicals exceed the threshold limits specified by the USEPA, thereby making the facility subject to compliance with the regulation.  \n\nNTMWD first submitted a RMP for the Regional WTP to USEPA in 1999.  RMPs must be updated and resubmitted to USEPA every five (5) years.  RMPs must also be updated and resubmitted due to any change that requires a revised hazard review or a revised off-site consequence analysis. \n\nThe Regional WTP is voluntarily resubmitting their RMP in 2009 to synchronize their RMP to the five year cycle based on the initial June 1999 submission.  The following information summarizes the 2009 update and resubmission:\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe Regional Water Treatment Plant uses chlorine combined with ammonia to disinfect water.  Water is treated at the plant and subsequently pumped into the distribution network of pipelines, pump stations, and storage tanks.\n\n1. Chlorine\nRegional WTP Plant 2 has a maximum storage quantity of 720,000 tons of chlorine.  The chlorine is stored in two to four Department of Transportation certified 9"

The chlorine is stored in two to four Department of Transportation certified 90-ton rail cars.  The total amount of chlorine exceeds the threshold limit of 2,500 pounds set by the USEPA.  \n\nRegional WTP Plant 4 has a maximum storage quantity of 720,000 tons of chlorine.  The chlorine is stored in two to four Department of Transportation certified 90-ton rail cars.  The total amount of chlorine exceeds the threshold limit of 2,500 pounds set by the USEPA\n\n Chlorine is delivered to the Regional WTP in the rail cars by railroad on rail spurs.  A release of chlorine gas could potentially occur at the chlorine storage area or at the chlorine process areas.\n\n2. Ammonia\nRegional WTP Plant 1 has a maximum storage quantity of 14280 pounds of ammonia.  Ammonia is stored in a single tank. The total amount of chlorine exceeds the threshold limit of 2,500 pounds set by the USEPA.  \n\nRegional WTP Plant 2 has a maximum storage quantity of 34 tons of ammonia.  Ammonia is stored in a two tanks. The total amount of chlorine exceeds the threshold limit of 2,500 pounds set by the USEPA.  \n\nRegional WTP Plant 3 has a maximum storage quantity of 51 tons of ammonia.  Ammonia is stored in a two tanks. The total amount of chlorine exceeds the threshold limit of 2,500 pounds set by the USEPA.  \n\nRegional WTP Plant 4 has a maximum storage quantity of 51 tons of ammonia.  Ammonia is stored in a two tanks. The total amount of chlorine exceeds the threshold limit of 2,500 pounds set by the USEPA.  \n\nAmmonia is delivered to the Regional WTP by a tanker truck.  A release of ammonia gas could potentially occur at the ammonia storage area or at the ammonia process areas.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\nIn May 2009, Malcolm Pirnie, Inc. updated the offsite consequence analyses at Regional WTP by identifying and documenting"

Any changes resulting from this review are reported in this resubmission.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe accident history for the Regional WTP was reviewed for the period from June 2004 through June 2009.  During this period of time, no accidental releases of chlorine and ammonia occurred that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or any environmental impact.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe NTMWD maintains a consistent accidental release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases of chlorine and ammonia at Regional WTP.  The program consists of seven elements:\n\n1. Safety Information\nNTMWD has maintained information concerning process chemicals, technology, and equipment as part of their risk management program at Regional WTP.  The information is made available to employees and contractors at Regional WTP who will work in the chlorine and ammonia process area.  Emergency response planners can also use the information to develop training programs and procedures.\n\n2. Hazard Review\nA hazard review of chlorine and ammonia processes and procedures is conducted at least every five (5) years to evaluate potential causes and consequences of accidental releases, or whenever there are changes that require a new hazard review.  In May 2009 a revised chlorine and ammonia process hazard analysis using the \"What-If\" method was conducted by Malcolm Pirnie, Inc. with the assistance of Regional WTP plant management and staff familiar with the process, operation, and maintenance.  Existing precautions were reviewed and determined to be adequate.  Potential changes in operating, maintenance, and other process safety management"

      "SummaryText": " procedures that could further improve the overall safety of the chlorine and ammonia systems were identified.\n\nThe results of this review are documented and are maintained as part of the RMP records.  \n\n3. Operating procedures\nNTMWD have developed and implemented written operating procedures that provide instructions and step for conducting activities associated with the chlorine and ammonia processes at Regional WTP consistent with the safety information. Regional WTP operating procedures include startup, shutdown, and emergency operating procedures, and describe how the system should be operated in order to minimize the chances of an accidental release. The procedures also emphasize safety considerations during operation and address hazardous situations that can occur and how to correct them.\n\n4. Training\nAll Regional WTP staff currently involved in chlorine and ammonia processes have been trained in the classroom and/or during on-the-job training in an overview of the processes and in the operating procedures, as is new staff assigned to the processes.  Training includes emphasis on safety and health, hazards, emergency operations including shutdown, and safe work practices.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years to ensure Regional WTP staff understands and adheres to current operating procedures.  \n\n5. Maintenance\nRegional WTP has developed and implemented a preventive and corrective maintenance program to ensure equipment used to process, store, or handle chlorine and ammonia is functioning properly and installed to minimize the risk of releases.   The program addresses equipment testing, inspection, and preventive maintenance schedules, and documentation of equipment testing, inspection, and preventive and corrective maintenance activities. \n\n6. Compliance audits\nUSEPA's risk management rule requires that Regional WTP complete a compliance audit for its risk management program at least once every 3 years. The primary goals of conducting a "

The results of this both audits, in addition to recommendations made, are documented and are maintained as part of the RMP records. \n\n7. Incident Investigation\nRegional WTP management investigates each incident that resulted in or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release of chlorine or ammonia. A process to identify the underlying causes of incidents and implement procedures for preventing similar events has been developed. \n\nAn incident investigation team will be established following criteria established in the Regional WTP risk management program.  As part of the investigation, an incident report will be prepared to recommend system changes (i.e., operational modifications, additional training and competency requirements), to prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future. The incident investigation report and any changes resulting from the report will be reviewed with all staff members who operate and maintain the applicable system.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\nAn Emergency Response Plan (ERP) has been developed for Regional WTP, which provides specific emergency response procedures for accidental releases of chlorine and ammonia to ensure that emergency response coverage is available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  These procedures include leak investigation, operational-level response activities, and communications to coordinate response activities with outside agencies, such as the City of Wylie Fire Department HAZMAT Team and an environmental response contractor, in the event of an emergency. \n\nNTMWD will be u"

      "SummaryText": "pdating the ERP into an NIMS-compliant all-hazard integrated contingency plan (ICP) in 2009.  The ICP format minimizes duplication in the preparation and use of emergency response and risk management plans for various regulatory requirements, and will eliminate confusion for Regional WTP staff that would have had to decide which plan applies to a particular emergency.\n\nRECOMMENDED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nA? Consider upgrading the current unprotected chlorine ammonia areas to include enclosure and scrubber.  \nA? Consider interlocking the leak detectors to turn off the unprotected chlorine and ammonia systems\n\n"
