The following topics are addressed in this Executive Summary:\n\n\u00bf  Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\u00bf  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\u00bf  Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\u00bf  Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\u00bf  Five Year Accident History\n\u00bf  Emergency Response Program\n\u00bf  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Phibro-Tech, Inc. facility is located at 8851 Dice Road, Santa Fe Springs, California.  The plant is located approximately 1.8 kilometers (1.1 miles) east of the 605 Freeway and 0.6 kilometers (0.4 miles) south of Slauson Avenue.  This area is largely industrial complexes with the nearest residential areas to the west and northwest.\n\nThe regulated substance used at the Phibro-Tech facility is ammonia.  The facility stores a maximum of 58,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in the bulk ammonia tank.  The facility also stores etchant product solution that is an aqueous solution of ammonia at concentrations of less than 20 percent.  The approximately 48,000 gallons of product storage capacity will hold less than 58,000 pounds of ammonia in the form of aqueous ammonia in product solutions.  In the etchant process, anhydrous ammonia, water, carbon dioxide (CO2), and other additives are combined with ammonium chloride solutions in mix tanks (reactor vessels) to produce product (etchant).  The process is a batch process.  The ammonium chloride solutions are produced in the cupric chloride and copper ammonium chloride systems else where in the facility.  .  Ammonium chloride and CO2 are not covered chemicals under RMP and CalARP.  The processing of the cup"

The plan includes identification and assembly of the necessary protective equipment or other equipment/actions, the composition of the emergency response team, and the notifications required in the event of implementation of the plan.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM/RMP/CalARP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes due to the renovation of the facility.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nNo physical modifications have been made to the system since the March 2004 update to the anhydrous ammonia portion of the etchant process PSM/RMP/CalARP.  The March 2007 PHA did not identify any hazardous operating modes that required immediate attention.  A list of 24 recommendations was compiled that could potentially improve the safety of the system.  Phibro-Tech will review the recommendations and will determine, which, if any, of the recommendations to implement.  Independent of the PHA, Phibro-Tech is investigating the addition of new sensor and control channels in the Process Line Controller to improve process flow.  The addition of new PLC control channels will have the benefit of also improving safety in an already safe process.  The recommendations"

This maintenance and inspection information includes all equipment such as the anhydrous and aqueous ammonia storage tanks, process piping, relief and vent systems, fire protection system components, emergency shutdown systems, and alarms.  \n\nManagement Of Change\n\nPhibro-Tech\u00bfs Management of Change policy requires all modifications to the ammonia system, other than replacement in kind, to be documented.  In particular, the change of any equipment, control system, or procedure must be evaluated to determine that it will not have an adverse effect on the safety aspects of the system.  In addition, procedures are revised as necessary to reflect the changes in the system.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review\n\nPhibro-Tech\u00bfs Pre-Startup Safety Review requires a review of all significant process or equipment changes to determine that the changes are not themselves deficient or that the addition of the new portions of the system will adversely affect the original system.  Management procedures are in place to insure that a satisfactory hazard analysis is been completed before the system is started.  The records from this Pre-Startup Safety Review must be kept on file.\n\nCompliance Safety Audits\n\nPhibro-Tech has implemented a compliance safety audit program to audit the PSM/RMP/CalARP program every three years.  A standard audit checklist has been established and is used for all RMP compliance safety audits.  Corrective actions related to the audit will need to be documented and kept on record to show how the audit is improving the overall performance of the risk management programs in place at the facility.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nPhibro-Tech has implemented an incident investigation procedure to identify the underlying causes of incidents and implement steps to prevent similar events from occurring.  Under this program, incidents or accidents that resulted in or could reasonably have resulted in a hazardous chemical release must be reviewed."

For the worst-case release scenario, the distance at which the airborne concentration of ammonia drops below the toxic endpoint level of 0.14 mg/L (200 ppm) is 2.8 miles (4.5 kilometers).  The population potentially at risk from the worst case spill is based on the 2000 Census and is estimated population is 189,100 persons in 59,239 households.\nOne alternative release scenario was analyzed.  This release scenario assumed an uncontained outdoor spill during ammonia tanker truck offloading. The spill is assumed to occur onto the pavement in the facility yard and is uncontained. The emission rate is based on the assumption that the entire contents of the truck (8,000 gallons) typically transfers in 45 minutes, for a transfer rate of 178 gallons per minute (1,010 lbs/min). It is assumed that active emergency response by the truck driver limits the duration of the release to 5 minutes. The distance at which the airborne concentration of ammonia drops below the significant impact level is 0.2 miles (0.3 kilometers). There are no residences and no sensitive or environmental receptors within 0.2 miles of the Phibro-Tech facility.\n The worst-case aqueous ammonia release scenario for Phibro-Tech assumes a breach of the largest storage tank, A-4, with a capacity of 13,000 gallons.

There are no residences and no sensitive or environmental receptors within 0.1 miles of the Phibro-Tech facility.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Phibro-Tech, Inc. facility was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of chemical recovery systems.  These safety features include ammonia sensors, automatic shut down buttons, and scrubbers.\n\nAmmonia sensors are located in the vicinity of the ammonia storage tank, cupric oxide reactor, the maintenance shop, the laboratory, and on the north side of the facility, along the fence line.  The ammonia sensors are located outside and therefore are protected with a porous plastic cover to prevent contact with chemicals, dirt, water, or dust contaminants. \n\nAmmonia remote emergency shut down (ESD) buttons are placed throughout the facility.  In the event of an emergency, the operator can use one of these buttons to shut off the ammonia flow.  The six ammonia EDS buttons are located near the ammonia etchant area, the maintenance shop, and the production office.\n\nAll of the chemical recovery process equipment and acid storage vessels are located in diked areas at different locations throughout the facility.  \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere has not been an accidental release or `nea"

These solutions are then transferred to drums and totes for shipment to customers.  Prior to filling, all drums and totes are washed to remove the remains of prior etchant solutions.  A scrubbing system removes ammonia from the exhaust of all process vents.  A system of ammonia sensors is in the process area and at strategic locations along the fence line to detect accidental releases of ammonia.  A process logic controller (PLC), in conjunction with various sensors, interlocks, and the electronically controlled anhydrous ammonia valves, ensures proper operation of the process.\n\n \nThe anhydrous ammonia process at Phibro-Tech is a Program Level 3 process under PSM, RMP, and CalARP. The aqueous ammonia process is a Program Level 2 process under CalARP.  The aqueous ammonia process is not a covered process under RMP since the concentration of the aqueous ammonia is less than the RMP threshold of 20%.   A complete update for the Phibro-Tech PSM/RMP/CalARP plan was prepared to incorporate the aqueous ammonia process into Phibro-Tech\u00bfs accident prevention program, at the direction of the Santa Fe Springs Fire Department.  This revision for the RMP included a full process hazards analysis (PHA) covering both the anhydrous and aqueous ammonia portions of the process, a revised offsite consequence analysis (OCA) covering the entire process, and updated Program Level 3 Prevention  Plans.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nPhibro-Tech, Inc. maintains an emergency response committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.

These procedures are technically accurate, understandable to the employees, and are designed for safe operation of the facility.  The operating procedures cover all phases of the process, including initial startup, normal operation, temporary operations as the need arises, emergency shutdown,  and normal shutdown.  The procedures contain process operation limits and provide information of the consequences of deviation from these limits and the steps required to correct any deviations.  Safety and health measures are included in the procedures to warn employees of potential risks and protective action that should be taken.  \n\nEmployee Training\n\nPhibro-Tech training policies require all employees, including maintenance and contractor employees involved with highly hazardous chemicals, to be trained to fully understand the health and safety hazards associated with hazardous chemicals with which they are working.  The training includes normal awareness training which informs personnel of the hazards of the chemical and the safety precautions to use, training in operating procedures and practices, emergency response, and other required management controls are required.

      "SummaryText": "A team will be assembled to collect and document information related to any incident.  All employees with information should be interviewed and other facts should be gathered to develop a complete picture of the facts concerning the incident.  Recommendations are then developed for changes in equipment, procedures, or safety systems to prevent recurrence of the event and those recommendations implemented.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nPhibro-Tech\u00bfs Employee Participation program requires that employees participate in the development of all aspects of the development and implementation of the PSM/RMP/CalARP programs.  Employees and their representatives have access to all information required to be developed for the Process Safety Management Program without regard to possible trade secret status of such information.\n\nHot Work Permit\n\nPhibro-Tech has established a Hot Work Permit program.  This program ensures that employees, contractors, and company property are protected against fire, explosion, and other dangers resulting from hot work.  Formal procedures should exist for these programs and paperwork associated with ongoing work is kept for documentation.\n\nContractor Safety\n\nPhibro-Tech\u00bfs Contractor Safety program requires all outside contractors who work in and around the process system containing highly hazardous chemicals to have received training and be informed of the necessary health and safety aspects of working in the area.  The goal is to assure that contractor employees perform work in a safe manner and do not endanger themselves, other employees, or the facility.  \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nPhibro-Tech maintains a comprehensive set of process safety information, including written information concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to effective PSM/RMP/CalARP programs.   The information compiled is comprehensive enough for an accurate assessment of the fire and explosion characteristics, reactivity hazards, the"

      "SummaryText": "health and safety hazards to workers, and the corrosion effects on process equipment as well as monitoring and safety related equipment, and includes Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) information for each covered chemical.  Process technology information is also included and consists of information on the amount of hazardous material stored and used at the facility as well as operating limits for the process.  Piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs) of the system and information on all of the equipment utilized in the system are included.  \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOn February 1, 2007, and March 7, 2007, a new comprehensive PHA/HAZOP was conducted in two sessions to assess the combined anhydrous and aqueous ammonia portions of the ammonia etchant process at Phibro-Tech.  During this redo of the PHA, the entire process was reviewed from anhydrous ammonia delivery to loading of product drums and totes for shipment to customers.  In February, 2007, the ammonia etchant process at Phibro-Tech was examined by a structural engineer to ensure seismic stability.  The PHA used the HazOp methodology that included a combined Guide Word / What-If approach and was a systematic analysis to determine the potential hazards associated with the process and to evaluate mitigation alternatives including equipment modifications, procedural modifications, training, and administrative controls.  The PHA considered the potential consequences associated with a release of the hazardous materials including fires, explosions, and exposure of people to toxic materials.  It focuses on equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions, and external events.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for Phibro-Tech assumes a breach of the ammonia tank and the release of the entire contents of the tank onto the ground.  The tank is a 12,000 gallon tank.  However, there are administrative controls in place to limit the capacity of the tank to only 85 percent of maximum ca"
