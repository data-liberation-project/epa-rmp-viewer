The facility is coordinated with the LEPC and comply with CFR 1910.38.   If an accidental release were to occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Mills County LEPC, and/or any other authorities to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the releas to the community and envirnoment.\n\nFacility Information\n\nJ & N Fertilizer Co., Inc., 306 West 6th Street, Malvern Iowa 51551 has a maximum of  270,000 pounds in a storage tank and nurse tanks which are used for the storage for the sale to farmers for direct application as a crop nutrient and anhydrous ammonia is used in blending of fertilizers for retail sale.\n\nWorse Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\nThe worse case scenario would be of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 78,800 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the end point is .92 miles.  The facility has all excess flow devices, Emergency Shut off valves and breakaway valves in place required by the ANSI Standards and State Requirements.  These will help limit exposure in a release situation.\n\nThe alternate release scenario, a 3 inch trasfer hose is used as an alternate release scenario followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shut-down valve(s) intervenes or remote manual shut-off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia.  The maximum quantity released would be 28,000 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .6 miles.  (The most likely potential incident, would be a release from a break in a 1inch transfer hose release scenario followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow "
