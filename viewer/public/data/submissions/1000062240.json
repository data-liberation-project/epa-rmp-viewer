Introduction\n\nA Risk Management Program has been implemented at the Berkshire Refrigerated Warehousing, LLC (Berkshire) facility located at 4550 South Packers Avenue in Chicago, Illinois, for the reduction of accidental releases of hazardous materials. This updated Risk Management Plan (RMP) summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to site personnel, contractors, visitors, and the community and environment at large of hazardous chemical releases. The RMP is organized to correspond with specific U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP, Program 3 of 40 CFR 68, definitions and requirements of Subpart G, including: \n\n?

Berkshire is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and to the environment. It is Berkshire policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations. \n\n\n\nThis RMP has identified potential hazards and has taken steps to design and maintain a safe facility in order to prevent releases, and minimize the consequences of accidental releases, which could occur. This RMP addresses potentially catastrophic chemical releases that could result in immediate harm and acute health effects to offsite receptors (public and environmental).

Facility Identification\n\nThe Berkshire Refrigerated Warehousing facility is located at 4550 South Packers Avenue in Chicago, Illinois. The NAICS code for the facility is 49312 - Refrigerated Warehousing and Storage. \n\n\n\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. There is one (1) refrigeration system onsite that is used for cold storage. \n\n\n\nThe amount of ammonia currently present in the refrigeration system is approximately 18,000 pounds.  The refrigeration system is used to cool the blast freezers, holding freezer, convertible freezers, north and south freezer, shipping docks, and boxing room, ready-to-eat room. This system is a two stage system with three (3) low stage and two (2) high stage compressors.  Evaporators are fed with high pressure liquid from the receiver, through the low and high temperature recirculators.\n\n\n\nAn aerial photo identifying the site location is included as Appendix A. \n\n\n\nIV.    Hazard Assessment - Worst Case Scenarios (WCS)\n\nAppendix B consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the worst-case scenario.  Appendix C consists of the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the worst case release scenario. \n\n\n\nV.    Hazard Assessment - Alternative Release Scenarios (ARS)\n\nAppendix B consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the alternative release scenario.  Appendix D consists of the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the alternative release scenario. \n\n\n\n \n\nVI.

However, as discussed throughout this document Berkshire is continuously improving this program. \n\n\n\nThis prevention program covers those processes that handle ammonia above the threshold quantity for both PSM and RMP rules. The most recent audit of the PSM program was conducted on January 29, 2015, and the next audit will occur before January 29, 2018, in compliance with the requirement to conduct PSM audits every three years.  The elements of the PSM / Program 3 prevention program and a brief description are listed below.\n\n?    Employee Participation - Berkshire has developed a site-specific employee participation plan that ensures employees and their representatives are consulted when conducting and developing process hazard analyses and other information required to be developed under the PSM/RMP regulation.  In addition, the employee participation program will ensure employees and their representatives have access to process hazard analyses and all other information required to be developed under PSM/RMP.  \n\n?    Process Safety Information - Berkshire maintains a site-specific PSI program that ensures information pertaining to the hazards, technology, and equipment of the process are properly developed and maintained. \n\n?    Process Hazard Analysis - Berkshire has developed a site-specific PHA program that ensures a PHA is conducted initially, at a minimum of every five (5) years, and whenever a change is significant enough to require a change in PSI.  In addition, this program ensures PHAs are conducted in accordance with OSHA and EPA regulations and ensures findings and recommendations of PHAs are properly documented. Berkshire conducted a thorough PHA revalidation study for the ammonia refrigeration system on February 14, 16, and 21, 2017.\n\n?    Operating Procedures - Berkshire has updated a site-specific procedure that ensures operating procedures provide clear instruction for different phases of process operations and ensures they are properly maintained.

Management of Change - Berkshire has developed a site-specific management of change procedure that ensures changes (except for replacement in kind) to the ammonia process, such as additions of new equipment or changes in operating, maintenance, or other procedures are documented. \n\n?    Pre-Startup Review - Berkshire has developed a site-specific pre-startup safety review procedure that ensures a safety review is performed when modifications to the ammonia process are significant enough to require a change in PSI.\n\n?    Mechanical Integrity - Berkshire has updated a site-specific mechanical integrity procedure that ensures written preventative maintenance procedures are developed and maintained, preventative maintenance tests and inspections are properly documented, and employees maintaining the process receive adequate training.  \n\n?    Contractor Qualifications - Berkshire has developed a site-specific contractor qualification procedure that ensures all contract employers' safety performance and programs are evaluated, a contract employee injury and illness log is maintained, information of potential hazards are communicated between Berkshire Refrigerated Warehousing and the contract employer, and required training and information is communicated, such as the provisions of the emergency action plan and control over entrance into process areas.\n\n?

This coordination effort includes providing each aforementioned agency with a copy of our emergency action plan, providing each with a site diagram and hazardous material information.\n\n\n\nAlthough Berkshire does not have an onsite hazardous materials response team, selected individuals have received HAZWOPER training through classroom instruction, on-the-job training, and drills.
