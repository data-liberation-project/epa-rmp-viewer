      "SummaryText": "Coastal States Crude Gathering Company\nTexas City Terminal\nRMP Executive Summary\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Coastal States Crude Gathering Company's Texas City Terminal are committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  However, if such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel will be available to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We have also coordinated with the Texas City Fire Department to provide additional emergency response expertise.\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) storage, an LPG truck and rail car distribution center, and a pipeline pump station..  We have nine regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Methane, Ethane, Propane, Propylene [1-Propene], Isobutane [Propane, 2-methyl], Butane, Butene, Isopentane [Butane, 2-methyl], and Pentane.  The regulated substances at our facility are components of the Propane, Butane, Isobutane, Butylene, LPG Mix, Natural Gasoline, and Propylene products that are stored and transported by truck, rail car, and pipeline.\n\nThe maximum inventory of regulated substances at our facility is:\n\nMethane                       9,000 lb\nEthane                     53,000 lb\nPropane                1,200,000 lb\nPropylene [1-Propene]           150,000 lb\nIsobutane [Propane, 2-methyl]        1,200,000 lb\nButane                1,600,000 lb\nButene                   360,000 lb\nIsopentane [Butane, 2-methyl]        2,200,000 lb\nPentane                2,200,000 lb\n\n3.

      "SummaryText": " controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo conduct the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  For alternative release scenario analyses we have employed the EPA's RMP Guidance for Propane Storage Facilities Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 flammable substances involves a catastrophic release from the Terminal Operations.  In this scenario, 10,106,724 lb. of a flammable mixture containing Propane, Isobutane [Propane, 2-methyl], Butane, Isopentane [Butane, 2-methyl], and Pentane, is released.  The release quantity has been limited to 41% of the maximum capacity of the source by a system of administrative controls.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the calculated distance of 1.73 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.\n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 2 flammable substances involves a release from the Terminal Operations, which is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Explosion.  The scenario involves the release of 1,272 lb. of Propane in one minute.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 0.06 miles.\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under EPA's Risk Management Program (40 CFR Part 68).  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nSafety Information\nTexas City Term"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the \"Checklist\" method.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of at least once every five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on May 1, 1997.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Texas City Terminal maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation, such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nTexas City Terminal has a training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every once every years, and more frequently as needed.\n\nMaintenance\nTexas City Terminal carries out documented maintenance checks to ensure the mechanical integrity of process equipment.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes, among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as nee"

Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nCompliance Audits\nTexas City Terminal conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  The most recent compliance audit was conducted on May 1, 1997.  These audits are carried out at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nTexas City Terminal promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of five years.\n\n5.    Five-year Accident History\nTexas City Terminal has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during the last five year reporting period.\n\n6.    Emergency Response Plan\nTexas City Terminal maintains a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response, including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n7.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nThe developments and findings that result from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program are regularly evaluated to d"
