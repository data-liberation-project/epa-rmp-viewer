The facility poses a certain risk to the community since chlorine is a flammable/explosive material.  This plan outlines the facilities plans to minimize that risk and displays the efforts and resources put into the accident prevention program. \n\n\n\n1.2    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\n1.2.1    Process Safety Information\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI) pertains to any process which is covered under the RMP regulations and shall be used to enable the employer and employees to understand and identify hazards involved with chlorine while operating.  For the purpose of identifying the hazards of chlorine, a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) is provided in Appendix B.  \n\n\n\nThe maximum intended inventory is three 2,000 lb cylinders of compressed chlorine located inside the facility.  The chlorine is then fed from the cylinders to different areas of the treatment system via underground piping.  \n\n\n\nIf the air within the chlorine room becomes unsafe due to a chlorine leak, there are detection sensors that trigger alarms and lights which notify the employees and the local fire department.  \n\n\n\nInformation pertaining to the equipment in the process can be found in the office of the plant superintendent and may be viewed by employees upon request.  These specifications include materials of construction, piping and instrument diagrams, ventilation system design, design codes and standards employed, and safety systems.  The equipment used at the plant complies with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.\n\n\n\n1.2.2    Operating Procedures\n\n\n\nTo change a chlorine cylinder the WWTP has developed the following standard operating procedure (SOP) to provide empl"

Place the yoke over the outlet valve and insert the inlet adapter into the valve. Make sure that the inlet adapter and lead washer seat firmly against the outlet valve. Then tighten the yoke screw until the yoke is snug on the outlet valve.\n\n5. Only use the cylinder or container valve wrench provided by the chemical supplier to tighten the yoke or operate the outlet valve. Never, under any circumstance, use a pipe wrench or any ill fitting wrench on the yoke/outlet valve since this will \"round off\" the soft metal of the square valve stem.

The property is located along Cornishville Road in a rural area and is bordered primarily by residential farmland.  The facility treats a mixture of domestic, commercial, and industrial wastewater from the City of Harrodsburg.  With a design capacity of 2.68 MGD, the facility uses screening, settling, rotating biological contactors as well as a settling lagoon system to achieve treatment.  Chlorination and sulfur dioxide are used for disinfection and de-chlorination.\n\n\n\n\n\nFacility Owner and Operator:\n\nCity of Harrodsburg\n\n965 Cornishville Road\n\nHarrodsburg, KY \n\nTelephone 859-734-2113\n\n\n\nChlorine is stored inside the facility in two 2,000 lb cylinders (see Figure  for chlorine storage and handling areas).  The chlorine is converted at this location from a liquid phase to a gas phase to be used within the treatment process. The gas is then transported via an underground pipeline to the different areas of the plant including the chlorine contact basin, lagoons 1, 2, 3, and 4, the plant influent, and the sludge mixing box.\n\n\n\n1.4    Process Hazard Assessment Results\n\n\n\nIt is the responsibility of the Harrodsburg WWTP to perfor"

The PHA shall identify, evaluate, and control the hazards of chlorine processes by utilizing a what-if checklist.  The checklist is found below:\n\n\n\nWhat if?\n\n\n\nThe following items discuss some of the hazards scenarios which might be associated with the chlorination process.  While not all items are posed with the words \"what if\", readers should consider these items with \"what if this happened ?\" or \"what if I didn't do it this way ?\"\n\n\n\nSpecial care should be taken to inspect all lines on at least an annual basis.  Even Schedule 80 PVC becomes brittle over time when exposed to chlorinated water.\n\n\n\nA check of the chlorine alarm system should be performed on at least a annual basis.  The chemical supplier, Living Waters of Cincinnati, should be contacted for assistance if needed (502)-863-2874).  If the alarm system fails in the event of a chlorine leak, an employee could easily be overcome upon entering the building.\n\n\n\nAlso, on a annual basis, the blowoff lines should be checked to see that they are clear.  Insects have rarely been known to plug these lines with nest material.\n\n\n\nIf a chlorine cylinder is not seated properly in the floor boots they may move once on the manifold and break the transfer lines and release chlorine.  This supposes that the vacuum cutoff fails.  Valves on the cylinders should always be closed tightly before and during cylinder changes\n\n\n\nIf any of the ejectors, flow tubes or controllers become damaged chlorine may escape in large quantities.  This supposes that the vacuum lock devices on one of the cylinders fails simultaneously.  As with all system components, these devices should be inspected at least quarterly for corrosion, damage or hairline fractures.\n\n\n\nWater supply valves should always be open before operating the system with positive chlorine pressure.

Evacuation routes will, of course, be \n\ndetermined primarily by wind direction at the time of the incident. General evacuation routes will be US \n\n127 (North and South), US 68 (East and West) and KY 152 (East and West). Persons living on lesser \n\nroads than those mentioned should work their way to the general evacuation routes, taking care to move in \n\nupwind or crosswind directions. Due to the close proximity of the facilities mentioned to the plant, the \n\ntime factor involved may make evacuation an extremely unsafe option. Additionally, should the chemical \n\nleak or spill be small in volume or short-lived, in-place sheltering might be a preferable option. In-place \n\nsheltering should be carried out by advising persons in the vulnerable zone to stay indoors, close all doors \n\nand windows, shut down all air conditioning and ventilation units and move to the center of the building \n\nuntil notified that the emergency is over. The initial notification and further advisement's will be made by \n\ntelephone (primarily to the large factories and the schools), public address announcements from \n\nemergency vehicles as possible, as well as local radio and television broadcasts. Initial or temporary\n\nevacuation centers for an incident would be set up at one or more of several locations selected as \n\nnecessary.

If the leak cannot be stopped without risk,\n\nisolate the area until the gas has dispersed. \n\nNOTE that a leak from a container can be slowed by rotating the container so that gas rather than liquid\n\nEscapes from it, i.e., rotate the container so the leak is at or near the uppermost side of the container.\n\nSpill containment for Sulfur Dioxide is the same as for Chlorine outlined above.\n\n(CLEAN-UP/DISPOSAL) Chlorine can be absorbed in alkaline solutions. Common solutions are\n\nCaustic Soda and Soda Ash. The WWTP does not maintain any alkaline solutions of any appreciable\n\nquantity at the facility. The WTP Plant, located 7 miles EAST of the City Limits, does maintain an\n\ninventory of Caustic Soda for water treatment use, however, it would take 2,500 lbs. of 100% Caustic\n\nSoda, or 6,000 pounds of Soda Ash, to neutralize 1 ton of chlorine. These quantities of those two \n\nchemicals are not kept on hand by the City, but in the event they are used to contain or clean up a spill, \n\nthey would be provided by a private contractor (listed below).
