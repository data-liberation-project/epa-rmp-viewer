The terminal functions as a storage and distribution facility for fertilizer used by some of Farmlands 600,000 producer-members to grow the crops that provide high-quality, low-cost food for families around the world.\n\nFacility snapshot\n\nAnnual volume of 60,000 to 100,000 tons of ammonia is distributed through the Farmland facility that has been supplying co-ops in central Kansas for 23 years.  As a terminal, the facility provides a vital link in the chain of Farmland inputs.  Anhydrous ammonia, produced at Farmlands nitrogen manufacturing facilities, is shipped to the Conway terminal where it is stored until needed by local co-ops for their patrons fields.  By eliminating much of the shipping costs for the co-ops, the terminal helps contain the cost of fertilizer for Farmland member-owners as well as provide a convenient location for them to get their product.\n\nImpact on the community\n\nFarmland is a solid, reliable member of the Conway, KS, community.  Its employees are committed to customer service and the facility is available to service member-owners as needed throughout the year.  Farmland's Conway employees know their customers are also their neighbors and strive to \"always be there if someone needs us.\"\n\nEmployee snapshot\n\nFarmland has two full-time and two part-time employees, as well as an area manager, with nearly 50 years of combined operating experience at its Conway ammonia terminal.  Although few in number, these employees have a large impact on the community in which they live.  \n\nFarmland employees recognize community involvement and volunteerism as the most effective way to improve the communities they live in.\n\n\n\nPollution Prevention Policy\n\nFarmland Industries Inc., is committed to protecting the environment and preserving our natural resources fo"

This rule has required this facility to establish an accident prevention program which is equivalent to that required for Program 3 processes under the EPAs RMP rule.\n\nThe OSHA PSM/EPA Prevention Program consists of a set of facility management policies and procedures that promote and recognize process safety and the prevention of accidents in processes that handle, use, store or process hazardous materials.  The procedures provide accident prevention process controls to all aspects of terminal activities.\n\nThe Conway terminal adheres to the requirements of PSM and has written policies and procedures addressing all aspects of PSM and EPA Prevention Program requirements including routine training and testing of employees and drivers that operate any part of the process, alarms to indicate operating conditions outside the norm, an off-hours phone notification system for abnormal conditions, video monitoring of truck loading/unloading stations and automatic shutdown of ammonia transfer should control parameters fall outside normal conditions.

The impact of these potential releases must be quantified in accordance with release criteria dictated in the rule.  The projected impact distance is determined using EPA defined atmospheric conditions and is intended to provide a conservative estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected.  According to the EPA, the worst-case scenario is intended to ensure that no potential risks to public health are overlooked, but the distance to an endpoint estimated under worst-case should not be considered a \"public danger zone.\" Possible causes or the extreme improbability that such releases may occur are not considered.\n\nThe alternative relea"

It is prepared industrially from natural gas, steam and air.  Some of this ammonia is used for direct injection into croplands as a fertilizer.  A large amount of industrial ammonia is reacted with carbon dioxide to make urea fertilizer, or reacted to make ammonium nitrate fertilizer.  Ammonia is also frequently used as a refrigerant for the storage of perishable foods.\n\nAmmonia vapors can be irritating to the nose, throat, eyes and skin.  Direct liquid contact to the skin can cause severe burns.\n\nFarmland has considered potential worst-case releases from the refrigerated atmospheric storage tank which is passively mitigated by a secondary containment dike and the largest bullet tank, the two largest vessels onsite.\n\nFarmlands hypothetical worst-case scenario involves an anhydrous ammonia release from the terminals 30,000 ton atmospheric storage tank.  The worst case release assumes, as required by the rule, that this entire quantity is released as a result of a catastrophic failure of the tank.  This unlikely event was modeled with a publicly available model (DEGADIS) which has been demonstrated to provide reasonable estimates of concentrations and distances associated with release event.  The impact of this release scenario is predicted to extend beyond the facility boundary and impact public receptors.\n\nThis scenario, we believe, is a hypothetical worst-case event dictated by the rule and extremely unlikely to occur for many reasons.  In addition to the stringent design controls for this type of vessel, facility maintenance and inspection programs address the integrity of process and storage vessels, including"

Generally, significantly lower quantities are involved, due to numerous shutdown safeguards present, as they are through out the terminal, and operator intervention which tend to mitigate and limit the consequences of failures.\n\nThe hypothetical ammonia alternative release scenario considered for this process is a release of ammonia due to the failure of a 4\" transfer pipe.  The pipe is assumed to fail and release ammonia for approximatly 1 minute before employees activate the emergency shut down system stoping the flow. The contents of this pipe is   assumed to subsequently drain out. The impact of such a release was modeled with the DEGADIS model which shows that, under typical ambient conditions, the impact of the release would extend off-site.\n\n\nPlanned Changes for Safety Improvements\n\nSafety improvements are a continual and ongoing process at the facility which is facilitated by the Prevention Program/Process Safety Management Program.  Formal process hazard analysis revalidation is conducted at least every five years, but review is constant through management of change procedures, operator training, incident investigation and mechanical integrity programs.  As a result, changes relevant to safety occur continuously as needs are identified through these procedures and policies."
