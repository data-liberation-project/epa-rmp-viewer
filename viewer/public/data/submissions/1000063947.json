The property was purchased by DanoneWave in 2016. The property has under went major upgrades in an effort to put the facility back into production in mid-2017. \r\n\r\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nDanoneWave Salt Lake City, Utah facility is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated ammonia refrigeration.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of ammonia.  If such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with the Salt Lake City Fire Department for emergency response support.\r\n\r\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThis facility produces dairy fluid milk products. The only Risk Management Program (RMP) regulated substance present is anhydrous ammonia, utilized as the primary cooling media in the closed-loop refrigeration system.\r\n\r\nHere is a summary of the most recent RMP activity for this site:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tJune 2017 - RMP Update - New ownership (DanoneWave) and refrigeration system modifications. \r\n\u00bf\tOctober 30, 2012 - RMP De-Registration - Cream o'Weber Dairy closed the facility.\r\n\u00bf\tFebruary 8, 2012 - RMP Correction - Cream o'Weber Emergency Contact Change.\r\n\u00bf\tApril 14, 2010 - RMP Update - Cream o'Weber 5-Year Update.\r\n\u00bf\tOther Past Submittals by Cream o'Weber.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the refrigeration system(s) is to provide cold storage capabilities"
