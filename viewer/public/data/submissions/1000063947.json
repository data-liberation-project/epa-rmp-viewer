The property was purchased by DanoneWave in 2016. The property has under went major upgrades in an effort to put the facility back into production in mid-2017. \n\n\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nDanoneWave Salt Lake City, Utah facility is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated ammonia refrigeration.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of ammonia.  If such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with the Salt Lake City Fire Department for emergency response support.\n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThis facility produces dairy fluid milk products. The only Risk Management Program (RMP) regulated substance present is anhydrous ammonia, utilized as the primary cooling media in the closed-loop refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nHere is a summary of the most recent RMP activity for this site:\n\n\n\n?    June 2017 - RMP Update - New ownership (DanoneWave) and refrigeration system modifications. \n\n?    October 30, 2012 - RMP De-Registration - Cream o'Weber Dairy closed the facility.\n\n?    February 8, 2012 - RMP Correction - Cream o'Weber Emergency Contact Change.\n\n?    April 14, 2010 - RMP Update - Cream o'Weber 5-Year Update.\n\n?    Other Past Submittals by Cream o'Weber.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the refrigeration system(s) is to provide cold storage capabilities "

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nOur facility has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68.  Our facility is also subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119, as well as the EPCRA Section 302 and 311/312 notification/reporting requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention program that are in place at our facility.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Management\n\n\n\nThe facility maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our ammonia refrigeration system are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If Scenarios.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in refrigeration engineering and process operations, and are re-evaluated at a minimum of every five (5) years.  Any findings related to the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nFor the purpose of safely conducting activities related to our ammonia refrigeration system, maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation including startup, normal operations, emergency operations, normal shutdown, emergency shutdown, and pump out.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to all operators who work with the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nDanoneWave"

Refresher training is provided at least every three (3) years and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nDanoneWave carries out highly documented maintenance checks on ammonia refrigeration system equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, piping systems, pressure relief valves, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in applicable maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\n\n\nWritten procedures are in place at the facility to manage changes in ammonia refrigeration system technology, equipment, and procedures.  Authorized employees whose job tasks are affected by an ammonia refrigeration system modification are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Reviews\n\n\n\nPre-startup safety reviews are conducted any time the ammonia refrigeration system, or any of its components, are opened for repairs, tie-ins, or modifications.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating procedures, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nPSM/RMP compliance audits are carried out on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.
