(\"Vandalia\") is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If unforeseeable releases occur, a plan has been formulated to respond to and mitigate the effects of a release with trained emergency response personnel.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substance Handled\n\nVandalia has one (1) regulated substance present at its WiNoc coal processing facility located in Clay County, West Virginia near Bickmore, West Virginia.  The regulated substance is anhydrous ammonia.  This facility is located in a remote location with the nearest public residence located in excess of one mile from the facility.\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario (including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario).\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for Vandalia's facility, Vandalia has utilized the services of an environmental consulting firm that utilized a computer program developed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP*Comp in addition to utilizing the Risk Management Plan (RMP) Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance Manual.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 1 substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from an anhydrous ammonia tank.  The scenario involved the release of 13,151.5 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  At Class D atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind-speed, a maximum distance of 1.0 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint concentration of 0.14 mg/L.  There are no public receptors within this maximum distance.\n\n4. Five-year Accident History\n\nVandalia has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last five (5) years."

Emergency Response Plan\n\nVandalia maintains a written emergency action plan to deal with accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response program requirements for Program 1 sources that must ensure that \"emergency response procedures have been coordinated with local emergency planning and response organizations.\" (40 CFR 68.12(b)(3))\n\n6.
