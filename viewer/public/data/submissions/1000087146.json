(ETM&T) Baltimore, MD Terminal, hereafter referred to as the Facility, is a refined petroleum product storage and distribution facility in Baltimore, MD.  \n\nThe Facility handles and stores pentane and various refined products.   The Risk Management Program covers the pentane blending system including the associated piping, 1x 83,960-gallon vessel, Pentane Injection Skid, and 1x pentane truck off-loading station product connection point.  Pentane is received by truck and stored in one (1) 83,960-gallon pressurized storage vessel and subsequently injected into regular and premium gasoline lines feeding the site gasoline truck loading rack.  The pentane process has been assessed as RMP Program Level 3 and therefore meets or exceeds the accidental release and risk prevention requirements laid out in 40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D.  The Facility maintains an Emergency Action Plan and coordinates emergency response with the local LEPC and responders. \n\nTwo requirements of this section specifically apply to operations at the Facility: \n\n1. Purpose and General Duty Clause - The essence of the general duty clause is that an owner/operator that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has a fundamental obligation to ensure a safe operation and to have plans in place in the event of an accident to appropriately manage the situation.\n\nETM&T is committed to ensuring the safe operation of the Facility, to ensure a safe workplace for employees and a safe location for neighbors in the community. ETM&T has procedures in place to prevent accidents and is committed to emergency preparedness both for the Facility and the community and coordinates with the Baltimore City LEPC and Baltimore City Fire Department.\n\n2. Risk Management Plan - The primary function of the Facility is to act as a product storage and distribution facility. Due to the flam"

Safety at the Facility depends on the manner in which flammable substances are handled as well as the various safety devices incorporated into the design of the processes. Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees and contractors which reinforces the safety policies and procedures of the Facility. Programs have been established to help prevent any accidental releases and to train personnel for emergency response in the event of a release.\n\nFor planning purposes, ETM&T has considered the impact of worst-case and alternative release scenarios. The probability of the worst case catastrophic event evaluated in this report is extremely remote. The worst-case scenario is far less probable than natural catastrophes such as tornadoes and floods that could produce much more severe and extensive damage and injury. ETM&T also considered the impact of a more likely loss of containment event, listed as the alternative release scenario. \n\nETM&T has implemented safety precautions and procedures designed to prevent and mitigate catastrophic releases. ETM&T has active operating, maintenance, training and inspection procedures. ETM&T provides annual emergency response training to its employees, but the terminal is a Non-responding Facility. There have been no accidents reported involving the pentane system at the Facility since the installation of the pentane blending system.\n\nETM&T's management is committed to the following:\n- Preventing accidents;\n- Training our employees in correct response procedures in the event of an accident;\n- Participating in community emergency preparedness;\n- Addressing any citizen concerns by fully exp"

Above all, ETM&T stresses its commitment to ensuring a safe working environment for employees, visitors and the community and intends to work cooperatively with the local responders and the community to ensure continued progress."
