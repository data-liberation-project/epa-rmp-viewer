Executive Summary\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR \u00a768\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR \u00a75189\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.119\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Pandol Cold Storage has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n1.1 Pandol Cold Storage, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Pandol Cold Storage has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following process which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\nProcess Name               | Process Chemical             | Process Quantity(lbs.)\nAmmonia Refrigeration        Anhydrous Ammonia              54,000\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses, and physical property damage.\n\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have: \n1. Prepared a unified program based on the PSM regulation to meet CalARP and RMP obli"

Utilized PSMWriter software to ensure that all necessary employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\n\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures, and practices that will help our employees and neighbors protect themselves.\n\n1.2 Process Description\n\nFacility Overview\n\nPandol Cold Storage operates a commercial cold storage for table grapes in Delano, CA. The facility has an ammonia refrigeration system that provides refrigeration capacity to the following:\n(10) Rooms\n(6) Precools\n(1) Export Staging Room\n(1) Hallway\n(1) Shipping Dock\n\nFacility Location\n\nPandol Cold Storage is located at 33164 Pond Road Delano, CA 93215. The latitude and longitude of the high pressure receiver is 35.719344, -119.156787. The facility is located approximately 4.5 miles east of state highway 99 in a rural area surrounded primarily by agriculture land.\n\nAccording to FEMA Flood Map Service, the facility is not located in a special flood hazard area.\nPandol Cold Storage is not located in an Alquist-Priolo Fault Zone as defined by the California Department of Conservation. In addition, a review of United States Geological Survey (USGS) fault maps revealed that there are no faults in close proximity to the site. The USGS 2018 One-Year Model revealed that Pandol Cold Storage had a 1-2% chance of experiencing \u0093potentially minor-damage\u0094 due to ground shaking in 2018.\n\nDescription of Covered Process\n\nThe refrigerated spaces are equipped with air-cooling evaporators and accumulators as required for flooded operation. Most control valve groups are located on the roof to provide easy access. The refrigeration machinery is contained within or directly adjacent to the machinery room.\n\n\nProcess Classification\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at Pandol Cold Storage consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping. As such, the refrigeration"

During these meetings we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\nPandol Cold Storage has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Pandol Cold Storage facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\nPandol Cold Storage has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\nPandol Cold Storage\u0092s emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\nCal/OSHA\u0092s Emergency Action Plan \u0096 Title 8 CCR \u00a73220\nU.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u0092s (OSHA) Emergency Action Plans \u0096 Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.38\nCal/OSHA\u0092s Process Safety Management [Emergency Response Program Requirements] \u0096 Title 8 CCR \u00a75189(n)"

Our employees will not respond to accidental releases of ammonia. In lieu of responding to accidental releases, Pandol Cold Storage is implementing the following protocols:\nThe facility is included in the community emergency response plan developed under Title 42 USC \u00a711003.\nAppropriate mechanisms are in place to notify emergency responders when there is a need for a response.\nAnnual emergency response coordination activities are performed (Section 1.5.1).\nAnnual notification exercises are performed (Section 1.5.2).\n1.5.1 Emergency Response Coordination Activities\n\nThe purpose of emergency response coordination activities is to coordinate response needs with local emergency planning and response organizations. The intent is for local response organizations to be made aware of the regulated substances at Pandol Cold Storage, their quantities, the risks presented by the covered processes, and the resources and capabilities at our facility to respond to an accidental release of a regulated substance. The emergency response coordination activities will consist of the following:\nCoordinations will be completed at least annually. Additional coordinations will be made to account for changes at our facility that may affect the community emergency response plan.\nCoordinations will include Pandol Cold Storage\u0092s emergency response plan, updated emer"

The facility will record each notification exercise utilizing PSMWriter.\n\nAlternatively, the facility may meet the notification requirements through other exercises conducted to meet other Federal, state or local requirements, provided that the necessary notification is performed. Additionally, if a notification is made in response to an accidental release, this would also satisfy the notification requirement.\n\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\n\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nPandol Cold Storage has implemented many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, Pandol Cold Storage continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program.

Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Pandol Cold Storage has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\nFor the future, Pandol Cold Storage now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Pandol Cold Storage employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Pandol Cold Storage will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety."
