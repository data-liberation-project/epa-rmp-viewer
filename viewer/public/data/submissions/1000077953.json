The products that contain the flammable mixture are stored in a temperature controlled area designated as the \"cold room\".  There is a subsection of the cold room that is enclosed by chain link fencing that is referred to as the \"cage\".  All of the aerosol products that contain any of the compounds in the flammable mixture are stored inside the cage.  The cold room is equipped with an exhaust fan that can be used in the event of an emergency.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response:\n\n\n\nIn the event of a discharge, Hilti employees will follow the onsite emergency response protocols.  The emergency response plan will be coordinated with the Middlesex County Office of Emergency Management (OEM).\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\n\n\nThe warehouse has been in operation since July 2011 under different management.  There have been no known releases of hazardous materials from the facility.\n\n\n\nAccidential Release Prevention and Chemical Specific Prevention Procedures:\n\n\n\nHilti has developed and implimented Standard Operating Procedures (SOPS) and a Risk Management Plan in accordance with NJAC 7:31 and 40 CFR 68.  In addition, Hilti utilizes fequent visual inspections to dtermine the presence of a leak.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Iprove Safety:\n\n\n\nHilti has identified the hazards of working with extraordinariy hazardous substances onsite, and has developed program"
