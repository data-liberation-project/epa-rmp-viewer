The plant uses a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of employees and the public, as well as the protection of the environment.  This summary provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that the plant has designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\n* A description of the plant and the use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation;\n\n* An overview of the accidental release prevention programs;\n\n* A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule;\n\n* An overview of the emergency response program; and\n\n* An overview of improvements at the plant to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting employees, the public, and the environment.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe plant operates two production units: 2-Ethylhexanol (2-EH) and Plasticizer (PX).  The Phthalic Anhydride (PA) Unit was permanently shutdown in July 2016.  The PA Unit did not utilize threshold quantities of any substance on the EPA's List of Regulated Substances.   \n\n\n\nThe 2-Ethylhexanol (2-EH) Unit started up in 2017 after some modification during the 2015 - 2016 time frame.  The unit previously produced 2-Propylheptanol (2-PH).  The 2-EH Unit uses propylene as a feedstock and produces propane as a byproduct.  Additionally, the 2-EH Unit uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in a chiller and as a NOx emissions control agent in F-10 boiler's Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system.  The 2-EH Unit has implemented a Level 3 Risk Management Program which was the program level implemented in the past for the 2-PH Unit.     \n\n \n\nThe Plasticizer (PX) Unit originally started up in 2007 and after some"

This standard is a fully comprehensive prevention program designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  The plant takes a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals through the requirements of OSHA's PSM Standard.  The plant's management systems address each of the key areas of this successful prevention program including:\n\n\n\n* Process safety information\n\n* Process hazard analysis\n\n* Operating procedures\n\n* Training\n\n* Mechanical integrity\n\n* Management of change\n\n* Pre-startup safety review\n\n* Compliance audits\n\n* Incident investigation\n\n* Employee participation\n\n* Hot work permit\n\n* Contractors\n\n\n\nThese elements of the prevention program work to prevent accidental chemical releases.

There were no accidental chemical releases of covered substances that resulted in onsite or offsite injuries or property damage from July 11, 2013 to August 14, 2018 when this updated Executive Summary was submitted.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nAn integrated emergency response / contingency plan is maintained which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  The plant program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, the plant coordinates the plan with the Houston area Channel Industries Mutual Aid Organization (CIMA) and the local community emergency response plans.\n\n\n\nRECENT CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nSince 1999, the plant has implemented several projects to improve the fire protection systems, including repairing and upgrading fireproofing, and replacing underground firewater pipelines.  The plant purchased a \"Quick-Attack Fire Truck\" and an \"Emergency-Response Trailer\" to add capability to the already existing fire truck and emergency response equipment.  Pipeline isolation valves were installed to the feedstock pipeline as part of the past project to convert the 2-EH Unit to 2-PH production.  In 2013, the Confined Space Entry Procedure, was updated with ventilation requirements for welding operations in confined spaces.  Also, the Hot Work Procedure, Safe Work Permit Procedure, and Line Breaking Procedure were updated with the \"4-Eyes\" principle where at least two or more individuals (equipment operator/owner and individual performi"
