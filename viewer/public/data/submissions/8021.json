The facility is in operation five days per week, mon-fri, with some weekend work performed as necessary to meet production requirements.    \n\nCoverage under EPAs 40CFR Part 68, Risk Management Plan requirements is due to the use of Anhydrous Ammonia in the facility.  Anhydrous Ammonia is utilized as the refrigeration medium. \n\nThere have been no reportable accidents/incidents/releases, etc. within the past five years related to the refrigeration system.\n\nThis facility is required to comply with the requirements 29CFR 1910.119, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management.  The refrigeration system is monitored 24hrs per day, 7 days a week, 52 weeks per year by trained in-house refrigeration maintenance personnel.   Every two hours, critical refrigeration system operating parameters and equipment are checked and then recorded on a log sheet. Periodic (daily, weekly, monthly, annual) equipment maintenance is performed according to a set schedule and then recorded.\n\nAccording to the 40 CFR Part 68, Risk Management Plan requirements a \"worst case\" release scenario must be documented.  This facility utilized the instructions and guidance contained in EPAs \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\" dated November 1998 for the development of the worst case release scenario.  The scenario chosen involves the largest anhydrous ammonia vessel at the facility.  The \"maximum intended\" volume of anhydrous ammonia (the largest volume of anhydrous ammonia that could ever be in the vessel) vs. The normal operating volume of anhydrous ammonia, was used in the calculations.  The vessel is located outside the main building.    The worst case scenario involves some type of facility upset or condition which would result in a catastrophi"

The EPAs Risk Management Program  Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration dated November 1998, and the associated equations and charts contained in Chapter 4 of the document, was used to determine the distance to the potential toxic endpoints.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the 40 CFR Part 68, Risk Management Plan requirements an \"Alternative Release\" scenario must be documented.  This scenario must be one that is more likely to occur than the worst case scenario and one that reaches an endpoint off-site.  This facility utilized the instructions and guidance contained in EPAs \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\" dated November 1998 for the development of the \"Alternative Release\" scenario.  Past accident/incident history, working knowledge of the facility refrigeration system, and Process Hazard Analysis data results were all used as guidance tools for choosing the Alternative Release scenario.  The scenario chosen is a release from an opening in process piping/equipment caused by failure due to some type of mechanical failure in a pipe, at a flange, joint, weld, valve or valve seal.  The release in this scenario would occur on the facility roof where some of the process piping is located. The EPAs Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration dated November 1998, and the associated equations and charts contained in Chapter 4.2 of the document, was used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint, for the \"Alternative Release\" scenario.\n\nThis facilitys refrigeration maintenance personnel attend initial and annual refresher training in Ammonia Emergency Response procedures.  There are refrigeration maintenance department personnel on-site 24hrs a day, 7 days a week, 52 weeks per year.   There is a guard force on-site 24hrs day, 7 days a week, 52 weeks per year.  They are trained to summon outside assistance shoul"
