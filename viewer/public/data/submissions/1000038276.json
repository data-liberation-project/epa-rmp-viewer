This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\n\n\n\n\n\nWPE has emergency response policies in place that are addressed in the facility's Health and Safety Plan, SPCC/FRP, and Emergency Action Plan. Most of the listed Plans require a minimum of annual training in order to keep employees educated on emergency response procedures in place at the facility. All new employees are required to undergo training on emergency response procedures prior to initiating responsibilities onsite. It is WPE's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to control the release as necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\n\nWestern Plains Energy, LLC ethanol plant is located near Oakley, Gove County, Kansas.The facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  The regulated substances under the RMP program are Anhydrous Ammonia a flammable mixture (natural gasoline), typically referred to as denaturant.  \n\n\n\n\n\nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE SCENARIOS:\n\nWorst Case Scenarios:\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia - Anhydrous Ammonia is stored as a gas liquefied by pressure in an aboveground steel tank.

Natural gasoline is used onsite to denature ethanol prior to shipment offsite. Denaturant is stored in an aboveground steel tank.

The endpoint used was an over pressurization of 1 PSI, a worst case option.  Denaturant deliveries at the facility typically occur during normal business hours with a facility staff member overseeing loadout operations - therefore a release at the loadout area could be ceased within minutes by manual overrides.

If any additional training is deemed necessary, WPE will ensure that additional training or education opportunities are presented to the employees in need. There are no planned changes to improve safety at the WPE facility at this time.\n\n"
