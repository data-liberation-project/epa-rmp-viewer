This commitment is demonstrated by our excellent safety record. Programs in place cover areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. \n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nOur facility's primary activity is storage and handling of low temperature food products. We have 1 regulated substance present at our facility. This substance is Anhydrous Ammonia. We use the ammonia as a refrigerant to maintain the temperature of our warehouse.\n\n\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps \n\n\n\nMaintaining the refrigeration system properly and ensuring that maintenance is performed in a safe and professional manner is the most critical part of preventing accidental releases. Operating and maintenance procedures have been implemented to help ensure this is done. International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) standards are also very important in preventing releases. IIAR standards are reviewed to help identify potential problem areas, develop good management practices, and maintain our system in a manner that will provide the safest and most efficient operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance with PSM and RMP regulations is another important step in preventing releases. Cypress Cold Storage, Maumelle. strives to meet or exceed all PSM and RMP requirements. The following sections briefly describe the elements of these programs\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nCypress Cold Storage Maumelle maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all process\n\n\n\nProcess"
