      "SummaryText": "North Star Coop's approach to chemical safety is a work in progress.  The program is a work in progress because of changing rules/regulations and outside impacts on our business.  Our company is always looking for ways to improve security and safety for both our facilities and employees.  One of the major outside impacts in our business is the increased Meth traffic in our small rural area.  We now keep nurse tanks empty during the off season and do not fill them until called for in the spring in addition to locking all nurse tanks.  Our NH3 facility is separate from the rest of our operation.  North Star Coop trains employees to safely work with hazardous substances.  Each employee is also give instruction as to the procedures to follow should a release occur.  Our county Emergency Management and local fire department personnel are aware of our Ammonia facilities."
