              "Description": "A PHA using the HAZOP methodology was performed for the Panther Creek Plant on October 8-10, 2018. The PHA was initiated by Tall Oak Midstream to evaluate the current design and operations per the requirements of PSM regulations.  \n\n \n\nThe HAZOP technique is an organized and systematic effort used to identify potential process hazards and layers of protection within the process systems. The areas of the project to be studied are subdivided into workable sections called ?nodes?. The complexity of this PHA required 46 nodes. As part of the PHA, possible causes and consequences of potential hazards were noted as well as the improvements or action strategies that would reduce and/or prevent the circumstance. \n\n\n\nThis PHA covered all of the Panther Creek Plant. The plant consists of inlet separation, stabilization, amine treating, refrigerated cryo plant, and overhead/refrigeration/residue compression. \n\n\n\nThe objective of the PHA was to review the safety design, procedures and training to reduce the likelihood of a catastrophic release of hazardous chemicals. At the Panther Creek Plant, the facility handles large volumes of natural gas, condensate and NGLs. The objective of this PHA is to avoid a release of flammable chemicals at the facility and also prepare the facility for instances when there is a release of flammable substances. \n\n \n\nDuring the PHA, there were several assumptions that we made as part of the PHA protocol. Primarily, we did not list every common safeguard for every deviation. For example, here is a list of common safeguards that are applicable to every deviation within the PHA. Operator training, Operating procedures, Mechanical Integrity Program, Safe Work Practices, Preventive Maintenance ProgramESD System, DCS/PLC Program Logic, Design Codes and Standards, Daily facility walkaround (Operator awareness). We do not document these safeguards on every deviation as they are consistent throughout the facility. Generally, we only put the specific safeguards (such as PSVs, shutdowns devices, specific ESDs, or similar very specific safeguards). We believe that this provides a much better and more logical report during and after the PHA. \n\n \n\nSimilarly, we do not repeat every possible consequence over and over again in the PHA. Many facilitators provide a list of consequences that occur routinely, but are not specific to the deviation and cause. For example, if there is a valve that fails open and overpressure is possible, the primary issue is overpressure of piping or vessels. Every time that a vessel could overpressure, the consequences include loss of containment (gas/liquid escaping piping/vessels) personal injury, fire, property damage, downtime and possible environmental damage. Since all of these issues occur each time there is a loss of containment, we believe that only loss of containment (typically overpressure) needs to be listed as a consequence, and all of the other consequences follow. The risk ranking will determine how serious the loss of containment is, so all of the possible consequences are not listed every time. If the consequence is only operational, we have determined that it is not necessary to risk rank the consequence. However, it will be clear that the consequences are only operational. Some operational issues cause property damage or downtime and will be reviewed in more detail. \n\n\n\nIf an overpressure of a vessel or exceedance of temperature limits is listed as the consequence, it is assumed that there is a loss of containment as that is the worst scenario for these consequences. The loss of containment is not always listed, but it is assumed when risk ranking the scenario. \n\n\n\nIn this PHA, we did not document the plugging of each and every strainer, filter or similar device (typically covered under Less Flow deviation). However, we did discuss where DPI gauges were required and where DPI signals should be brought into the control room. Where additional equipment was required, this was noted in the PHA. \n\n\n\nAlso, the relief valves in the facility are still being reviewed. Kahuna is reviewing each and every relief valve and providing documentation of the size, setting and design basis for each relief valve. In the PHA, we did not document each relief valve to ensure that it was properly sized, but occasionally this was brought up due to other changes made during the PHA. \n\n",

This philosophy involves making each and every employee and contractor accountable for their own safety, as well as that of the community around them. As a company, we follow a close adherence to all applicable federal, state, and local laws to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all. \n\n\n\nEmployees who enter the Panther Creek Processing Facility complete a thorough training, both in the classroom and on-the-job, that enables them to address emergency issues as they arise. This preparation includes standard operational, emergency operational, and release prevention training. In addition, periodic refresher courses help to keep operators' problem-solving abilities up-to-date and in sync with our recurring safety improvements. Our regular internal audits provide an excellent check-and-balances system for monitoring these high standards that we set. \n\nThe Panther Creek Processing Facility is located 16322 County Road 3840, Coalgate, OK 74538. The Panther Creek facility will separate incoming gas in a slug catcher, where overhead gas will be directed to an amine unit for sweetening, then processed in a 200 MMscfd cryogenic unit with a de-methanizer tower.  Residue gas from the cryogenic plant will be compressed and directed to product pipeline, and natural gas liquids (NGLs) from the cryogenic plant will be directed to product pipeline.  Liquids from the inlet slug catcher will be directed to a de-ethanizer tower, where overhead gas can be directed back to the amine unit inlet for gas processing.  Liquid hydrocarbon from the de-ethanizer tower will be directed to a condensate stabilizer to separate out the lighter NGLs from condensate product.  NGLs from the condensate stabilizer tower will be combined with NGLs from the de-methanizer tower to product pipel"

      "SummaryText": "ine, and stabilized condensate will be stored in onsite product tanks, with capability for trucking liquid product from the facility. The facility is classified as a Program Level 3 facility under the regulation. The worst-case scenario (described in the RMP submittal) is the loss of the entire contents of the largest vessel, with a subsequent vapor cloud explosion. An alternative release is the loss of NGL due to a hose break during loading. There are numerous safety devices to prevent such events from occurring at the facility. We have discussed these potential hydrocarbon releases with our employees and with local emergency response officials in Coal County, thereby further reducing the possibility of any impact on the public. The following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Panther Creek Gas Processing Plant. Because the processes at the plant regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) are also subject to the OSHA PSM, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program. \n\n\n\nEmployee Participation: Active employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the company's PSM program is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals. Employee involvement will help to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are implemented. Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues. Tall Oak Midstream strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs. These programs include regularly scheduled safety meetings, tail gate safety meetings, Hazard Communications, and other training programs (emergency response training, first aid, etc.). "

      "SummaryText": "\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information: Complete and accurate written process safety information (PSI) concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to an effective PSM and RMP program and to completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis (PHA). The PSI will be useful to the operators, the team performing the PHA, those in charge or training, contractors, those conducting prestartup safety reviews, and those in charge of updating the emergency response plan. Process safety information is readily available to all employees. Tall Oak Midstream keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Chemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Safety Data Sheets (SDS's)\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA): Tall Oak Midstream has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes of Panther Creek are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. The facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and What if/Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. Periodic reviews are conducted at lease every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures: Tall Oak Midstream "

These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators. Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and annual reviewed by management as current and accurate. The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff. \n\n\n\nTraining: In addition to training on operating procedures, the facility has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process. New employees receive basic training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All of this training is documented for each operator including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training. \n\n\n\nContractors: At times Tall Oak Midstream will use contractors to supplement its workforce during periods, for increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with orientation sessions pertaining to these key points. \n\n \n\nPre Startup Safety Review (PSSR): Tall Oak Midstream conducts a PSSR on any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.

This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented. \n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity: The Panther Creek facility has well established practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment. The basic aspects of this program include (1) training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting equipment deficiencies when identified, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical  integrity of the process. \n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices: Tall Oak Midstream has long standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exist of support personnel, (2) lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping and equipment are opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely. \n\n\n\nManagement of Change: Tall Oak Midstream has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other f"

Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as maintenance personnel, are provided any necessary training on the change. Incident Investigation: Tall Oak Midstream promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to gather the facts, determine the root cause, and develop corrective action to prevent the reoccurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a reoccurrence, and forward these results to the business management team for resolution. \n\n\n\nCompliance Audits: To help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Tall Oak Midstream periodically conducts an audit to determine whether procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Tall Oak management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained. \n\n \n\nFive year Accident History: No incident resulting in onsite or offsite impacts from a hydrocarbon release has occurred at Panther Creek within the last 5 years; note, the facility started operations during the month of this initial RMP submittal. In order to maintain this record of no such incidents, we place daily emphasis on our prevention and safety program.  \n\n\n\nEmergen"

      "SummaryText": "cy Response Program: In the event of an emergency involving our natural gas liquid extraction facility, it is our policy to follow our Emergency Response Plan, which has been reviewed with the Coal County LEPC. Activation of this emergency response plan sets in motion a pre-planned series of events that notify all area emergency response agencies. Emergency response agencies are notified on the 911 system. The 911 call is channeled through the Coal County Sheriff's Office. All agencies are personnel respond to the predetermined staging areas with representatives from each agency reporting to the Central Command Post (CP). A contingency plan is developed and executed using trained industry personnel along with other emergency response personnel from responding agencies, as needed. Employees of the facility are issued individual copies of the Emergency Response Plan. All of our operators at this facility have had the appropriate emergency response training as mandated by the OSHA standard. This plan and our emergency response policy have also been discussed with the local fire departments and members of the fire departments have thoroughly inspected our facility. \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety: Diligent compliance with our RMP Prevention Program forms the framework on which we will continue to improve the level of safety at Panther Creek. Some of the key components of the safety improvements we expect to achieve are as follows: (a) The Management of Change provisions ensures that we consider the potential safety and health impacts of any change we make to process chemicals, technology, equipment, or procedures. (b) The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure continual evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in our safety standards. (c) The Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize the risk of haza"
