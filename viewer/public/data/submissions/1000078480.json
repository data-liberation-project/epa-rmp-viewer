      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary \n\n \n\nPanther Creek Processing Facility owned and operated by Tall Oak Midstream, LLC is committed to the same brand of safety and environmental excellence that all other company assets promote. This philosophy involves making each and every employee and contractor accountable for their own safety, as well as that of the community around them. As a company, we follow a close adherence to all applicable federal, state, and local laws to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all. \n\n\n\nEmployees who enter the Panther Creek Processing Facility complete a thorough training, both in the classroom and on-the-job, that enables them to address emergency issues as they arise. This preparation includes standard operational, emergency operational, and release prevention training. In addition, periodic refresher courses help to keep operators' problem-solving abilities up-to-date and in sync with our recurring safety improvements. Our regular internal audits provide an excellent check-and-balances system for monitoring these high standards that we set. \n\nThe Panther Creek Processing Facility is located 16322 County Road 3840, Coalgate, OK 74538. The Panther Creek facility will separate incoming gas in a slug catcher, where overhead gas will be directed to an amine unit for sweetening, then processed in a 200 MMscfd cryogenic unit with a de-methanizer tower.  Residue gas from the cryogenic plant will be compressed and directed to product pipeline, and natural gas liquids (NGLs) from the cryogenic plant will be directed to product pipeline.  Liquids from the inlet slug catcher will be directed to a de-ethanizer tower, where overhead gas can be directed back to the amine unit inlet for gas processing.  Liquid hydrocarbon from the de-ethanizer tower will be directed to a condensate stabilizer to separate out the lighter NGLs from condensate product.  NGLs from the condensate stabilizer tower will be combined with NGLs from the de-methanizer tower to product pipel"

The facility is classified as a Program Level 3 facility under the regulation. The worst-case scenario (described in the RMP submittal) is the loss of the entire contents of the largest vessel, with a subsequent vapor cloud explosion. An alternative release is the loss of NGL due to a hose break during loading. There are numerous safety devices to prevent such events from occurring at the facility. We have discussed these potential hydrocarbon releases with our employees and with local emergency response officials in Coal County, thereby further reducing the possibility of any impact on the public. The following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Panther Creek Gas Processing Plant. Because the processes at the plant regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) are also subject to the OSHA PSM, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program. \n\n\n\nEmployee Participation: Active employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the company's PSM program is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals. Employee involvement will help to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are implemented. Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues. Tall Oak Midstream strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs. These programs include regularly scheduled safety meetings, tail gate safety meetings, Hazard Communications, and other training programs (emergency response training, first aid, etc.). "

      "SummaryText": "\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information: Complete and accurate written process safety information (PSI) concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to an effective PSM and RMP program and to completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis (PHA). The PSI will be useful to the operators, the team performing the PHA, those in charge or training, contractors, those conducting prestartup safety reviews, and those in charge of updating the emergency response plan. Process safety information is readily available to all employees. Tall Oak Midstream keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Chemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Safety Data Sheets (SDS's)\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA): Tall Oak Midstream has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes of Panther Creek are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. The facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and What if/Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. Periodic reviews are conducted at lease every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures: Tall Oak Midstream "

These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators. Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and annual reviewed by management as current and accurate. The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff. \n\n\n\nTraining: In addition to training on operating procedures, the facility has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process. New employees receive basic training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All of this training is documented for each operator including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training. \n\n\n\nContractors: At times Tall Oak Midstream will use contractors to supplement its workforce during periods, for increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with orientation sessions pertaining to these key points. \n\n \n\nPre Startup Safety Review (PSSR): Tall Oak Midstream conducts a PSSR on any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.
