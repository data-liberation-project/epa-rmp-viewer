      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\nA Risk Management Plan has been implemented at Norfolk Southern's East End Shop facility for the reduction of accidental releases of hazardous materials.  This Management Plan summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to the community of hazardous chemical releases.  The Plan summary is organized to correspond with specific Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP definitions and requirements, including:\n\n7 Introduction;\n7 Norfolk Southern statement of commitment to protect health, environment, and safety;\n7 Facility identification and regulated substances covered processes;\n7 Hazard Assessment;\n7 Five-Year Accident History;\n7 Emergency Response Plan; and\n7 Planned changes to improve safety\n\nNORFOLK SOUTHERN COMMITMENT TO PROTECT HEALTH, ENVIRONMENT, AND SAFTETY \nNorfolk Southern Railway Company is committed to the safe and environmentally responsible handling of hazardous materials.  Norfolk Southern's goal is to manage risks associated with hazardous materials and to efficiently respond to incidents involving hazardous materials.  This RMP formalizes and documents these activities.  \n\nFACILITY IDENTIFICATION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES COVERED PROCESSES \nThe East End Shops facility is located at 8 = Street at Campbell Avenue, Roanoke, Roanoke County, Virginia 24042.  Propylene is used in the car shop facility for welding torches and space heating and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule.  The propylene process at East End Shops, which includes four (4) 1,000 gallon tanks (equivalent to 15,136 pounds), is the only process that exceeds the 10,000-pound RMP threshold.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\nThe RMP regulations define a worst-case release as \"the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint defined in Sections 68.22 (a)\" (40 CFR 68.3). For "

      "SummaryText": "regulated flammable substances (e.g., propylene), the endpoint is defined as an overpressure of 1 pound per square inch (psi) resulting from an unconfined vapor cloud explosion. For substances in a tank, the greatest amount held in a single vessel, taking into account administrative controls, is used for the calculation (40 CFR 68.25(b)(1)).  According to the Off-Site Consequence Analysis Guidance, in a worst-case release involving a flammable gas, the substance forms a vapor cloud which then detonates (U.S. EPA, May 1996). Ten percent of the total energy available for explosion has been assumed to contribute to the explosive effect (40 CFR 68.25(e)). The distance to the overpressure level of 1 psi is then calculated. \n\nA Trinitrotoluene (TNT) equivalent equation based on the method presented in the Handbook of Chemical Hazard Analysis Procedures (U.S. EPA) was used to calculate the distance to the overpressure endpoint for the East End Shops largest propylene tank.  Using these calculations, a 1 psi overpressure vapor cloud explosion can reach a distance of 530 feet.\n\nACCIDENT HISTORY\nEast End Shops has not had any accidental releases from the propylene process within the last five years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\nThe RMP regulations require that \"response actions have been coordinated with local emergency planning and response agencies\" (40 CFR 68.12(b)(3)).   Emergency response activities at the East End Shops facility are coordinated with Virginia Emergency Response Council and the Roanoke Fire/EMS Department.  Depending on the quantity and chemical involved in a \"reportable spill,\" Norfolk Southern's procedures also require the notification of certain local, state, and federal emergency planning and response agencies. \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nSafety and emergency response preparedness is a part of the Norfolk Southern activities.  Exposure risks to employees and the public are minimized through ongoing inspections and regulatory requirements.  At this"
