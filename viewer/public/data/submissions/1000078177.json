Introduction'\r\n\r\nThe Florence plant is an ammoniated fertilizer production facility that unloads anhydrous ammonia tank trucks or rail tank cars into a storage tank and 44.8% nitrogen solution (25% aqua ammonia) tank trucks into a storage tank.  The ammonia and ammonia solution are then used in the production of fertilizers.  The facility has been in operation since 1909.\r\n\r\nThe Florence Plant, has an excellent safety record with no deaths or serious injuries to plant personnel or contractors due to the RMP covered process.\r\n\r\nThe facility safety record is a direct result of much emphasis on safety in the plant on the part of management and employees.\r\n\r\nB.
