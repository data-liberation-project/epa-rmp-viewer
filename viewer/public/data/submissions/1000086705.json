Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) Policy\n\n\n\nPembina Midstream is committed to protecting the health and safety of all individuals affected by our activities.  We are committed to safeguarding the environment and contributing to the well-being of the communities in which we operate.\n\n\n\nPembina works to continually improve our EHS performance by:\n\nA?    Integrating EHS best practices into all parts of our business.\n\nA?    Ensuring compliance with applicable laws, regulations and industry standards.\n\nA?    Identifying, assessing and managing EHS risk throughout our business.\n\nA?    Ensuring that each employee, contractor and third party service provider understands their EHS responsibilities, is trained to meet them and is monitored for compliance.\n\nA?    Establishing EHS objectives and regularly measuring our progress.\n\nA?    Maintaining Pembina Midstream's commitment to open and honest dialog with stakeholders\n\n\n\n\n\n2.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe function of the Lynchburg Terminal is the wholesale distribution of propane.  The propane is normally delivered by rail tank car, stored in nine 30,000 gallon capacity vessels and is distributed by customers trucks.  The one substance regulated under the Risk Management Plan (RMP) is propane.  The quantities of propane stored in each 30,000 gallon vessel are controlled to 90% of their capacity to prevent overpressuring.  This procedure is backed up by a system to prevent pressure exceeding 250 psi, preventing structural damage to the vessels and also preventing an uncontrolled release.  Based on the aforesaid, the maximum inventory in storage at the site is 9 times 27,000 gallons or 241,000 gallons equivalent to 1,027,112 pounds of propane.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.  Worst Case and Alternate Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nThe parameters of the offsite consequences analyses for the terminal are based on the requirements set forth in RMP rules (40 CFR 68).  The wor"

Worse case scenario for Program 3 involves a catastrophic release from one of the 9-30,000 gallon tanks in the propane storage and involves the release of the entire content of the tank (27,000 gallons or 114,124 lbs).  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, with 10% of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Off-site receptors would not be affected.\n\nA?    Alternate release scenario for Program 3 involves a release from one of the propane storage tanks when a truck loading pipe/hose is ruptured releasing 49,000 lbs of propane.  It assumes that the entire quantity is released as a vapor with 10% of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Off-site receptors would not be affected.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.  General Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention \n\n     Steps\n\n\n\nPembina Midstream, USA has taken steps to comply with accidental release prevention requirements under 40 CFR Part 68.
