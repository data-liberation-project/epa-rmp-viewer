We at Hydrite Chemical are strongly committed to employee and public safety and environmental responsibility.  It is our policy to control our processes to prevent the accidental release of harmful or noxious materials that could endanger or irritate our employees, plant visitors, or neighbors.  This commitment is integrated into our design standards, equipment installation and maintenance practices, operating procedures and training programs.\n\nHydrite Chemical has developed and trained written emergency response procedures in the event of an accidental release from any of our processes.  These written plans have been provided to the local emergency response agencies including local emergency response personnel, hospitals, state and federal agencies.\n\nHydrite warehouses three chemicals regulated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Program and the Environmental Protection Agency Risk Management Program.  These chemicals are an anhydrous form of sulfur dioxide, chlorine and aqueous ammonia.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are received in compressed gas cylinders ranging from 105 lbs. to 2,000 lbs. and is stored as a liquid under pressure.  Aqua ammonia is received in bulk via truck and stored on-site in an outdoor storage tank.  All storage containers are designed to comply with National Standards including the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), OSHA, and the Chlorine Institute.\n\nWorst case scenario for regulated toxic gases is based on the total loss of the maximum quantity stored in each container.  Release is assumed to occur over a 10 minute period with weather conditions as defined by EPA in the Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  Passive mitigation for enclosures is included as all material is received a"

      "SummaryText": "nd stored within a building.  Hydrite has elected to use the ALOHA modeling package to keep our scenarios comparable with the local emergency response providers.  Worst case release for sulfur dioxide has the greatest distance to the endpoint and does have off-site impact.\n\nAlternate scenarios for chlorine and sulfur dioxide were based on a fuseable plug failure on a ton container allowing the quantity in the container to be released through the 3/8 opening for 15 minutes.  Weather conditions used were as specified in the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  Modeling was conducted using ALOHA.  The alternate scenario for aqueous ammonia was based on a total tank failure with the contents released into a dike.  The release is assumed to occur over a 60 minute period with the entire contents of the tank released.  Due to ALOHA's inability to model aqueous solutions, Hydrite used RMP*Comp for modeling the aqueous ammonia scenarios.  All alternate scenarios have off-site impacts. \n\nHydrite Chemical has multiple release prevention programs integrated into all phases of operation from design through maintenance.  Each chemical is reviewed for physical hazards, health hazards, environmental hazards and process hazards.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes are subject to OSHA PSM.  Aqua ammonia is not stored ina concentration regulated by OSHA's PSM, but is subjected to the same requirements for RMP compliance.  All three processes are subject to EPA's RMP program.  As required by those programs, these processes undergo a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  Written operating procedures have been developed and are reviewed on a regular basis.  Employee training procedures have been developed and are implemented ensuring the employees understand the hazards of the chemicals, know how to operate the equipment, know how to shut down the process and how to respond to a release.  Pre-start up safety reviews are performed prior to operation of new equipment or receipt of new"

This plan includes\n     \u00b7 individual assignments in case of an emergency for on-scene control of the situation, \n     \u00b7 response personnel, \n     \u00b7 appropriate response actions, \n     \u00b7 resources available at the plant for use in responding such as \n     \u00b7 self-contained breathing apparatus, \n     \u00b7 two way radios for communication, \n     \u00b7 repair kits for leaking cylinders and tanks.  \n\nHydrite Chemical is strongly committed to employee and public safety and environmental responsibility and continually works to improve processes or procedure that advance our goal of zero releases."
