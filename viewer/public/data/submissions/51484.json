      "SummaryText": "The Holden Gas Processing (HGP) facility, located in Logan County West Virginia, is a refrigerated JT (Joules-Thompson) effect plant designed to process 8 MMscfd of gas at an inlet pressure of 45 psig and 60?F.  The facility was moved to its present location in late 1999 from Huntsville, Tennessee.  The compression was brought on-line in January 2000.  The process was brought on line March 2000. The facility is manned 10 hours daily. \n\nLow pressure inlet gas from CHK\u00bfs gathering system is delivered to the plant via a 10\u00bf pipeline between 25-45 psig.  The gas is compressed by 3 electric drive reciprocating gas compressors to process pressure of approximately 900 psig.  The gas is dehydrated using Tri-ethylene Glycol (TEG) and Molecular Sieve prior to entering the liquid extractions portion of the process.  The TEG system produces an effluent stream (primarily water) that is pumped to a slop tank. \n\nThe nature of the plant is gas expansion from a higher pressure to a lower pressure, thereby cooling the gas to extract hydrocarbon liquids and making the resulting residue gas merchantable The plant is designed to operate in the de-ethanizing mode. Overhead vapors (residue gas) from the de-ethanizer with a volume of 7.5 MMscfd and composition of 76% Methane and 15% Ethane are recompressed to 1150 psig and delivered to the Columbia Gas Transmission Pipeline.  Liquids leaving the bottom of the de-ethanizer flow to the fractionation system. \n\nDepropanizer and Debutanizer fractionation systems are provided at HGP.  The facility produces a approximately 1200-1500 gallons a day of Propane product with a composition of 10% Ethane and 75% Propane.  The balance of the product stream is composed of heavy ends.\n\nThe facility produces approximately 3000 gallons a day of a Butanes plus (Propane/Butane mix) product stream with a composition of  21% Propane, 41% Butane and 20% Pentane.  The balance of the fluid mix are heavy ends commonly known as C6 plus. \n\nEthane Propane, Butane and"

      "SummaryText": "Pentane are regulated substances each with a TQ of 10,000 lbs.\n\nBecause of the volume of stored regulated substances vs. the transient gas stream, only the storage area was evaluated when determining RMP eligibility or Program level.  The interconnecting piping would make the refrigeration plant part of the process but the requirements would not change in relation to distance to the overpressure endpoint of 1 psi or resulting RMP Program level.\n\nThere are five (5) 30,000 gallon pressurized \u00bfbullet\u00bf type storage tanks on location.  \n\nTwo (2) of the storage tanks are used primarily for propane storage.  One tank is produced into daily.  When the tank is full @ 85% the tanks are switched.  The full tank is vented back into the process to reduce the ethane content before being trucked from the facility.\n\nOne (1) tank is used for Butanes Plus (Propane-Butane mix) storage.  This tank is shipped by truck as soon as a load (9,500 gallons) is produced.  Though this tank is procedurally held at approximately 33%, at 3,000 gallons production a day, if transportation were unavailable, the tank could fill to 88% maximum in 5.5 days.  Consequently, the tank was evaluated as being full.\n\nOne (1) tank is used as a slop tank.  As discussed above, the effluent stream from the TEG dehydrator is pumped to this tank.  Additional fluids from the various tanks are dumped in the tank.  The normal content of this vessel is 98% water. This fluid is transported by truck to an offsite disposal facility.\n\nOne (1) tank remains in standby mode.  This tank can be used for either Propane or Butane storage if for some reason (weather) transportation was unavailable for shipping the product. Procedurally, this tank is used only as standby and as such was not evaluated for RMP.\n\nWorst Case and Alternate Release Scenarios\n\nWe used RMP*Comp\u00bf and two composition scenarios to determine worst case scenario.
