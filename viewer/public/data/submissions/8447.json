It is MAP Garyville Refinery's policy that in the conduct of its activities it will strive to protect and promote the health and safety of its employees, customers, and others who may be affected by these activities, and to limit adverse effects on the physical environment in which its activities are carried out.  As part of this policy, the MAP Garyville Refinery has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One part of these systems is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the MAP Garyville Refinery and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) rule 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements:  Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule), and the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality regulation (LAC 33:III.Chapter.59).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at the MAP Garyville Refinery.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan executive summary requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the MAP Garyville Refinery.\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe MAP Garyville Refinery has a long-standing commitment to the safety of the general public, of the MAP Garyville Refinery employees and to the preservation of the environment.  One primary portion of this commitment is the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances in and around the refinery.  The MAP Garyville Refinery utilizes engineering controls, inspec"

      "SummaryText": "tion programs, and detailed procedures as a means to prevent accidental releases.  In the event of a release, the refinery has well trained emergency response teams to contain, mitigate, monitor, and stop the release.  The refinery has fully staffed and trained emergency response teams for fire fighting (VERT), medical emergencies (RESCUE), and for ambient air monitoring (Air Monitoring Team).  In addition to handling the release, the refinery has also established a wide variety of communication systems to alert the community in the event of a significant release.  In conjunction with our local emergency planning commission (LEPC), the refinery has the ability to notify the local community through cable override systems, radio broadcasts, and/or through an automated telephone notification system (FirstCall).  The Air Monitoring Team (AMT) is also trained to communicate with members of the local community while performing real time monitoring of the neighborhoods around the refinery.\n\nThe MAP Garyville Refinery Division Manager has overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the risk management program for EPA-regulated processes at division facilities.  However, the specific responsibilities for certain aspects of that program have been delegated to other personnel who report either directly, or through other management personnel, to the Division Manager.  Those relationships are depicted on the division organization chart.

The MAP Garyville Refinery uses crude petroleum as their feed material and makes a variety of petroleum-based products, including gasoline, diesel fuel, and liquefied petroleum gases such as propane and butane.  Many of these products are flammable substances that EPA has specifically listed in the RMP rule and are present in our process units above the EPA threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.  In total, the MAP Garyville Refinery has 26 process units that are covered by the RMP rule because of their flammable process materials.  As of submittal of the RMP, one of these units (Unit 46 - Propylene Splitter) had not begun operation; the expected date of startup is June 23, 1999.  These units are listed in the RMP data included with this summary (Section 1.17 of the RMP Data Elements).\n\nThe MAP Garyville Refinery also handles one toxic substance regulated by the RMP rule in a sufficient quantity to be covered by the RMP rule:\n\n7 Hydrofluoric acid is used as a catalyst in the HF Alkylation unit which produces gasoline.\n\nThe HF Alkylation Unit is covered because the unit contains more than the threshold quantity of hydrofluoric acid of 1,000 pounds.\n \n1.3 Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nThe MAP Garyville Refinery performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance that could affect the public or the environment.  The offsite consequence analysis consisted of evaluating both worst-case scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  The MAP Garyville Refinery does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that might occur during the lifetim"

We have submitted release scenario analyses to EPA and have shared that information with the LEPC and other organizations involved in emergency response activities.  It is also available to local residents and businesses.\n\nThe paragraphs below briefly describe some of the scenarios we analyzed and are the scenarios for which we have included detailed information in our risk management plan.  Please recognize that none of these events have occurred at our facility.  Also, for some of these events, we have emergency mitigation systems that should help reduce the consequences of the events if they occurred.  In all cases, if such events occurred, we would actuate our emergency response plan to respond to the event, notify local authorities, and take appropriate actions to protect both our employees and people in the community.\n\nIf you are interested in this information, please contact the receptionist at the MAP Garyville Refinery at (504) 535-2241 and ask for the Environmental and Safety Manager.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case scenario associated with the toxic substances in RMP-covered processes at the refinery is a failure from the hydrofluoric (HF) acid settler/acid storage in the HF Alkylation Unit.  If such a failure released the maximum inventory of the acid settler/acid storage (700,000 pounds), the HF acid would vaporize, resulting in a toxic exposure hazard in the downwind area that would extend outside of the boundary of the refinery.  As specified by the EPA, this analysis assumes that all of the HF acid is released to the air and no credit is taken for the operation of our HF acid vapor mitigation system (i.e., a water spray system to reduce the amount of vapor that leaves the unit if released). \n\nThe worst-case scenario associated with a release of flammable substances in RMP-covered pro"

The analysis assumes that the maximum possible inventory of 4,600,000 pounds is released, completely vaporizes, and ignites, resulting in a VCE.  Because there are some public receptor locations just outside the refinery property, this event could affect members of the public at those closest locations.  Although the MAP Garyville Refinery has numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this worst-case scenario as specified by the EPA.  \n\nThere are no Program 1 processes at the refinery, therefore, no additional worst-case analyses are reported for such processes.  Also, the MAP Garyville Refinery did not identify any worst-case scenarios that would affect public receptors other than the receptors affected by the scenarios reported above.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe MAP Garyville Refinery analyzed numerous release scenarios for toxic materials.  The single alternative toxic release scenario we are reporting as part of the risk management plan involves a release of HF acid from a drain valve failure on the Rerun Tower in the Alkylation Unit.  This would result in a release of 8,248 pounds of HF acid in the time required to activate the water mitigation system, thereby effectively stopping the release.  Because the HF acid release would be accompanied by hydrocarbon material, it was assumed the existing atmospheric hydrocarbon monitors would detect the event.  We also took credit in the analysis for the water deluge system that would reduce the amount of HF vapor that would leave the unit.  However, the analysis indicated that the resulting HF vapor cloud could result in toxic exposures to people outside the refinery boundary.\n\nThe alternative release scenario in our risk management pl"

The piping failure would release 453,092 pounds of flammable material in the time required to isolate the release.  The analysis assumed that all of this material would be involved in a VCE and showed that the resulting overpressure from the explosion would affect public receptor locations outside the refinery.\n\nAs stated previously, we have included details regarding these scenarios in the additional information submitted to EPA with this executive summary and have shared that information with the LEPC, other organizations involved in emergency planning and members of the local community.  If you are interested in this information, please contact the receptionist at the MAP Garyville Refinery at (504) 535-2241 and ask for the Environmental and Safety Manager.\n \n1.4 Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the MAP Garyville Refinery.  Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) standard, and because the OSHA PSM requirements are very similar to the EPA RMP requirements for refineries, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements.  The PSM program at this facility has been extended by the MAP Garyville Refinery, where necessary, to satisfy EPA's Program Level 3 accident prevention program requirements.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe MAP Garyville Refinery encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.

In addition, the MAP Garyville Refinery has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include teams which promote both process and personal safety, such as the monthly Health and Environmental Safety (HES) meetings with management and hourly employees and the Accident Projection Technique (APT) Program.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe MAP Garyville Refinery keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the MAP Garyville Refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).

The MAP Garyville Refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, operating procedures, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe MAP Garyville Refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe MAP Garyville Refinery has a comprehensive PHA program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each existing covered process and future processes are systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage those hazards.\n\nThe MAP Garyville Refinery primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques available.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as recommends accident prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team recommendations are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution."

All approved safety improvements being implemented in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained by the Environmental and Safety Department.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the MAP Garyville Refinery periodically updates and revalidates its process hazard analyses of affected units. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  Consideration of potential offsite effects has been incorporated into all PHA updates completed after August 19, 1996.  The results and recommendations from these updates are documented and retained.

New employees receive basic training in the MAP Garyville Refinery operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted every 3 years.  Operators are given the opportunity to take part in more frequent refresher training if desired.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe MAP Garyville Refinery uses contractors to supplement its work force throughout the year, as well as during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.
