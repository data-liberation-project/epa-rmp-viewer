This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release program covering areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility.  It is company policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations as well as implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\nOur emergency response program is based, in part, upon the Chlorine Institute's Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) Risk Management Program guidances.  The emergency response plan includes detailed procedures for mitigating releases, procedures for notification of the local fire, medical, and emergency response authorities, and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\r\n\r\nB.  The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe facility primary activities include distributing and repackaging inorganic chemicals as well as manufacturing sodium hypochlorite (bleach) for our customers. Bleach manufacturing involve use of chlorine. The total inventory of chlorine stored at this plant is limited to the reasonable minimum.\r\n\r\nC.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe Company has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA as well as OSHA's PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. Additionally, access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, and authorized contractors.\r\n\r\nD.  Five-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nNo accidental release of hazardous materials in reportable quantities has occurred during the past five (5) year period.\r\n\r\nE.  T"

We have discussed this program with the Dallas County Local Emergency Planning Committee and the City Fire Department. Representatives of the City Fire Department and many emergency responders have visited this plant.\r\n\r\nG.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nThrough our ongoing implementation of the PSM/RMP program, the Company looks continuously for possible system changes to improve our operations.  For example, the facility uses three levels of safeguards to protect against an accidental release.\r\n\r\nThis facility plans to remove the regulated chemical from the site in 2019."
