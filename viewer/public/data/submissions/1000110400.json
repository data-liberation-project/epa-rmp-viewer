Gretna maintains Environmental, Health, and Safety (EHS) management systems to ensure the safe operation of its facilities.  As part of this commitment, Gretna invests resources in various areas of accident prevention, such as:\n\n\u0095\tSafety in process design;\n\u0095\tSafe operating policies and procedures;\n\u0095\tA comprehensive mechanical integrity program;\n\u0095\tManagement of process changes;\n\u0095\tTraining;\n\u0095\tIncident investigation and auditing; and\n\u0095\tEmergency response participation.\n\nThis document provides an overview of the risk management activities at the Gretna Wastewater Treatment Plant, including:\n\n\u0095\tA description of the facility and substances regulated by the EPA RMP rule;\n\u0095\tA summary of potential release scenarios and potential off-site consequences;\n\u0095\tAn overview of the Prevention Program to prevent accidental chemical releases;\n\u0095\tA five-year history of accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule;\n\u0095\tAn overview of the emergency response program; and\n\u0095\tPlanned changes to improve safety.\n\n \nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe City of Gretna Wastewater Treatment Plant uses chlorine as a disinfectant.  Chlorine is stored as a liquid under pressure in 1-ton cylinders.  Chlorine is the only regulated substance in sufficient quantities to be covered under the Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation.  The facility is classified as Program Level 2 under the RMP regulation.\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nGretna\u0092s ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of the employees, and constant emphasis on safety have allowed us to operate without serious accidents.

This coordination includes periodic committee meetings with or communications to local emergency response officials, local government officials, and community members.  The City of Gretna Wastewater Treatment Plant has access to trained and fully equipped firefighting, HAZMAT, and medical/rescue teams capable of managing a broad range of emergency incidents.  The City of Gretna Wastewater Treatment Plant also maintains a 24 hour communications capability with Jefferson Parish OEP officials, as well as area emergency response organizations (i.e. local fire departments, Sheriff's department, State Police, etc.).  Periodic emergency drills are held with the Jefferson Parish OEP and local emergency response organizations.  Refresher training is also provided to local emergency response organizations on the hazards of regulated substances at the site.\n\nJefferson Parish OEP is responsible for maintaining written plans for the preparedness, mitigation, response and recovery of any natural or technological disaster that may occur in Jefferson Parish.

The OEP is also responsible for coordinating the plans and operations of various emergency response agencies in Jefferson Parish such as fire, police, emergency medical services, public works, volunteers and other groups that respond to emergencies. \n\nThe City of Gretna Wastewater Treatment Plant maintains a written emergency response program designed to protect workers, public safety, and the environment. This program consists of policies and procedures for responding to releases, including actions to be taken in the event of a fire, explosion, or chemical release. These procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including first aid and medical treatment, evacuation, personnel accountability plans, notification requirements to Jefferson Parish OEP and the public in the event of a release, post-incident cleanup and area decontamination requirements. In addition, there are procedures that address maintenance, inspection, testing, and use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific response duties.  The emergency response program is updated as needed to address changes to the processes.  The Management of Change process is used to trigger updates to the emergency response plan, including notification and training of personnel affected by the change.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nDiligent compliance with our RMP Prevention Program forms the framework on which we will continue to improve the level of safety at the facility.  Some of the key components of the safety improvements we expect to achieve are as follows:\n\n1. The Management of Change provisions ensure that we consider the potential safety and health impacts of any change we make to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures.\n\n2.

Internal and third party compliance audits will ensure we maintain and increase our level of safety protection.\n\n5. An ongoing dialogue with the Jefferson Parish Emergency Management Director or his designate will ensure a constant state of readiness to respond to any potential emergencies, as well as a means to implement improvements as the need develops.  In this way, we shall bolster our strong commitment to the safety of our workers and the community."
