Post treatment includes disinfecting with Chlorine.\n\nIII.  The worst case release scenario for chlorine would be the failure of a pressurized chlorine cylinder\n     valve, and the sudden release of it's contents (2000lbs) in 10 minutes. The distance would 0.9 miles\n     as determined by the EPA's PMP* Comp.\n\n     The alternative release scenario would be a valve sheared off releasing 2000 pounds of liquid chlorine\n     in 15 minutes.
