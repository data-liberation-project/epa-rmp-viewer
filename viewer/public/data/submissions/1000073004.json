In the event of an emergency, POET Biorefining-North Manchester's Emergency Coordinator will direct internal response activities to the extent they are within the qualifications and capabilities of company personnel, taking reasonable precautions to prevent or minimize the extent of release or the co-mingling of materials.  There is no facility emergency response team.  Employees within their designated work areas will respond to small releases, if such response does not pose a danger to their health or safety.  In the event of a larger release, it is the policy of POET Biorefining-North Manchester to notify the Chester TWP Fire Department, evacuate all employees at the facility, and, if circumstances warrant, mobilize a pre-designated professional hazardous material response team to the site.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program, and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nPOET Biorefining-North Manchester is committed to protection of the environment through the combined use of inspection, maintenance, employee training and response preparation.  Public access to the facility from the highway is restricted by gates.  Much of the property is fenced, limiting vehicle access.  The plant is fully lighted. Personnel are typically on-site 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  There is a multi-camera video surveillance system installed at the property, and a general computer based alarm system.   The alarm system includes monitoring of the storage tanks and denaturant blending system (level control and overfill monitors).  The alarm system is monitored in the control room for abnormal conditions, which trigger visual control panel alarm lights and audible alarms.  All facility denaturant storage tanks have secondary storage containments and are included in the facility Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) Plan.\r\n\r\nFive"

POET Biorefining-North Manchester's main product is denatured ethanol for use as motor vehicle fuel.  Production at the facility was initiated in September 2008.  POET Biorefining-North Manchester produces ethanol using the dry mill method.  Corn meal is mixed with water and a digestive enzyme to produce starch, which is cooked and liquefied.  The resulting mash is cooled and a secondary enzyme is added to convert the liquefied starch to fermentable sugars.  Yeast is added to the mash to ferment the sugars to ethanol.\r\n\r\nThe fermented mash (beer) contains about 20% alcohol and is distilled, then passed through a dehydration system to produce 200-proof anhydrous ethanol.  After final dehydration, the ethanol is collected in two 2,000,000-gallon storage tanks for addition of a denaturant (natural gas condensate, NGC) to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption, per federal and state requirements.  NGC is blended in-line with the ethanol and transferred to vehicles for transport off-site.  The denatured ethanol is shipped from the facility in tank trucks and rail cars.\r\n\r\nChemicals Regulated Under EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Program\r\nPentane concentrations within the NGC denaturant is the only CAPP/RMP regulated chemical which exceeds the CAPP quantity thresholds for applicability of the regulation.  The CAPP/RMP regulated process consists of the NGC denaturant storage tank and the associated blending/transfer equipment and piping.  The denaturant is added to the ethanol to a concentration of 2% to 5%.  The greatest CAPP regulated quantity of denaturant in a tank, vessel or piping system is the quantity in the largest denaturant storage tank, located in the center containment area of the tank farm.  \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\r\nPOET Biorefining-North Manchester is committed to the p"
