      "SummaryText": "At the same site for over 120 years, the facility, now owned and operated by Buffalo Color Corporation (BCC) has been manufacturing dye stuffs to color denim, and a small specialty chemical manufacturing area.  For the last 75+ years , the plant has staffed safety and environmental departments devoted to the tasks of reducing the risk of harm to employees and neighbors, which could arise from operations at the facility.  Since 1981, BCC has been coordinating its emergency response programs  through the use of an Emergency Preparedness Manual, copies of which have been distributed to nearby police, fire, and medical units.  The latest version of this manual, revised to comply with recent federal guidelines, is part of the company's Risk Management Program.  Many elements of the plant's accidental release prevention program were documented in the Process Safety Management system, mandated by OSHA, in 1994.  These have been re-evaluated from the  environmental perspective and are now carried voer into the company's Risk Management Program.  The Worst Case and Alternate Scenarios, are included in this submission.  Butadiene is no longer used at BCC.  During the past 5 years, there have been no reportable incidents related to Formaldehyde."
