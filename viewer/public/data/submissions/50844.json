As part of this plan, the Safety and Training Manager or the Manager of Administration will attend 3 courses offered by the Bureau for further training.

Once data is available for the entire year, a final plan will be prepared by December.

The maximum quantities that can be stored on site are 180,000 pounds of chloroform, 61,000 pounds of ethyl ether, and 42,000 pounds of pentane.  These quantities are approximate values.

Inventory quantities are highly variable, sometimes dropping as low as 45% of the maximum intended inventory.  Although no single vessel may exceed the regulated quantity at a given time, there are enough of these vessels co-located that the regulated quantity could be exceeded in a single release.  These processes are Program 3 processes because public receptors are included within the greatest distance to endpoint indicated by the worst-case scenarios and the processes themselves fall under NAICS code 325199.\n\nIn addition to being subject to the EPA regulation, Tedia complies with OSHA PSM, as well as the RCRA and CERCLA requirements due to the large quantities of hazardous solvents distilled and stored on site.  \n\nTo meet these requirements and to ensure the safety of our employees, Tedia has, and continues to improve, a comprehensive prevention program.  All new employees receive a safety briefing before they enter the work areas.  The initial briefing is followed by in-depth training within 60-days of employment.  General Safety Rules, encompassing everything from safe lifting to proper PPE to spill cleanup procedures, are issued to all employees on their first day, and are emphasized throughout their daily work. Posters throughout the facility and bulletin board postings, including daily safety and housekeeping checks, are a constant reminder to employees of their responsibility in creating a safer workplace for everyone at Tedia.

All facilities that report to the Butler County LEPC in this manner are included in their emergency response plans.  As part of their annual training program, Fairfield Fire Department engine companies and paramedics participate in a familiarization tour of Tedia facilities.  Due to the large quantities of hazardous chemicals stored in its facilities, Tedia employees are not required to attempt to fight fires.   Employee responsibilities in the event of a fire are to safely shutdown all equipment where it can be done without jeopardizing their safety, to evacuate the building by the nearest exit, and to report to the designated rally point.  The alarm used in the Tedia production facility provides internal notification only.  In the event of a fire, the Fairfield Fire Department will be automatically notified whenever the emergency sprinkler system is activated.  As a means of preparing for such an emergency, biannual evacuation drills are held. \n\nTedia believes that its safety posture can always be improved and is involved in several programs to introduce new safety systems and update existing ones.
