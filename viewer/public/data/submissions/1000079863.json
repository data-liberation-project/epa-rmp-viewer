The Union Carbide facilities at South Charleston, Institute, Polyolefins Process Research & Development, and New Yard share leveraged support and management and are collectively called West Virginia Operations (WVO).  \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nWVO is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release should occur, highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also an active member of the Kanawha Putnam Emergency Planning Committee which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe New Yard is used to temporarily store rail cars for eventual processing at the Institute site. The rail yard is managed by West Virginia Operations Site Logistics, but is not considered contiguous with the Institute site. No chemical loading or unloading takes place at the New Yard.\n\n\n\nThere is currently one RMP regulated substances present in one covered process at the facility. UCC stores a threshold quantity of one EPA regulated toxic substance in the New Yard:\n\n?    Ethylene Oxide\n\n\n\nThe maximum inventory quantity of ethylene oxide has stayed the same for the 2019 RMP resubmittal. However, the amount used to model impacts for worst case scenario has increased from 180,000 lb to a conservative number of 184,000 lb of ethylene oxide. This is due to discussions with "

Although the distance to endpoint did not change, an additional public receptor was added to include churches which are within the distance to endpoint for the worst-case scenario and checked the box for toxic worst case scenario to include National or State Parks, Forests or Monuments for the inclusion of Kanawha State Forest, which is within the distance to endpoint.  This change did not occur as a result of an increased distance to endpoint, but rather due to improved mapping tools.\n\n\n\nThe RMPComp tool was utilized to provide distance to endpoint of the toxic worst-case scenario. \n\n\n\nChanges were made to Section 1 to reflect changes in Owner or Operator, person responsible for RMP implementation, Emergency Contact, and Parent Company web site address.\n\n\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nUCC at the New Yard site has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years. Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there have been no accidental releases as defined by the RMP rule of regulated substances, during this period.\n\n\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nUCC's general accident prevention program consists of compliance with the EPA RMP rule, OSHA's PSM standard, and implementation of Dow's Operating Discipline Management System and standards. Key elements include:\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nWe maintain detailed records of safety information that describe the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all covered processes. Examples include, but are not limited to, Material Safety Data Sheets for all the hazardous chemicals, equipment design specification sheets, and reactive chemicals test results. This information is maintained up-to-date and is available to operating personnel.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that ha"

The methodologies used to carry out these analyses may include: Checklists, What If/Checklists (combined), Hazard and Operability Studies (HAZOP's), Reactive Chemical/Process Hazard Analyses, Chemical Exposure Index, Fire & Explosion Index, and Layers of Protection Analyses. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at regular intervals. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, WVO maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nWVO has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Refresher training is provided on a continuing basis.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nWVO carries out a documented Planned Preventative Maintenance Program (PPM) which provides checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes, but is not limited to: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, pumps, and compressors. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWVO"

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and receive training prior to the modification.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted at WVO. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nSelf-assessments and audits are conducted on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. Audits are conducted using established schedules and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nWVO promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a significant release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nWVO believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. UCC employees and contracted employees working in UCC Institute plants are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees and contracted employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\n\n\nCon"
