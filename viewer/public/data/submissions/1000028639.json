      "SummaryText": "Blue Origin operates four liquid hydrogen storage tanks as part of a rocket engine test facility at our West Texas Launch Site.  The liquid hydrogen storage tanks have an aggragate capacity of 69,000 gallons. The maximum total quantity of liquid hydrogen that can be stored on our site is 37,420 pounds.\r\n\r\nThe storage tanks are designed, installed, and operated in accordance with industry standards; specifically, our installation is compliant with CGA (Compressed Gas Association) Standard H-5, Installation Standards for Bulk Hydrogen Supply Systems, and we also followed the guidelines in CGA Standard P-29, Application of OSHA PSM and EPA RMP to the Compressed Gas Industry, to update our Process Safety Management and Risk Management Plans.\r\n\r\nOperation of this process is controlled by approved, written procedures, and conducted by knowledgeable, trained employees. \r\n\r\nBlue Origin is committed to the safe operation of our facilities. Our safety and environmental policies are documented in our Health and Safety Manual which includes elements of process hazard analysis, management of change, accident and illness prevention, hazardous waste management, and hazard communication plans.  A hazardous materials contingency and emergency response plan which includes the process covered by this Risk Management Plan is part of our Health and Safety Manual.\r\n\r\nWe work closely with the local fire departments, and where applicable, the Local Emergency Planning Committees, at all our facilities to ensure communication of hazards present on our facilities, and coordination of emergency response.  We have conducted two drills with local emergency responders to practice and improve emergency response capabilities. Key facility personnel have completed FEMA training on the incident command system to improve coordination with emergency response agencies.\r\n\r\nThere have been no accidents at this facility in the past five years."
