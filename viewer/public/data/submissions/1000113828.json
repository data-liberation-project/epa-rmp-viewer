If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Virden Fire Department, Macoupin County Local\nEmergency Planning Committee or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n     2. The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\n\nThis is an unmanned facility. The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizer for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient. The storage and handling system consists of a 26,000 and a 18,000 gallon storage tanks, loading risers, associated plumbing and nurse tanks. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors. The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 563,620 pounds; this includes the amount of anhydrous ammonia that could be stored in nurse tanks.\n\n   3. The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. This facility has implemented the provisions of the Compressed Gas Association\u0092s (CGA\u0092s) \u0093American National Standard Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\u0094 (6th edition), commonly referred to as \u0093ANSI/CGA G-2.1 2014\u0094, as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". Compliance with these regulations and on-going training of our employees make up our accident release prevention program.\n \n  4. Five year accident history. \n\n There have been no"
