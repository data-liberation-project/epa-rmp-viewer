This release was selected as a practical scenario for emergency response planning purposes.\n\nThe distance to 1 psi overpressure for this scenario was also calculated using equation C-1 from the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  However, a 3% yield factor was used instead of 10%, as recommended in the guidance document.  The distance to a 1 psi overpressure is calculated as 735 feet (0.14 miles) from the source.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nJavelina accident prevention programs encompass four different areas: design, operation, maintenance, and auditing.  The facility is subject to the OSHA PSM regulations, and has developed a program to maintain compliance with those regulations.  Some of the elements of the Javelina accident prevention program are outlined below.\n\n  Designing for Safety\n  -  Materials of construction are chosen to provide mechanical integrity\n  -  Flammable gas and Hydrogen Sulfide monitors provide early warning in case of leaks\n  -  Vessels are equipped with level, pressure, and temperature alarms\n  -  Pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves to prevent overpressure\n\n  Operating Safely\n  -  Operators are trained, tested, and qualified according to Occupational Safety & Health\n     Administration standards\n  -  The process is continually monitored by computerized control systems and operators\n  -  Operational procedures are based on Process Hazards Analyses\n  -  Operators follow approved procedures\n  -  Pre-startup safety reviews are conducted before starting new or significantly modified equipment\n\n  Maintaining the Plant\n  -  Maintenance personnel are trained, experienced, and qualified\n  -  Maintenance personnel are an important part of the plant safety programs\n  -  A work order and permit system is used to control maintenance"

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nJavelina Company has a longstanding commitment to both employee and public safety. Such commitment is demonstrated by the resources that are invested in accident prevention, personnel training, and emergency response preparedness.  Safety is of prime consideration in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of all Javelina processes and equipment. Javelina's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances, and to be prepared to respond quickly and effectively to any releases which may occur.  Detailed procedures designed to fulfill this policy are found in the following documents:\n\n  -  Javelina Company Emergency Plan\n\n  -  Process Safety Management Manual\n\n  -  Safety Procedures Manual\n\n  -  Standard Refinery Procedures Manual\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nJavelina Company is a refinery gas processing plant.  Refinery gas is created during the refining process, and is typically used as a fuel in refinery boilers and heaters.  This gas contains components, such as ethylene, ethane, and hydrogen, which are more valuable as chemical and plastic feedstocks than they are as fuels.  Each of the six refineries in the Corpus Christi area produce this gas, but not in sufficient volumes at each refinery to economically justify the investment needed for a processing facility to separate the components.  The Javelina facility was built in 1989-90 to process gas from the various refineries.  The facility began processing gas from the refineries in late 1990.  \n\nWith all refineries on line, Javelina processes approximately 138 million standard cubic feet per day of refinery off-gas.  From this is produced more than 25,000 barrels of liquid hydrocarbons, including ethylene, ethane, propylene, propane, butane, and natural gasoline, plus 30 million standard cubic feet of hydrogen.  Ethylene and propylene are class"

      "SummaryText": "ified as basic petrochemicals, while ethane, propane, and butane are considered feedstocks.  Pentane, also called natural gasoline, is routed to the refineries for further processing.  Hydrogen is widely used in the chemical and refining industries.\n\nThe Javelina facility does not contain any toxic chemicals listed in 40 CFR '68 above the threshold quantities.  The facility does not store large quantities of regulated flammable substances, but the processing equipment does contain several of the regulated flammable substances above the threshold quantities listed in Table 3 of '68.130.  These substances include butane (mixture of n-butane and isobutane), ethylene, propylene, ethane, propane, hydrogen, and methane.\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\nThe worst case scenario at the Javelina facility involves the release of a mixture of ethane and ethylene from the C2 Splitter.  The C2 Splitter is a fractionation tower designed to separate ethylene from ethane.  It is 276 feet tall, 12= feet in diameter, and contains approximately 280,000 lbs of an ethane/ethylene mixture (30% ethylene, 70% ethane) at maximum liquid height.  For the worst case analysis, this entire quantity was assumed to be released as a vapor over a ten minute period, with a resulting vapor cloud explosion.\n\nAlthough numerous controls are in place to prevent such releases and manage their consequences, no credit was taken for mitigation in evaluating this scenario.  Using the equations from the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance (equation C-1), the distance to 1 psi overpressure is calculated as 2,800 feet (0.53 miles) from the source. \n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nThe alternative release scenario selected for the Javelina facility involves an ethylene leak due to a flange separation on the suction side of the ethylene product pumps.  This leak was assumed to release 16,500 pounds of ethylene over a ten minute period.  Although the ethylene in the plant is a liquid at this point, it was assumed to instant"

      "SummaryText": "Operations personnel will assess the situation and request assistance from Corpus Christi Fire\n      Department and/or Refinery Terminal Fire Company if the situation warrants\n  -  Operations personnel will notify public safety providers and local emergency management who\n      will inform citizens by various means\n  -  Operations personnel will attempt to isolate the source of the release\n  -  If outside assistance has been requested, operations personnel will establish a command center\n      upon arrival of the fire department\n  -  Off-site emergency alarms are activated from the control room if there is any concern that the\n      release will travel beyond the plant fence line\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Javelina accident prevention policies currently in place include provisions to continually review and update those policies as new information becomes available.  Information sources include PHA revalidations, accident (and near-miss) investigations, new regulations, review of incidents at other facilities, etc.  No major changes are currently planned for Javelina's safety policies, but the policies will be continually fine-tuned to minimize the risk to employees and the surrounding community."
