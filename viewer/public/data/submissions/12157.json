      "SummaryText": "The Elementis Pigments Inc. East St. Louis plant has been at 2001 Lynch Avenue since the early 1900s.  The plant produces inorganic pigments and specialty barium sulfate intermediate chemical products.  The East St. Louis facility has only one hazardous chemical above the threshold quantity, ammonia.  This is used in a single chemical process.  One outdoor storage tank, capable of holding 70,000 pounds of ammonia, provides the chemical to two process reactors.  The ammonia is used in acidic iron oxide solutions to precipitate solid iron oxide.  Iron oxide is commonly known as rust.  The iron oxide produced at the East St. Louis facility is used primarily as pigment in the manufacturing of paints and construction coatings.  No releases of ammonia have occured over the past five-year period.\n    Chemical safety for all employees and nearby residents is of paramount importance.  Prevention of accidents and assurance of safety is maintained by developing and implementing safe operating procedures, training employees, preventive maintenance and sound engineering.  Every employee has been issued their own personal Safety Manual covering all aspects of plant safety, including emergency response.  All employees have received thorough training on each section in the manual.  Supervisors in charge of continuous plant operations have been given additional first response training.  The Safety Manual specifically describes the actions to be taken in case of any plant emergency including contact of outside agencies.  Additionally, the plant has recently revised the Emergency Management Manual.  This manual was prepared to provide a useful framework for coping with a wide variety of emergencies that could occur at the East St. Louis facility.  Daily, supervisors start each shift with a safety talk.  Weekly, supervisors cover selected topics in five-minute safety awareness presentations.  Monthly, plant wide safety meetings are held, and are open to all plant employees to discuss safe"

      "SummaryText": "ty-related issues and concerns.  Annually, every employee receives eight hours of refresher safety training.  Ammonia safety is further covered in an additional manual to detail installations, engineering and maintenance.  \n    The storage tanks and piping systems are designed to safely handle ammonia storage and transportation to and from the tank.  The design pressure for the system is 250 psi, though pressures above 150 psi are seldom used.  Excess flow valves on all pipe connections at the storage vessel protect the system from large accidental releases.  Relief valves prevent an unanticipated pressure build up in the storage tank as well as in the piping system.  Ammonia sensors at the storage tank monitor ammonia concentration in the air surrounding the tank.  An alarm is sounded at the elevated levels to alert operators to ammonia leakage.  A water deluge system is automatically activated at higher levels to reduce or eliminate the effects of an ammonia leak at the storage tank.  \n    Elementis recognizes preventive maintenance as an effective means of providing safety.  Ammonia policy requires excess flow valves to be replaced every two years.  The East St. Louis facility believes the excess flow valves are key safety components in the system and changing them regularly provide the best assurance that only minimal amounts of ammonia will be released should a break in the piping system occur.  Experience indicates new excess flow valves insure optimum performance in an emergency situation.  Every five years the pressure vessel is emptied, tank thickness is verified, weld integrity checked, pressure relief valves replaced, and all piping inspected.  All defective material is replaced before putting the system back in operation.  Active safety systems are also inspected regularly to assure proper operation. \nThe active water deluge system is designed to control large accidental releases at the tank and prohibit ammonia gas from leaving plant property.  Currently, Ele"

      "SummaryText": "mentis is permitted to use only 1500 pounds of ammonia per day by our wastewater treatment facility.   As a result, only one delivery of ammonia is received per month.  Consequently, much of the time there is far less than 70,000 pounds of ammonia on hand.  The tank is normally filled to three quarter capacity, fifty to sixty thousand pounds, further limiting potential release quantities.  Self-contained breathing apparatus are strategically placed through out the plant to allow access to the necessary valves to properly isolate the system should a break occur.  Five-minute air packs are available to allow employees to safely exit areas that may be subjected to an ammonia release.  \nThe worst case scenario selected by Elementis closely simulates completely severing a two-inch diameter pipeline, the largest pipe size in the system.  The scenario assumes both the excess flow valve and the deluge systems fail.  The worst case also assumes the storage tank is full.  The entire chain of events is remotely possible.  The scenario could effect sites up to 3.1 miles from the facility according to OCA guidelines.  \nThe alternate scenario case provided is more likely to occur.  The alternate scenario assumes a half-inch diameter hole occurs in a pipe or the storage tank.  Completely losing a half-inch relief valve would resemble this case.  The alternate also assumes the deluge system fails.  The alternate scenario indicates locations up to nearly a quarter mile may be effected by such a release.  Prevailing winds would likely keep this release within the plant boundaries."
