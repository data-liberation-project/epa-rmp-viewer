This information is stored with the Inspection and Testing Department. \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis \n\nSinclair Wyoming Refining Company has a comprehensive analysis program to ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Each process unit is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage those hazards. \n\nSinclair Wyoming Refining Company uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.
