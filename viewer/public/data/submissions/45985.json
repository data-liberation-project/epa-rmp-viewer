Wayne Fire Dept., which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of a release.\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nThe Brenntag \u00bf Ft. Wayne facility\u00bfs primary activities encompass distribution of chemical products.  There are currently two regulated substances present at the facility.  These substances include chlorine, and sulfur dioxide (anhydrous).  The sulfur dioxide, and chlorine are received prepackaged in different size containers.  Chlorine, and sulfur dioxide, are materials only handled for resell to customers.  The maximum inventory of chlorine at the facility is 30,000 pounds.  Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous), is present at the facility in quantities of 10,000 pounds.\n\n3.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe Brenntag \u00bf Ft. Wayne facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with the NFPA 30 -1996 Standard.\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is currently in place at the stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nBrenntag \u00bf Ft. Wayne maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nBrenntag \u00bf Ft. Wayne conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with the distribution processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is     \u00bfWHAT IF\u00bf  The studies are undert"
