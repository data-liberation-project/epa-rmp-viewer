      "SummaryText": "The Hy-Vee Perishables Center's approach to chemical safety is to prevent a release of anhydrous ammonia from the refrigeration system that has a potential of causing harm to the public and the environment. This is accomplished through training, maintence of the systems, and by following company policies, as well as state and federal requirements. The Hy-Vee Perishables Center has chosen to comply with the Environmental Protection Agency's 40 CFR Part 68 - Chemical Accident Prevention Rule to prevent a catastrophic release of ammonia into the community. Additionally, senior management meets on a regular basis to review their commitment to safety, compliance, and implementation of safe procedures.\n\nThe Hy-Vee Perishables Center, located in Chariton, Iowa is a grocery products storage and distribution facility that contains refrigerated areas. The refrigerated areas are cooled by an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system. Anhydrous ammonia, a substance regulated by the EPA, is one of the most economical refrigerants available. However, the properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions while operating the refrigeration system to prevent employee exposure, and to reduce the threat of exposure to nearby members of the community. In order to observe these safety precautions, Hy-Vee Perishables Center follows the EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Rule, Program Level 3.  The amount of ammonia estimated to be contained inside the 3 refrigeration systems totals 30,000 lbs.  The 30, 000 lbs is divided over 3 systems.  The worst case is based off of the Produce system which is the largest system containing 14, 000 lbs.\nIn addition to complying with the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, applicable state codes and regulations are met to help prevent a catastrophic release of ammonia. The ammonia refrigeration system has been constructed according to the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration guidelines (IIAR). The operators of th"

Hy-Vee, Inc. also contracted Industrial Consultants, LLC to perform audits of the Process Safety Management (PSM) Program for the ammonia refrigeration system at the Hy-Vee Perishables Center. The purpose of the audits and audit report is to assist in complying with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals. Hy-Vee Perishables Center is required to comply with this regulation due to the use of anhydrous ammonia in a refrigeration system in excess of the threshold quantity (10,000 pounds).\nAn Emergency Response Program has been established for the Hy-Vee Perishables Center. Elements of that program include, but are not limited to the following. Annual Emergency Responder training and certification of employees on the HAZMAT teams; emergency evacuation drills and mock release scenerios practiced annually; Emergency Response Program information shared with local fire department, hospital, law enforcement, and Lucas County LEPC; written procedures established for known and unknown ammonia leaks; contact lists of emergency response personnel.\n\nThe Hy-Vee Perishables Center has experienced one ammonia release in the past 5 years.  Around 12:00 a.m. on May 2, 2007 an ammonia cloud was reported rising form the storm drain near the ice plant.  Procedures were initiated to shut down the ice makers and ammonia compressors in the ice plant.  Upon further investigation, it was noted that the leak appeared to be coming from the roof of the ice plant.  The leak was found to be coming from a 2 inch, low pressure, liquid ammonia line that had been added for the expansion of the ice makers.  The 2 inch line had a steady stream of liquid ammonia flowing out of it.  Using the training and skills acquired, 2 responders donned air-purifying respirators and chemical resistant"

Once the valve was shut, the flow of the liquid began to diminish to a drip and eventually stopped completely around 1:00 a.m., limiting the total leak to 1 hour and a loss of around 1653 lbs of ammonia. \n \nAfter the leak was stopped, the exhaust fans were started in the Ice Plant engine room to evacuate the smell of ammonia.  After the determination was made that the loss was more than 100lbs in 24 hours, reports were made to the EPA and DNR.  All cleanup and decontamination was done.  There were not any injuries as a result of this incident.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety at the Hy-Vee Perishables Center include continued review of the PSM program and RMP, and addressing issues where applicable. Additional training is also planned for key individuals on the applications of managing the PSM program and RMP."
