The City recognize the importance of preventing releases of chlorine and sulfur dioxide into the environment and therefore have designed a plan of action to prevent releases and have written it's plan in Manuel \"Standard Operating Procedures for Chemical Spills and Chemical Releases\".  This plan was designed to have a road map to manage and control all release.\n\nThe responsibility of responding to releases at the cities four plants lay with the Hazardous Material Response Team from The Huntsville Fire Department.
