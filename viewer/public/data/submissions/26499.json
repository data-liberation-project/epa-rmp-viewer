Founded in 1924, Univar USA Inc. supplies the food industry, chemical compounders, pharmaceuticals, mining, forest products, oil and gas producers, electronics, coatings and many other key industries with the chemical raw materials required to produce or refine products used in numerous end-use markets.\n\nUnivar USA Inc. is a member of the National Association of Chemical distributors (NACD) and complies with the Responsible Distribution Process (RDP), an environmental, health and safety improvement initiative.\n\nSome of the products stored and handled by Univar USA Inc. are subject to EPA's Risk Management Program rule (40 CFR Part 68).  A key requirement of this rule is the preparation and submission of an RMP Plan, contained herein.  The contents of the RMP Plan are prescribed by EPA, including this Executive Summary.\n\nCORPORATE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE APPROACH\n\n1. Prevention Program\n\nProcesses that are subject to OSHA's Process Safety management (PSM ) standard AND are regulated under EPA's RMP rule are subject to the Program 3 Prevention program.  Univar USA Inc. has documented the Prevention Program in its Process Safety Management Manual.  Briefly, this program includes provisions and requirements for:\n\n* Process Safety Information\n* Process Hazard Analysis\n* Operating Procedures\n* Training\n* Mechanical Integrity\n* Management of Change\n* Pre-Startup Review\n* Compliance Audits\n* Incident Investigation\n* Employee Participation\n* Hot Work permits\n* Contractors\n\n\n\n2. Emergency Response Approach\n\nUnivar USA Inc. has an Emergency Contingency Plan in place.  This Plan is shared with local emergency responders who have access to Univar USA Inc. facility personnel.  VW&R responds to minor incidents but will call in professional emergency responders in the event of all other incidents.\n\nUnivar USA Inc  invites and encourages l"

Joint emergency exercises are conducted when possible.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE\n\nThe Altoona Pennsylvania site stores, handles and delivers a variety of hazardous and non-hazardous chemical products to wholesale customers in Pennsylvania and  Maryland. .  Prepackaged cylinders of Chlorine solution are handled at inventory levels above the threshold planning quantity of 2500 lbs. The typical inventory level for chlorine is 92,500 lbs. in cylinders. Prepackaged containers of sulfur dioxide are handled at inventory levels above the threshold planning quantity of 5000 lbs. The typical inventory level for sulfur dioxide is 55,800 lbs. in cylinders. \n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe Worst-Case Toxic Release Scenario for the site would involve a total container failure with a release of 2000 lbs of chlorine  according to the EPA proscribed release protocol. This would result in a release of 2000 pounds of chlorine in 10 minute time period. Air dispersion modeling projects an affected area and distance to endpoint of approximately 7.4 miles. An additional  Worst-Case Toxic  Release Scenario would involve a total container failure with a release of 2000 lbs of sulfur dioxide.  Air dispersion modeling projects an affected area and distance to endpoint of approximately 7.4 miles.\n\nALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIO(S)\n\nThe Alternate Case Release Scenario for toxics would involve a total container failure with a release of 150 lbs of chlorine. Air dispersion modeling projects an affected area and distance to endpoint of .43 miles. A second  Alternate Case Release Scenario would involve a total container failure with a  release of 150 lbs  of sulfur dioxide. Air dispersion modeling projects an affected area and distance to endpoint of .43 miles.\n\n\nGENERAL PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nAs outlined previously, Univar USA "

Employee training and operating procedures.\n3. Employee release detection and mitigation activities.\n4. Equipment and containers designed to meet appropriate regulatory guidelines  \n\nACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe site has experienced no accidents as specified in 40 CFR Part 68 related to the containerized storage of chlorine or sulfur dioxide in the previous 5 years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nAn emergency contingency plan has been prepared and made available to local emergency response agencies. Blair County Emergency Planning Committee is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.  A contract has been formalized with Clean Harbors Inc, an emergency response contractor to provide on site and off site emergency response services in the event of a release.\n\n\n"
