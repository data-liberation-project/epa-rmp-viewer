This regulation is published in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 68.\n\nWe have one regulated substance, chlorine, which is above the threshold quantity as specified in Section 68.130 of 40 CFR Part 68; therefore we must comply with the RMP program. This program provides our facility with the integrated approach to identifying and managing the hazards posed by chlorine. Under this program, our facility has assessed and continues to assess hazards to determine how accidental releases can impact the public health and environment.\n\nLike the majority of municipal wastewater treatment plants in the United States, gaseous chlorines is used at the UF WRF facility to destroy pathogenic organisms in the treated wastewater before its reuse. The same properties that make chlorine valuable as a disinfectant also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling chlorine as a safeguard to our workers, our community and the environment.\n\nThe UF Physical Plant Division?s commitment at the UF WRF facility is to store, handle and use chlorine to achieve the needed benefits of disinfection while minimizing both onsite and off-site risks. This is accomplished by designing a safe process, maintaining the process, operating safely, and training the operators. The UF WRF also has three chlorine detectors in the chlorine storage room and an emergency chlorine scrubber which will activate automatically in case if release and neutralize the storage room? s air before emitting to the atmosphere. Our commitment to safety is demonstrated in the fact that ov"

The University has also registered the process with the Florida Department of Community Affairs in Tallahassee, the lead agency for RMP Program 3 enforcement in Florida.\n\nManagement System\n\nThe management system at our facility oversees the implementation of the RMP element. The plant superintendent is responsible for the development, implementation, and integration of the RMP elements. He requires adherence to the risk prevention program, arranges for periodic compliance audits, updates to process hazard analyses, updates process safety information to keep the program current, and delegates the day-to-day responsibility of the various program components according to job type. For example, the management of change program is the responsibility of operators who might change out process equipment; plant operators are responsible for ensuring that the process operating procedures and training are revised to reflect such change in equipment.\n\nHazard Assessment\n\nOur written hazard assessment program evaluates the impact of significant accidental releases on the public health and environment and develops a history of such releases including:\n\nOffsite Consequence Parameters: The off-site consequence parameters are the factors that define the offsite significance of the worst-case and alternative scenarios. For toxic substances, the most significant parameters are the endpoint specified in the regulation for each toxic substance, the release rate for each scenario, and the meteorological data that determines the distance will travel before it reaches the designated endpoint. For chlorine, the endpoint is defined at a concentration of 0.0087 mg/l, which has been determined by a national"

The release rate for the worst-case scenario is specified by rule as a chlorine cylinder being released over a 10-minute period, while the release rate in the alternative (more realistic) scenario is based on the release from a lead washer leak over a 30-minute period.\n\nThe EPA default meteorological conditions were used for the worst-case and alternate scenarios to arrive at a distance to endpoint, which is the radius of the circle of impact used to identify potential human and environmental receptors.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario: The following summarizes the worst-case scenarios of substance release at our facility:\n-    Release of 2000 pounds of chlorine (entire cylinder) over a 10 minute period.\n-    Release occurs in open air\n-    The wind speed is 1.5 meters/sec., and the atmospheric stability class is ?F?, which is very stable and therefore able to carry a gas release the greatest distance.\n-    The distance to the chlorine endpoint of 0.0087mg/l is estimated by RMP Comp to be 0.9 miles from the release.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario: The following summarizes the alternative release scenarios for a substance release at our facility:\n-    Release of chlorine gas around a lead washer used to seat the yoke to the cylinder.\n-    Gas detection and alarm, and Gainesville Fire Department response leading to the leak being fixed, is conservatively estimated to occur within 30 minutes from the time the release occurs.\n-    The wind speed is 3.0 meters/sec. and the atmospheric stability class is ?D? which is a moderately stable atmosphere that provides some chlorine gas dispersion.\n-    The distance to the chlorine endpoint of 0.0087 mg/l is estimated by RMP Comp to be less than 0.1 mile from the release.\n\nAnalysis Review and Updates: The consequences analysis will be updated whenever there is a change in the chlorine process, or changes in chemical quantities handled or stored.

The following paragraphs provide a brief summary of each element and its function in the overall risk prevention program at the University of Florida WRF:\n\nProcess Safety information: Prior to conducting any process hazard analysis, our facility compiles written process safety information regarding process chemicals, technology, and equipment. The purpose of compiling this material is to enable our employees to identify and understand the potential hazards of processes that involve highly hazardous chemicals.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis: Our facility has developed an orderly, and systematic approach for identifying, evaluating, and controlling processes that involve highly hazardous chemicals, in addition, at least one team member is knowledgeable of the specific process, hazard analysis methodology being used. We have performed an initial process hazard analysis (hazard evaluation) at our facility.\n\nOperating Procedures: The standard operating procedures at our facility provide clear instruction for a covered process.

We have also established and implemented written procedures to maintain the on-going mechanical integrity of our process equipment. In addition, we insure that frequency of our mechanical inspections is consistent with applicable manufacturer?s recommendations and that each test and/or inspection is thoroughly documented.\n\nPre-Start-up Review: The pre-start-up reviews conducted at our facility prior to the introduction of highly hazardous chemicals into a process, all construction and equipment is in accordance with design specifications. We also insure that the training of each employee involved in operating a process is complete, and that all safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and are deemed to be adequate.\n\nCompliance Audits: Our compliance audits evaluate the effectiveness of our compliance with the risk management program, identify any deficiencies and ensure that corrective actions are implemented in a timely manner.

We have established an emergency action plan which provided procedures for planning and responding to a release of a highly hazardous chemical. UF WRF operators are provided with annual safety training that includes a review of the emergency response plan. The emergency response plan covers all aspects of emergency response including escape procedures and route, procedures for post evacuation employee accounting, notification procedures, rescue and medical duties, and response procedures for spills and leaks.
