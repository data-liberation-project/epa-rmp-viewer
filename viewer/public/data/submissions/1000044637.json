      "SummaryText": "Berkeley Farms, LLC processes milk products. The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant to\n\nmaintain the proper temperature of products within the facility. Anhydrous ammonia is an effective\n\nrefrigerant that has been used for many years by most food processing facilities. Ammonia is normally a gas\n\nat ambient temperatures, but is handled as a gas liquified under pressure. The refrigeration system consists\n\nof a high-pressure receiver, evaporative condensers, compressors, process air handlers, glycol chillers, low\n\npressure receiver, pumps, piping, and valves.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies: Berkeley Farms, LLC is committed to\n\npromoting safety for the plant, its employees and the surrounding area. The facility is complying with OSHA'\n\nProcess Safety Management Standard(PSM), Title 29 Code of Fedral Regulations (CFR)1910.119, and EPA's\n\nRisk Management Program regulations (RMP), Title 40CFR Part 68. The purpose of these programs is to\n\nensure that the refrigeration system is operated safely in order to prevent releaqses of Ammonia from the\n\nsystem. In addition, these programs serve to develop procedures to minimize releases in the event that they\n\ndo occur and to outline appropriate emergency response steps to take in the event of a release.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario: EPA's \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia\n\nRefrigeration\"(November 1998) and the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration's (IIAR) Risk\n\nManagement Guidelines (1998) were the primary documents used to develop the worst case release\n\nscenario. The worst case release is one that is unlikely to occur. The purpose of the worst case release\n\nanalysis is to support a dialogue with the community on release prevention. It is a conservative analysis and\n\nis not to serve as a rational basis for actual emergency response planning.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and chemical-specific Prevention Steps: As a part of its PSM Program\n\nBerkeley "

      "SummaryText": "Farms, Inc. Has established numerous programs that serve to prevent accidental releases of\n\nammonia.\n\nThese programs include:\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nTraining\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nManagement of Change\n\nPre-Startup Review\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nIncident Investigations\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nHot Work Permits\n\nContractor Safety\n\nEmergency Response Information: As part of the PSM program, the facility maintains an Emergency\n\nResponse Plan that was prepared in order to improve responsiveness to an emergency incident, and to\n\nincrease the reliability of actions taken during an incident. The plan includes all aspects of emergency\n\nresponse including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations notification of local emergency\n\nresponse agencies as well as the public.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the ammonia system, it is policy of the facility to request assistance as\n\nnecessary by calling 911 which will notify the Hayward Fire Department. In addition, the Hayward Fire\n\nDepartment has included Berkeley Farms, LLC in its local emergency response planning.\n\nFive-Year Accident History: Berkeley Farms, LLC has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases\n\nover the last 5 years. Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release\n\nduring this period.\n\nSteps to Improve Safety: Several Developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the\n\nvarious elements of our accidental release prevention program. Revised Standard Operating Procedures,\n\nupdated Emergency Response Plan, and a renewed emphasis on training are some of the major steps taken\n\nto improve safety. Changes in our program have been implemented by Berkeley Farms, LLC.\n\nIn addition, the facility will seek to operate and maintain our refrigeration system in accordance wit IIAR\n\nGuidance and will continue to implement its OSHA PSM Program in conjunction with the Risk Management\n\nProgram."
