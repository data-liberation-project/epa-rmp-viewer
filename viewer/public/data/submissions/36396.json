Facility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\nThe primary activities at the New Martinsville facility are the manufacture of polyurethane intermediates and iron oxide pigments.  The polyurethane intermediates include aromatic isocyanates like toluene diisocyanate.  Polyether and polyester polyols are also produced.  The New Martinsville facility uses or stores eight of the RMP listed chemicals on the site as of June 11, 2004.  Of the eight chemicals covered, five are raw materials, one is an intermediate, one is a finished product, and one is a neutralizing agent for a safety system.  All eight chemicals were modeled using worst case release parameters as a screening exercise to determine the worst case scenario for the facility.  Phosgene was determined to be the worst case scenario chemical followed in order of potential off-site impact by ethylene oxide, chlorine, formaldehyde, ammonia, propylene oxide, ethylene diamine, and toluene dissocyanate.\n\n3.

      "SummaryText": "New Martinsville facility is the rupture of a phosgene solution vessel. Because of the low storage temperature and the solution concentration, the release to the atmosphere occurs through evaporation from a pool.   Using dispersion modeling (PHAST Software), this results in an endpoint distance  that reaches offsite receptors. This release assumes no mitigation other than containment in a dike.\n\n4.  Alternative Release Scenarios\nAlternative Scenarios were developed for all of the RMP chemicals. The alternative scenario for phosgene has the largest potential impact distance of the group. In this scenario it is assumed a leak of 50% phosgene solution develops from the phosgene solution feed system, and is released into the diked area.  However, mitigation limits the release of phosgene to the atmosphere.  Mitigation in this case includes immediate activation of the steam ammonia curtain, and isolation of the line and neutralization of the solution in the dike within 20 minutes.  Under typical weather conditions as suggested in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance the distance to the endpoint reaches offsite receptors.\n\n5.  Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe New Martinsville Plant complies with all elements of the OSHA PSM Rule and the EPA RMP Rule.  There are safety procedures, standard operation emergency procedures, accident investigations, hot work and line opening permits, extensive training programs, on-site emergency response teams, vessel inspection programs, and experienced personnel both in the salaried and hourly workforce.  Bayer is active in phosgene safety initiatives including a corporate phosgene safety committee, Bayer worldwide phosgene safety committee, and is an active member of the ACC Phosgene Safety Panel that deals with phosgene safety issues on an industry-wide basis.\n\n6.

A liquid ethylene oxide release within the plant resulted in an OSHA Recordable Accident in 2000.  The release totalled 100 pounds. There has never been any offsite impact from the New Martinsville facility resulting from the release of chemicals listed in the rule. \n\n7.  Facility Emergency Response Program\nThe New Martinsville facility Emergency Response System consists of volunteer emergency response teams scheduled on each rotating shift.  There are 112 emergency response team members.  They receive four hours on-site training monthly as well as off-site training in specialized subjects, such as fire fighting, rescue, incident command and Hazmat.  An E-Team organization provides secondary support and is staffed by Technical and Managerial Personnel.  The E-Team's main function is to assist and advise the Emergency Response Teams and communicate with outside agencies.  The plant belongs to an industrial mutual aid group called NORIMAC (Northern Ohio River Industrial Mutual Aid Council) that provides mutual aid between the various industries, government agencies, and service organizations in the area.  Community warning sirens are placed in residential areas within 2 miles of the plant and have been in operation, as part of the CAER program, for more than twenty years."
