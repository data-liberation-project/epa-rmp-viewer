Subsequently, equipment and operational techniques have evolved that ensure the process is carried out with very little risk to employees and the public.  The mechanical systems in place are \"State of the art\" for our industry.  Systems are in place which include training of operators, continuous electronic montitoring devices, routine inspection by our operators as well third party inspection and maintenance performed by a qualified contractor performed at 60 day intervals.  We have implemented OSHA PSM standards at the facility as well.  The process draws chlorine gas from ton cylinders by generating a vacuum.  In the event of a failure in any of the application equipment the vacuum is lost and chlorine gas flow stops.  Electrical interlocking of application equipment ensures that unless all process function properly, gas is not allowed to leave the manifold.  In addition, electronic sensors, located in areas adjacent to the point of application and the storage room will sound an alarm and shut the system down should chlorine be detected in the atmosphere.\n   Cereal Food Processors has an emergency action plan in place in the event of a Chlorine release.  Our position regarding response is to defer to our LEPC, as they are the appropriate personnel to respond to a catastrophic release.  It is our policy to respond by calling 911.  The 911 dispach will notify the fire department, which includes the HAZMAT team.  The fire departments' HAZMAT Team Leader will act as the site coordinator.  The fire department will coordinate with other public agencies and conduct public notification and evacuation if necessary.  The HAZMAT tem is familiar with our ton containers and ancillary mitigation devices.  Cereal Food Processors will notify CHLOREP and EPA National Response Center initially, then follow up when th"

As a result of the 6/08/99 incident the chlorinating system was improved to include the aforementioned mitigation devices. \n   Cereal Food Processors operates an internal program we call our Continuous Improvement Program.
