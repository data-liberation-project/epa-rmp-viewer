This internal policy affirms our commitment to abide by the nine Guiding Principles of NACD Responsible Distribution. \n\nCCI has a Corporate Social Responsibility Program approved and signed by senior management. Besides the areas of human rights, labor and anti-corruption, this program also puts focus on CCI\u0092s corporate social responsibility regarding the environment. There are three main commitments to this section are to: \n\u0095\tSupport a precautionary approach to environmental challenges.\n\u0095\tUndertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility.\n\u0095\tEncourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies.\n\n\nAccidental release prevention - \nAccidental release of chemicals is mitigated by ongoing employee training, strict inventory practices, standard operating procedures, detailed maintenance practices, and systems to control processes. Emergency response activities are addressed in multiple documents, both developed by the facility and developed jointly with cooperating agencies.  These activities are reinforced by ongoing training, by the related day-to-day experience entailed in basic CCI operations, and by the many inspections and audits to which CCI is subjected by local, state, and federal government agencies, insurance companies, and customers.\n\nEmergency Response Policies - \nCCI maintains a Hazmat Team of 12 employees, including participation from all operating departments and all employee levels.

Training is provided by a variety of resources. They may include one or more of the following: third party training professionals, online courses, and in-house classroom sessions. Training is also supplemented with hands on experience along with appropriate response information regarding new chemicals or procedures.  The on-site CCI Hazmat Team can handle most releases. There is the potential for significant incidents that are beyond the scope of our internal hazmat team, and aid would be sought from professional hazmat response services. \nThere have been no incidents for which outside assistance was needed in the past five years.\n\nFacility - \nThe entire CCI production/warehouse/office facility is served with a ESFR sprinkler system.  The flammables area has an AR-AFFF foam system.  The fire suppression system includes an on-site 190,000-gallon fire water reservoir and a large emergency generator for the facility's fire pump.  Warehouses are completely contained, designed to hold both the stored chemicals and fire suppression system water.  Flammables storage areas are served with floor trenches leading to double wall underground concrete holding tanks.  Production areas are served with floor trenches leading to collection sumps and the wastewater neutralization system.  Storm drains are completely separate, and are covered in a WDNR \"No Exposure\" certification. \n\nThe CCI facility is approximately 1 mile from the Columbus Fire Department, the Lifestar emergency medical services, and the Columbus Police Department.  The hospital, emergency room, and clinic of Prairie Ridge Health are two miles away.  Dodge County Emergency Management is in the vicinity, as are the resources of Madison and the surrounding area. \n\nRegulated Substances - \nThe storage process included in the worst-case toxic scenari"

      "SummaryText": "o is a nominal 5400 gallon dedicated 37% hydrochloric acid tank located in a concrete containment inside the production building.  The tank is normally empty.  Approximately once a week, the facility receives a tank truck of 45,000 pounds of 37% hydrochloric acid.  CCI packages the 37% hydrochloric acid into intermediate bulk containers (IBCs), 55-gallon drums (drums), and other containers of many sizes in a specially designed acid/base packaging room. The flow of the 37% hydrochloric acid from the tank truck to the packaging stations in the facility's dedicated acid room is through the dedicated 37% hydrochloric acid tank.  The usual sequence of packaging the 37% hydrochloric acid is to connect the tank truck to the interior dedicated hydrochloric acid piping leading to the hydrochloric acid tank, and then to begin unloading the 37% hydrochloric acid into the tank.  While unloading of the tank truck continues, the 37% hydrochloric acid is pumped from the tank, which serves as a flow-through process vessel, to the packaging stations in the dedicated acid/base room.  Packaging proceeds while the remaining contents of the tank truck flow through the tank.  Depending on the details of the packaging orders, the tank truck is usually emptied in from 2-6 hours.  The tank is usually empty at the end of the initial run and any subsequent packaging runs, in part because each tank truck load of 37% hydrochloric acid constitutes a separate lot, and mixing of different lots needs to be avoided.\nBecause of certain recently changed conditions, including transportation challenges, severe hotter/colder weather, component supply challenges, and personnel considerations, a somewhat different procedure may sometimes be necessary.  The entire contents of the tank truck may need to be unloaded into the tank before any packing occurs.  If that happens, and assuming that the tank truck contained a full load, the tank will then contain more than the RMP threshold quantity 37% hydrochloric"

      "SummaryText": "acid. \nEven without this tank, the Hydrochloric acid is contained in smaller sized vessels in a co-located manner that surpass the threshold quantity in our storage warehouse.\n\nOther chemicals included in the storage process are all stored in a co-located manner. Essentially, these chemicals meet or exceed the threshold while being stored in multiple vessels (usually IBCs, drums and bottles) in a single storage area.\nThese include:\nAmmonium Hydroxide (Ammonia - conc. 20% or greater) - packaged in IBC totes, 55-gallon drums, and bottles directly from the tanker truck. Maximum quantity in a single vessel is 3000 pounds. \nEthyl Ether \u0096 These are delivered in 55 gallon drums, and are relabeled or down-packed into smaller vessels. Maximum quantity in a single vessel is 320 pounds.\nHydrofluoric Acid (conc. 50% or greater) - Delivered in 55-gallon drums, and down-packed into smaller vessels. Maximum quantity in a single vessel is 520 pounds.                                        \n\nInvolvement with community emergency response\nMost CCI employees, including most of the Hazmat Team members, live in the Columbus area.  In July 2014 CCI hosted a regional emergency response exercise with 14 participating agencies and 2 TV stations.  The scenario included a tornado causing injuries, structural damage, and spills of 37% hydrochloric acid both inside and outside the building.  A detailed report was prepared under the auspices of Wisconsin Emergency Management.  Another exercise is being planned for 2023.\n\nDue to the sophistication of the CCI fire suppression systems and the frequent inspections by the Columbus Fire Department, CCI has hosted area fire departments for part of their training programs, especially for the volunteer fire fighters.  CCI has supported local causes, and often has been visited by elected officials."
