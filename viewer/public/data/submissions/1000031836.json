      "SummaryText": "Solo Cup Company, located at 1550 Wrightsboro Road in Augusta, manufactures disposable food containers including those consisting of polystyrene foam.  This foam production process uses Difluoroethane (CAS # 75-37-6).\n\n\n\nSolo Cup is dedicated to the safety of our employees and our community.  Our corporate safety policy reinforces Solo's commitment to providing a safe environment for our employees and our neighboring community.\n\n\n\nThe Solo cup plant occupies 350,000 square feet of space on a 15 acre lot.\n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario listed depicts the release of 45,642 lbs of difluroethane.  RMP Comp software was used to model this release.  There is potential for offsite impact.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario depicts a 2 hour release of difluoroethane.  This estimated release is based on the accidental release that occurred on 13 Feb. 2007 but with a higher release rate and shorter duration.  The additional automatic and administrative system controls on the system will initiate response that justifies the scenario duration.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program includes coordination with local emergency response.  Our emergency response plan includes notification procedures, emergency contacts, etc.  Employees are trained on emergency response annually.\n\n\n\nSafety training at Solo Cup is an ongoing process.  Safety review and evaluation is part of our company's day to day operations.\n\n"
