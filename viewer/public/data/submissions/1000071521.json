      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary:\n\nAirgas USA, LLC operates a propane storage/filling facility with 62 employees in Rockford, IL. The facility is manned 17 hours per day. The Rockford propane process receives product by propane transport truck that is stored onsite in two (2) bulk storage vessels (108,000 lbs / 30,000 gallons each) before being transferred into gas cylinders then distributed to customers. Cylinders containing between 20 and 100 lbs of propane are filled on a daily basis. Each is weighed after filling, increasing operational safety.\n\n\n\nRegulated Chemical:\n\nPropane stored and transferred on site is listed as a highly hazardous chemical under the EPA Risk Management Plan (RMP), and OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations. The Airgas Rockford, IL onsite inventory of propane is in excess of 10,000 pounds making the propane process and its connected equipment a PSM/RMP covered process.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nThe highly flammable and hazardous nature of propane in the process makes it necessary for Airgas to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human and environmental exposure and to reduce the potential threat to personnel and nearby members of the community. Airgas' policy is to comply with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations. This Executive Summary sets forth some of the management systems in place to implement the accidental release and prevention program. Airgas has also implemented specific chemical prevention steps to help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors. The following examples of the types of safety features in place: (1) Release Mitigation - Emergency stop buttons to isolate propane sources; personal protective equipment (protective outerwear clothing, intrinsically safe devices, safety glasses, shoes, etc.) (2) System Integrity - Automatic control and manual valves that provides isol"

Employees are trained on\n\nand provided access to the Propane process safety information. Specific actions an\n\nemployee can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in the Employee\n\nParticipation plan. Forms of participation include being part of a PHA, a PSSR, and/or being\n\ninvolved in incident investigation. Employees participate in monthly safety meetings where process\n\nsafety issues are discussed and corrective actions are developed, and they are involved in the\n\nreview of the covered process operating procedures annually to ensure they are current, accurate\n\nand recommend any necessary changes.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\n\nAirgas keeps a variety of technical documents onsite and in the company's electronic document\n\ncontrol system that are used to help maintain safe operation of its processes. These documents\n\naddress chemical properties and associated hazards, equipment design/configuration information,\n\nspecific chemical inventories and operation limits for key process parameters - all key information for\n\noperating the process safely. Process operators are trained to operate the process using process\n\ncontrols and instrumentation within these safe operating limits.\n\nThe Facility Manager is responsible for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nAirgas has a risk management program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various\n\nprocesses are identified and controlled.

Additionally, the emergency shutdown procedure includes conditions that will prompt a shutdown and identifies\n\nqualified and responsible operators to complete the steps in a safe and timely manner.
