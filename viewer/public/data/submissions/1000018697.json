At the time of this filing, the East and West FHR refineries in Corpus Christi continue to have a combined record of greater than 20 million man-hours without a lost-time work injury. As part of the preparation of this update, FHR undertook a thorough review, including review by an independent consultant, of all of its RMP data and calculations. As a result, there are improvements in the current RMP, including updated amounts of regulated substances and revised release scenarios. This RMP is for FHR West Refinery in Corpus Christi, Texas. \n\nThe FHR facility at Corpus Christi performs a number of processing functions that would traditionally be classified as Petrochemical Refining and Specialty Chemical Processing. For the remainder of this submittal, the FHR West refinery in Corpus Christi will be referred to as 'FHR' and the primary processing function at the facility will be generically referred to as 'Refining'.\n\nFHR's emergency response capabilities include a 24-hour, 365 day/year, fully paid, in-plant industrial emergency response group (Refinery Terminal Fire Company - RTFC). In addition, over one hundred trained emergency responders could be deployed with state-of-the-art emergency response equipment within an hour if necessary due to the Corpus Christi Port Industrial consortium. Another aspect of our emergency response capabilities is notification of our adjacent neighbors through the Crisis Management Dispatch (CM"

The refinery has several regulated flammables, such as propane, butane, etc. Additionally, there is one EPA RMP toxic chemical handled above EPA RMP TQ at the refinery, and that is Hydrogen Fluoride.\n\n FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no RMP defined accidents that have occurred over the past five years involving EPA RMP regulated substances for the qualifying units.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at FHR. Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP rule are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program. For all process units containing threshold quantities (TQs) of highly hazardous chemicals (HHCs) per OSHA PSM, the programs summarized below are applied equally to EPA RMP covered and EPA RMP non-covered process units.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nFHR's policy is to encourage employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation included, but are not limited to, updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information, participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) teams and facilitating and participating in incident investigations. Employees have access to all information created as part of the refinery accident prevention program. Additionally, the refinery has a number of processes that address process safety and accident prevention. These processes include teams such as the Central"

Each of the teams contains members from across the refinery, including employees from operations, maintenance, engineering, as well as refinery management.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nFHR's policy is to maintain technical documents that are to be used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties, their associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. The Records Department within the refinery is the primary repository for process safety information. FHR also makes certain process safety information available on the FHR Intranet.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS). This information specifically addresses known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, the refinery has documented safety-related limits for certain process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the unit operating procedures. The refinery maintains these parameters within defined limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes.\n\nProc"

      "SummaryText": "ess Hazard Analysis\n\nWithin the PHA program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and confirm that adequate controls are in place to manage potential hazards. FHR primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform the majority of the PHA evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as a systematic and thorough hazard evaluation technique. The analyses are conducted with a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. The PHA team is led by a leader with experience and qualification in the HAZOP analysis technique. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are typically addressed by assigning action items to appropriate refinery personnel. Implementation of action items in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking is intended to help ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All PHA action items are tracked and maintained in the FHR Compliance Action Item Tracking System, LYNX. Within this system, each employee assigned an action is responsible for its execution by an assigned target date.  Responsible employees are automatically reminded via email of their assigned action and upcoming due date. For delinquent action items supervisors are emailed notification of employee's outstanding action items and the supervisor is responsible for taking appropriate action.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, FHR's practice is to periodically update and revalidate the hazard analysis results. The results and findings from base and revalidation PHA"

In the event the required five-year revalidation period is exceeded, a PSM incident will be recorded and addressed per our site's incident investigation procedures.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFHR's policy is to maintain written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nIn addition, FHR's policy is to maintain upper and lower safe operating limits for all process equipment in the Unit Operating Procedures and provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures is available on the FHR Intranet and at each control room area.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, FHR's policy is to implement a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in refinery operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing the basic training, an operator in training is paired with a senior operator to learn process- specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training to confirm that their skills and knowledge are maintained at a"

All of this training is to be documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nFHR uses contractors to supplement its workforce as part of routine practices or during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Before a contract employer is accepted at FHR, the contract employer is required to complete a Standardized Contractor Questionnaire Verified (SCQ-V) indicating the contract employers' safety record in industry. The SCQ-V is FHR's initial screening process for accepting a contract employer to work at the refinery and also used as an ongoing screening tool to renew and approve continued support from contract employers.\n\nBecause some contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has procedures in place designed to oversee that contractors:\n\n- perform work in a safe manner,\n\n- have the appropriate knowledge and skills,\n\n- are aware of the hazards in their workplace,\n\n- understand what they should do in the event of an emergency,\n\n- understand and follow site safety rules, and\n\n- inform refinery personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.\n\nThis is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work permitting process prior to beginning work. In addition, FHR's practice is to evaluate contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Refinery personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nFHR's policy is to conduct a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, a"

This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR also involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented. \n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nFHR has practices and procedures for maintaining pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. The purpose of these activities is to form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment. The governing documents that address FHR's mechanical integrity program include the following Equipment Synopsis documents for: \n\n- Fixed Equipment\n\n- Electrical Equipment\n\n- Instrumented Systems\n\n- Machinery\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner.

FHR's practice is to incorporate quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This is intended to help ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nFHR has safe work practices in place that are used to ensure worker safety within the facility.\n\nExamples of these include the following:\n\n- Security control and badge reader systems that regulate the entrance, presence and exit of all personnel and contractors at FHR,\n\n- Safe Work Permit Procedure, all work to be performed in a process area is performed under the direction of a safe work permit,\n\n- Lockout/Tagout Procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources on equipment undergoing maintenance,\n\n- First Break Procedure for the safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, \n\n- Confined Space Procedure to ensure adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined spaceand\n\n- Hot Work Procedure that is to be used to ensure adequate precautions are in place before performing hot work in a process area.\n\nThese procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, are used to form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nFHR has a system to manage changes to processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before the change is implemented.

Employees involved in operating a process, maintenance and contract employees whose job tasks will be affected by a change in the process are informed of and trained in, the change prior to start-up of the process or the affected part of the process.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nFHR's policy is to promptly investigate incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss (as defined by EPA RMP), or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to refinery management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked and maintained in LYNX. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHA revalidations.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nFHR's policy is to periodically conduct audits to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every three-years or on an as needed basis to track compliance with PSM and RMP requirements.

The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address various aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release with off-site consequences occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. In addition, FHR has procedures that are designed to address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that are to be used to address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to refinery processes or other refinery facilities. When necessary, the emergency response program changes are administered through the Safety Department, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for FHR is coordinated with FHR Emergency Response Team, RTFC, Local Emergency Response Agencies and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). FHR has around-the- clock communications capability with these organizations. At least four times a year, FHR's Emergency Response Team and these organizations are involved in an onsite test drill that is evaluated for effectiveness if an emergency should ever occur.

The final resolution of each finding is documented in LYNX, and the two most recent audit reports are retained in the Safety Department with the PSM Group.\n\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nMany processes at FHR have potential hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all Program 3 EPA RMP-covered processes at FHR. Collectively, these prevention program activities are designed to help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) equipment failures and (2) human errors.\n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, FHR has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of a release. The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\n\nRelease Detection\n\n1. Hydrocarbon and Hydrogen Sulfide detectors with alarms\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n1. Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\n\n2. Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\n\n3.
