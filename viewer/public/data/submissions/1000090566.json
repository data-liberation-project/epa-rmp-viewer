Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nIt is the VMH Terminal policy to adhere to all Federal and State rules and regulations.  The VMH Terminal has established a commitment to worker and public safety as well as the environment. This commitment is demonstrated by the release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility. It is the VMH Terminal policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If a release does occur, regular personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. Also, the Vopak MODA Houston Terminal has coordinated response activities with the Deer Park EMA and local Fire and Rescue Departments.\n\n\n\nB.    The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe VMH Terminal is a new hydrocarbon storage terminal located in Deer Park, Texas.  The products handled are flammable mixtures that meet the criteria for the National Fire Protection Association's (NFPA) 4 rating and are handled in quantities that exceed EPA's threshold of 10,000 pounds.  \n\n\n\nC.    The Worst-Case Release Scenarios and the Alternative Release Scenarios\n\na.    Worst Case Scenario:\n\nSince VMH Terminal does not have any toxic regulated substances above the threshold quantity, the worst case scenario was only carried out for the uncontrolled release of the largest inventory of flammable mixtures  (CAS 00-11-11), which was more than 10,000 pounds of a mixture of flammable substances that meet criteria for the NFPA-4 rating.  To carry out this analysis, it was assumed that none of the protective barriers in the facility worked.\n\nEPA assumes the worst-case scenario to be a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) and the RMP submittal must include this information.  For VMH Terminal, it was assumed that the single pressure vessel with the largest amount of flammable mixt"

ALOHA&trade; (Version 5.4.7), an EPA-sponsored software tool, was used to calculate a distance of 0.9 miles to 1 psi of overpressure endpoint.  As described in the EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis, the worst-case scenario was carried out based on a release of propylene, a component of the mixture in the tank.  Meteorological conditions for the worst-case scenario are defined in 40 CFR ?68.22(b) as atmospheric stability class F (stable atmosphere) and wind speed of 1.5 m/s.  The scenario involved a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the tank of 430,735 lbs. \n\n \n\nb.    Alternative Release scenarios:\n\nAn alternative case scenario considered a release during railcar unloading resulting in a vapor cloud fire. Propylene was selected as the predominant regulated component of the mixture, as it resulted in a greater distance to the lower flammable limit (LFL) endpoint.  ALOHA&trade; was used to predict a distance of 0.1 miles to the LFL endpoint, with a wind speed of 3 m/s and a stability class D with ambient air temperature (77?F).  Meteorological conditions were given in the ALOHA&trade; program and followed the methodology described in the EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis.  The scenario involved a release of 9,410 lbs/min which continues until the railcar has depressured.\n\n\n\nD.    General accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThe facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements, which are set out under 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68 of the EPA. The VMH Terminal is a PSM-covered facility and, as such, it has a viable process safety program. Workers and their representatives are consulted and have access to information regarding all PSM elements. Complete and accurate information on the proces"

Much of this information was compiled during the preparation of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA). Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDS's).\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis - The facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with the processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The HAZOP method is used to perform these evaluations. The studies were undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and will be revalidated at regular intervals of no more than 5 years. All findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures - For the purposes of safely conducting activities within the covered process, the VMH Terminal maintains written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in each covered process consistent with the process safety. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes. Safe work practices have been developed to provide for the control of hazards during operations such as lockout/tag out; confined space entry; opening process equipment or piping; and control over entrance into a stationary source by maintenance, contractor, lab"

Initial training on gas terminal operations is provided, and refresher training will be conducted at least every three years or more frequently as needed. Employee training is documented and records of training will be maintained onsite for at least three years. \n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity - Written procedures are in place for maintaining the on-going integrity of process equipment, which incorporates training for process maintenance activities, inspection and testing, corrective action for equipment deficiencies, and the application of quality assurance measures.  Documented maintenance checks are carried out on process equipment to ensure proper installation and operation.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Qualified and trained personnel carry out maintenance operations at the site.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.

Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Before any contractors are allowed to work on the VMH Terminal, they undergo an orientation conducted by the HSE team.  During this orientation contractors are made aware of the known potential hazards related the contractor's work, the hazards of regulated substances, the safe work procedures insisted on by the VMH Terminal Facility, and familiarized with the Hot Work Permit Policy and the Lock Out/Tag Out Procedures used at the VMH Terminal.  Contractors are informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur, and this information includes evacuation routes and assembly points.  The VMH Terminal Facility will document that the contractor has received and understands the training.\n\n\n\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps - The processes at the VMH Terminal have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  Safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances at the facility are in place to help prevent potential accidental scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human error. \n\n \n\nE.
