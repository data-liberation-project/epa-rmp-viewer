Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Chem Lab Products, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program. This program covers areas such as design, installation, operation procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Should an unforeseen event occur resulting in a release, our trained operations personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility?s primary activities include the packaging of bleach. We have one regulated substance present at our facility. This substance is Liquid Chlorine (under pressure). This regulated substance at our facility is used for manufacturing bleach.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is five Railcars on the site at 180,000 pounds each, resulting in a potential on-site maximum of 900,000 lbs. Only one (1) railcar is connected for unloading during the normal course of processing bleach.\n\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance. The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from the Railcar in the Bleach Manufacturing. The scenario involves the release of 180, 000 lbs of Chlorin"

The scenario involves the release of 1,500 lbs of Chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes. Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L of Chlorine is 5.2 miles.\n\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical- Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the Accidental Release Prevention requirement set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition. The process at our facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nChem Lab Products, Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all process.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out this analysis was HAZOP. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of at least once a year and more frequently as needed. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Proced"

These procedures address various models of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\n    Chem Lab Products, Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating specific covered processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Refresher training is provided at least once a year and more frequently as needed. Due to the small number of personnel involved and their close daily contact training and safety issues are constant parts of the bleach processing operation.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nChen Lab Products, Inc. carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by the these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations with previous training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Chem Lab Products, Inc. to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modifications.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-startup reviews related to new processes and to modifications in "

These audits are carried out at lease every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nChem Lab Products, Inc. promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation \nChem Lab Products, Inc. truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility?s implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analysis in particular.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.
