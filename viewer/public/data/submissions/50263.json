This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur,  we coordinate our response efforts with the Edgewood Fire Department and the Clayton County LEPC, which provide emergency response expertise to help limit the release distances and lower the potential risk of impacts.\n\n2. Stationary Sources and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activites include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous ammonia stored in a bulk storage tank at our facility in Edgewood.  With added capacity in on-site nurse tanks.\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention requirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nSilverEdge Coop maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that ahzards associated with our proceses are identified and cotrolled effectively.

Maintenance checks are conducted by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Examples of process equipment that would receive manitenance checks include:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at SilverEdge Coop to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and  procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or other employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly notified of the modification and offered training to deal with it.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nSilverEdge Coop routinely conducts pre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and modifications in established processes.
