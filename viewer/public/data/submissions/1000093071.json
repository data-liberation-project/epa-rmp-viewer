The facility is a potable (drinking) Water Treatment Plant located on Novato Boulevard, four miles west of Novato, California.\n\n\n\nIt is NMWD's policy to comply with the Cal-ARP and RMP regulatory requirements.  NMWD employees, supervisors and managers are all responsible for complying with these regualtions.  District employees and managers are provided with training to familiarize them with their requirements and responsibilities.\n\n\n\nNMWD has developed a process safety and risk management program that documents the policies pertaining to the prevention of accidental releases.  In addition, NMWD has conducted technical studies such as the Process Hazards Analysis and the Offsite Consequence Analysis to identify and evaluate potential hazards associated with the use of chlorine at the Stafford Water Treatment Plant.  NMWD has emergency procedures and an Emergency Response Plan (ERP), and these are coordinated with the Novato Fire Protection District. \n\n\n\nA management system is in place for implementing the RMP and Cal-ARP regulations.  This system defines the scope and purpose for each program element, procedures for implementation, roles and responsibilities, and the record-keeping requirements.  Delegated responsibilities are outlined in the NMWD written programs. \n\n\n\nAt the Stafford Water Treatment Plant chlorine is used to make chlorine dioxide which is used as a primary oxidant in the water treatment process.  Chlorine is also used in the process as a final disinfectant in the water leaving the plant. Use of these chemicals permits the operation to be in compliance with new EPA and California Department of Health Drinking water regulations.  A dedicated "

The chlorine flow rate is set by the plant computer control system at the chlorinator to feed the correct amount of chorine.  The design is inherently safe with halogen shut-off valves and vacuum regulators placed directly on the ton containers.  This means that if there is any damage to the piping system downstream there will be a break in the vacuum, and the chlorine will flow will stop at the regulator.  \n\n\n\nAll chlorine equipment is housed inside the chlorine building.  Leak detectors have been installed to monitor for chlorine leaks.  In a chlorine leak is detected, it triggers a local alarm, forces the halogen control valves to close, starts the gas containment scrubber system, and relays an alarm signal to NMWD's plant SCADA system.  The chlorine gas scrubber system is designed to neutralize any accidental chlorine leaks from the system-and can nullify the contents of an entire one ton container of chlorine gas.  \n\n\n\nIn developing the Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA), the approach taken was to follow the overall guidance provided by EPA and the American Water Works Association in the Model RMP for Water Treatment Plants.  During the last 8 years, there have been no accidents involving chlorine that resulted in any offsite impacts, and there have been no serious injuires or fatalities onsite.\n\n\n\nNMWD has implemented a comprehensive prevention program to minimize the potential for a catastrophic release of chlorine at the Stafford Water Treatment Plant.  Process safety information is available to employees, and a Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) has been conducted.  External events, including earthqua"

Following any system modifications, a pre-startup safety review has been conducted.  A management of change procedure has also been implemented.  \n\n\n\nStandard Operating Procedures (SOPs) have been developed for normal and emergency operations.  The SOPs provide written operating instructions for operating the chlorine systems, and they include procedures for container deliveries and container change-outs.  Equipment inspections, testing and maintenance activities are performed on a routine basis and documented in a computerized maintenance management system (Mainscape).  All operators are state-certified (California Department of Health Services) water treatment plant operators, and all operators and mechanics are required to be trained in the SOPs for the chlorine system.\n\n\n\nA compliance audit procedure has been developed for the Risk Management Program, and this will be used every three years to verify compliance with the Cal-ARP and RMP regulations.  NMWD investigates any incident or accident that results in the release of reportable quantity of chlorine.  Incident investigation procedures include root cause analysis.  \n\n\n\nGuidance is provided to the operators and mechanics to help them distinguish between an incidental release and an emergency.  In the event of an emergency, the procedures are to notify the response agencies, evacuate to a safe area, and assess the cause of the release, if this can be done safely.  The emergency response plan has been coordinated with the local response agencies, and NMWD will cooperate with these agencies to coordinate any offsite response that may be required in an emergency.  \n\n\n\nFollowing the PHA conducted in December 2005, NMWD is implementing recommendations to improve safety.
