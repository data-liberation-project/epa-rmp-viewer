Kill Plant are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Poultry Processing.  We have 1 regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is  Ammonia (anhydrous).  Ammonia (anhydrous) is used for Refrigeration.\r\n\r\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\r\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration  Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from the  Ammonia Refrigeration System's High Pressure Receiver.  In this scenario 20000 lb. of Ammonia (anhydrous) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 2.52 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a release from a compressor shaft seal.  The scenario involves the releas"

The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as an enclosure is taken into account to calculate the scenario.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by emergency shutdown systems.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia (anhydrous) is 0.06 miles.\r\n\r\n4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nHouse of Raeford Farms, Inc. Kill Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If/Checklist (combined).  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 3 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 06/25/2000.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, House of Raeford Farms, Inc.

Kill Plant has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nHouse of Raeford Farms, Inc. Kill Plant carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Proces equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\nWritten procedures are in place at House of Raeford Farms, Inc. Kill Plant to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on 06/23/2000.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Reviews\r\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at House of Raeford Farms, Inc.
