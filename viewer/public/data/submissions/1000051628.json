Poly vinyl alcohol is used in the manufacture of consumer goods packaging such as: laundry detergent bottles, ketchup bottles, and plastic lined boxes like those used for drink boxes.\n\n\n\nAs part of this production process, one RMP regulated substance in threshold quantities is utilized at Kuraray Bayport POVAL Plant. Based on applicable volumes maintained at the facility, vinyl acetate monomer is a listed toxic material. \n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental release prevention program and chemical-specific steps 40 CFR 68.155(d):\n\n\n\nIn general, Kuraray has implemented numerous steps to minimize the potential of a release of any chemical on site. All storage tanks are located within diked areas; truck-unloading facilities have been replaced by direct pipeline feeds, which are equipped with low-pressure alarms and automated shut-off valves.  Furthermore, all of the process areas at this facility regulated by the EPA Risk Management Program regulation are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  Processes containing materials that are subject to the EPA RMP Rule have been incorporated into the existing OSHA PSM program, resulting in a program that is in compliance with both the OSHA and EPA regulations.  Specific elements of this program include the following:\n\n\n\n?    Employee Participation in process safety management and accident prevention,\n\n?    Process Safety Information,\n\n?    Process Hazards Analysis (PHA),\n\n?    Documented Operating Procedures,\n\n?    Training Programs for all Employees,\n\n?    Contractor Requirements and Training,\n\n?
