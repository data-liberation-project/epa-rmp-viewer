(XTO) has a strong commitment to the protection of workers and the environment. The Lundin Fed 11X-4 (the Site) has an active safety program covering both employees and contract workers. This program encompasses promotion of safe work practices to prevent personal accidents, and incidents that would adversely affect the community. XTO recognizes their commitment to accident prevention through continuing programs including personnel training. Consideration is also given to safety in the design, installation, and operation of natural gas production and gathering systems and modifications to the Site. The safety commitment is also carried forth as evidenced by an aggressive maintenance program. Reasonable controls have been implemented to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. In the unlikely event that a release does occur, arrangements have been made within the local community to provide response and control of any catastrophic releases. Passive mitigation, such as vents, is present at the site to manage any overpressure conditions that may occur. \n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe facility is located at Highway 85 & Highway 23, travel E on Highway 23 for approximately 9.1 miles to CR 45 (Beaver Creek Rd); R (S) on 45 for approximately 3.1 miles to 115th M Ave NW; R (S) on 115th M Ave NW for approximately 2.9 miles to intersection;  R (N) at intersection for approximately 1.29 miles to existing access road on the Left in, McKenzie County.  Inherent with the operation of a gas refrigeration site, the Site processes and stores regulated flammable substances above the threshold quantity. These flammable substances are addressed throughout the RMP, and may include pentane, eth"

Flare gas is captured and processed through one or more Mechanical Refrigeration Units (MRUs). From there some of the residue gas or gas remaining after MRU process is being liquified through a Cryogenic (Cryo) process into Liquified Natural Gas Condensates. Any gas that is not captured during either of these processes is returned to flare.  \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nXTO maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the Site's processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Employees at the Site are active in the development and maintenance of up-to-date process safety information. Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known concerns. For specific operations areas, the Site has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters, such as temperature, level, and composition. The Site ensures that each process is maintained within approved limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel, and automated shutdown systems.\n\n\n\nThe Site also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and Site changes to en"

The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the location.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Site maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety, as well as to protect the environment. The program consists of procedures for contacting responders for mitigation of a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address aspects of emergency response by outside experts and include proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and any decontamination requirements. Employees receive appropriate training in procedures necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties which includes contacting trained responders. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to Site processes or other facilities within the Site.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Site is coordinated with the McKenzie County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This coordination includes periodic meetings, which include local emergency response officials, and local government officials. The Site contacts local emergency responders annually with regard to the hazards of regulated substances at the Site.\n\n\n\nXTO has implemented an Emergency Response Plan (ERP), elements of which overlap those of the RMP. The ERP provides the following information:\n\n\n\n-    Procedures for informing the public and offsite emergency response officials of a release.\n\n\n\n-    The individua"
