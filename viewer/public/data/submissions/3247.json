This is OSHA's highest award for safety performance. \n0.3 DESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe GE Plastics plant is on a 600-acre tract along the Ohio River in Washington, W. Va., about eight miles south of Parkersburg.  It was built in 1957 and currently employs about 700 people in the Mid-Ohio Valley.  GE Plastics manufactures engineered plastics, marketed under trade names such as CYCOLACR, GELOYR, MAGIXd, and others.  Our products are used in automotive, medical, electronic, computer, and appliance industries to name a few.  \nThe site is also home to a Technology Center, where GE conducts advanced research in polymer technology.  \nIn order to ensure quality products, quality service and quality of life, GE has invested more than $180 million in the site since 1988 for expansion, capital improvement, safety and environmental protection.  \nThe Washington W. Va. plant uses two chemicals that are regulated under the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule.  These are: acrylonitrile, a regulated toxic substance; and, 1-3 Butadiene, a regulated flammable substance.  Acrylonitrile and 1-3 Butadiene are raw materials used to manufacture our products. \n0.4 HAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\nAs part of our risk management planning, we have specifically identified the type of event that, should it ever occur, would have the most negative impacts on our workers and our neighbors.  This is known as the Worst-Case Scenario (WCS).   As defined by EPA, we are required to assume that the numerous engineering and administrative safety controls we have in place to prevent or mitigate such accidents have all failed at once.  Two types of consequences must be evaluated:  "

      "SummaryText": "a release of an EPA-listed toxic chemical, and a release of an EPA-listed flammable chemical.\nThis worst-case scenario would involve the catastrophic failure of a railcar tanker containing acrylonitrile liquid.  A worst-case scenario assumes a catastrophic failure is an event that essentially results in the instantaneous release of the entire vessel contents, which is, in this event, up to 173,000 pounds of acrylonitrile.   Under this scenario, the acrylonitrile liquid is assumed to evaporate and the vapors disperse in the direction of the prevailing wind.  According to EPA guidelines, exposure to acrylonitrile can occur without serious health effects at levels up to 35 parts per million  (0.076 mg per liter) for approximately one hour. \nA scenario using more realistic assumptions involves overfilling an acrylonitrile storage tank while transferring material from a railcar.   EPA defines this as the Alternative Release Scenario (ARS).  As much as 21,000 pounds acrylonitrile could be released over a 20-minute period.   The secondary containment dike around the storage tank would mitigate the impact of this scenario. \nThe Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) involving flammable materials at the facility involves a catastrophic failure of a butadiene storage tank, resulting in the instantaneous release of up to 2.4 million pounds of gas.  The scenario assumes that the gas will ignite and result in a vapor cloud explosion.\nThe Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) for all flammable materials involves failure of a pipe connection to a barge containing butadiene at our dock.  This could result in a release of up to 4,000 pounds of butadiene gas.  Since trained and certified operators continuously attend the butadiene transfer operation, remote shutoff valves would quickly isolate this leak. \n0.5 GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM/ CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nGE Plastics has implemented a comprehensive program to prevent accidental releases of highly hazardous chemical"

PSM ensures that proper safety information is in place; operating procedures are followed; chemical hazards are identified; employees and contractors are trained; and critical equipment is properly inspected and maintained.  PSM satisfies the accidental release prevention program requirements of the RMP.\nSome of the many, specific safety features to prevent a chemical accident include:\n7 Computer-controlled Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS) on the butadiene latex reactors to ensure that any deviations from the intended operating conditions are immediately identified and corrected;\n7 Safety procedures that reduce the potential for human error which could lead to a storage tank overfill;\n7 Secondary containment dikes around storage tanks to contain a spill;\n7 Butadiene and acrylonitrile gas sensors to detect and warn of a release;\n7 Spill containment around acrylonitrile railcars at the unloading station to mitigate the impact of a leak;\n7 Acrylonitrile railcar and butadiene barge and railcar unloading operations are continuously attended by US Department Of Transportation (DOT) trained operators;\n7 Extensive safety information about the processes available to employees;\n7 Written operating procedures that include emergency response actions;\n7 Comprehensive employee and contractor training programs to promote consistently safe work-practices;\n7 Maintenance programs to ensure ongoing equipment reliability - includes equipment testing and inspection;\n7 Compliance auditing to ensure standards are being followed;\n7 A safety procedure to review proposed plant modifications before they are implemented for possible hazards;\n7 Safety pre-qualification for all contractors;\n7 Safety reviews prior to startup of our processes; and,\n7 Safety systems that control hazards during special operations such as welding. \n  GE Plastics is engaged in an aggressive and compre"

We are in the process of inventorying our equipment at the site, interviewing suppliers, putting into place corrective actions where necessary, and developing a contingency plan. We are on track to complete this process prior to critical roll-over dates and believe we have addressed the systems and equipment necessary for safe site operation.\n 0.6 FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n The Washington W. Va. site has an outstanding record of accident prevention which demonstrates its commitment to public and worker safety.  Even minor incidents are investigated to identify what went wrong and to learn how to prevent future occurrences.  \n The RMP requires that all incidents involving regulated chemicals that resulted in any off-site impact or significant on-site impacts are reported in this document.  During the previous five-year period, one such incident occurred at the plantsite.  On July 10, 1995 a 500-pound release of butadiene vapor occurred when a valve malfunctioned on a butadiene barge container.   There was no fire or environmental impact from this incident, and no one was injured.  GE immediately reported the release as a precautionary measure, and the US Coast Guard closed traffic on the Ohio River for about two hours while the problem was being diagnosed and corrected.  There was never any danger to the community or anyone else beyond the immediate area of the leak.  Following this incident, GE worked with the butadiene barge operator/owner to ensure that all pressure relief valves on supply barges were inspected and replaced where necessary to prevent any future occurrences.  \n 0.7 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n The Washington W. Va. site maintains a written emergency response program designed to protect workers, the public, and the environment in the event of a major accidental release.  All of our employees are trained in the proper response to an incident.  We also invest in the equipment needed to respond "

Our trained fire brigade, medical and chemical response teams work closely with area hospitals, industries, and other response organizations in the Mid-Ohio Valley.  \n For example, within the last sixteen months, emergency drills, organized and directed by the GE emergency teams, have included:\n7 A simulated barge incident conducted with city officials, fire brigade, and police departments from the City of Vienna, West Virginia; \n7 A simulated chemical tanker truck incident at West Virginia University at Parkersburg with Camden-Clark Memorial Hospital emergency teams and area volunteer fire brigades; and,\n7 A simulated chemical/industrial accident with St. Joseph's Hospital emergency room and chemical emergency response teams.  \n Ongoing training exercises are important to the company's emergency response organization and help better prepare our partners in the community for emergency response necessary in the unlikely event of a major industrial incident. \n In March 1993, in partnership with DuPont and Shell Chemical, GE Plastics introduced the eleven-siren Industrial Alert System (IAS) in the Mid-Ohio Valley with coverage in Washington County in Ohio and Wood County in West Virginia.  Though we have never had to activate the IAS on an emergency basis at GE Plastics, the siren system is available to warn the public in the unlikely event of a major incident on site.   The system has been designed to enhance the area's emergency response services.  More information about how to shelter yourself and your family in the event of a chemical emergency can be found in the Bell Atlantic telephone directory.  \n GE personnel have helped develop emergency preparedness plans for local communities.
