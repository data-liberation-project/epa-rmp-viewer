Rayonier's Fernandina Specialty Pulp Products Mill implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes; and programs to evaluate possible hazards.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, Rayonier's Fernandina Specialty Pulp Products Mill implements policies and procedures to p"

Controlling and containing accidental releases of hazardous substances, including the use of emergency response equipment.\n4.

Procedures for informing the public when necessary. \n6.  Inspecting and maintaining emergency response equipment.\n7.  Reviewing and updating the emergency response plan.\n\nRayonier's Fernandina Specialty Pulp Products Mill maintains an emergency response team trained in these emergency response procedures.  All personnel are trained in evacuation procedures.  Rayonier periodically conducts emergency response drills.  The written emergency response plan complies with other federal contingency plan regulations [i.e. OSHA regulations 29 CFR 1910.38(a) and 29 CFR 1910.120(a)] and has been communicated to the local emergency response officials.  Rayonier's Fernandina Specialty Pulp Products Mill also maintains a regular dialogue with the local fire chief and routinely provides required information.\n\n\n\n1.7   PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nRayonier's Fernandina Specialty Pulp Products Mill constantly strives to improve the safety of the workers and the community.  There are many systems in place to achieve this goal.  Currently, the entire mill is undergoing extensive training for Behavior Based Safety (BBS) to improve overall safety performance.  This program is entitled H.A.W.K. (Halting Accidents With Knowledge) and is underway with a steering committee guiding the effort while training each employee.

These investigations are conducted whenever an incident has the potential to affect the safety of workers.  There is also a program to solicit safety suggestions from workers.  As a result of these activities, improvements can be achieved.  The following is a list of process safety improvements, which are planned or have recently been completed.\n\n1.  Rayonier's Fernandina Specialty Pulp Products Mill is currently moving the sulfur dioxide railcar unloading station to a permanent location with a bridge to provide safer access for the trained chemical unloader.\n2.  Hose specifications for railcar unloading have been reviewed and are being refined to adopt a larger hose.  This was done to ensure that there would be enough flow through the hose to utilize the excess flow valve (i.e. the valve will shutdown the flow when it reaches a specified rate) in the unlikely event that a hose is accidentally severed.\n\nMajor efforts to improve safety are also underway with Rayonier's Job Safety Analysis (JSA) program.  The program consists of systematically analyzing jobs from a safety perspective.  This is accomplished by identifying all the jobs performed and breaking each job down into the steps taken to complete each task.  The potential accidents and hazards of each task are identified and recommendations are then provided on how to prevent these hazards from occurring.  Employees participate in this program by providing input on each analysis.  The resulting JSA's are used in training each employee on how to do the job safely.\n\n\n\n\n2.0    CERTIFICATION\n\nRefer to the attached form.\n\n\n\n3.0    REGISTRATION\n\nRefer to the attached form."

To manufacture these quality pulps to specific customer specifications, Rayonier uses four chemicals subject the Risk Management Plan (RMP). The Fernandina Mill is classified as Source Industrial Code (SIC) 2611 and is consequently subject to the Program Level 3 requirements of RMP.  These same four substances are also subject to Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations and are listed below:  \n1. Ammonia (anhydrous)\n2. Chlorine\n3. Chlorine dioxide\n4. Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous)\nAmmonia and sulfur dioxide are used to make up cooking acid for pulps.  Chlorine and chlorine dioxide are used as bleaching chemicals in the process.\n\n\n\n1.3    OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nThe Rayonier's Fernandina Specialty Pulp Products Mill has four Program Level 3 processes for which offsite consequence analysis (OCA) evaluations were performed:  ammonia (anhydrous), chlorine, chlorine dioxide, and sulfur dioxide (anhydrous).  These were conducted to evaluate the consequences of a release of one of these chemicals.  The OCA includes estimating the distances to the toxic end point and the populations affected in the event of an accidental release of a regulated toxic substance.  A toxic end point is defined as the concentration of a substance in the air that a person can be exposed to for one hour without impairing their ability to take corrective action.  The toxic end po"

There was one release per the rule definition which occurred July 22, 1996 at 11:30 pm for approximately 15 minutes when a 1/2 inch chlorine line developed a small leak releasing approximately one pound of chlorine.  While there was no offsite impact there was an employee who required medical attention.\n\nThe wind direction carried the chlorine release to a production area.  An employee working in the area recognized that there had been a chlorine release and immediately exited the area.  The employee notified an operator who activated the chlorine emergency shut-off valve.  Activating the emergency shut-off valve mitigated the release.  Two workers were exposed; one was sent to the local hospital for precautionary reasons.  The employee was treated and released the same evening.  The other employee was administered oxygen at our first aid office on-site and did not require medical attention.\n\nFollowing the incident, a formal investigation was conducted and corrective measures were implemented to improve the process.  The root cause was identified and corrective actions were taken to prevent similar releases from occurring in the future.
