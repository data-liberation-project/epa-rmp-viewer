Due to these release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\r\n\r\n6. Emergency Response Plan\r\n\r\nChem Lab Products, Inc. carries a written Emergency Response Plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and material treatment, evacuations, notification of local Emergency Response Agencies and the public, as well as post-incident de-contamination of affected areas.\r\n\r\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced. In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\r\n\r\n7.

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nWe at Chem Lab Products, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program. This program covers areas such as design, installation, operation procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Should an unforeseen event occur resulting in a release, our trained operations personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\r\n\r\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nOur facility's primary activities include the packaging of bleach (sodium hypochlorite solution). We have one regulated substance present at our facility. This substance is Liquid Chlorine (under pressure). This regulated substance at our facility is used for manufacturing bleach.\r\n\r\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\r\n\r\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the LandView 6 software and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance. \r\n\r\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical- Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the Accidental Release Prevention requirement set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition. The process at our facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.

The methodology used to carry out this analysis was HAZOP. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are re-validated at a regular interval of at least once a year and more frequently as needed. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Chem Lab Products, Inc. maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various models of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shut-down and start-up after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nChem Lab Products, Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating specific covered processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Refresher training is provided at least once a year and more frequently as needed. Due to the small number of personnel involved and their close daily contact, training and safety issues are constant parts of the bleach processing operation.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nChem Lab Products, Inc. carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.
