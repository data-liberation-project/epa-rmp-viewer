Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nWe at Chem Lab Products, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program. This program covers areas such as design, installation, operation procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Should an unforeseen event occur resulting in a release, our trained operations personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nOur facility's primary activities include the packaging of bleach (sodium hypochlorite solution). We have one regulated substance present at our facility. This substance is Liquid Chlorine (under pressure). This regulated substance at our facility is used for manufacturing bleach.\n\n\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\n\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the LandView 6 software and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance. \n\n\n\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical- Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the Accidental Release Prevention requirement set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition. The process at our facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.

The methodology used to carry out this analysis was HAZOP. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are re-validated at a regular interval of at least once a year and more frequently as needed. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Chem Lab Products, Inc. maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various models of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shut-down and start-up after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nChem Lab Products, Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating specific covered processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Refresher training is provided at least once a year and more frequently as needed. Due to the small number of personnel involved and their close daily contact, training and safety issues are constant parts of the bleach processing operation.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nChem Lab Products, Inc. carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.

Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations with previous training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Chem Lab Products, Inc. to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modifications.\n\n\n\nPre-start-up Reviews\n\nPre-start-up reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Chem Lab Products, Inc. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe start-up prior to placing equipment into operation and incorporated into procedures and check-lists.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nChem Lab Products, Inc. conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. These audits are carried out at least once every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nChem Lab Products, Inc. promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation \n\nChem Lab Products,"
