EPA requires \nfacilities to model the distance that a plume of released gas would travel before it dispersed to an ambient \nconcentration equal to the \u0013Toxic Endpoint Concentration\u0014.  The Toxic Endpoint Concentrations for various \ncompounds were specified by EPA, and are generally concentrations that would cause no physical harm but could \ninterfere with people\u0012s ability to leave the area.  The Toxic Endpoint Concentrations for the RMP chemicals at the \nCDMWTP are: 3 parts per million (ppm) of chlorine;   and 3 ppm of sulfur dioxide.   In accordance with EPA\u0012s rule, \nthe following hypothetical accidental release scenarios were developed:\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario for Chlorine  \n\nLiquid chlorine (chlorine gas that is stored as a liquid under pressure at ambient temperature) is imported to the site \nby truck and stored in a one-ton containers for use in the oxidation/disinfection process.  The Administrative Worst-\nCase Release Scenario assumes that the entire contents of one of the chlorine cyliners (2000 pounds of chlorine) is \nemitted as a gas cloud in 10 minutes, during a period of exceptionally calm winds and stagnant atmospheric \nconditions (1.5 meter/second wind speed and \u0013F stability\u0014) that would result in minimal dispersion of the gas cloud \nas it blew downwind.  The thermodynamic properties of anhydrous chlorine indicate that such a large instantaneous \ngas release is probably impossible.  If the entire 2000 lbs of liquid chlorine were somehow discharged from the \ncontainer, it would spill onto the ground and immediately cool itself until it formed a puddle of \u0013chlorine ice\u0014, which \nwould take much longer than 10 minutes to evaporate into a gas cloud.   Nevertheless, the RMP rule dictates that the \nWorst-Case Scenario assumes the release of"

The plant treats raw water received from the Cachuma Reservoir for municipal water use.  The treatment \nprocesses are designed to oxidize, disinfect, and remove suspended matter, such as clay particles and algae in the raw \nwater, in order to meet California State Drinking Water Standards.  The design capacity of the plant is 24 million \ngallons per day (mgd) with a peak capacity of approximately 36 mgd.\n\nA gaseous chlorine system is used for oxidation and disinfection of the raw water.  A gaseous sulfur dioxide system \nis used periodically for dechlorination purposes.  The plant is equipped with chlorine and sulfur dioxide gas \ndetectors.\n\nFACILITY WILL DISCONTINUE USAGE OF ARPP-REGULATED CHEMICALS BY JANUARY 2000\n\nThe facility will discontinue the use of gaseous chlorine and sulfur dioxide before January 2000.  The existing \ngaseous chlorine system will be replaced by an aqueous sodium hypochlorite system, which will not be subject to \neither the PSM or ARPP rules.  Sulfur dioxide will not be used for dechlorination after January 2000, so the existing \nsulfur dioxide system will be removed.\n\nCHEMICALS CURRENTLY SUBJECT TO ARPP RULE AS OF JUNE 1999\n\nAs of June 1999 CDMWTP uses the following chemicals that are stored in quantities large enough to trigger the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency\u0012s Accidental Release Prevention Program (EPA\u0012s ARPP) and California\u0012s \nAccidental Release Prevention Program (Cal ARPP):\n\nChlorine \u0016 One-ton cylinders of liquid chlorine are delivered to the plant by truck.  A maximum of 8 one-ton \nchlorine cylinders are stored onsite.  Goleta WD also periodically stores several 150 pound chlorine cylinders for \nother remote facilities.\n\nSulfur Dioxide  \u0016 One-ton cylinders of liquid"

At the present time sulfur dioxide is stored but not used at the \nCDMWTP.\n\nThe chemical storage room also has enough trunions to store an additional 6 one-ton cylinders of either chlorine or \nsulfur dioxide.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASES DURING PAST 5 YEARS\n\nThe CDMWTP has not had any releases during the past 5 years that resulted in any injuries, off-site evacuations, or \nproperty damage.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT ACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe CDMWTP is subject to OSHA\u0012s Process Safety Management (OSHA PSM) regulations for all equipment and \noperations associated with its chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems.  Goleta WD developed a formal safety program as \npart of California\u0012s Risk Management and Accident Prevention Program in 1994.  The safety program includes the \nfollowing:\n\nReview of the design of all equipment and controls for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems to ensure they are \nproperly designed and installed.\n \nA Process Hazard Analysis to evaluate safety issues.  \n  \nTraining for all operators and maintenance staff.\n \nRegular inspection of all equipment, monitoring systems and controls, with stringent documentation of all \ninspections.  Prompt corrective action for any non-conforming items identified by the regular inspections.\n \nDevelopment of an emergency action plan.\n \n \n EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROCEDURES\n \n The Goleta WD uses its Emergency Action Plan  for the CDMWTP to provide step-by-step procedures for \nemergency response in the unlikely event of an accidental release.  The key elements of the response plan are as \nfollows:\n \nAll plant staff  are trained in the specific elements of the program.\n \nThe plant uses a combination of chlorine and sulfur dioxide detectors, audible alarms and visual alarm lights to \nalert the staff of a potential accident.\n \nIn the event of a large release, the plant would immediately contact the Santa"

To be conservative it was assumed that the dropped cylinder \nlands on its weakest point, splitting a seam to cause an 8\u0014 x <\u0014 crack.  To be conservative it was assumed that the \ndropped cylinder comes to rest with the crack below the liquid level in the cylinder, allowing half of  the liquid \ncontents to immediately drain onto the ground.  The thermodynamic properties of chlorine dictate that 12% of the \nspilled chlorine would immediately \u0013flash\u0014 to a vapor that would form a dense cloud that could blow downwind.  \nThe thermodynamic properties also dictate that the spilled liquid would immediately chill to chlorine\u0012s boiling point \ntemperature (-29 degrees F), forming a puddle of \u0013chlorine ice\u0014.
