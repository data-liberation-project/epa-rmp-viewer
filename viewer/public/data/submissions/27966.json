The Accident Prevention Program is a way to make safe operations and accident prevention systematic throughout the facility.  Packaged Ice, Inc. Corporate Management and Reddy Ice-Denver management are committed to operating a safe and compliant facility for the protection of its employees, the general public, and the environment.  A Combined Process Safety Management/Risk Management (PSM/RM) Program has been developed to meet the accidental release prevention requirements of EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Program (40 CFR Part 68) and OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management Standard (29 CFR 1910.119) under the Clean Air Act.  The Combined PSM/RM Program contains thirteen elements, establishing requirements for training, operating procedures, documentation, etc. These elements are tied together by a management system to ensure development, implementation and integration of the Program requirements.\n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM\nA management system has been developed to oversee the implementation of the PSM/RM Program elements.  The Plant Manager is identified as PSM/RM Coordinator, with overall responsibility for developing, implementing and integrating the Program requirements.  The Plant Engineer has responsibility for portions of the program closely tied to the refrigeration equipment and operation.  An established safety committee meets each month to present a safety meeting and address any safety issues brought up by employees during the month.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\nAs required by the Risk Management Program regulations,"

      "SummaryText": "the Reddy Ice-Denver facility has conducted offsite consequence analyses (OCAs) relative to the potential accidental release of ammonia.  The OCAs describe the potential offsite exposure to surrounding areas from an accidental release.  A worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenarios were calculated using the EPA RMP*Comp modeling program.\n\nThe worst-case scenario consisted of a total release from an ammonia receiver inside the engine room, as it would house the largest mass of ammonia at any given time.  The release model considered the potential release of 4,400 pounds of liquid ammonia from the vessel during a 10-minute period, potentially affecting a modeled radius of 0.6 mile and a population of 2,500 persons.  This impact is extremely unlikely, as the RMP*Comp program is very conservative, resulting in a large maximum radius. \n\nSeveral alternative scenarios, or potentially more likely scenarios, for the facility system were explored, ranging from a release from a valve seal, or a minor break in indoor piping, to failure of an outdoor liquid line.  The selected scenario consists of a two-minute release from a break in a \u00be\u00bf liquid line operating a 150 psi with an initial flow rate of 1059 pounds per minute.  A 1,710 pound per minute release rate was calculated by RMP*Comp.  Based on this release rate, a radius of 0.2 mile and a population of 234 persons were calculated.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe Reddy Ice-Denver facility has not had any releases that would require reporting as part of a five-year accident history.\n\nEMERGENCY PLANNING AND RESPONSE\nThe Reddy Ice-Denver facility operates under an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that includes procedures for: notifying the public and local emergency responders; emergency evacuation/response procedures; use of emergency alarms and equipment; employee training in evacuation and response procedures; first aid for ammonia exposure; and periodic review and updating of the emergency action plan.\n\nAs requ"

      "SummaryText": "RMPSubmit Executive Summary for Denver\n\nPROCESS SUMMARY\nThe Reddy Ice #368 facility located in Denver, Colorado, manufactures ice for wholesale/retail distribution.  The facility maintains approximately 13,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant for ice making and cold storage.  \n\nThe facility refrigeration system is a standard closed loop design consisting of compressors, condensers, storage tanks, ice makers, and freezer vaults.  There are three operating systems, one exclusively for the ice makers, and two for other plant requirements (freezers and storage vaults).  All of the systems are supplied liquid anhydrous ammonia from two storage receivers located in the engine room.  The system has numerous protective controls including motor overload, high and low temperature and pressure, low oil pressure, high and low liquid level cutouts, and pressure relief valves on all equipment.  Ammonia detectors and alarms are installed throughout the plant, which is manned by facility engineers 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia, when properly used, has proven to be a safe and reliable refrigerant.  The sharp odor of ammonia provides its own warning agent.  Practically all accidents involving anhydrous ammonia can be avoided through the facility\u00bfs program of proper training, knowledge of the equipment and procedures, and conducting preventive maintenance on all ammonia equipment.  Packaged Ice has instituted administrative and engineering controls as well as training programs on the corporate level to prevent such accidents.\n\nThe facility has multiple safeguards pertinent to the anhydrous ammonia process.  These include an ammonia detection and alarm system, exhaust purge fans, controls which shut down the compressors if operating limits are exceeded, and the capability of shutting the entire system down if required.  Administrative controls are in place that limit the utilization of vessels to approximately 75% of their intended capacities.\n\nThe c"
