Headquartered in Salisbury, Maryland, the family-owned, privately held company has operations in 15 states. Fifteen processing facilities produce about 56 million pounds of poultry products each week. Perdue also has grain storage and merchandising operations and is ranked among the top 12 largest US grain \n\ncompanies. In addition, Perdue manufactures edible oils, specialty feeds, and livestock feed ingredients and premium pet food ingredients.\n\n\n\nThe Perdue Farms Concord facility is located in Cabarrus County, North Carolina, in the city of Concord. The facility is a further poultry processing plant which employs approximately 297 associates to receive chicken meat plus other raw ingredients to form, prepare and package for distribution to the market place. The facility normally operates 6 days per with personnel present 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.\n\n\n\nThe regulated substance at the Concord facility, covered by 40 CFR Part 68, is anhydrous ammonia (R-717). The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as an integral part of its refrigeration system, which consists of several storage vessels, compressors, condensers, piping and air handling units throughout the processing plant in order to maintain proper food safety temperatures. The total system capacity of anhydrous ammonia on-site is 52,506 pounds distributed throughout the refrigeration components.  The facility maintains a full-time refrigeration maintenance staff that conducts multiple service inspections on a daily basis. In addition, there is a computer control system that monitors temperatures, pressures, and the atmosphere for leaks. \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\n\n\nAs a concerned member of the community, t"
