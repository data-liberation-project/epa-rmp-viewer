Ammonia is used at the facility as the cooling medium in our refrigeration system. The ammonia is contained in a closed loop system; it is designed to remain inside the piping and vessels in our facility. We believe that ammonia provides the safest and most efficient cooling choice for our operation.\n\nA. Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\nWe take many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system. These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure. We also have a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel, and emergency response procedures that enable trained personnel to respond quickly to system upsets. The Refrigeration Manager is responsible for the management of these ammonia safety programs.\n\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nAmmonia is the only substance covered by the Accidental Release Prevention Regulations handled at this facility. The max intended operating inventory for the facility is 42,917 lbs.\n\nC. Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThe facility has an accident release prevention program that complies with Occupational Safety and Health Act's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Rule. The prevention program consists of the following elements:\nEmployee Participation Program\nProcess Safety Information\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOperating Procedures\nTraining Program\nContractor Safety Program\nPre-Startup Safety Review Procedures\nMechan"

Description of the Emergency Action Plan\nAn emergency action plan has been implemented at the facility. This program contains\nprocedures describing how the facility will respond to ammonia spills and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures. The program has been coordinated with local fire department officials.\n\nF. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nHouse of Raeford will follow management of change procedures for any facility improvements or updates to safety programs that relate to the ammonia system."
