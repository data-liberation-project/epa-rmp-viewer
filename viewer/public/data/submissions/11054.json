IF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE COMPANY, OR OTHER AUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE TO PEOPLE AND THE ENVIROMENT.\n\nTHE PRIMARY ACTIVITIES AT THE FACILITY IS THE STORAGE AND BLENDING OF FERTILIZERS FOR SALE TO FARMERS AND THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF PROPANE.  ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECEIVED, STORED, AND DISTRIBUTED FOR BOTH DIRECT APPLICATION AND FOR BLENDING INTO MIXED-GRADE FERTILIZERS FOR CROP PRODUCTION NUTRIENTS. PROPANE IS RECEIVED, STORED, AND DISTRIBUTED FOR USE AS A FUEL.\n\nTHE MAXIMUM QUANTITY OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA STORED WOULD BE 925,000 POUNDS IN A 26,000 GALLON TANK, A 18,000 GALLON TANK, AND NUMEROUS 1,000 GALLON TANKS. THE MAXIMUM QUANITY OF PROPANE STORED IS 175,000 POUNDS IN A 30,000 AND A 18,000 GALLON TANK.\n\nTHE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF A STORAGE TANK RELEASED AS A GAS OVER 10 MINUTES. THE MAXIMUM  QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 130,000 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE STORAGE TANK AT 85 PERCENT CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM ) IS 1.12 MILES.\n\nTHE WORST CASE SCENARIO FOR PROPANE IS A VAPOR CLOUD EXPLOSION CAUSING A 1 PSI OVERPRESSURE TO A DISTANCE OF .43 MILES. THE MAXIMUM QUANITY RELEASED WOULD BE 110,000 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE STORAGE TANK AT 85 PRECENT CAPACITY.\n\nTHE ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS A RUPTURE OF A 3 INCH PIPE WITH A RELEASE TIME OF 2 MINUTES. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT IS .78 MILES. THE ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR PROPANE IS A VAPOR CLOUD EXPLOSION CAUSING A 1 PSI OVERPRESSURE TO A DISTANCE (FACTOR OF.67 x "
