This release, if ignited, has off-site impact as determined by use of the EPA OCA Guidance and by computer modeling.\n\nALTERNATIVE TOXIC RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n         There are seven toxic regulated substances in the RMP.  These are anhydrous ammonia, formaldehyde solution, methylchloroformate, oleum, phosgene, phosphorus oxychloride, and sulfur trioxide.  No mitigation is assumed in assessing off-site impact, except for the oleum release, which is contained in a dike.   The alternative release scenarios are summarized as follows.\n\n         Anhydrous Ammonia - A leak in the ammonia distribution  pipeline.\n\n         Formaldehyde Solution - A leak from the formaldehyde storage tank transfer pump seal. \n\n         Methylchloroformate - A leak in the transfer pipeline to the process.\n\n         Oleum - A leak of 20% oleum from the oleum tower tank.  The leak is contained in a diked area.  \n\n         Phosgene - A leak in the phosgene pipeline after a vaporizer releasing phosgene vapor. \n\n         Phosphorus Oxychloride - A leak in the truck unloading hose. \n\n         Sulfur Trioxide - A leak in the truck unloading hose. \n\nALTERNATIVE FLAMMABLE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n         A release of Trimethylamine from a process transfer line.  The release results in a fireball.  No mitigation or administrative control is assumed.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n       The DuPont Belle Plant processes follow the requirements of DuPont Corporate Safety, Health and Environmental (SHE) Standard S21A, \"Process Safety Management\".  This standard includes and embraces the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.\nThe DuPont Belle Plant safety programs include:\n\nDesigning for Safety:\n             o  A documented process technology system covering hazards of \n                 materials, equipment design basis, and process design basis.\n             o  Extensive accident pr"
