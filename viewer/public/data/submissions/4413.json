      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nWashington Steel reviews the properties of each material used at the facility to ensure that the material is handled in a way that minimizes the potential for accidental releases that could endanger public health or the environment.  The company's processes and equipment are designed to meet industry-specific design codes and standards (where established) and the company employs industry-accepted practices in its operations.  All federal and state regulations that pertain to the materials and processes are complied with.  Where appropriate, written procedures are developed and employees are trained to ensure that they perform their jobs safely and without incident.\n\nKnowing that releases may occur in spite of the company's efforts to prevent them, Washington Steel has developed a document that sets forth the procedures to be followed in the event of a release.  This document describes the types of releases facility employees should anticipate, defines the procedures to be followed in dealing with the releases, identifies the persons and agencies to be notified in the event of a release and to be called upon in the event assistance is needed and establishes the internal chain of command.  The document also describes the actions to be taken in conjunction with the Washington County LEPC in the event the release has the potential to affect persons offsite. \n\nSOURCES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nWashington Steel finishes stainless steel sheet and strip at the Washington Plant.  The company uses a dilute solution that contains hydrofluoric acid and other ingredients in a production process known as pickling.  The hydrofluoric acid purchased for use in the process is stored as a 70% solution in a 10,000-gallon aboveground tank.  The acid is transferred from the storage tank to the pickling tubs by pipelines as needed to maintain the strength of the solution.\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\nThe worst-case relea"

      "SummaryText": "se scenario would result from the failure of the hydrofluoric acid storage tank when it is full.  Although the acid released from the tank would be contained in a diked area beneath the tank, EPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance predicts the distance to the toxic endpoint at 0.43 miles from the tank.  Within 0.43 miles of the tank are residences, public recreational areas and commercial and industrial areas, none of which would be considered major.  Approximately 2,200 people reside within the area based on 1990 Census data for the City of Washington and Canton Township.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\nA release that is more likely to occur than the failure of the hydrofluoric acid storage tank and that would reach an endpoint offsite if it occurred is a release from a section of the pipeline that conveys acid from the storage tank to the pickle tubs that runs outside the building.  Based on the facility's assessment, a leak in the pipeline would release less than 1/2 gallon per minute and could last as long as 2 hours in certain situations.  EPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance predicts the distance to the toxic endpoint from this type of release at 0.06 miles from the point of the leak.  Within 0.06 miles of the leak location are 3 residences.  It is estimated that 14 people reside within the area.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nWashington Steel has used 70% hydrofluoric acid in its pickling process for more than 50 years.  During that time, relatively few releases have occurred.  This is due to the fact that the company uses equipment that is compatible with the acid and designed for its intended service, inspects the equipment routinely and trains its operations and maintenance personnel to carry out their duties safely. \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nWashington Steel has had only one accident involving 70% hydrofluoric acid in the past five years.  The accident occurred on 1/21/99.  One em"

      "SummaryText": "ployee was injured in the accident.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nWashington Steel's existing emergency response program was prepared in cooperation with the Washington County LEPC.  The program includes measures to respond to releases internally, identifies outside contractors the company can call upon for support, and provides telephone numbers to call if it becomes necessary to notify the public or request assistance from response agencies (fire, medical, etc.).  Washington Steel personnel, who are familiar with the properties of and hazards posed by 70% hydrofluoric acid, are trained in the procedures to follow in the event of a release.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nWashington Steel plans to replace the existing hydrofluoric acid storage tank with a new tank.  The existing mild steel tank has reached the end of its useful life.  The new tank, which has already been purchased and delivered, has been designed to meet the latest industry guidelines for 70% hydrofluoric acid storage.\n\nWashington Steel also plans to enclose the section of the hydrofluoric acid pipeline that runs along the outside of the plant buildings when it is time to replace the line.  This is the section of the pipeline that was modeled and reported in the alternative release scenario.  By enclosing the pipeline, the consequence of a leak will be significantly lessened."
