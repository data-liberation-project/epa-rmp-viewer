This process includes chlorine gas injectors for wastewater, storage of two 1-ton cylinders for wastewater.  The prevention program for the chlorine system consist of a written Risk Management Plan (RMP) that addresses each of the elements required by EPA' RMP program.  The plan includes procedures for employee particapation and training.. process safety information, mechanical intergrity, pre-startup safety reviews, operationing procedures, incident investigation, compliance audits, and emergency response.

The plant is permitted for a monthly average discharge of 2.0 million gallons per day (mgd).  The facility uses oxidation ditch activated sludge process to treat the incoming wastewater flow. The treated, clear effluent water is disinfected using chlorine prior to discharge.\n\nThe plant handles one regulated substance in excess of the Environmental Protection Agency's threshold limit for accedental release prevention.  The facility receives and stores chlorine in one ton cylinders.  The maximum number of cylinders on site is two.  Chlorine gas is greenish yellow in color and liquid chlorine has a clear amber color.  Chlorine is non-explosive and it's odor is easily detectable at very low concentrations.\n\nTo help in the prevention of accidental releases of chlorine, the Garden City Water Pollution Control Plant's safety program includes maintaining the equipment to insure proper operation by qualified personnel who receive on the job training in chlorine handling safety.\n\nIn the past five years, the Garden City Water Pollution Contol Plant has had no accidental releases of chlorine.\n\nThe Garden City Water Pollution Control Plant emergency response consist of personnel trained to respond quickly and safely to emergencies.  The plant personnel are instructed to notiify the Garden City Fire Department of any emergencies."
