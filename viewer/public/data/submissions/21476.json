(\"AmeriGas\") is the nation?s largest distributor of propane in the United States, with over 600 retail locations, 300 satellite locations, and 12 terminal locations. We operate in 45 states with over 5,500 employees. We are the industry leader in gallons distributed and customers served, and we continuously strive to be the industry leader in safety innovation and practices. We constantly endeavor to improve our safety performance as it relates to our employees, our customers, the environment and the general public with whom we work. \n\nAmeriGas staffs a professional Safety Department at our Corporate Headquarters in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania. AmeriGas also has six Regional Safety Managers, an Operations Safety Manager, a Safety & Technology Manager,  and a Logistics & Supply Safety Manager strategically located throughout the United States. These safety professionals are able to immediately respond to a serious incident and provide technical expertise to emergency response agencies on the scene of the incident. AmeriGas also has a 24-hours-a -day Emergency Communications Center, which handles all after-hours and emergency calls from around the country. Located in Rocklin, California, the ECC has the ability to contact AmeriGas field personnel on any type of incident encountered at any AmeriGas location, or by AmeriGas customers.  \n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PROGRAM\n\nAt this facility we store and distribute butane, which is considered a regulated flammable substance by the EPA. The same properties that make butane valuable as a fuel also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling propane to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce potential hazards to our own personal health and safety as well as our coworkers, and to reduce the potential hazard to nearby members of the community. It is our Company?s policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, state and local rules and regulations. Safe handling of "

Butane is used by our customers as a gasoline additive. Butane is received by pipeline, railcar, ship or transport truck and stored in 2 bulk storage tanks of 13 million gallon capacity each. Butane is distributed to customers by transport trucks. This facility has equipment for unloading transport trucks, railcars and ships. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nThe regulated substance handled at this facility is butane. \n\nThe maximum amount of butane that can be stored at this facility is 115,310,647 pounds. \n\n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATIVE SCENARIO\n\nWorst-case and Alternative Scenario Information is contained in the appropriate Sections of this Risk Management Plan. \n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN, ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PROGRAM AND SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThis AmeriGas butane storage and distribution facility complies with the EPA?s Accidental Release Prevention Rule and all applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58. All of our drivers have been thoroughly trained using the National Propane Gas Association?s Certified Employee Training Program (CETP). The worst-case scenario and alternative scenario have an extremely small chance of occurring. Our butane storage tanks are designed for butane service and may remain in service indefinitely. Our preventative maintenance program ensures that our bulk storage tanks are structurally sound, are maintained regularly, and are inspected per industry standards and state law.\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThis facility "

On 9/15/96, a valve failure led to the release of 9,720 pounds of butane to the atmosphere, which quickly evaporated and dissipated. The Los Angeles City Fire Department responded to the facility and directed the emergency response efforts. There were no injuries and no damage to public or environmental receptors as a result of this release. \n \n\nEMEREGNCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe emergency response plan for this AmeriGas facility includes procedures for notification of the local fire, law enforcement and medical authorities, as well as notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n\nThis facility?s emergency response program is based upon the following publications and standards:\nNational Propane Gas Association (NPGA) LP-Gas Safety Handbooks: \n\"Guidelines for Developing Plant Emergency Procedures\" and \n\"How to Control LP-Gas Leaks and Fires.\" \nOccupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) Occupational Safety & Health Standards for General Industry (29 CFR 1910): \nSection 38, \"Employee Emergency Plan and Fire Prevention Plans\" and \nSection 120, \"Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response\" \nNational Fire Protection Association (NFPA): \nNFPA-58, the Liquefied Petroleum Gas Code and \nNFPA-54, the National Fuel Gas Code.  \n\nWe have discussed this program with the California Region 1 (Los Angeles County) Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Los Angeles Fire Department. A representative of the California Occupational Safety & Health Administration (CalOSH) visited and inspected this facility on March 15, 1995.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThis facility was constructed in 1974 and is in compliance with NFPA-58 Standard. AmeriGas acquired this facility from CalGas Propane Company in 1983. A major plant modification was completed by AmeriGas in 1983, in which a second bulk storage tank was added, a new compressor was installed, a transport unloading bulkhead was added, and the hydros"
