      "SummaryText": "Lang Ice Company is a manufacturer of ice for wholesale and retail sale.  As such, the company operates a mechanical refrigeration system, using anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant.\n\nThe system was installed in 1990, to make cubed ice.  The system capacity for ammonia is 20,130 lbs, most of which is stored in the receiver and ice-makers.  \n\nLang Ice Company has long been committed to employee safety and to being a good community neighbor.  To this end, Lang Ice maintains an active process safety management program to prevent accidental releases of ammonia.  \n\nThe facility is located in a residential section of the City of Chicago, approximately 3.5 miles south of the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal, and 3.5 miles east of Midway Airport.  The setting is urban.\n\nLang Ice Company personnel are trained to respond to and investigate minor releases.  However, for a major release, the facility would call upon the Chicago Fire Department for emergency response.  Facility personnel are trained in response actions which consist of minimizing damage to the facility while assisting the orderly evacuation of all personnel.  Lang Ice Company regularly evaluates and implements any appropriate measures to further improve safety. Upon submission of this RMP, Lang Ice intends to conduct a review of its PSM and RMP regulated ammonia system and its smaller, non-regulated system. Lang Ice will update this RMP as appropriate.\n\nIn the last five years, there was one reportable accident described in section six of this RMP."
