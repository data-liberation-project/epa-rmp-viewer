The incidental releases include leaks encountered when installing the cylinders for use, dismantling the chlorine cylinders, and any minor release found upon inspection or testing of the equipment. Proper handling equipment is maintained at the plant for use in the incidental release situations. Major releases or problems encountered with the smaller releases will be handled by outside assistance. The plant will contact the City of Longview Fire Department for assistance with chemical releases. The local Hazmat team will then be contacted by the fire department if needed. The First Call emergency contact system is available for facilities in Gregg County. The fire department will initiate contact with the First Call program for emergency notification assistance.\n\nThe City of Longview Emergency Response Plan for Hazardous Material Incidents is identified in detail in the RMP with copies of the forms for emergency notification.
