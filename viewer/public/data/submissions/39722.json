To meet this objective McCain Foods USA, Inc. (McCain Foods) has developed a Hazard Assessment detailing the potential effects of an accidental release; provided an accident history of the last five years; completed an evaluation of worst-case and alternative accidental releases; documented McCain Foods\u00bf Prevention Program that includes safety precautions and maintenance, monitoring, and employee training measures; and, developed an outline McCain Foods Emergency Response Program that spells out emergency health care, employee training measures and procedures for informing the public and response agencies (e.g. the fire department) should an accident occur. \n\nMcCain Foods utilizes and stores anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant, which makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions during ammonia use to prevent human exposure, reduce the threat to workers\u00bf personal health, the surrounding community and the environment.  It is McCain Foods\u00bf policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state regulations.  Safety depends directly on the proper handling of ammonia combined with the safety devices that are incorporated in our facility and the safe handling procedures that personnel are trained in.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\nMcCain Foods located at 801 Rockwell Avenue in Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin, is a food product manufacturing facility with approximately 350 employees.  McCain Foods is required to develop and implement a RMP as issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), based on exceedence of t"

McCain Foods\u00bf production of frozen foods utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia, readily recognized by its distinctive odor, is a compressed gas with extremely toxic vapors which irritate the eyes and skin. Although classified as non-flammable by the DOT, in confined spaces anhydrous ammonia can accumulate to a flammable concentration and create an explosive environment.\nExposure pathways for anhydrous ammonia include inhalation which may cause irritation, lack of sense of smell, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, difficulty breathing, head ache, lung damage, and long-term inhalation can cause digestive disorders; eyes which causes irritation, frostbite, tearing, blindness, and glaucoma; skin which may cause severe irritation, blisters, and frostbite; and ingestion which may cause irritation, difficulty breathing, and kidney damage. \nInventory of anhydrous ammonia at McCain Foods is equal to 37,633 pounds (lbs.) throughout the entire system which includes the following vessels with associated maximum anhydrous ammonia capacities:  \nOutside High Pressure Receiver \u00bf 13,783 lbs.\nOutside Intercooler \u00bf 11,661 lbs.\nFES Recirculator \u00bf 4,179 lbs.\nRECO \u00bf40 Recirculator \u00bf 3,692 lbs.\nFES Intercooler \u00bf 1,582 lbs.\nVilter Recirulator \u00bf 1,368 lbs.\nRECO \u00bf20 Recirculator \u00bf 1,368 lbs.\n\nPotential hazards that could lead to an accidental release include, but are not limited to, equipment failure, damage to piping, damage to equipment, and human error.    \n \nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program at McCain Foods includes:\n\u00b7\tRegular completion of a process hazard analysis.\n\u00b7\tUse of process controls such as vents, relief valves, check valves, manual/automatic shutoff, interlocks, alarms and procedures, backup pump, and purge system.\no\tElectronic ammonia detection in machine room, outside in main relief head"
