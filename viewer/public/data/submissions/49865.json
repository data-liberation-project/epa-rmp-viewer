This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, training of highly qualified personnel, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our facility process. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent chemical releases. However, if a release does occur, our personnel are trained and equipped to quickly respond to, control/contain, and mitigate the release.\n\nGeorgia Gulf Lake Charles, LLC is committed to the Responsible Care Management System? program, a voluntary initiative for the safe management of chemicals and processes, and meeting the needs of our stakeholders. Georgia Gulf Lake Charles, LLC follows the Responsible Care Management System?, which is integral to the development and implementation of our Environmental and Health and Safety policies. Georgia Gulf Lake Charles, LLC continues to improve our Community Awareness and Emergency Response Procedures to assist in emergency preparedness and foster community right to know.  This is further demonstrated by Georgia Gulf Lake Charles, LLC's involvement in outside agencies and willingness to provide an open line of communication with the community.\n\nGeorgia Gulf Lake Charles, LLC is located in Westlake, Louisiana.  The facility came into existence on November 13, 1999 as part of the Vinyls acquisition by Georgia Gulf Corporation and Affiliates from CONDEA Vista Company.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n \nThe facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of employees who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\nThe PHA team findings are made available to those individuals associated with the process unit for comments and forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest rank receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA findings are tracked through completion. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nOperators, supervisors, and plant engineers work together to develop and maintain operating procedures. These procedures define how tasks related to process operations are safely performed. At Georgia Gulf Lake Charles, LLC, operating procedures are: (1) used to train employees, and (2) serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.\n\nOperating procedures include:\n- Steps for safely conducting activities,\n- Applicable process safety information, such as safe operating limits,\n- Safety and health considerations, such as chemical hazards, personnel protective equipment"

The training program includes both initial and refresher training.\n\nAll new operators receive comprehensive training before being assigned to the operating unit. This training includes training on specific types of equipment, such as pumps and compressors, general overview of the process, properties and hazard substances in the process, detailed review of plant procedures, such as, safe work practices and emergency response. Written tests are used to verify that employees understand the training material before a new employee can report to a process unit. \n\nOnce the new employee reports to the unit, detailed training with respect to the process and specific procedures is given to the employee. Once the new hire has demonstrated, through written tests and demonstration of learned skills, mastery of process specific operating procedures, the employee is allowed to begin work.\n \nRefresher training covers (1) a general overview of the process, (2) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process and, (3) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices. Written tests are used to verify that employees understand the training before an employee can resume work in the process.
