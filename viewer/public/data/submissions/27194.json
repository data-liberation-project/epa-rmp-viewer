Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nWe at Texoma Ag-Products, Inc. in Devol, Oklahoma  are strongly committed to employee, public,\r\nand environmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental\r\nrelease prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures,\r\nmaintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to\r\nimplement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release\r\ndoes occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects\r\nof the release.  We also coordinate our response efforts with the Cotton County LEPC, which\r\nprovides additional emergency response expertise.\r\n\r\n  2.   Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\r\nammonia stored in one 18,000-gallon tank and one 12,000 gallon tank at our facility in    \r\nDevol, Oklahoma (Figure 1).  The maximum amount stored is 25,500 gallons (131,223 pounds) at\r\nthe maximum fill capacity of 85%.\r\n\r\n  3.   Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\r\nWe utilized RMP Comp for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite\r\nconsequence analysis for our facility.  The following details these scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of one of the \r\nlargest single anhydrous ammonia storage tanks (80,000 pounds) in gaseous form over a 10-minute\r\nperiod.  We anticipated that administrative controls or mitigation would not effect the release rate. \r\nAt Class F atmospheric stability, 1"

Radius2 x 3.14 = area\r\nof circle. 1.5 miles2 x 3.14 x 75 people = approximately 530 people within 1.5 mile radius of the site. \r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario involves a release from vehicular collision with the tank resulting\r\nin a pipe break and the release of anhydrous ammonia through a 1\" dia. hole in the anhydrous\r\nammonia product line.  Vehicular collision (RMP Hazard Review, Section 8.4) was selected as the\r\nmost probable causal agent for an alternative release scenario.  The scenario involves the release of\r\n5,000 pounds of ammonia in a gaseous form over a period of two minutes.  Active mitigation\r\n(emergency shutoff) limited the release to two minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the\r\nmaximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of ammonia is 0.4 mile (Figure 3).
