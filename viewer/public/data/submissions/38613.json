      "SummaryText": "Facility Accidental Release Policy:  The management and employees of Walla Walla Farmers Co-op, Inc. at 111 North 9th., Walla Walla, Washington 99362, branch operations at 113 South D Street, Prescott, Washington 99348, and 5003 West Brinkley Road, Kennewick, Washington 99338, are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of Anhydrous Ammonia and Aqua Ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and the Walla Walla County Emergency Management as well as other entities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and to the environment. A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.  2.  The primary activity at the Walla Walla Facility is the manufacturing of Aqua Ammonia by the conversion of water and Anhydrous Ammonia, as well as the storage, distribution and sale of fertilizers to farmers to enhance crop production.  Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored and converted to Aqua Ammonia and then distributed to the branches at Kennewick and Prescott as well as at Walla Walla for agricultural use in the fertilizing of farm crops.  3.  Accidental Release Prevention Program:  The facility has implemented the provisions of the \"Safety Requirements for Storaage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc.  4.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety:  Safety improvement is an on-going process at this facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenaance of safe conditions at the facility.  In the year 2001 within the months of July and August Walla Walla Farmers Co-op, Inc. and Walla Walla County Emergency Management worked jointly developing emergency and response procedures as a measure for better preparedness should an emergency situation take place involving the Anhydrous Ammonia and Aqua Ammonia."
