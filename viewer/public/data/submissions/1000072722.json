These resources include safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the process at the East Toyah Gas Processing Facility (East Toyah) and training of operations personnel and contractors.   KNTK implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. Kinetik places emphasis on prevention, prompt detection, and expeditious correction of unsafe conditions by periodically conducting internal inspections and regularly training responsible personnel.  Should a release occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release and prevent or mitigate any off-site consequences.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\nEast Toyah, located in Reeves County, Texas, is owned by KNTK.  East Toyah is a natural gas processing plant comprising natural gas liquid recovery, gas liquids fractionation, and gas treatment and compression equipment.  Produced gas and liquids are delivered to the East Toyah Facility from gathering systems and pipelines.  The natural gas liquid recovery equipment is designed to recover natural gas liquids from the inlet gas.  East Toyah produces natural gas, natural gas liquids, and stabilized condensate.  The East Toyah equipment operates to separate, stabilize, treat (as necessary to remove hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide), compress (gas), dehydrate (gas), store (natural gas liquids and stabilized condensate), and transfer gas, natural gas liquids, and stabilized condensate to sales.  Natural gas and Natural Gas Liquids are transported by pipeline from East Toyah, and stabilized condensate is transported by cargo tank motor vehicles.\nThe listed flammable substance above the threshold quantities at the East Toyah is a flammable mixture containing metha"

The East Toyah complies with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements and Program 1 requirements of the U.S. EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Risk Management Program (RMP). \n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\nImplementation of appropriate administrative and technological safeguards in the process ensures the safety of workers and the surrounding community.  The East Toyah process has been designed using current equipment design codes and standards with appropriate safety controls.  The process design includes control systems to maintain operating parameters, such as temperature, pressures, flow, and level within allowable limits.  \nWritten operating procedures for the process are developed, maintained, and periodically reviewed for safe operations.  Personnel operating the process are trained on the operating procedures to familiarize them with the consequences of exceeding allowable safety and operability limits and steps to correct deviation from normal operating parameters.  \n\nKNTK has implemented safe work practices to help ensure worker and process safety at the East Toyah Gas Plant.  Examples of these include: (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel; (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance; (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping and equipment is opened; (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work); and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures, along with training of involved personnel, form a system to ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely."

      "SummaryText": "Specific Prevention Steps\nHazards in the process at the East Toyah Plant are continually managed to ensure safe operations.  The accident prevention program is applied throughout the RMP covered process at East Toyah and covers all individually listed flammable substances and regulated flammable mixtures.  The prevention program is designed and implemented to prevent accidental releases that could be caused by equipment failures and/or human errors.  Safety features are incorporated into the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of East Toyah to help prevent, quickly detect, and control a release, and to reduce the consequences of a release.  \n\nThe following types of safety features are used in the covered process: \nRelease Containment and Control\nProcess relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and combust releases.\nValves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\nAutomatic shutdown systems for specific process parameters. \nContainment areas to contain liquid releases.\nDual mechanical seals on hydrocarbon liquid pumps, where feasible. \nTotal plant emergency shutdown (ESD) system.\nRelease Mitigation\nPortable fire extinguishers. \nPersonnel trained in emergency response and procedures.\nPersonal protective equipment.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nEast Toyah has an excellent record of accident prevention and has no accident history.\n\nEmergency Response Program Information\nKNTK maintains written emergency procedures at East Toyah to protect worker and public safety and the environment.  These include procedures for a fire or explosion and notification of local emergency response agencies in the event of an accidental release.  Employees are trained on the emergency procedures and the procedures are updated as needed when the process or facility is modified.  Changes to the emergency procedures are administered through the Management of Change process.\nThe overall emergency response program for East Toyah is coordinated with the Reeves"
