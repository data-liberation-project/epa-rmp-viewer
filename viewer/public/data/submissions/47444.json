      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary (40 CFR 68.155)\n\nBackground Data\n\nIn accordance with Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, chapter 68 (40 CFR 68) promulgated by the Federal Environmental Administration (EPA), TRANSFLO Terminal Services, Inc. has prepared this Risk Management Plan (RMP) for operations involving pentane at their Philadelphia, PA  East facility.  The TTSI terminal provides Transloading services of bulk products between rail and truck transportation modes.  The Philadelphia East TRANSFLO terminal has been in operation since 1990.  The terminal is located at 52 East Oregon Avenue, Philadelphia, PA.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nTRANSFLO is committed to protecting the health and safety of its employees, contract operators, the surrounding community and the environment; therefore it is TRANSFLO policy to maintain compliance with 40 CFR 68.\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nTRANSFLO will handle pentane at this terminal, transloading product from railroad tank cars into highway cargo trailers in quantities in excess of 8,000 gallons per cargo trailer which will exceed the 10,000 pound threshold quantity listed in 40 CFR 68, Appendix A.\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\nAs required by 40 CFR 68 Subpart B, TRANSFLO has evaluated a worst-case release scenario for pentane using the parameters specified by the EPA.  TRANSFLO?s worst-case release scenario is the rupture of a single railroad tank car with subsequent product release over a 10-minute period.  In developing the release parameters of the worst-case scenario, TRANSFLO has not considered any passive mitigation measures.  Using the EPA?s RMP*Comp software program, it was determined that the distance to the toxic endpoint in this scenario has the potential to result in a release with offsite consequences.  The worst-case release scenario was developed following EPA regulations and is considered to have an extremely low probability of occurrence.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nTRANS"

      "SummaryText": "FLO also evaluated several other release scenarios considered to have a higher level probability of occurrence (although stall a very low probability) based upon a review of over 10 years of incident data from chemical transloading operations.  This 10 year period included the safe handling of over 500,000 rail to truck chemical transloads.  After a careful review of both the worst-case and alternative release scenarios, TRANSFLO has decided to include one alternative release scenario into the RMP document.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario identified by TRANSFLO is the failure of a product transfer hose.  In developing the parameters of Alternative Release Scenario 1, TRANSFLO considered the average response time of terminal personnel to control the release and safely shut the transfer unit down.   Using the EPA RMP*Comp software program and EPA?s RMP offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance Document, the distance to the flammable endpoint in the alternative release scenario has the potential to result in minor site consequences at a distance much less than the worst-case scenario and would largely be limited to terminal property itself.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nTo prevent and mitigate accidental releases of pentane, TRANSFLO has implemented several precautionary measures:\n\n?TRANSFLO has developed standard operating procedures (SOP?S) for the Transloading of pentane from railcar to cargo trailers for use by trained and qualified personnel.\n?TRANSFLO encourages contract operator employees to voice concerns, offer suggestions and contribute to procedures, policies and processes involving this product.  Employees are expected to follow established procedures until employee driven process changes are implemented, training conducted and communicated to all affected persons.\n?TRANSFLO conducts operational audits and inspections to insure compliance with established operating procedures, maintenance of transfer equipment and facility physical systems.\n?A doc"

These processes include preventative maintenance of the transfer unit to maintain on-board safety and control systems.\n\nThe transfer unit has been designed and constructed to meet or exceed the requirements outlined in the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Flammable and Combustible Liquids Code (2003 ed.).  A review of the National Fire Code finds this operation is in compliance with all requirements of the code.\n\nTRANSFLO will conduct initial familiarization sessions with the local emergency responders as part of the terminals emergency action plan (EAP).   In addition, the following agencies inspect the TRANSFLO terminal on a regular basis:\n\nU.S. Department of Transportation- Federal Railroad Administration- Hazardous Materials Inspectors.  \n\nPA Department of Environmental Protection\n\n\n\n\nFive- Year Accident History\n\nTRANSFLO has not handled pentane at this facility during the past five years.  There are not accident or releases to report.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nTRANSFLO and the contract operator have documented emergency response plans and procedures in place at this facility to respond to and safety mitigates any release or accident involving pentane.  Included in the emergency response plan are measures to be taken internally by TRANSFLO contract operators to control the release, if possible, and to make initial notification to local responders and to TRANSFLO headquarters.\n\nOperator personnel at the terminal are trained to the Hazardous Materials Operations level as outlined in 29 CFR 1910.120 Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response.  These employees may also perform activities under the specialist employee definition as defined by 1910.120.
