Using natural gas extracted from the Cook Inlet region, approximately 3,800 tons of ammonia and 3,500 short tons of urea are manufactured at this plant daily. Four substances are present in quantities greater than the RMP thresholds, including two toxic chemicals (ammonia and chlorine), and two flammable gases (methane and hydrogen). \n\nThe plant is located 10 miles north of Kenai on the Spur Highway in an industrial area of Nikiski.  The surrounding area is heavily forested and mostly rural, with small commercial operations along the highway and several side-roads leading to small subdivisions.  The full-time population living within one-half mile of the plant is less than 20, and less than 200 residents live within one mile of the plant.  The plant is situated on a bluff overlooking Cook Inlet to the west, approximately 80 feet above sea level.  It is bounded by industrial sites to the north and east, and a cleared field graded for industrial development to the south.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION and EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\nPrograms and procedures have been implemented to prevent fires, explosions, and releases of hazardous substances.  If such events do occur, then emergency response programs and procedures are in place to protect the safety and health of plant personnel and the surrounding community, and to minimize any environmental impact.  These programs and procedures are contained in the plant's Hazardous Materials Release Prevention, Control and Countermeasures Plan (RPCC).  The RPCC fulfills all applicable federal, state, and local emergency preparedness and contingency planning requirements.  \n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe plant is subject to the Program 3 Prevention Program requirement.  RMP Program 3 Prevention Program elements include process safety information, process hazard analysis, ope"

These requirements mirror OSHA 1910.119 Process Safety Management (PSM) prevention program elements, but with an off-site focus.  Since the plant is a PSM-regulated facility, these prevention program elements have been previously developed and implemented.  Modifications to these programs have been made to incorporate off-site considerations, to meet RMP requirements.\n\nIn addition to these PSM/RMP mandated programs, the safety program at the plant is designed to make safety and accident prevention an integral part of day-to-day operation.  The plant adopted a comprehensive safety management system in 1988 designed by the International Loss Control Institute, which provided a systematic approach to identify potentially unsafe acts or conditions and to increase safety awareness.  Since that time, this management system has been changed and fine-tuned to enhance its usefulness and address Plant-specific issues.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe plant has a 125-member emergency response team, trained and equipped to respond to chemical and fire emergencies.  The Incident Command System structure is used, and an emergency response plan is in place.  In the event that additional assistance or greater expertise is required, an emergency response strike team is contracted to provide immediate response.  Through a Mutual Aid Agreement between emergency responders and local industry, the plant conducts joint fire response and hazardous material awareness training with various fire departments in the Borough.  The Nikiski Fire Department is familiar with the plant and prepared to respond to an emergency if necessary.\n\nThe plant maintains an active membership on the Kenai Peninsula Borough Emergency Planning Committee, and is continually working with other committee members t"

For releases that could potentially impact the community, the plant emergency siren would be initiated, and the Borough would be asked to activate the Community Alert Network (computerized call-down system) to notify people in the area of potential impact.  The plant has provided the community with instructions on how to shelter in place to help people protect themselves during a chemical release.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe plant had two releases that meet the RMP criteria for reporting in the past five years.  These releases resulted in minor injuries to employees in the immediate area and/or property damage to the plant.  There were no offsite losses or injuries resulting from the releases.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\nThere are extensive programs, procedures, and controls in place at the plant that make particular offsite consequence scenarios very unlikely to occur.  Process units are designed to codes and standards, automated controllers keep the process operating within safe limits, critical systems are equipped with redundant protection, pressure relief valves and overflow lines are located throughout the plant, and the process is equipped with monitoring systems and alarms and automatic shutdown systems.  Other examples of safety systems and controls at the plant include well-trained employees, routine inspections, preventive maintenance, emergency ammonia flares, safe work practices, standard operating procedures, and administrative procedures.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nSafety improvement projects receive a high priority when allocating capital budget.  For example, in the past 10 years, $13.2 million dollars were spent installing emergency flares to prevent ammonia releases.  In addition, safety recommendations are continually generated from process hazard analyses and incident investi"
