The Facility Policy: The owners, management and employees of this facility are committed to the\n\nprevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular\n\ninspections and maintenance, and training of all persons that work with the material. Should an accidental\n\nrelease occur, the facility has coordinated with the local fire department and emergency planning committee\n\nso they may plan for a response to an anhydrous ammonia release and minimize the impact of the release to\n\nthe public and the environment.\n\n\n\n2. Facility Information: The primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to\n\nfarmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a crop production\n\nnutrient.\n\n\n\n3. Worst Case and Alternate Case Release Scenarios: The worst case and alternate case release scenarios are\n\nnot listed in the executive summary for security reasons.\n\n\n\n4. The Accidental Release Program: This facility complies with the rules and regulations relating to the\n\nhandling of anhydrous ammonia, equipment and storage Facilities. These regulations administered by the\n\nstate Insurance Department are consistent with ANSI K61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding the storage\n\nand handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\n5. The Five Year Accident History: There has been no accidental release of anhydrous ammonia for the\n\ncovered process in the past five years that has resulted in any onsite deaths, injuries or property damage or\n\nto the best of our knowledge any offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage\n\nor environmental damage.\n\n\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program: This facility has a written emergency action plan in accordance with\n\nOSHA Standard 29 CFR 191"
