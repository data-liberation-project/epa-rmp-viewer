              "Description": "The St. Cloud Water Treatment Facility (WTF) falls under the EPA RMP 40 CFR Part 68 and OSHA PSM 29 CFR 1910.120 regulations for having an inventory on-site of chlorine gas over the threshold quanity of 2,500-lbs.  In lieu of these regulations, the St. Cloud WTF has developed a prevention program to eliminate injury and/or death to the St. Cloud WTF employees and the surrounding public in case of an accidental release.  Section 1: Introduction, Purpose and Management System - is to ensure that everyone who plays a part in the RMProgram understands their roles and responsibilities and those responsibilities are assigned for all program elements.  Section 2: Employee Participation Plan - is to define how employees willbe involved in the RMProgram.  The St. Cloud WTF will provide an overview of the RMProgram, provide access to all RMProgram information required to safely perform their duties and will provide procedures on how to obtain this information.  Designated employees are listed under each program element.  Section 3: Process Safety Information - is to provide process safety information pertaining to the hazards of chlorine gas, the technology of the process and the equipment used in this process.  This is accomplished through annual employee right-to-know training.  Section 4: Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) - describes how the St. Cloud WTF will handle PHA to identify, evaluate and control the risks associated with chlorine gas hazards.  The overall purpose of the PHA is to prevent or minimize the effects of an accidental chlorine gas release.  Section 5: Operating Procedures - is to ensure that the St. Cloud WTF maintains up-to-date and accurate written Standard Operating Procedures (SOP's) that provide clear instruction for the chlorination process.  SOP's for changing a cylinder, response to a leak while changing a cylinder, loading and unloading a cylinder are some of the procedures written in this section.  Section 6: Training - is to ensure that personnel working on or near chlorine is adequately trained and understands the inherent process hazards and appropriate response and action to an accidental chlorine release.  Section 7: Contractor Responsibility - is to ensure that only contractors with good health and safety programs are selected to perform work on and around the chlorine system.  Employer and contractor responsibilities are assigned.  Section 8: Pre-startup Review - is to ensure safe operation of new and modified regulated processes.  Section 9: Mechanical Integrity - is to establish, implement and maintain an ongoing mechanical integrity program that ensures process equipment and instrumentation to minimize the risk of an accidental chlorine gas release.  Section 10: Hot Work Permit - is to ensure that a hot work permit is issued for all hot work operations conducted on or near the chlorination system.  Section 11: Managing Change - is to make sure any system changes are properly reviewed against the original system specifications and be accomplished safely.  Section 12: Incident Investigation - is to document and investigate all incidents including \"near misses\" involving the release of chlorine gas to determine cause(s) an order to prevent reoccurance.  Section 13: Emergency Response Plan (ERP) - is to establish a procedure for the timely mitigation of hazardous material incidents within the property of the St. Cloud WTF.  ERP training is completed for all new employees and is reviewed on an annual basis for all other employees.  Section 14: Compliance Audits - is to ensure audits are performed to evaluate the St. Cloud WTF's process safety and risk management programs.  The audit will assist with the identification of recommendations to address program deficiencies.",

This regulation is applicable to the St. Cloud WTF because the maximum inventory of chlorine gas stored at the facility is greater than the threshold limit of 2,500-lbs.  The maximum amount of chlorine on-site at the facility is 18,000-lbs.  \n\nThe St. Cloud WTF uses chlorine to disinfect the drinking water supply to the 66,000 residents of St. Cloud and the 3,000 residents of St. Augusta. \n\nA requirement of the RMP is to complete an off-site analysis assessment if an accidental release of chlorine gas would occur.  A worst-case scenerio and an alternate-case scenario was described.  An assessment of these scenarios is documented and stored in the RMP documents.  \n\nThere have been no reportable accidents at the St. Cloud WTF in the last five years.\n\nActive administrative and mitigation control measures are utilized to prevent an accidental release.  Chlorine gas detectors are in place and checked monthly.  An audible alarm will sound if chlorine gas is detected.  An accidental release of chlorine gas would take place in an enclosed building, slowing the release rate and decreasing the distance of travel.  A chlorine scrubber at the St. Cloud WTF is an active mitigation tool in place at the facility that will neutralize a chlorine gas leak, if one would occur.\n\nThe goal of the Prevention Program is to reduce the risks associated with an accidental release of chlorine gas and prevent injury to the WTF employees and the surrounding public.  This is accomplished by specifying responsibilities and outlining safety procedures that will prevent and/or contain a chlorine gas release.\n\nThe City of St. Cloud Water Utility has developed an "

The plan identifies necessary administrative and employee actions that shall be taken during the event of an emergency.  The St. Cloud WTF maintains and updates the written emergency procedures annually.  \n\nElements addressed in the EAP include escape procedures and exit routes, critical plant operations, accounting for employees, rescue and medical duties, reporting emergencies, alarm systems and notification of emergencies and types of evacuations.\n\nThe Public Utilities Administration is committed to safety by providing annual employee right to know, bloodborne pathogen, lock out - tag out, emergency action plan, risk management plan and confined space entry procedure training.  Administration supports regular Hazard Control Committee Meetings and Monthly City Safety Committee Meetings and provides personal protection equipment to all employees.
