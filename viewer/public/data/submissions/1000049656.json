      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nTrident Seafoods Corporation St. Paul shore plant employs up to 280 people on a seasonal basis.  The facility processes primarily crab and halibut.    Anhydrous ammonia is used to freeze and store product and utilizes the Process Safety Management program developed by OSHA and the Risk Management Program (RMP) from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to operate and maintain their refrigeration system.  The RMP is submitted to the EPA to meet the requirements of Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, codified in the Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) Title 40 Part 68 \n\nThere is a management system designating program responsibilities.  A specific person is responsible for each section of the program.  Most sections are reviewed yearly, revised and updated.  Every five years a process hazard analysis is completed or revalidated for the entire system.  A written follow up report is generated and recommendations documented.  Every three years a compliance audit is performed and program components are reviewed in order to examine and improve our program. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program \n\nThe ammonia system uses 11,300 pounds of anhydrous ammonia to chill, and brine freeze crab.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant in cold storage, blast freezers, plate freezers and in the operation of a small ice making machine.  A worst case and alternate worse case scenario has been studied detailing the effects of ammonia releases.\n\nThe prevention program, complying with 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68, fosters employee participation.  Training is involved in every section of the program.  Knowledge starts with the components and equipment.  Standard operating procedures both detail and instruct process operation and maintenance procedures.  Any changes are documented to insure any modification is correctly designed, and properly installed by qualified contractors and maintenance persons.  All ha"

Any release over one hundred pounds in quantity, any reportable injury, or significant property damage is immediately reported.  All incidents are investigated and cause determined to prevent any re-occurrence.\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nTrident Seafoods St. Paul, Alaska has a written Emergency Action Plan.   Annual Hazwoper and refresher training is conducted for facility personnel.\n\nTrident Seafoods Corporation St. Paul plant actively promotes and improves safe work practices. This emphasis has resulted in a more efficiently run facility.\n\n"
