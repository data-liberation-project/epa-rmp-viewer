We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n *  A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n *  A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n *  An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n *  A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n *  An overview of our emergency response program\n *  An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n *  The certifications that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide\n *  The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nOur facility takes propane off the Cochin Pipeline, operated by Dome Pipeline Corporation, and stores it in 90,000 gallon above ground bullets.  Ethyl mercaptan, an odorant, is also stored at the terminal and is injected into the propane stream to odorize the propane prior to truck loading.  Due to the current court  order staying propane as a regulated chemical under the RM Plan, we are considering ethyl mercaptan to be our only regulated chemical on site.  All scenarios are consequently based on ethyl mercaptan.  The facility is completely automated and is available for around"

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\t\n\tNot Applicable\n\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\n\tNot Applicable\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nDome Pipeline Corporation has determined the worst case scenario at the Benson Propane Terminal is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) of a 1,000 gallon above ground ethyl mercaptan  storage bullet.  This bullet contains a maximum of 850 gallons (85% of storage capacity) of ethyl mercaptan.  This scenario was based on the remote possibility of the tank being compromised due to physical or mechanical damage.   The distance to 1 PSI overpressure has been calculated at .124 miles.

The area is also continuously monitored by computer supervised fire and gas detection systems.\t\n\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nDome Pipeline Corporation has reviewed several alternate release scenarios at the Benson Propane Terminal.  The scenario selected was a pool fire of ethyl mercaptan due to the failure of a welded nozzle at the bottom of the 1,000 gallon tank.  The scenario assumes a complete nozzle failure which would release the entire contents of the tank.  As much as 850 gallons(85% of maximum storage capacity) of ethyl mercaptan would be released and subject to a vapor cloud fire.  According to EPA's lookup tables, the distance to the Lower Flammable Limit (LFL) is less than .06 miles.  Based on 1990 census data, US Geological Survey maps and aerial photography, Dome Pipeline Corporation had determined there is  a  public receptor (a propane truck staging parking lot). No environmental receptors were found.  Control measures for ethyl mercaptan loading are:  (1) the area near the storage tanks is rocked or concrete, (2) a vegetation control program is in place, and (3) the facility is wired according to National Fire Protection Association Standard 70.
