              "Description": "Prevention Program Summary (?68.175)\n\nEthylene oxide and propylene oxide are reacted individually or in series with other raw materials to form the majority of our products.  Therefore, the use of EO and PO is considered as one process for our site.\n\nAll of the prevention program elements are common to both systems, except for two additional safeguards or mitigation measures on the EO storage.  Both EO and PO storage employ diking, pressure, temperature and level control and alarms, and suitable safety relief devices.  In addition, EO storage utilizes a cooling exchanger to keep the stored EO below 45?F and has a provision to send the EO through an emergency scrubber equipped with a sulfuric acid quench.  \n\nThe site Prevention Program is managed by the Plant Engineer and the Environmental Engineer and includes:\n    \n1) Employee Participation\nEmployees are encouraged to participate in site prevention programs to promote awareness and to allow input from all site personnel into managing the safety of our facility and personnel.  Specific means of employee participation in process safety and accident prevention are outlined in the Employee Participation procedure in the site PSM manual.\n\n2) Process Safety Information\nProcess Safety Information including piping and instrument diagrams, flow diagrams, material safety data sheets, technical data sheets, relief device calculations, equipment files for design specifications, etc. is maintained and readily accessible to all employees.  The PSI used for the initial PHA's and subsequent revalidations is listed with that particular PHA and includes pointers to the location of each piece of information.  \n\n3) Process Hazard Analysis\nInitial Process Hazard Analyses for all parts of our process were performed and are documented with appropriate reports.  Revalidations of these PHA's are being performed according to the OSHA PSM five-year schedule.  The findings of the PHA's, appropriate risk mitigation improvements, and responsible personnel are compiled into a spreadsheet which is used by the Project Engineer to track the mitigation to completion.\n\n4) Operating Procedures\nDocument-controlled standard operating procedures and manufacturing procedures are readily available to process operator to ensure safe and consistent operation of the process.  These procedures are annually reviewed and certified as being currently accurate and correct.\n\n5) Training\nA training program administers and tracks all requisite training which includes OSHA-mandated operator process training and refresher, emergency responses to spills, releases, fires, and explosions, and hazard awareness and control.  Training documentation and verification of understanding are kept in the central files.  Personnel records are also maintained and tracked electronically in the Virtual Training Assistant (VTA).\n\n6) Contractors \nContractors are selected based on their safety record and performance as documented on the required prequalification form.  Site orientation training on the hazards present and the safety and emergency procedures is administered to each contract employee before work on-site is allowed.  A post-project evaluation of the firm's safety performance is completed by site personnel to document adherence to site policies and procedures and safe work practices.\n\n7) Prestartup Safety Review\nPrestartup Safety Reviews of all equipment alterations are conducted to ensure hazards uncovered during the PHA phase of the project are corrected and that the equipment is ready for safe use.\n\n8) Mechanical Integrity\nA comprehensive mechanical integrity and preventive maintenance program is in place to monitor equipment integrity and performance and to ensure operation of all safety systems. \n\n9) Safe Work \nSafe Work, Hot Work, Lock out/Tag out and Confined Space Entry permit programs are used to safeguard personnel and prevent accidents and incidents caused by maintenance operations.\n\n10) Management of Change\nA procedure to manage all changes to equipment and facilities is used to ensure the hazards of the modification are mitigated and all personnel are informed of the alterations.  This procedure and the appropriate forms can be found in the site procedures manual.\n\n11) Incident Investigation\nThe site utilizes an incident, near miss and suggestion reporting database with whole site access to report safety, environmental, process and quality incidents and near incidents and to suggest improvements in any of these categories.  This database and accompanying procedure, provide for review and investigation by staff members, suggestion of corrective actions, tracking of completion of these actions and communication to appropriate personnel of incidents and steps taken to prevent recurrence.\n\n12) Compliance Audits\nSite personnel conduct audits of the facilities and systems to ensure potential hazards are detected and corrected and that site systems are functioning appropriately to prevent mishap.  In addition to the requisite compliance audits of the process safety and accident prevention systems, perfunctory audits are conducted on parts of these programs such as the safe work permitting system and inspection records.  However, only the compliance audits are officially documented and kept on file for review.",

It also reflects the addition of two new chemicals effective July 1, 2004.\nAt the Nalco Energy Services, L. P. Freeport Plant, we are committed to operating and to maintaining our process in a manner that is safe for our employees, the public and the environment.  As part of this commitment, we have established a Risk Management Program (RMP) that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Program (the RMP rule).  One element of the RMP rule is a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) which details accident prevention measures and safeguards.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of our risk management program.\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response planning programs are vital to ensure the safety of our employees, the community and the environment.  The Nalco Energy Services, L. P. Freeport Plant implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of the hazardous substances we use.  In the event of a significant accidental release, trained responders will act to control and contain the release.  We work with the local emergency response organizations to evaluate potential releases and to formulate appropriate responses to contain and to prevent and/or reduce the consequences of such a release.  Nalco Energy Services, L. P., in conjunction with the local emergency planning and response organizations, has established a means to warn the surrounding communities in the event of a release which would threaten the public.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nNalco Energy Services, L. P. operates a manufacturing facility at the Freeport site"
