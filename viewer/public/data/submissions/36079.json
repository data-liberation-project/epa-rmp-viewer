It also reflects the addition of two new chemicals effective July 1, 2004.\nAt the Nalco Energy Services, L. P. Freeport Plant, we are committed to operating and to maintaining our process in a manner that is safe for our employees, the public and the environment.  As part of this commitment, we have established a Risk Management Program (RMP) that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Program (the RMP rule).  One element of the RMP rule is a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) which details accident prevention measures and safeguards.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of our risk management program.\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response planning programs are vital to ensure the safety of our employees, the community and the environment.  The Nalco Energy Services, L. P. Freeport Plant implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of the hazardous substances we use.  In the event of a significant accidental release, trained responders will act to control and contain the release.  We work with the local emergency response organizations to evaluate potential releases and to formulate appropriate responses to contain and to prevent and/or reduce the consequences of such a release.  Nalco Energy Services, L. P., in conjunction with the local emergency planning and response organizations, has established a means to warn the surrounding communities in the event of a release which would threaten the public.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nNalco Energy Services, L. P. operates a manufacturing facility at the Freeport site"

Ethylene Oxide and Propylene Oxide are reacted individually or in series with other raw materials to form the majority of our products. In our oxyalkylation process, Ethylene Oxide and Propylene Oxide are the only RMP regulated chemicals that are present above the EPA threshold quantity. In our Formaldehyde Reaction process, Formaldehyde (50% aqueous) and Methylamine (50% aqueous) are the only RMP regulated chemicals present above the EPA threshold quantity.  For the purpose of this RMPlan, the use of EO and PO is considered as one process for our site:\n\nProgram Level      Regulated Substance        Type            \n           3                Ethylene Oxide               Toxic           \n           3                Propylene Oxide             Toxic              \n           3                Formaldehyde                 Toxic          \n           3                Methylamine                   Flammable   \n\n \n3.

General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nAccident prevention is our top priority and a vital part of our business. A number of programs are in place at our facility to prevent accidental releases and to ensure safe operation.  These programs include:\n\n\u00b7 Process Safety Information\n\u00b7 Process Hazard Analysis\n\u00b7 Incident reporting and investigation\n\u00b7 Mechanical Integrity Program\n\u00b7 Training Program\n\u00b7 Emergency Response \n\u00b7 Standard Operating Procedures\n\u00b7 Critical Safe Work Permitting System\n\u00b7 Management of Change System\n\u00b7 Prestartup Safety Reviews\n\u00b7 Contractor Safety Program\n\u00b7 Compliance Audit Program\n\u00b7 Employee Participation\n\nIn addition to the accident prevention programs, we have implemented the following chemical-specif"

Five-Year Accident History\n\nIn the past five years, our facility has not had any accidental releases that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site or offsite or any evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nOur facility maintains an emergency response and contingency plan, which meets all of the federal, state and local regulatory requirements and is communicated to all employees.  This plan and the emergency response training for site personnel provide protection for our employees, the public and the environment.  \n\nRepresentatives of our facility are active members of Brazosport's Community Awareness and Emergency Response (CAER) group, the Brazoria County Petrochemical Council (BCPC), the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Brazosport Emergency Planning Committee (BEPC).  All of these groups work to improve the communication between the chemical companies about emergency response and mitigation.  Furthermore, we share information to better enable us to protect our workers, communities and environment and to prevent accidental releases.\n\nRegular drills involvin"

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe following improvements were identified during initial Process Hazard analyses at our facility: \n\nImprovements already completed include:\n\n1) Review of relief systems for adequacy and change as necessary to handle worst emergency case.\n2) Addition of more alarms and review of set points of existing alarms for adequacy.\n3) Addition of more instrumentation to better monitor process conditions at more points along the process train.\n4) Installation of backflow prevention measures to avert hazardous contamination or mixing of incompatible chemicals.\n5) Revision of standard operating procedures to clarify process steps and to eliminate possible confusion or error.\n6) Established a mechanical integrity and preventive maintenance program to monitor critical equipment and instrumentation and to minimize unforeseen failures.\n7) Installation of vent flare to incinerate all vent gases and minimize hazardous material release during an emergency venting situation.\n8) Updated all plant drawings to reflect equipment and piping changes to provide an accurate tool for site personnel.\n9) Revalidation of the initial Process Hazard Analyses have been completed to meet the five year revalidation frequency per OSHA.  \nPlanned improvements include:\n\n1) Further automation of process equipment to minimize the opportunity for human error.\n2) Addition of more instrumentation to allow for closer monitoring of process conditions and installation of more interlocks to provide additional safeguards against accidents.\n3) Continue the Process Hazard Analyses Revalidation process based on the five year review frequency to verify that all hazards uncovered initially have been satisfactorily mitigated and t"
