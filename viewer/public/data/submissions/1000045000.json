      "SummaryText": "Executive summary \n\n\n\nIn response to growing public concern over the potential danger from accidental releases of hazardous substances, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was mandated by Section 112(r)(7) of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) to establish a regulatory program to prevent serious chemical accidents that may potentially affect public health and the environment. By adding Section 1I2(r), which was part of Congress' response to a series of past chemical accidents with major offsite consequences, the CAAA established a new role for the EPA in chemical accident prevention. \n\n\n\nThis Risk Management Plan (RMP) was prepared to fulfill the requirements of Section II2(r) of the CAAA pursuant to USEPA regulations contained in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68, Sections 68.1-68.220, Accidental Release Prevention Provisions. These regulations require stationary sources with listed substances present in a process in greater than the threshold quantity to develop and implement a RMP that includes a hazard assessment, a prevention program, and an emergency response program. The RMP must be registered with the USEPA, submitted to appropriate agencies, and made available to the public. This RMP was prepared by Regional Utilities. It is pertinent to begin by distinguishing between the Risk Management Program and the Risk Management Plan. The Plan is the information that the owner or operator will prepare and submit to a central point to be specified by the EPA. The Program is the system that backs up the Plan and confirms that the facility is being operated safely. \n\n\n\nRegional Utilities has established a risk and process safety management program to properly identity, evaluate, and prevent catastrophic chemical releases as well as properly plan, train and respond in the event of a chemical release. The program is designed to provide reasonable assurance that operation hazards are identified, significant safety incidents are avoided"

      "SummaryText": ", operational safety requirements are considered in making decisions, proper maintenance/inspections are performed, unacceptable risks to person, property, products and environment are avoided, and emergency response resources are available and ready in the event of a chemical incident. \n\n\n\nThe Regional Utilities Nokuse Plantation Water Plant is a water treatment facility which is currently permitted by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection to treat up to 12,240,000 gallons of water per day. This facility is located at 10407 U. S. Highway 331 South, Freeport, Walton County, Florida. Chlorine which is a regulated hazardous substance is stored and used at the Regional Utilities Nokuse Plantation Water Plant. The hazardous properties of Chlorine make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling the substance to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to facility personal and contractors, and to reduce the threat to the community. At the facility, Chlorine is stored and used in greater than the EPA threshold quantity of 2,500 lbs. for Chlorine. The water treatment operation utilizes Chlorine gas for chlorination (disinfection) of the drinking water that is supplied to Regional Utilities' customers. Administrative controls at the WWRF limit the onsite quantities to a maximum inventory of 4,000 pounds of Chlorine in two (2) one-ton cylinders. Chlorine is gaseous at ambient conditions and is stored liquefied in pressurized containers. The containers are delivered to the facility and unloaded by the chemical supply vendor. The containers are connected/disconnected by the facility's trained operating personnel. Liquefied or gaseous Chlorine may pose a health risk if the valves, containers, or lines transferring the material develop leaks or rupture. The quantity released, release rate, weather conditions, and topography will affect the speed and direction of spread of the gas. \n\n \n\nAccess to the site is restricted to authorized facilit"

The process is locally monitored using a continuous gas monitor connected to local and remote alarm systems. Operations and maintenance staff are properly trained on process safety procedures. Based on a review of the applicable regulations and considering the Regional Utilities Nokuse Plantation Water Plant compliance approach Prevention Program 3 has been selected for the facility. The main focus of the prevention program is to reduce the likelihood of a release by maintaining equipment and training staff and contractors. \n\n\n\nWithin the past five years there has been no reportable chemical release at the facility. This written RMP was developed based upon the Chlorine system design information, operating procedures and other relevant facility information. Personnel responsible for environmental activities, emergency planning and coordination, and system operation and maintenance also provided information used to prepare the plan. A review of the facility Emergency Response Plan (ERP) was also conducted. If a release does occur, the ERP will be a key component of post-release mitigation efforts. A hazard assessment consisting of one worst-case and one alternate case release scenarios was completed and both hazard and vulnerable zones were identified. The hazard assessment was conducted in accordance with 40 CFR 68 regulations, guidance provided by the USEPA RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) document and EPA's OCA software package RMP*COMP. An updated RMP, including an updated offsite consequence analysis, prevention programs, and management system, will be submitted within five years of the initial RMP submission or the most recent RMP update. A compliance audit to certify compliance with the provisions of the RMP regulations will be conducted at least every three years. A management system is in "
