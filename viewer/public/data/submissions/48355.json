It is the stated policy of Chemtura to safely manage our site operations.  In addition, we have prepared contingency plans to be used in the unlikely event that a major accident should occur.  The Morgantown, West Virginia facility has been recognized by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), as an OSHA STAR Site.  Recognitions as an OSHA VPP STAR site is a recognition of the outstanding efforts of both the employer and employee in achieving exemplary occupational safety and health programs and are considered to be among some of the best in the nation for worker safety.\n\nWe believe it is important for all interested parties to have access to information that can help them better understand our business and our facility.  If you have any questions about this document, or any other aspect of our company or our plans, please contact our Environmental Health and Safety Manager at (304) 284-2380.\n\n2.0  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nOur company is committed to operating safe and environmentally sound chemical production facilities everywhere we do business.  Protection of our neighbors and workers is the highest priority.  This ongoing commitment to worker and public safety is demonstrated through resources invested for safe design, operation, and maintenance of our facilities.\n\nIn order to provide top quality products for our customers, the Chemtura Morgantown facility utilizes certain raw materials in its manufacturing processes that are classified as toxic or flammable.  We are committed to comply with governing laws, regulations, and engineering standards as well as systematic assessments to manage and maintain a safe operation.  Our operating practices and procedures ensure that numero"

However, if a major release does occur, our trained on-site emergency response organization will be activated.  This organization includes medical and chemical emergency response teams.\n\n\n3.0  Description of the Facility and Regulated Substances\n\nChemtura currently operates two facilities, both of which are located in the Morgantown Industrial Park in Morgantown (Westover), West Virginia.  The facilities are referred to as the North Plant and the South Plant.  Both plants were built in 1965 and currently employ about 90 people in the Morgantown area.  Chemtura manufactures millions of pounds of antioxidant chemicals marketed under trade names such as ULTRANOXA?, WESTONA?, and others.  Our products are used in various plastics, inks, coatings, and adhesives for improved ultraviolet (UV) heat, color, and processing stability.\n\nThis site is also home to a Technology Center, where Chemtura conducts advanced research in specialty chemical technology.\n\n\n4.0  Hazard Assessment Results\n\nAs part of our risk management planning, we have specifically identified the type of event that, should it ever occur, would have the most negative impacts on our workers and our neighbors.  This is known as the Worst-Case Scenario (WCS).  As defined by EPA, we are required to assume that the numerous engineering and administrative safety controls we have in place to prevent or mitigate such accidents have all failed at once.  EPA defines a worst-case scenario as a catastrophic failure, which is an event that essentially results in the instantaneous release of the contents in the largest single vessel on-site.\n\nA worst-case and alternative release scenario were developed for the North and South Plants using the RMP Comp software and ALOHA software.  The scenarios predicted the endpoint for each release scenario based upon the data input.\n\n\n5.0  General Accidental Release Prevention/Chemical Specific Prevention Steps"

      "SummaryText": "\n\nChemtura has implemented a comprehensive program to prevent accidental releases of highly hazardous chemicals known as Process Safety Management (PSM).  PSM is an integral part of working safety at both the Chemtura facilities.  PSM ensures that proper safety information is in place; operating procedures are followed; chemical hazards are identified; employees and contractors are trained; and critical equipment is properly inspected and maintained.  PSM satisfies the accidental release prevention requirements of the RMP.\n\nSome of the many, specific safety features to prevent chemical accidents include:\nA? Computer controlled safety systems on the phosphorous trichloride storage and transfer systems to ensure that any deviations from the intended operating conditions are immediately identified and corrected;\nA? Safety procedures that reduce the potential for human error which could lead to a storage tank overfill;\nA? Secondary containment dikes around storage tanks and tank truck unloading areas to contain a spill;\nA? Building enclosures around phosphorous trichloride tank truck unloading and storage equipment to contain a leak;\nA? Both the unloading and storage building enclosures are equipped with a water suppression system to mitigate the release of vapors from the building.\nA? Phosphorous trichloride liquid is transferred through a double-walled or \"pipe-within-a-pipe\" system to prevent leaks to the atmosphere.\nA? Phosphorous trichloride piping system is equipment with electronic sensors to detect a leak within inner piping system;\nA? General area gas sensors are located within both the storage and unloading buildings to detect and warn of a release of phosphorous trichloride during the transfer or storage; \nA? Chemical Operators are present during the unloading and transfer of phosphorus trichloride; \nA? Both the unloading and storage building are under continuous video surveillance with the monitors being located in within two separate control rooms (i.e., 18"

Even minor incidents are investigated to identify what went wrong and to learn how to prevent future occurrences.\n\nEPA requires that all incidents involving RMP-regulated chemicals that resulted in any off-site impact or significant on-site impacts are reported in this document.
