If an accidental release should occur, the McGregor Company and the Waitsburg retail facility are prepared to work with the local fire department, or any other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n2.\tFacility Information\n\no\tThe primary activity at the facility is the storage, and handling of anhydrous and aqua ammonia.\n\no\tAnhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia are received, stored, and distributed as agricultural grade fertilizer to local farmers.\n\no\tAnhydrous ammonia is received by truck  and stored in one above ground tank(s).  The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia handled is 130,000 lbs.\n\noAqua ammonia is received by truck and stored in three above ground tank(s) at the site. The maximum amount of aqua ammonia handled is 53,060 lbs.\n\n3.\tThe Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\na.\tAnhydrous Ammonia Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios   \nThe worst-case release scenario involves the failure of the largest storage tank when filled to 85% capacity as limited by regulations.

Aqua Ammonia Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\nThe worst case scenario involves the failure of the aqua storage tank when filled to the largest inventory level on any given day. Total release of aqua ammonia from this tank would be 53,060 pounds of 20% aqua ammonia in solution.  The total amount of this release would be contained within the secondary containment.  The secondary containment regulations require that the containment contain at least 125% of the volume of the largest storage tank. This is per Washington State Department of Agriculture WAC 16-201-025.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.10 miles. This figure comes from EPA's RMP Comp. \n\nThe alternative release scenario is based on the most likely potential incident that might occur at this facility.  We use the scenario that a 2 transfer hose would break and release 3,800 pounds of 20% aqua ammonia solution in five minutes.  The concrete loading pad on which the delivery truck was being loaded would contain all of the released aqua ammonia.  This is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 PPM) is 0.10 miles. This figure comes from EPA's RMP Comp.\n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia and Aqua Ammonia: The Facility has implemented the provisions of the Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, ANSI K 61.1, \nPublished by the American National Standards Institute, Inc, the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.
