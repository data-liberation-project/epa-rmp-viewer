      "SummaryText": "Tampa Electric Company (TEC) is an investor-owned electric utility, which serves an area of about 2,000 square miles in West-Central Florida, including Hillsborough County and portions of Polk, Pasco, and Pinellas Counties.  In addition to other generating facilities, TEC owns and operates the H.L. Culbreath Bayside Power Station located on Port Sutton Road in Hillsborough County, Florida.\n\nTEC re-powered the coal-fired Gannon Power Station.  The repowered Station is natural-gas fired and known as Bayside Power Station (BPS).  BPS is comprised of two combined-cycle units.  Unit 1 consists of three General Electric Model PG7241(FA) combustion turbines, three Heat Recovery Steam Generators (HRSG) and one repowered steam turbine generator.  Unit 2 consists of four General Electric Model PG7241(FA) combustion turbines, four Heat Recovery Steam Generators (HRSG) and one repowered steam turbine generator.  The repowered plant has nominal capacity of approximately 1750 MW (approximately 750 MW from Unit 1 and approximately 1000 MW from Unit 2).  Steam from Unit 1?s three combined-cycle units powers Gannon Steam-electric turbine Unit No. 5, which has a nameplate rating of 239 MW.  Steam from Unit 2?s four combined-cycle units power Gannon steam-electric turbine Unit No. 6, which has a nameplate rating 414 MW.  All of the existing six coal-fired boilers at Gannon were shut down prior to October 2003. \n\nThe BPS natural gas-fired combined cycle combustion turbines uses dry low-NOx (DLN) combustion technology to reduce NOx emissions.  The HRSGs have selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems installed to further reduce NOx emissions.  The SCR system consists of an ammonia injection grid, catalyst, ammonia storage, a monitoring and control system, electrical system, piping, and other ancillary equipment.  The SCR system is designed to reduce NOx emissions by reacting ammonia (NH3) with exhaust gas NOx to yield nitrogen and water vapor in the presence of a catalyst, while minimi"

      "SummaryText": "zing ammonia slip within the permitted levels.\n\nThe requirements of the chemical accident release prevention rule (40 CFR Part 68) apply to the anhydrous ammonia present in the SCR system process.  Under the threshold determination criteria, if a regulated substance is present in a process in a quantity of 10,000 pounds or more of the substance, TEC must address the risks posed by the regulated substance in the applicable process.  The SCR system contains two ammonia storage tanks with a total capacity of 98,824 pounds of anhydrous ammonia each, and a minimum and maximum operating level of 5,000 and 84,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, respectively.  Since the total capacity of the two tanks (maximum operating level) of 168,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia is greater than the threshold trigger of 10,000 pounds, the SCR system process is subject to the chemical accident prevention rule. \n\nAn offsite consequence analysis was conducted for the ammonia in the SCR system process using EPA's RMP*Comp electronic program, based on the EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance document.  Any releases would be controlled using administrative controls that limit the quantity of ammonia released.  The ammonia storage area also has designed mitigation systems, which consist of sumps, drains, and dikes to contain releases of ammonia along with a sprinkler and deluge system to absorb ammonia vapor in case of a release.\n\nBayside Power Station is committed to the safety to its employees and neighboring community.  This commitment is based on established health and safety policies and procedures.  These procedures are complemented by personal training, safety drills, and facility inspections.  A process safety management (PSM) program has been implemented at Bayside Power Station, which includes provisions for management of the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia system process hazards.  The PSM program includes evaluations of process design, process technology, operational and"

      "SummaryText": " maintenance activities and procedures, emergency preparedness plans and procedures, training programs, and other elements which impact the process.  With a combination of appropriate safety design measures, preventative maintenance programs, and development and implementation of proper safety procedures, Bayside Power Station manages the risk associated with ammonia handling at the facility.  Currently there are no reportable accidents related to ammonia releases, within the last five years.\n\nIn the event of an emergency at the facility, emergency response has been coordinated with local emergency response organization, Hillsborough Fire & Rescue Department.  Several meetings and walk-downs of the ammonia storage system have been coordinated with the Hillsborough Fire & Rescue Department to discuss TEC's coordination with local emergency responders to react to emergencies resulting from fire, explosion, or releases of store ammonia. In addition, Bayside Power Station has established and implemented a PSM emergency response plan in the event of an accidental hazardous materials release, natural hazards, or other potential emergencies.  The plan addresses potential emergencies identified by a facility-wide risk analysis conducted by a team of environmental professionals, health and safety specialists, and Bayside Power Station personnel.  The plan identifies specific responsibilities and procedures to be followed by all facility personnel following an accident or impending emergency to maximize employee and community safety.  TEC has also coordinated to immediately contact the National Response Center, as well as the SERC and the LEPC, if 100 pounds or more of ammonia are released."
