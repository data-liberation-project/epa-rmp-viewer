Medical emergencies will require notification of the Spokane County Fire District 9.  This facility has an Emergency Response Plan; however, it does not maintain a trained fire brigade or hazardous material response team on-site and is only trained to respond to the initial stages of an emergency and then to evacuate.\n\n\n\nThe Tristar North, Inc. - Spokane Facility is an LPG Transloading facility (specifically, railcar to truck tanker).  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the LPG Railcar Storage and Transloading process only including the associated piping and storage for up to fifty (50) LPG railcars (detached). The facility can store either butane or propane railcars. The maximum intended inventories reported in this Risk Management plan represent the extreme cases where the facility is storing 50 butane railcars or 50 propane railcars.\n\n\n\nTristar North, Inc. - Spokane Facility complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) accident prevention rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard (29 CFR Part 1910.119) and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  This LPG Railcar Storage and Transloading process is designed, constructed and maintained in accordance with NFPA #58 and the manufacturer's instructions.  Railcars meet the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Railroad Administration design requirements for pressurized tank cars.\n\n\n\nThis is a new facility; therefore, it has never had an accident involving LPG which has result"
