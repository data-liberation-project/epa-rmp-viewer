The GPS coordinates for the Sugg A 143 facility are noted as, Latitude 31.58412, Longitude: -101.38624. Laredo has a longstanding commitment to worker and public safety and this commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Laredo's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nNatural gas compression of wellhead gas provides gas lift to remove liquids from the wellbore. Gas is gathered from the surrounding wells and sent to the Sugg A 143 facility for the purpose of compressing the gas. The high-pressure gas is then sent back to the wells for the purpose of removing liquids from the wellbore.\n\n\n\nThe process of the compression and dehydration of natural gas and removal of condensate and natural gas liquids is described in detail below. \n\n\n\nNatural gas from nearby wells is gathered into pipes that extend out into the field in a spider web configuration. The gas then enters the Sugg A 143 facility. Oil and water are separated out and sent to 300 bbl produced water and condensate fixed roof atmospheric storage tanks. The oil is then trucked offsite following custody transfer. The produced water is sent to a nearby injection well for disposal. From the separator the gas is measured through orifice meters prior to being compressed. After the gas is compressed, it is dried in a glycol dehydrator to remove entrained water. The mainstream of gas leaving the glycol dehydrator enters the high-pressure pipeline where it is re-distributed back to the wells for th"

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating in safety training and emergency response. \n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nLaredo keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes at all Laredo facilities. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. The reference documents are maintained on file at the local offices. Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, are provided in material safety data sheets (SDS) located at the nearest field office.\n\n\n\nThe Sugg A 143 facility will maintain numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for esta"

These procedures include guidance for the following activities: (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made.\n\n\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nAll employees involved in operating the Sugg A 143 facility receive basic training in facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. New operators are paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. ln addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted on an as needed basis. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe Sugg A 143 facility uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in an event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.

Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Review\n\n\n\nLaredo will conduct a Pre-startup Safety Review (PSSR) for this facility or modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on the following tasks (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.\n\n\n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\n\n\nLaredo has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.
