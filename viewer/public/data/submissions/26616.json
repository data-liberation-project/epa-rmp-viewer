The Facility Policy\nThe Management and Employees are committed to the prevention of any type of accidental release of NH3 or any other chemical that is stored at this facility.  The Great Bend Coop is a Agri Alliance AG-21 member (Farmland Industries).  With this program the Great Bend Coop strives to go beyond industry standard for employee, patron and environmental safety.\n\n2.  Facility Information\nThe NH3 plant is located on the north east side of Albert, Kansas.  The facility is located in the city limits.  The old 18,000 gal tank has been replaced with a 30,000 gal tank.  The old tank has been sold and will be removed after EPA and State Agriculture compliance.\n\n3.  The Worst Case and Alternate Case Release Scenario\nBoth scenarios come from the RMP Comp.  Worst case involves a release of the total amount of product stored at the facility of 140,196 pounds in a ten minute period, with 14,000 pound per minute, toxic endpoint would be 4.4 miles effecting about 250 people.    \n\n4.  Accidental release prevention program\nThe Coop recognizes all safety procedures required by State and Federal Regulations.  The Coop also complies with recomendations from the AG-21 program.  The most common release would be overfilling nurse trailers.  Policy states not to fill above 85%, however on a cool morning a tank could be filled to 85% and release in the warm afternoon.\n\n5.  Five Year Accident History\nThe facility has not had a reportable release within the past five years.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Program\nThe Coop has an Emergency Action Plan, Emergency Response Plan, and an active Safety Committee.  All areas have worked with the County, City of Albert, and the Coop's insurance company to develop these plans.  Rod Cushenbery is the Branch Manager and he is also the Mayor and Assistant Fire Chief of Albert.\n\n7.
