This commitment is demonstrated\n\nby the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in\n\nthe design, operation, and maintenance of the aqueous ammonia system. The facility's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substance.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage, and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of prepackaged\n\nagricultural chemicals to farmers, including the regulated substance, aqueous ammonia. \n\n\n\n\n\nAqueous ammonia (24% of ammonia by weight) is stored in two 25,000-gallon above ground tanks at the site.\n\nThe total quantity of ammonia present in the aqueous ammonia, based on 24% ammonia by weight and conversion rate of 7.54 lb/gal, is approximately 90,480 pounds.\n\n\n\nBased on the facility's NAICS code (42491 Farm Supply Merchant Wholesalers), the facility is required to follow the EPA RMP and the CalARP Program 2 for aqueous ammonia as required by the local Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA, the Sutter County's Environmental Health Division.\n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nThe facility's Hazard Assessment was completed on 9/26/2014.\n\nThe Offsite Consequence Analysis part of the Hazard Assessment was reviewed and revised November 2014 and is summarized as follows:\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nBased on the EPA RMP guidance, the worst-case release scenarios is defined as a release from the largest storage vessel at the facility. The aqueous ammonia worst-case scenario is a release of approximately 45,240 pounds of ammonia from one of the aqueous ammonia storage tanks.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nBased on the EPA RMP guidance, the alternative-case release scenarios is defined as a release scenario that is more likely than the worst-case release"

The aqueous ammonia the alternative-case scenario is a release from a 4-inch hose during the transfer between a storage tank and the delivery truck.\n\n\n\nRisk Considerations\n\nAmmonia is a toxic inhalational hazard; and thus, the use of aqueous ammonia has inherent potential risks to potentially reach sensitive populations within the community. The facility's identified potential risks for an ammonia release from its process are included in the off-site consequence analysis and Hazard Assessment. Facility RMP elements and other safety programs are structured to minimize the potential of a release from the identified risks.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe facility employs a regional Environmental, Health and Safety Specialist to facilitate training and RMP implementation. As part of the implementation of CalARP Program 2 for aqueous ammonia, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by the facility to manage process safety issues associated with the use of aqueous ammonia. Prevention elements for Program 2 are listed below:\n\n\n\n- Safety Information (SI)\n\n- Hazard Assessment (HA)\n\n- Operating Procedures (OP)\n\n- Training (TRN)\n\n- Mechanical Integrity (MI)\n\n- Incident Investigation (II)\n\n- Compliance Audits (CA)\n\n\n\nAlthough not required, the facility implements the following Program 3 RMP elements to further minimize the potential for accidental releases:\n\n\n\n- Management of Change (MOC) \n\n- Pre-Startup Review (PSSR) \n\n- Employee Participation (EP) \n\n- Contractors (CON) \n\n\n\nThe facility is completely fenced and the gate is closed and locked when the facility is closed. A security guard completes visual inspections of the ammonia systems three times per night.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no CalARP-applicable releases of aqueous ammonia at the facility in at least the past five (5) years.\n\n\n\nFLAMMABLES: WORST CASE\n\nThe use of flammable materials at the Wilbur-Ellis Yuba City facility is not encompassed by either"

The facility does meets the following criteria:\n\n\n\n- Annually filing of the Hazardous Materials Business Plan is completed for Sutter County. This filing is\n\nhandled by the SSRE Technician and includes the facility in the community emergency response plan.\n\n\n\n- Coordination with the local Fire Department. The last visit from the Yuba City Fire Department was in 2011.

To improve the safety of the aqueous ammonia system, Wilbur-Ellis is in the process of implementing non-destructive tests to evaluate the mechanical integrity of the tanks. At a minimum, inspection frequencies will follow industry standards.\n\nWilbur-Ellis is also implementing a facility-wide comprehensive corrective action/preventative action (CAPA) log to track and facilitate completion of listed CAs on a timely basis. Recommended improvements and identified deficiencies from the inspection checklists, compliance audits, and PHA studies will be included on the facility CAPA log along with the priority, employee responsible, and targeted completion dates.\n\n\n\n1.
