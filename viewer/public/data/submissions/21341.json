INTRODUCTION\n\nIn June of 1996, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued regulations requiring all industries handling regulated chemicals above threshold amounts to develop, submit, and make available to the public plans to manage the use and handling of these chemicals. This plan known as the Risk Management Plan has three components. These are listed below with a brief explanation of the requirements.\n\nHazard Assessment\nHazard Assessment describes the potential off-site consequences of a worst case scenario as well as alternate or more likely scenarios involving accidental release of regulated chemicals. This assessment consists of an estimate of potential release quantities and its potential off-site impact on people and the environment.\n\nPrevention Program\nThis section describes Uniroyal Chemical's program to identify and prevent accidental releases of regulated chemicals. The program includes several key elements involving: hazard identification, process safety information, training, operating instructions, employee participation, mechanical integrity, management of change, inspections, and work permits.\n\nEmergency Response Plan\nThis section describes actions to be taken in response to an accidental release to protect the employees, the public and the environment. The plan covers procedures for public notification and coordination with community response agencies.\n\n\nII. FACILITY OVERVIEW \n\nUniroyal Chemical Company, Inc.(Uniroyal Chemical ) manufactures specialty organic chemicals and conducts research and product development activities at its 87-acre complex, located on 280 Elm Street, Naugatuck, Connecticut. The facility is bounded by the Naugatuck River on the east, Cherry Street on the west, and the Naugatuck Water Pollution Control Facility on the south.\n\nUniroyal Chemical prod"

Our products are broadly divided into three categories; Rubber Chemicals including anti-oxidants, accelerators, bonding agents and waxes; Specialty Chemicals including lube oil additives, curatives and polymerization inhibitors; Agricultural Chemicals including miticides.  \n\nAt present, 250 full-time employees work at the Naugatuck facility and an additional 600 employees work at the corporate headquarters in Middlebury and the agricultural research station in Bethany. Uniroyal Chemical is a division of Crompton Corporation, a $3.3 billion multi-national manufacturer of specialty chemicals, polymers and polymer processing equipment. \n\nUniroyal Chemical uses over 120 different raw materials at the Naugatuck facility. Of these, twelve (12) are RMP regulated chemicals and three (3) are stored in tanks in quantities above the RMP regulated Threshold Quantities (TQ), requiring Uniroyal Chemical to prepare the Risk Management Plan.  These chemicals are Ethyl Chloride, Carbon Disulfide and Phosphorus Trichloride.   \n\n\nII. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nUniroyal Chemical considers the health and safety of the public, its employees, and customers and the protection of the environment to be of primary importance in the conduct of its business.  Uniroyal Chemical will meet all applicable laws, regulations, permits and internal requirements. Uniroyal Chemical follows the Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) Policy adopted by the corporation.

With members from a broad cross-section of the community and Uniroyal Chemical's Naugatuck facility, the CAP has met regularly and discussed various topics of mutual interest including environmental protection. Uniroyal Chemical reviewed the RMP rule as well as its Risk Management Plan with the CAP several times and obtained their valuable input. Uniroyal Chemical also met with the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) and reviewed the Plan. Uniroyal Chemical arranged for a public meeting to review its RMP with the public, invited the press and placed several advertisements in the local newspapers announcing the public meeting. Uniroyal Chemical prepared a brochure describing the RMP, provided details of off-site consequences, and described Uniroyal Chemical's prevention program and the emergency response plan. Uniroyal Chemical met with the public, press and the Town leaders on June 15, 1999 and explained the RMP and answered questions. Copies of this brochure were distributed to the public at the meeting.\n\n\nIII. REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nAs described earlier, Uniroyal Chemical uses over 120 different raw materials at the Naugatuck facility. Of these, twelve (12) are RMP regulated chemicals** and three (3) are stored in tanks in quantities above the RMP regulated Threshold Quantities (TQ), requiring Uniroyal Chemical to prepare the Risk Management Plan.

Measures have been put in place (through operating procedure, verification of inventory before ordering materials, training of personnel, verification before material is loaded into the storage tanks, etc.) to ensure that the maximum inventory of nine of the twelve chemicals is limited to less than their respective TQs.  The maximum inventory of the remaining three RMP chemicals are also limited to reduce the distance of potential off-site impact caused by a hypothetical accidental release of these chemicals.\n \n\nIV. RESULTS OF HAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nThe following is a summary of the results of the Hazard Assessment and Consequence Analysis calculated for hypothetical release incidents involving ethyl chloride (flammable substance) and carbon disulfide (toxic). Uniroyal Chemical used EPA's RMPComp accidental release model to evaluate the consequence of a worst-case release. An example of a worst-case scenario would be where an accident resulted in the instantaneous release of all the contents of a tank.  An alternate scenario would consist of an incident where a process pipeline gasket or pipe was leaking for 10 minutes before being stopped and repaired.\n\nCarbon disulfide( CS2) is stored in a 12,000 gallon stainless steel storage tank. Up to 126,000 pounds of carbon disulfide could be stored in this tank. As described above, Uniroyal Chemical is limiting the maximum on-site inventory of CS2 to 80,000 pounds. The CS2 storage tank is located underwater inside a concrete dike and the CS2 itself is stored under a water blanket within the storage tank. Any transfer of CS2 from the storage tank to the process area is achieved by the displacement of CS2 with water. These storage and transfer conditions prevent any releases of CS2 into the dike from contacting the outside environment. CS2 is heavier than water"

In addition to the containment dike, the tank, containment dike and the majority of the associated piping are fully enclosed by an air-tight structure that further reduces the release rate of Phosphorous Trichloride to the environment by over 95% for both worst-case and alternative release scenarios. With the construction of the enclosing structure the off-site consequence of a potential PCl3 release has been significantly reduced.    \n   \nAs mentioned earlier, the regulations require that the worst-case scenario be evaluated.
