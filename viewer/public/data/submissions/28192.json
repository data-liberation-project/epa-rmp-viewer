The Authority also serves as a conduit for tax exempt financing for municipal water and wastewater facilities and industrial air and water pollution control facilities.  Each operation and/or financing endeavor is an independent financial entity.  On a functional basis, the Authority operates as a governmental utility, receives no direct tax revenues or revenue sharing and is compensated for services rendered.\n\nPerhaps our greatest impact to the general public is our ownership and operation of several large water and wastewater treatment facilities.  We provide essential services to a significant portion of the public in the Dallas/Fort Worth metropolitan area and to several cities around Lake Livingston.  As the operator of these facilities, it is our duty to inform the public about efforts to prevent and, if necessary, respond if a hazardous substance were inadvertently released from one of our treatment facilities.  There are other operators of water utilities in these regions who have an interest in the same risk management issues.  \n\nTRA\u00bfs Tarrant County Water Supply Project (TCWSP) began operation in 1974.

An additional caustic feed system is presently under construction and should be completed early 2003. The facility is located on Mosier Valley Road south of the City of Euless.  The quality of treated water leaving TCWSP meets or exceeds all established standards.\n\nAs a result of new federal guidelines, 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Program (ARPP), the TCWSP is required to develop and implement a Risk Management Program (RMP) due to the amounts of chlorine that it uses in its treatment process. In developing its RMP, TCWSP has conducted an analysis of potential off-site consequences of an accidental release including a \u00bfworst case\u00bf and \u00bfalternative case\u00bf release scenario.  In addition, the facility has compiled a five-year accidental release history, a release prevention program and an emergency response program.  The TCWSP has an outstanding safety record and there have been no accidents related to covered processes in the past five years.\n\nWith respect to accident prevention programs:\n*Annual training is required by all operations and maintenance employees who work in and around hazardous chemical storage and loading areas.\n*Visual inspections of these covered processes are conducted by operations personnel on each shift.\n*Sensors and alarms are in place around all process areas to detect any leakage of the hazardous chemicals.\n*Written operating procedures are continuously updated and maintained for operations personnel to use during their work routines.\n*All accidents are investigated promptly with written documentation of all findings.  These accident investigations are reviewed by management and Certified Safety Professionals to determine cause and prevention.\n*Monthly safety audits are conducted of al"
