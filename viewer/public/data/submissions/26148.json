Introduction:\n\nThe  Royster-Clark  Nitrogen terminal in Meredosia  receives\n\nfertilizers from barges, stores the fertilizer in tanks, and\n\nloads  trucks.  The facility has one anhydrous ammonia  tank\n\nand  four  urea  ammonium  nitrate (UAN)  liquid  fertilizer\n\nstorage tanks.\n\n.\n\nB.  Accidental Release Record:\n\n\n\nThe Royster-Clark Nitrogen, Meredosia Terminal, has an\n\nexcellent safety record with no deaths or serious injuries\n\nto facility personnel since it was constructed in 1964.\n\n\n\nThe facility safety record is the direct result of continued\n\nemphasis on safety by management, employees, contractors,\n\nand truck drivers.  There have not been any releases from\n\nthe terminal that meet the description of an RMP accidental\n\nrelease.\n\n\n\nC.   General Accidental Release Prevention  Policies And\n\n  Activities:\n\n\n\nRoyster-Clark Nitrogen believes safety and concern for the\n\nenvironment must be second nature to all employees and\n\ncontractor personnel.\n\n\n\nThe entire Royster-Clark Nitrogen team works together to\n\nensure the facility is in compliance with OSHA's Process\n\nSafety Management standards and the accident prevention\n\nprograms are continuously improved.  A networked computer\n\nmanagement system is utilized to provide our employees with\n\nthe necessary tools and records to maintain the safety of\n\nthe process.  This teamwork is an integral part in the\n\nsafety efforts of this facility.\n\n\n\nAccident release prevention steps include the fourteen\n\nelement program for Process Safety Management, a management\n\nsystem, corporate oversight of the facility, and a focus on\n\ncontinuous improvement.\n\n\n\nRoyster-Clark Nitrogen encourages all employees to\n\nparticipate in the facility's safety program.  Examples of\n\nemployee participation include participation in Process\n\nHazard Analyses, cooperative training, updating"

Worst Case Scenario:\n\n\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency requires the worst case\n\nscenario to be a catastrophic rupture of the terminal's\n\nammonia storage tank with a compete loss of product over 10\n\nminutes. The tank is included in the facility's mechanical\n\nintegrity inspection and testing program.  Acoustic Emission\n\ntesting was completed in June of 1998.  The testing\n\nindicated the tank to be in good condition.  Other safeguard\n\ninclude pressure and temperature instrumentation, multipl"

The EPA does\n\nnot allow any of these safeguards to be considered in the\n\nworst case scenario.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn regard to worst case scenarios, EPA say's:\n\n\n\n     \"Because the assumptions required for the worst\n\n     - case analysis are very conservative, the\n\n     results likely will be very conservative.  These\n\n     endpoints are concentrations below which it is\n\n     believed nearly all individuals could be exposed\n\n     for one-half hour to one hour without any\n\n     serious health effects.  In addition,  the worst\n\n     case analysis is carried out using very\n\n     conservative assumptions about weather and\n\n     release conditions.  The distance to the\n\n     endpoint estimated under worst-case conditions\n\n     should not be considered a zone in which the\n\n     public would be likely in danger;  instead, it\n\n     is intended to provide an estimate of the\n\n     maximum possible area that might be affected in\n\n     the unlikely event of catastrophic conditions.\n\n     Distances greater than 10 kilometers are\n\n     particularly uncertain.  EPA intends the\n\n     estimated distances to provide a basis for\n\n     discussion. rather than a basis for specific\n\n     actions.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause of the routine testing, in plant safety systems,\n\ndaily visual inspections, and intensive operations training,\n\nRoyster-Clark Nitrogen believes the worst case scenario to\n\nbe extremely unlikely to happen.\n\n\n\nE.  Anhydrous Ammonia Alternative Scenario:\n\n\n\nThe conditions picked for the alternative case scenario are\n\nthose which would create a maximum amount of loss of\n\nanhydrous ammonia from a vessel of ammonia.  The scenario\n\ninvolves breakage of the sight glass and failure of the\n\nammonia check valve resulting in loss of 100 gallons of hot\n\nanhydrous ammonia to the atmosphere.\n\n\n\n\n\nF.
