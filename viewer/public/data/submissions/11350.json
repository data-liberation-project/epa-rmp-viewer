Because the City of Monroe stores and uses in excess of the threshold quantity of chlorine and sulfur dioxide at the wastewater treatment plant (referred to as the Water Pollution Control Center or WPCC), these processes are covered under this regulation.  There are three separate chlorination systems at the WPCC, and each is addressed as a separate unit in the RMP planning.\n\nThe technical information herein may be used as a training reference in initial and recurring operator and maintenance training. Training on process fundamentals, operations, and maintenance, coupled with the recommended process modifications discussed below, will reduce the potential hazards to plant personnel and the surrounding community.\n\nAn Emergency Response Program and an Incident Investigation Program are included. These two programs should be an integral part of both initial and recurring training.\nA Risk Management Plan (RMP), in the format required by the EPA, is included at the end of the main body of this document.  It consists of a summary of data elements as required by EPA for inclusion in a public access database. The RMP is intended to inform the public of the City of Monroe's proactive stance toward protection of the environment and the surrounding community.\n\nE.1 Hazard Assessment\n\nThe Hazard Assessment is comprised of a Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenario for the chlorine systems and sulfur dioxide system, as well as a 5-Year Accident History for the same. The Hazard Assessment was conducted as an initial screening procedure as part of determining which Program Level (I, II, or III) the WPCC falls.  Residences lie within the EPA-defined endpoint concentrations of the plant's Worst-Case releases, therefore, the plant is ineligible for Program I.  The WPCC is operated by p"

The WPCC is included in Risk Management Program II.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario is defined as a ton container (2,000 pounds) of chlorine or sulfur dioxide being released by a catastrophic event within a 10 minute duration.  Because the buildings in which the chlorine and sulfur dioxide are housed are not provided with a solid door or any other containment, no mitigation factor is taken for these structures. The worst case scenarios were developed using the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance document. The distance to the toxic endpoint for a chlorine release was determined to be 4.49 miles for the three storage locations on the plant site impacting a total of 14,738 people.  For sulfur dioxide, the distance to the toxic endpoint was estimated to be 4.76 miles impacting 16,564 people.  For all worst case release scenarios, public receptors include: residences, hospitals, recreation areas, schools, business and commercial areas.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario for chlorine and for sulfur dioxide was also determined using the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance document. The alternative release scenario for each of the chlorine systems assumed a valve failure on the tank resulting in a 60 minute release of a total chlorine quantity of 697 pounds.  The sulfur dioxide system assumed the same release type and rate.  The distance to the toxic endpoint for the chlorine alternative release scenarios was 1.77 miles impacting approximately 2,290 people.  The distance to the toxic endpoint for sulfur dioxide was determined to be 1.88 miles impacting approximately 2,584 people.  \n\nE.2 5-Year Accident History\n\nOne release has occurred during the last five years.  On May 9, 1999, the main chlorination system at the treatment plant was shut down after sever equipment failure and a chlorine gas release.  This release did not result in any on-site of off-sit"

The Program must be updated every three years, or any time a covered process undergoes a physical or administrative modification.  The Document Management System is largely the responsibility of the Risk Management Program Team lead by the Plant Superintendent.  The Risk Management Team consist of one operator, one maintenance person, and the Plant Superintendent.

The physical data will provide useful information in the inevitable event the plant process is modified, thereby requiring revisited dense gas dispersion.  It is also imperative that plant operators and managers are appraised of the potential health hazards and exposure limits associated with chlorine and sulfur dioxide stored on the plant site.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nBasic specifications on each process are included in this document for easy reference. Details such as Maximum Intended Inventory, Safe Upper and Lower Temperatures, Safe Upper and Lower Pressures, and Codes and Standards Used to Design, Build and Operate the Process are provided in this section.

The Hazard Review technique used was a \"What If\" analysis. The \"What If\" was developed from experience at similar chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems. The Hazard Review team consisted of plant management, plant operations, and an outside process design engineers knowledgeable in the Hazard Review process.\n\nRecommendations\n\nThe result of the Hazard Review is a set of recommendations for the plant to implement.  Rule 40 CFR 68.50 requires the City of Monroe to ensure that problems identified are \"resolved in a timely manner.\"  For those items that can not be promptly resolved, it is recommended that a schedule be developed that addresses those issues, with responsibility for each assigned to the appropriate personnel.  \n\nThe recommendations were developed by the Hazard Review Team with a consensus from all team members.  Recommendations are summarized below:\n\n1. Provide labeling on valves throughout the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems.\n\n2. Install wind socks at the facility.\n\n3. Provide protection of the main chlorine and sulfur dioxide storage areas through the installation of a metal guard or rail\n\n4. Label piping with contents and flow directions.\n\n5. Provide refresher training on the SCBAs.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nBasic chlorine and sulfur dioxide system operating procedures have been developed and documented for the facility. They provide system descriptions, specifications, and operating procedures for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide liquid and gas systems. Procedures include Start-up, Shutdown, Normal, Abnormal, and Emergency Operation.\n\nTraining \n\nTraining is required by the EPA to be included in the Risk Management Program.  Training Record Forms are included with the Program for the required document"

Sound preventive maintenance will reduce potential hazards to personnel onsite, as well as to the off-site public.  In the event of an inspection or compliance review, state and federal regulators will request to see documentation and record keeping associated with the Maintenance Program. \n\nIncident Investigation\n\nAn Incident Investigation Program has also been developed. The EPA has established strict guidelines to follow in the aftermath of any release involving the chlorine or sulfur dioxide systems. The Incident Investigation Program outlines key milestones that must be accomplished within 24 hours of any covered incident, and the actions that must occur subsequently. Ultimately, it is desired that the plant learns from the incident and takes action to prevent similar incidents in the future. Incident Investigation Report Forms are included, and must be maintained for a minimum of five years after each incident.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nInternal Compliance Audits must be conducted every three years to verify compliance with the programs and procedures contained in this document. The Plant Manager must certify that the Risk Management Program team has evaluated compliance with the provisions of the Program, and verify that the procedures and practices are adequate and are being followed. Audit Report Forms are provided, the two most recent of which must always be maintained. This means that in the year 2006, the Compliance Audit Report for the year 2000 may be discarded.\n\nE.5  Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is included as part of the Risk Management Program in case a significant release ever occurs. As in all the above programs, it is important to review this program regularly. The Rule, 40 CFR 68.95 requires training for all employees \"in relevant procedures\" of the Emergency Response Program.\n\nIt i"

The City has elected to allow the City of Monroe Fire Department to address all major releases at the plant site.  Minor releases will be handled by the plant staff.\n\nE.6  Summary of Action Items\n\n1. The RMP Rule, 40 CFR 68.42 requires that details of all accidental releases be recorded from this date forward.  \n\n2.  The RMP Rule, 40 CFR 68.15 requires that the Document Management System (e.g., the RMP Team) be updated anytime personnel changes or administrative changes are made that would affect the lines of authority or responsibility for maintaining the RMP. \n\n3.  The RMP Rule, 40 CFR 68.54 requires that each employee presently operating a process, and each employee newly assigned to a covered process be trained or tested competent in the operating procedures.  As an alternative, the City may certify in writing that the employee has the required knowledge, skills, and abilities to safely carry out the duties and responsibilities as provided in the operating procedures.  Training documentation forms will be recorded and filed at the plant site.\n \n4. The RMP Rule, 40 CFR 68.56 requires training on the plant maintenance procedures.  The City of Monroe must train or cause to be trained each employee involved in maintaining the on-going mechanical integrity of the process.  To ensure that the employee can perform the job tasks in a safe manner, each such employee must be trained in the hazards of the process, in how to avoid or correct unsafe conditions, and in the procedures applicable to the employee's job tasks.  Refresher training on operating and maintenance procedures must be provided every three years.\n\n5.The RMP Rule, 40 CFR 68.60 requires incident investigations no later than 24 hours following each incident.\n\n6.
