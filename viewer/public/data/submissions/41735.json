      "SummaryText": "The Risk Management Plan Executive Summary\n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Honda of America Mfg., Inc.'s Anna Engine Plant:\n\nHonda of America Mfg., Inc. (\"Honda\") has developed and implemented two policies which directly impact and influence Honda's accident release prevention and emergency response activities.  First, Honda's Safety Policy expresses Honda's commitment to:\n\n- provide a safe and healthful working environment,\n- conduct its operations with the highest regard for associate safety,\n- continually improve the safety management system, \n- train associates in respects to safety related to their job, and\n- comply with all applicable safety and health requirements and standards mandated by \n  federal, state, and local law.\n\nSecond, Honda has developed and implemented an Environmental Policy through it's ISO14001 Environmental Management System, which expresses Honda's commitment to:\n\n- comply with all applicable environmental requirements mandated by federal, state, and local law,\n- operate and continually improve an environmental management system, and \n- implement methods to prevent pollution, conserve natural resources and reduce \n  waste.\n\nWith these policies as a foundation, Honda's Anna Engine Plant (Honda/AEP) has made a significant effort to ensure compliance and good management in all areas relating to chemical safety. Many of the Risk Management Program (RMP) requirements are similar or identical to requirements covered by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) program, and the two Honda processes subject to RMP regulation are also subject to PSM requirements.  Moreover, even before the OSHA PSM standard was adopted as a final rule, Honda/AEP maintained a high level of protection from potential chemical exposures for all AEP associates.  This was accomplished through: operational controls, systems design, mechanical integrity and associate training. Honda/AEP"

      "SummaryText": " procedures meet all applicable PSM requirements.  In many respects, procedures to prevent or control unwanted releases at Honda/AEP currently exceed PSM requirements relative to mechanical integrity and associate training.  For example, Honda/AEP uses fixed head monitoring devices to detect leaks and/or releases, uses grade-specified components, replaces hardware prior to manufacturer-suggested replacement intervals, and has implemented comprehensive associate training.\n\nA Brief Description of the AEP Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nHonda/AEP primarily consists of six manufacturing departments:\n\n1. Aluminum Die Cast Department.\nIn the Aluminum Die Cast Department, raw aluminum ingots are melted in aluminum furnaces.  The molten aluminum is then injected into dies either by low-pressure casting or by high-pressure casting.  Low pressure casting is used to produce engine cylinder heads.  High pressure casting is used to produce engine blocks and transmission casings.\n\n2. Aluminum Machining Department.\n\nEngine blocks and cylinder heads from the Aluminum Die Cast Department are machined into finished products for use in the Engine Assembly Department.  \n\n3. Engine Assembly Department.\n\nThe Engine Assembly Department consists of three assembly lines.  The assembly lines produce L-4 and V-6 Accord based engines and 4 cylinder Civic based engines.  \n\n4. Ferrous Casting Department.\n\nIn the Ferrous Casting Department, scrap metal is melted in a cupola and poured into sand molds to form brake disk rotors, brake drums, and cylinder sleeves.  Additionally, iron is melted and poured into an alloy die to make camshafts, balance shafts and cylinder sleeves.  \n\n5. Ferrous Machining Department.\n\nIn the Ferrous Machining Department, the brake disk rotors, brake drums, and cylinder sleeves poured in ferrous casting are machined into finished products.  Crankshafts and balance shafts are also machined and heat-treated.  Anhydrous ammonia and propane, regulated substanc"

Driveshaft Machining Department.\n\nIn the Driveshaft Machining Department, driveshafts are assembled.  Inboard, inner and outboard driveshaft parts are forged, machined and heat-treated.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia Process:\n\nLiquid anhydrous ammonia (metallurgical grade) is stored in an 18,000-gallon capacity tank.  The volume of ammonia in the tank is limited by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), Ammonia Safety Code, to 15,300-gallons, to allow for vapor space in the tank.  The process uses ammonia vapor, which is supplied from the headspace of the tank.  If additional vapor is needed, ammonia is passed through a series of immersion heaters (vaporizers) where the liquid is vaporized into a gas.  Through overhead piping, the ammonia vapor travels through a shutoff header stand and a flow meter stand prior to being introduced into the nitriding furnace.  \n\nDue to the high temperature (1,110 degrees Fahrenheit) the ammonia dissociates into its components according to the following reaction:\n\n2 Anhydrous Ammonia -> 2 Nitrogen + 3 Hydrogen\n\nThe nitrogen combines with the alloying elements in the steel to form nitrides.  The nitrides form at the steel surface as a hard chemical layer which will minimize wear and fatigue.  The remaining component, Hydrogen, (3H2) is burned off by the afterburner.\n\nPropane Process\n\nPropane is stored in an 18,000-gallon storage tank, limited to 15,300-gallons by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Chapter 58 (the LP-Gas Code).  Propane vapor is used in the nitriding furnace to fuel pilot lights and flame curtains.  Propane is passed through a vaporizer, to supply vapor to the process.  The pilot light is associated with an afterburner attached to the furnace exhaust stack, which is used to incinerate off gasses emitted by the furnace.  The flame curtains are used to keep oxygen and other gasses from entering the f"

Honda/AEP surpasses the requirements of various elements of the standard, including response training, mechanical integrity and chemical-monitoring devices to maintain high levels of compliance and prevent accidental releases.  Monitoring systems have built-in back up systems to insure fail-safe operation/detection and therefore are highly reliable.  The plant also exceeds training requirements and has appropriate material/equipment to control or stabilize process leaks and releases.  The AEP emergency response team conducts intensive annual training regarding chemical specific response scenarios and maintains chemical specific response equipment.  As a result, no significant accidental releases have occurred over the life of the various processes regulated by the PSM standard.\n\nFive-year Accident History:\n\nThe AEP has not had any RMP reportable releases of regulated substances in the past five years.  \n\nThe Emergency Response Program:\n\nHonda of America Mfg., Inc., has developed a company-wide Emergency Response Plan (ERP), which explains Honda's commitment to emergency response.  This plan describes the responsibility and procedures of Honda personnel and establishes a system in which the members of each plant's emergency response team work with local emergency response organizations.  This company-wide plan also serves as a model upon which the Honda/AEP emergency response team has based its own AEP-specif"

The AEP plan outlines how the Honda/AEP emergency response team is to work closely with the Anna Fire Department, the Shelby County Hazmat Team, and the Emergency Management Agency to promptly respond to any emergency.\n\nThe Honda/AEP Emergency Response Team (ERT) meets annually with the Village of Anna Fire Chief and members of its response team to review operations at the plant.  This meeting also includes an in-depth tour of the plant that includes inspection of sumps, hydraulic pump pits and a thorough inspection of the roof. \n\nThe Anna Engine Plant Emergency Response Team is currently made up of 12 to 15 associates on each of the three production shifts.  The members are volunteers who work full-time in their respective production departments.  There are 3 full-time emergency response staff members, one for each shift, with one (on a rotating basis) on call 24 hours a day, who are responsible for leadership and coordination of team members.  Each emergency response team member must meet Fire Fighter Level I state requirements as defined in section 1001 of the National Fire Prevention Association (NFPA) manual and must attend quarterly training classes and drills.  Training is taught on-site by an outside training contractor in accordance with NFPA, section 600 requirements.  Additionally, 5 to 10 emergency response team members on each shift are trained to the Hazmat Technician level as defined in OSHA section 1910.120 requirements.  \n\nThe emergency response team members are activated by procedures identified in the AEP Emergency Response Plan.  If plant security, which covers the plant switchboard 24 hours a day, receives an emergency call, they are trained to activate the alarm system and alert the emergency response pagers.
