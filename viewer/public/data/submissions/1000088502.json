This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with the Jones County Fire Department which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\r\n\r\n2. Regulated Substances Handled \r\nThere is one (1) regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is acrolein [2-Propenal].  The regulated substance at our facility is stored and distributed to our customers.  Acrolein [2-Propenal] is stored in a pressurized vessel to minimize emissions during storage.  There is no material handling of acrolein except moving of containers.\r\n\r\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program & Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68.  In additional to 40 CFR 68, the Baker Petrolite - Laurel facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119 and EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.\r\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of our release prevention program that are in place at our facility.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nLaurel UC maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with acrolein.\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\nLaurel UC conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that haz"

The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public.\r\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\r\n\r\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nLaurel UC has limited the access to the site to one gate and one pedestrian entrance to increase the safety of our employees, our communities, and the environment. In addition, our HSE management system continuously strives to improve procedures and equipment to ensure safety for our employees, our communities, and the environment.
