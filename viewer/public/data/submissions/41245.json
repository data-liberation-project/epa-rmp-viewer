      "SummaryText": "Slack Chemical is a chemical warehousing, repackaging and distribution company. At any one time there could be between 250 and 300 different chemicals on site. The majority of the chemicals are non-hazardous. Of the hazardous chemicals only one qualifies for the RMP Worst Case Scenario, chlorine. The plan has been reviewed and updated in 2004. The risks imposed with our process is minimal.\n\nSlack Chemicals Worst Case Scenatio- Emergency Response Plan is not for a stationary source but because of the quantity of chlorine handled and on hand it falls under the RMP as a process. The chlorine is in ton and 150# cylinders (150# cylinders is the alternate release scenario) and are located in warehouse 'E'. At any one time there could be 24,000+ pounds of chlorine on hand. Slack Chemical does not use the chlorine but houses/stores it to ship to customers who use it in their processes. Worse case scenario plans are located at the entrance door to warehouse 'E', the receptionist desk, and the Director of Regulatory Compliance office. The Company policies, plans and responses are explained in the Worse Case Scenario plan. Slack Chemical is located in an urban/residential area at the base of the foothills of the Adirondack Mountains and is approximately 30 miles east of Lake Ontario. The facility is located in the Village of Carthage, Jefferson County.\n\nIn the worst case scenario a ton cylinder could rupture releasing its contents to the atmosphere. If this would happen the resulting vapors could travel approximately 7,800+ feet before dissipating to 5 PPM or less. This scenario depends upon the weather conditions at the time of an incident. A catastrophic release could last a minimum of 5 minutes. The plume and associated hazardous conditions could affect 600 students and staff at an elementary school several hundred meters to the north, a hospital and residences. The normal wind direction and the location of the cylinders make this an improbable but not an impossible s"

      "SummaryText": "cenario. \n\nSlack Chemicals prevention program has been established around the training, transportation, handling, and storage of chlorine cylinders and all product processed at the facility. The Company Management Committee and the Safety Committee develop, implement and monitor all safety and risk management programs at the plant. \n\nChlorine cylinders are checked for leaks prior to them being off-loaded from the vendors truck. The end caps on the ton cylinders and the screw on/off caps on the 150# cylinders are never removed thus protecting the cylinders from having a valve sheared off. There are Job Tasks Descriptions, in writing, on how chlorine is to be handled and stored. The ton cylinders are rolled onto forklift tongs from the truck and secured in place with chocks to prevent them from moving. They are stored on wooden 4' X 4 tracks to keep them off the ground. The 150# cylinders are rolled off the truck by hand and stored upright with chain supporting them preventing them from falling. The full cylinders are separated from the empty. Slack Chemical has repair kits ('A' & 'B') for both type cylinders and the employees receive training regarding chlorine, its characteristics, first aid, emergency response, transportation, storage and handling and the use of the repair kits. \n\nIn the event of an incident Slack Chemical has several employees trained as HAZWOPER First Responders, two who has taken the 40 hour EPA Emergency Response To Hazardous Materials Incidents, course, and one employee who is on the Jefferson County Hazardous Materials Response Team. Public notification can be accomplished through phone calling, radio, or door-to-door. The evacuation of an area would be the decision of the Jefferson County Emergency Manager, the Incident Commander, and/or the Mayor of Carthage. The mayor has the final authority. \n\nAs mentioned above, the Management Committee and the Safety Committee are continually monitoring the safety and risk management programs for impro"
