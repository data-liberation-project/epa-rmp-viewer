In the event an accidental release should occur, we are prepared to work with our Local Fire Company(s),  Emergency Response Personnel, and other appropriate authorities deemed applicable depending on the specific incident, to best mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\nFacility Information:\n\n\n\nThe primary activity of our company is  NAICS code 115112 \"fertilizer applications for crops\"  however we are also engaged  in providing \"agricultural inputs\" that include the receiving, storage, and reloading of Anhydrous Ammonia for delivery to farmers in our area.     \n\n\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application to farm fields during the early spring and fall months.  During the balance of the year little if any product transfer occurs .  The maximum quantity handled at a given time would be the off loading of a semi-trailer vehicle tank. \n\n\n\nThe Anhydrous Ammonia storage facility is operated on an \"as needed\" basis with staff present only during the receiving and reloading of product for delivery.  Total annual hours at the work site do not meet the 2,080 hour requirement to qualify as a \"full time employee\" on site therefore we are required to report zero in item number 1.11    Our facilities have adequate lighting, and are inspected  at various times of day and night throughout the year. Time expended for these inspections is not included in our staffing calculation.\n\n\n\nWorst-case release scenario:\n\n\n\nThe \"worst-case release scenario\" is considered to be the re"

The maximum quantity released based on 85 % tank capacity as limited by design standards, the distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm)  miles based on EPA's RMP -Comp Program (Version 1.06), as well as possible public and environmental receptors within the area have been provided to the County LEPC (Local Emergency Planning Committee) to assist them in their planning.   \n\n\n\nAlternative release scenario:\n\n\n\nThere has not been an actual release of Anhydrous Ammonia during the last 5-years at the site.  We believe the most likely release would be caused by a break in a transfer hose.  Transfer hoses are protected by manual,  self closing excess flow , and \"pull away\" valves so our alternative release scenario is based on the loss of contents from the largest hose used (off loading transportation equipment).  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is determined per instructions by EPA guidance.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Program:\n\n\n\nOur Anhydrous Ammonia accidental release program is based on guidelines found in the American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) standard K-61.1 \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia; and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard 29CFR 1910.111 \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".   We conduct annual employee training on the safe handling, transportation and distribution of Anhydrous Ammonia, and have installed safety equipment including, but not limited to: Excess flow valves,  Breakaway couplers at risers,  Emergency shut-off valves,  Barriers to avoid damage by trucks or other vehicles, and Lock outs to prevent tampering when the site is unattended.   We also maintain routine contact with our local fire department and emergency response personnel; and have provided and/or participated in safety training exercises on Anhydrous Ammonia.
