Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Alco Chemical are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safey.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installlation, operating procedures, maintenance and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent potential releases of regulated substances.\n2.     The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur faciliy's primary activities encompass water based batch reactions.  We have four regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include 1) Carbon Disulfide, 2)  Dimethylamine solution in water and 3) Ethylenediamine 4) Vinyl Acetate Monomer.  The regulated substances at our facility are involved in several uses.  The primary use of all substances  is in producing additives for industrial cooling water treatment for prevention of disease causing bacterium and algae and industrial water treatment.  They are also used to reduce harmful bacterial growth in  the sugar manufacturing industry and in household detergents.\n\n3.       The Worst Case Release Scenarios and the Alternate Case Scenarios including adminstrative control and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario:\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our faciltiy, we have used SLAB models &  look up table.\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps  to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  Our release prevention plan involves both fixed systems and various elements desc"

At no time, are contractors allowed to perform non-routine activities such as welding, entering into confined space, and opening process lines without a permit from Alco maintenance personnel.  The permitting procedures require that all safety measures have been taken prior to performing such tasks.\n\n5.      Five Year Accident History\n         \nAlco Chemical has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years. We have not had a release reportable under the RMP program. \n\n6.      Emergency Response Plan\n\nAlco Chemical carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addtion, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that  would require a modified emergency response."

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nWe have fixed systems such as deluge system, sprinklers, fire monitor nozzles, elevated monitor nozzles, remotely operated nozzles, dikes, and run off collection system.  Any or all of these would be activated depending upon the gravity of situation.  However, we also have other components to our Prevention Program.  These are briefly described below.\n\n4.1    PROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n         -----------------------------------------\n         Alco Chemical maintains a detailed record of safety information that decribes the chemical hazards, operarting parameters and equipment designs associated with covered processes.\n\n4.2     PROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n          --------------------------------------\n         We conduct comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associted with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodolgy used to carry out these analyses is HAZOPS.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n4.3     OPERATING PROCEDURE\n          -------------------------------\n          For the purpose of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Alco Chemical maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial start up, normal operations, emergency shut down, emergency operations, and normal shut down.  Alco Chemical does not use temporary mode of operations.  The information is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.  Alco Chemical is an ISO 9001 certified  facility.
