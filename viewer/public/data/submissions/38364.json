      "SummaryText": "The Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority has operated the Water Treatment Plant for the City of Lockhart since 2000 without any reportable accidents.  Only one hazardous chemical is used in sufficient quantity to require compliance with the RMP.  Chlorine is stored and used as disinfectant for drinking water.\n\nG.B.R.A. recognizes the importance of care in the handling of chlorine.  Chlorine handling has been addressed in the G.B.R.A. Safety Manual, Job Safety Analysis, Emergency Operations Plan, the Preventative Maintenance Program, and Annual Safety Audit.  Chlorine training occurs once a year with a more advanced training every two years.  Training is conducted on a practice container.  Team members review procedures for various senarios.  Leak detection systems are located at the plant with audible and visible alarms.  Personnel have access to S.C.B.A.'s, a chlorine ton repair kit, and proper training if ever a situation were to present itself.\n\nG.B.R.A. sees the need for improvement and constant training with the completion of the Risk Management Plan.  Along with the Lockhart Fire Department, G.B.R.A. will coordinate certain job duties to perform maximum recovery in a worst case senario.  The distance covered in a worst case senario is 1.3, which involves a portion of the city.  The situation poses danger , yet response is the key.  Everyone involved in the response program will be minutes from the scene.  Proper training, hazardous checklist reviews, and constant communication will be our focus to provide a safe environment for the citizens of Lockhart as well as its employees."
