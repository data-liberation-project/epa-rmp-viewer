This facility has mechanisms in-place as identified in the Process Safety Management, Ammonia Refrigeration System to address small releases of ammonia.  If an emergency release were to occur (i.e. a reportable quantity release), it is our policy to notify applicable agencies and request that they respond to the emergency.  The Saulsbury Brothers facility is included in the Caroline County Emergency Operations Plan.  Procedures are contained therein for response to an emergency involving the ammonia refrigeration systems by non-facility personnel.\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:\n\nThis facility is a raw vegetable processing facility.  The facility receives, processes, packages and freezes raw vegetables for shipping to destinations in the region.  We use ammonia as a refrigerant in four (4) ammonia refrigeration systems to provide refrigeration capacity to process equipment including cooler and blast freezer evaporator units and water chillers.  The systems are identified as  Flo Freezer No. 1, Flo Freezer No. 2, Cold Storage No. 3, and Cold Storage No. 4.  Flo Freezer No. 1 and No.2 systems are interconnected and have a combined ammonia capacity of 12,174 pounds. Cold Storage No. 3 and Cold Storage No. 4 have capacities of 3,608 pounds and 3,198 pounds, respectively.  Thus, the total plant capacity is 18,980 pounds.  \n\nThe worst-case and alternative case release scenarios:\n\nOur worst-case scenario is the failure of a pipe or vessel in Flo Freezer Systems No. 1 and No. 2 when they are operating with their combined maximum intended inventory of 12,174 pounds, resulting in its complete release to the environment over a period of 10 minutes.

      "SummaryText": "ulting distance to a 200 ppm ammonia toxic endpoint is 7,500 feet and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  Our alternative release scenario is a 1/4\" effective diameter orifice leak (representative of a pump seal leak or gasket rupture) leading to an airborne release.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends off-site to a distance of 1,000 feet.\n\nThe general accident release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps: \n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The ammonia  refrigeration systems are designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with IIAR codes and standards.\n\nFive-year accident history:\n\nWe have not had an accident involving ammonia that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place in the five years prior to June 21, 1999.\n\n\nThe emergency response program:\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our ammonia refrigeration systems, it is our policy to perform immediate external notifications to applicable agencies (National Response Center, State Emergency Response Commission, Local Emergency Planning Committee) and request that they respond to the emergency.  The Saulsbury Brothers facility is included  in the Caroline County Emergency Operations Plan.  Procedures are contained therein for response to an emergency involving the ammonia refrigeration system by non-facility personnel.\nPlanned changes to improve safety:  \n\nChanges will be implemented as needed as a result of safety evaluations of the refrigeration systems."
