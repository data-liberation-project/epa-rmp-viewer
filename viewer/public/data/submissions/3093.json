The booster discharge passes through intercoolers before entering the high side compressors.\n\nThe high side compressor suction draws from the intercoolers (booster discharge) and the high side suction accumulator and liquid recirculators at about 25 psig.  This accumulator receives suction from the refrigerated tanks, glycol chillers, and high side cooler units.  \n\nThe major discharge from the high side compressors (hot gas), at 150 to 175 psig, is vented to roof-mounted condensing towers.  A portion of the hot gas is also used for defrosting and for operation of the pumper drums (which can be used to transfer liquid).  The condensed liquid is returned to the high pressure receiver where it is fed to the system.  \n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is protected by the existence of specific safety systems/hardware, including safety relief valves, engine room ventilation, and system safety interlocks.  Safety relief valves protect the receiver, compressor discharge, condensers, pumper drums, suction accumulators, intercooler, and other vessels from the hazards associated with overpressure.  Safety interlocks include high pressure and high temperature alarms and cutouts for the compressors, as well as high level floats and sensors for vessels.  The high pressure cutouts for the compressors are set at 200 psig.\n2.0\tPOTENTIAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\nThe refrigeration system is a totally closed system.  Historically, releases of ammonia from industrial refrigeration systems most often occur from leaking valves, malfunctioning pressure relief devices, or inadvertent releases during repair activities.  While these incidents can impact employees, they seldom lead to a release of a reportable quantity or represent an off-site impact (i.e., beyond the property line).\n\nConsistent with the RMP rule requirements, two specifically defined release scenarios (a worst-case release and an alternative release) were analyzed to dete"

This release is representative of a small pipe or vessel leak.  It would also be representative of a flange leak or pump seal failure.  Because the high pressure receiver and some piping are located outdoors, passive (building) mitigation1 was not used to reduce the release rate or the distance to the endpoint.  Active mitigation2 was considered, because it is believed that emergency responders could identify and stop the leak in less than 60 minutes.  However, reducing the release duration does not change the TEP distance obtained from the Model plan.  \n\nUsing the specified meteorology contained in the Model Plan, the distance to the endpoint for the more likely release scenario was estimated to be 450 feet or 0.1 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n* Many of the high pressure liquid lines are located in enclosed areas that could help to contain such a release, and the outside piping is elevated to promote dispersion;\n\n* Industrial standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of these lines;\n\n* Ammonia is not corrosive in this service;\n\n* Most of the lines are elevated to minimize potential damage from fork lifts;\n\n* The facility has a preventive maintenance program in place to m"

The plan details what personal protective equipment and spill response equipment is available; identifies specific individuals, their 24-hour telephone numbers, and their responsibilities; identifies procedures for emergency medical care; and refers to other pertinent elements of the management system (i.e., standard operating procedures).\n\n1\tPassive mitigation means equipment, devices, and technologies that function without human, mechanical, or other energy input.

This endpoint represents the maximum airborne concentration below which nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible effects or symptoms that could impair their ability to take protective action.\n\nThe release scenarios analyzed are based upon the guidance contained in the USEPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration (the Model Plan), dated November 1998.  This guidance document used the SACRUNCH atmospheric dispersion model to construct lookup tables that relate the quantity and rate of ammonia released to the endpoint distance.\n\n2.1\tWORST-CASE RELEASE\nThe worst-case release is considered to be defined by the catastrophic rupture and complete loss of the maximum contents of the storage receiver (approximately 3,650 pounds of ammonia) over a 10-minute period.  Using the specified worst-case meteorology contained in the Model Plan, the distance to the endpoint for a worst-case release was estimated to be 3,700 feet or 0.7 mile.\n\nAlthough the worst-case consequence analysis is required by the RMP, it should be considered a highly unlikely event.  Design, construction, and operation of the high pressure receiver is such that catastrophic failure is extremely remote.  The receiver was designed and constructed in strict accordance with the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (Section VIII), and was certified and stamped by the National Board of Pressure Vessel Inspectors (National Board).  Third party and state mandated inspections of the vessel's condition occurs annually by a boiler and machinery insurance inspector who has been certified by the National Board.  In addition, the vessel is visually inspected.\n\nThere are only two plausible causes for a catastrophic loss of containment of the receiver:  (1) the internal"

To help minimize the probability and severity of an ammonia release, a prevention program that satisfies the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals  standard (29 CFR 1910.119) has been implemented.  The key components of the prevention program are summarized below:\n\n* The development, documentation, and operator availability of critical process safety information regarding the hazards of ammonia, the design basis of the system, and the equipment.  This information is used to fully understand and safely operate the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n* The development of an extensive employee participation program, which includes employees from all levels of the organization and from all areas within the plant (i.e., production and maintenance).  This program also assures that employees that utilize the ammonia system and are most knowledgeable about it are best able to easily, effectively, and regularly recommend changes or improvements which enhance safety.\n\n* The performance of a formal process hazard analysis (PHA) in 1996, using the What-if... technique.

      "SummaryText": "1.0\tSOURCE AND PROCESS DESCRIPTION\n1.1\tSOURCE\nThe Hiland Dairy facility is subject to the USEPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) for Accidental Chemical Release regulation (40 CFR 68) because it has a refrigeration system that contains more than the threshold quantity (10,000 pounds) of anhydrous ammonia (CAS Number 7664-41-7).  Anhydrous ammonia (NH3), is a gas at ambient conditions.  The anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) refrigeration system is used to manufacture and store fluid milk, yogurt, and other related products.  It is a closed system that contains approximately 16,300 pounds (i.e.,  3,000 gallons) of ammonia in various physical states (gas, liquid, and saturated vapor).  The largest vessel is the high pressure receiver that operates at approximately 150 psig and can contain as much as 3,650 pounds of liquid ammonia (at its maximum safe fill volume of 90%).  However, this vessel typically contains less than 1,000 pounds of ammonia.  Most of the ammonia equipment is located indoors.  The condensing towers and some piping runs are located outdoors.\n\nAmmonia is the oldest and most common refrigerant in general industrial use throughout the world.  It is a high capacity refrigerant that operates at reasonable pressure.  Although exposure to ammonia is irritating and potentially toxic in large doses, personnel exposure to more than a small leak is rare because ammonia operates within a closed system of vessels, piping, and equipment.  In addition, ammonia can be easily detected by smell at levels well below its toxic endpoint.\n\n1.2\tPROCESS DESCRIPTION\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is a two-stage system consisting of a high pressure side and a low pressure side.  The storage freezer units operate on the low side (i.e., low pressure).  Ammonia suction from the storage freezers and processing units at or below 0 psig passes through the low side accumulator before entering the booster compressors.  Any liquid ammonia in the low side suction is trapped in the low side"

      "SummaryText": "pressure were to increase uncontrollably and rupture the vessel from the inside; or (2) rupture of the vessel wall due to inadvertent contact (e.g., vehicular) from the outside.\n\nThe vessel is operated well below the design pressure (i.e., maximum allowable working pressure) of 250 psig and because of the safety factors built into the ASME Code, a fourfold pressure excursion, to approximately 1,000 psig, would have to occur before catastrophic vessel failure.  Such pressures could not be generated internally.  The only logical external cause of high pressure would be flame impingement or surface radiation from a high challenge fire adjacent to the vessel.  If this were to occur, the vessel is equipped with a safety relief valve (SRV) set to relieve internal pressure at 250 psig.  A high pressure excursion would not occur as long as the SRV continued to function.  Actuation of the SRV would result in an ammonia release similar to that described in Section 2.2 for the alternative release scenario.  The SRVs are replaced every five years, in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidance contained in IIAR Bulletin Number 109, Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safety Ammonia Refrigeration System, to ensure that they will function properly when required.\n\nFurther, rupture of the vessel from the outside as a result of inadvertent vehicular contact is unlikely since the unit is located inside the engine room.   \n\nThe worst-case release scenario is unlikely for the following additional reasons:\n\n* The worst-case weather conditions which were used for this scenario are uncommon;\n\n* Industry standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of this receiver;\n\n* Ammonia is not corrosive in this service and the vessels are relatively new;\n\n* Safety relief valves limit operating pressures;\n\n* The facility has a preventive maintenance program in place to maintain the ongoing integrity of the vessel;\n\n* The facility has a training pr"
