This is demonstrated through a comprehensive system we?ve undertaken to prevent accidental releases at our facilities.  This system is all-encompassing, and includes (but is not necessarily limited to): System design and maintenance, Accurate Operating Procedures, and making sure each employee operating a covered process has been both certified (RETA) and trained on our specific system through the use of our ammonia refrigeration contractors.\n\n\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass potato cold storage.  We have two regulated substances present at our facility, anhydrous ammonia used for cold storage refrigeration, and chlorine used to sanitize our rinse water.  \n\n\n\nWe have undertaken studies to determine our Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios using RMP Comp?, Land View ?, and RMP Submit ?.  The results of these scenario studies are available at the main office of the Potato Shed at 16456 Slater Avenue, Bakersfield CA 93308.  \n\n\n\nWe?ve compiled safety information for this facility that includes: Original Blueprints, Piping & Instrumentation Diagrams, Original Equipment Manufacturer?s literature, Material Safety Data Sheets, Inspection Forms, and a detailed Mechanical Integrity Inspection Schedule.  This facility was originally constructed in accordance with ASTM standards, and has not undergone any changes that would result in modification of this data.\n\n\n\nWe?ve conducted several Process Hazard Analyses, the most recent being in June of 2008.  As of this submission (March 2009), we have remediated everything identified by this study and subsequent Compliance Audits (the latest being March 2009) to ensure compliance with the California Code of Regulations, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5.  Process Hazard Analyses are conducted every five years and Compliance Audits conducted every three"

      "SummaryText": ".  Documentation of these programs are available in the office of the Potato Shed at 16456 Slater Avenue, Bakersfield CA 93308.\n\n\n\nIn order to ensure the safe operation of our system, we review our Standard Operating Procedures on an annual basis.  The most recent of these reviews was conducted in March of 2009.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nAll of our operators have been certified by the Refrigerating Engineers and Technicians Association, at a minimum of Operator Level l, and have received training on the specifics of our system by our ammonia refrigeration contractor.\n\n\n\nWe?ve instituted a detailed Mechanical Inspection program that is based on both Original Equipment Manufacturers? and generally-accepted industry guidelines.  These detailed inspections are carried out annually, with visual inspections being performed daily by operators.\n\nOur refrigeration contractor is responsible for maintaining Maintenance Procedures, as our facility staff does not conduct maintenance, only operation.\n\n\n\nAs a measure of additional safety, we pledge to investigate every accident or near-miss as they occur to prevent similar incidents.  There has never been a release from this facility.  In case of accidental release or other emergency, Vignolo Farms Inc. maintains an effective Emergency Action Plan which details which steps to be taken in case of release or other disaster.\n\n"
