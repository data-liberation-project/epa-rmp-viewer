Metro District believes that a good place to work must be a safe place and is dedicated to providing safe working conditions to prevent accidents.  The Metro District recognizes that accidents can be prevented by intelligent cooperation of personnel and the understanding and constant practice of accident prevention by each employee.\n\nThe Metro District publishes and distributes to each employee a Safety Manual of Policies, Programs, Practices, and Procedures to ensure employees are aware of the potential industrial hazards associated with wastewater treatment.  Every new employee also takes a mandatory two-part general safety and awareness-training module as part of the new hire orientation.\n\nA Description of the Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled\nThe Metro District is a regional government formed under Colorado law in 1961.  It provides wholesale wastewater transmission and treatment service to 55 member municipalities and special connectors in the Denver metropolitan area in compliance with federal, state, and county laws.\n\nThe Metro District collects about 140 million gallons of wastewater per day from neighborhood sewer lines and delivers it through approximately 230 miles of interceptor sewers to the Metro District's Robert "

      "SummaryText": "W. Hite Treatment Facility in northeast Denver.  \n\nPrimary treatment removes pollutants from wastewater through screening, skimming, and settling. Secondary treatment uses microorganisms to remove suspended and dissolved organic matter.  Chlorine is then mixed with the remaining water to kill harmful microorganisms (pathogens).  Before the effluent is discharged into the South Platt River, it is dechlorinated by mixing it with sulfur dioxide.  \n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\nThe Metro District's release prevention program integrates safety information, hazard review, standard operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigations into an effective accident prevention program associated with the disinfection system.  The Metro District trains all employees who work on covered processes to ensure the safe operation and maintenance of the disinfection system.  The maintenance schedules and activities are computerized and designed to have all maintenance be preventative.  \n\nMaintenance on the disinfection system is planned and documented using a Computerized Maintenance Management System.  This program schedules daily maintenance tasks to maintain systems in good working order.\n\nThe leak detection portion of the disinfection system consists of process area detectors that have audible, visible, and remote alarms.  The remote alarm appears at the Control Systems Operator's computer.  In addition, operators inspect the disinfection system every two hours.  Process controls include vents, relief valves, check valves, manual shutoffs, automatic shutoffs, alarms, emergency air supply, emergency power, and rupture disks.  \n\nThe Five-Year Accident History\nThe Metro District had an accident in 2006 that injured one employee. An RMP correction and recertification letter was submitted to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on December 14, 2006.\n\nThe Emergency Response Program\nThe M"

      "SummaryText": "etro District is a non-responding facility; therefore, Metro District employees will not respond to accidental releases of regulated substances.  The South Adams County Fire Protection District (SACFPD) is the Metro District's emergency responder.  The Metro District coordinates all emergency response actions with SACFPD.  SACFPD will respond to any accidental releases of chlorine and/or sulfur dioxide at the Metro District.  SACFPD personnel has been trained on the use of emergency leak repair kits for railcars which are stored on site.  Finally, evacuation procedures for plant personnel are well documented in the Metro District's Disinfection Emergency Action Plan.  \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nThe Metro District has a project to replace liquid chlorine and sulfur dioxide with alternative chemicals that will not pose a risk to human health through atmospheric dispersion that will be operational by the end of 2010.  Once the facility is on line, the District will schedule the decommissioning of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems.  When the facilities have been decommissioned, the Metro District will no longer be subject to 40 CFR Part 68 requirements."
