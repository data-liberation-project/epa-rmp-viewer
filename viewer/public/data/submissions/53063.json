      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nHelena is submitting this updated electronic RMP in compliance with the provisions of the Clean Air Act 112 (r) as codified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency at 40 CFR Part 68 and the State of California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  Standards codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration at 29 CFR 1910.119 are not applicable to the operations at this facility because the facility is operated as a retail operation and is exempt from the OSHA standards.  This electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of aqua ammonia from the Butte City Retail Facility located at Highway 45 & Highway 162 in Butte, City, Ca. 95920.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Butte City Retail Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Butte City Retail Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release (even though a release is unlikely) will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\n\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\n\n\nHelena updated this RMP in 2008 response to its recent internal compliance audit and an increase in the chemical inventory.  Helena is updating this RMP as a correction in 2012 to show that the quantity of aqueous ammonia, although still above the regulatory threshold, has been reduced because the Facility removed a 9,000-gallon tank from the process.  It is important to note that this change did not trigger a change to the OCA, Program Level, Operating Procedures, Safety Procedures, or the Process Hazard Analysis.\n\n\n\nFACILITY\n\n\n\nThe Butte City Retail Facility is a retail agricultural chemical facility that stores aqua ammonia in one 14,000-gallon storage tank and one 1,000-gallon storage tank.  Aqua ammonia is transported to this facility via a commercial carrier and transferred to the 14,000-gallon storage tank.  The 14,000-gallon storag"

      "SummaryText": "e tank is vented to the 1,000-gallon storage tank to scrub emissions.  The process operations conducted by Helena personnel consist of transferring aqua ammonia from the 14,000-gallon storage tank into a facility operated transport truck and delivering the aqua ammonia to local farmers for direct application.  In the field, the aqua ammonia is transferred from the transport truck into a poly-tank.    \n\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nWorst case and alternative consequence analysis were completed for the aqua ammonia storage process. The worst-case scenario release for the Butte City Retail Facility assumed that all the contents in the largest single storage tank were released (14,000-gallon).  The release was modeled as if the aqua ammonia tank had a catastrophic failure and the contents were released and contained within the diked secondary containment.  The vapor emission rate of the chemicals was calculated using standard equations recommended by U.S. EPA for such analyses.  The fate and transport of the evaporated ammonia was modeled via a standard U.S. EPA screening air dispersion model, SCREEN3.  \n\n\n\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario assumes a rupture of a 2-inch transfer hose caused by an impact from a vehicle or some other source during a loading or unloading operation.  The vapor release rates and fate and transport of the evaporated ammonia was managed the same as the worst-case scenario.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Branch Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Helena facility and is assisted by the Depot Manager.  The Branch and Depot Managers are responsible for conducting aqua ammonia process operations in accordance with this RMP and are responsible for the relevant maintenance, training procedures and documentation.  Upon request, a copy of its Risk Management Plan, Contingency Plan, and Operating Procedures will be provided to its contractors and auditing agency.  \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n"

The RMP will be updated as the Butte City Retail Facility adds, deletes, or changes processes. The Emergency Response Program has been coordinated with the Region III, CA LEPC.\n\n\n\nNOTE: Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 of the standard RMP produced by EPA's RMP Submit Program are not applicable to the Butte City Retail Facility."
