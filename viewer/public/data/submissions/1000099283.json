Because of its extreme toxicity, chlorine is considered a hazardous material.\n\n\n\nSnavely's Mill is committed to maintaining a safe manufacturing operation for our employees and the surrounding community. Our chlorination system obeys our local building and fire codes, as well as industry-consensus codes and standards where appropriate. In accordance with the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (29 CFR 1910.119) and Environmental Protection Agency (40 CFR 68) regulations, this facility has prepared an OSHA / RMP Program, as well as performed air dispersion modeling and off-site consequence analysis.\n\n\n\nOur priority is to prevent accidental releases of hazardous materials instead of merely responding to problems. Our RMP program includes elements addressing:\n\n- Employee Participation: We involve our employees at all appropriate points in our program.\n\n- Process Safety Information: We maintain information relating to the safety of chlorine and the chlorination system design so that our employees are fully informed.\n\n- Process Hazards Analysis (PHA): We conduct detailed studies of our chlorination system to identify the important hazards and safeguards. The PHA is revalidated every five (5) years.\n\n- Operating Procedures: We provide written operating procedures to help our staff stay within the safe operating limits of the chlorination equipment.\n\n- Mechanical Integrity (Maintenance and Quality Control): We have established a comprehensive program of inspections and preventive maintenance to keep mechanical failures from occurring.\n\n- Training: We train our operators in safe operation and maintenance of the chlorination system.\n\n- Management of Change: Alterations to the chlorination system are screened to verify that they are within the original safe design limits.\n\n- Pre-Startup Safety Review: We conduct a formal safety review before startup"
