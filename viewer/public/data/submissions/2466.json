( Ethox ) is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for its employees, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, Ethox established a system to ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  Part of this system is a Risk Management Program that helps manage potential risks at Ethox and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One requirement of the rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) describing the risk management program at Ethox.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at Ethox.\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nEthox is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  A comprehensive accidental release prevention program is in place that covers areas such as the design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility.  It is Ethox policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  However, if such a release does occur, Ethox is completely coordinated with Donaldson Center Fire Department which provides trained emergency response personnel to assist in the control and to mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe facility's primary activity is the manufacturing of Surface Active Chemicals.  There are two regulated substances present at the facility: Ethylene oxide [Oxirane] (EO) and Propylene oxide [Oxirane, methyl-] (PO). EO and PO are used for manufacturing detergents, emulsifiers and wetting agents. The maximum inventory in any one ves"

The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), include administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nEthox performed an offsite consequence analysis (OCA) to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.  The OCA consists of evaluating both worst-case scenarios (WCS) and alternative release scenarios (ARS). An ARS represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility like Ethox.  An ARS helps the LEPC improve the community emergency response plan.\n\nThe main objective of performing the OCA is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).  The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance.  At a distance less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less.\n\nWhen considering the release of a toxic substance, most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are likely. People who are particularly susceptible to the substance released could be incapacitated.\n \nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for the facility, Ethox has used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from a rail car.  The scenario involves the release of 170000 lb. of Ethylene oxide [Oxirane] in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Under worst case weather"

      "SummaryText": " conditions, namely Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 11 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.090 mg/L.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios\n\nOne alternative release scenario will be submitted for each toxic substance present in Program 2 and Program 3 processes cumulatively. \n\n    The alternative release scenario for EO involves a release from the relief valve opening on an EO Rail Car.  The release rate is 6,000 lb/hr.  This release rate is set by the relief valve flow capacity.  The duration is 5 minutes.  The alternative release scenario is based on the relief valve opening from over pressurization due to excess nitrogen flow to the rail car.  In accordance with Ethox response procedures, plant personnel will quickly stop the nitrogen flow , allowing the relief valve to re-close.  The elevation is 13 feet to the top of an EO rail car.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.090 mg/L is 0.37 miles.\n\n    The alternative release scenario for PO involves a release from the relief valve opening on a PO Rail Car.  The release rate is 6,000 lb/hr.  This release rate is set by the relief valve flow capacity.  The duration is 5 minutes. The alternative release scenario is based on the relief valve opening from over pressurization due to excess nitrogen flow to the rail car.
