The New Oxford, Pennsylvania Poultry Processing Plant has written this document in an effort prepare for emergencies relating to the anhydrous ammonia, which is currently used as a refrigerant above the EPA threshold value of 10,000 lbs, and to comply with Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 68.  This document, in conjunction with the Process Safety Management Program, will be used to comply with the Title 40 regulations.\n\nPlainville Farms, LLC (Plainville Farms) utilizes anhydrous ammonia in the refrigeration system at its New Oxford Processing Facility, located at 304 South Water Street, in New Oxford, Pennsylvania, 17350.  The substance is received by a tanker truck delivery and is transferred into the high-pressure receiver located outside the Air Compressor Room northwest corner of the facility.  The plant has a total capacity of 38,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia and normally stores about 34,000 pounds of the product within its refrigeration system during normal operations.\n\nThe facility's Safety Manager maintains an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) and a Chemical Release Emergency Prevention Plan which provides the response procedures all employees, contractors, and visitors to the Plainville Farms New Oxford Processing Facility must follow. As provided in these documents, Plainville Farms New Oxford Processing Facility employees are to inform an incident commander in the event that an ammonia release is suspected.  It is the responsibility of the incident commander to confirm that an ammonia release has occurred and determine the necessary level of evacuation as well as to call the fire department to respond to the incident.  The Plainville Farms New Oxford Processing Facility does not currently have an Incident "
