      "SummaryText": "The Panther Creek Energy Facility, located in Nesquehoning, Pennsylvania, is committed to ensuring a safe work environment for its employees and the surrounding community.  To this end, plant management strongly supports the implementation of safe procedures for all aspects of operation, including the DENOX process that uses Anhydrous Ammonia.  The facility fully complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) rule and the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP).  \n\n\n\nThe Panther Creek Energy Facility is a small electric power generation facility.  Power at the facility is generated through the burning of culm, a waste product generated from the production of anthracite coal.  A byproduct from the combustion of any coal or culm is nitrous oxides (NOx).  \n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is injected into the cyclones of the boilers to minimize NOx emissions to the atmosphere by converting NOx to nitrogen and water.  Anhydrous ammonia is delivered to the facility in tank trucks and stored in a 24,000-gallon pressure vessel before being vaporized and injected into the boiler cyclones.\n\n\n\nAs part of the RMP requirements, facilities must consider the impact of a worst-case and an alternate-case release of a regulated substance.  Panther Creek utilized the Dense Gas Dispersion (DEGADIS) Model developed by the University of Arkansas for the U.S. Coast Guard.  DEGADIS can handle ground-level passive releases.  \n\n\n\nThe Panther Creek Energy Facility complies with the OSHA PSM rule.  Classroom and on-line safety training is conducted for all employees, and specific training is given to operators of the anhydrous ammonia system.  All components of the ammonia system are covered under a Mechanical Integrity program to assure that it is operated safely and to assure that the sytem remains physically sound.  Standard operating procedures (SOPs) have been established for start-up and shutdown of the ammonia "

      "SummaryText": "process under both normal and emergency situations.\n\n\n\nThe Panther Creek Energy Facility has an Emergency Response (ER) Plan in place that is reviewed and updated.  All employees have been trained on this procedure.  On-duty plant operators are available in the Control Room 24 hours per day.  Plant Operators will notify the emergency response coordinator in the event of a leak or spill.  \n\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan contains specific actions required to control an ammonia release from equipment or piping damage, a leaking valve, or the activation of a pressure relief device.  The plan discusses the procedures to be implemented in the event of a fire adjacent to the ammonia system.  Procedures are included to alert facility personnel of the danger potential. A list of emergency contacts and evacuation procedures are included in the plan.\n\n\n\nThe Panther Creek Energy Facility is committed to continuous improvement of its environmental, health and safety performance.  The facility remains fully committed to the safe storage, use, and operation of the anhydrous ammonia system.  The facility complies with the regulations and intent of both the PSM and RMP programs.
