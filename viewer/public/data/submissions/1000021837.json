      "SummaryText": "Boulder Scientific (BSC) operates a small specialty\n\nchemical production facility in Mead, Colorado.  Ethyl ether is used in \n\nlarge quantities in some reaction processes, and therefore is stored in C-430 cylinders, C-120 cylinders, a \n\n10,000-gallon or a 4,500 gallon tank on site.  Because the quantity of ethyl ether on site can \n\nexceed the 10,000-lb threshold for the RMP rule, Boulder Scientific prepared \n\nand submitted this plan.\n\n\n\nThe storage and transfer of ethyl ether is also regulated under OSHA's \n\nProcess Safety Mangement Standard (PSM), and BSC developed a number of \n\nsafety protocols and procedures when the PSM standard was implemented in \n\n1996.  In addition to the normal safeguards associated with handling \n\nflammable liquids, BSC implemented detailed written procedures for all ethyl \n\nether transfers.  These procedures were reviewed in great detail by the PSM \n\ncommittee to systematically identify potential hazards and eliminate or \n\nreduce the risk associated with each hazard. All personnel handling ethyl \n\nether receive special training in handling flammable liquids and the unique \n\nhazards assoicated with ethyl ether.   In over twenty years of operating \n\nwith ethyl ether, BSC has never had a significant incident involving ethyl \n\nether.  In addition to the procedure and operating equipment safety \n\nreviews (PHA), accident risk is further reduced by locating the storage of ethyl ether in \n\na diked areas to prevent migration of spilled liquids and by fire protection \n\nfrom a high-volume sprinkler system and FFF foam system.\n\n\n\nThe equipment covered under the PSM standard (and the RMP rule) includes the \n\nstorage tanks, cylinders, transfer piping, and MicroMotion Meters connected to the storage \n\ntank.  Under the RMP rule, each facility is required to develop a worst case \n\nscenario which assumes that the maximum quantity in the process (all the \n\ncontents of the storage tank) are instantly vaporized and explode.  The \n\nanalysis of this worst-case s"

      "SummaryText": "cenario indicates a radius of impact of 0.28 \n\nmiles, which extends to the west of the property boundary into a residential \n\narea in the town of Mead.  As EPA points out in their guidance documents, \n\nthese distances do not represent the likely reults of an accident because \n\nthey are so conservative.  The more realistic (but still quite conservative) \n\nalternative scenarios of a leaking tank followed by a pool fire or vapor \n\ncloud fire produce impact distances of less than 0.1 miles, which are \n\ncompletely contained on the property to the south, west, and north.  \n\nPotential off-property impact to the east is minimal since this property is \n\ncurrently agricultural land.  There were no alternative scenarios that \n\nproduced impact distances of greater than 0.1 miles.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency release, BSC has written and tested a \n\ncomprehensive Emergency Response Plan.  Coordinated through Mountain View \n\nFire Department, the Plan describes what steps are to be taken in the event \n\nof a major fire or chemical release.  BSC maintains OSHA-certified \n\nresponders on each production shift and coordinates practice responses on an \n\nongoing basis with the Fire Department.\n\n\n\nTo summarize, ethyl ether has been handled without incident at the BSC site \n\nfor over twenty years.  BSC's ongoing program of risk minimization for ethyl \n\nether storage and transfer is reflected in four types of safeguards:\n\n\n\n1)  Location of the storage tanks and piping far enough from the property \n\nline to eliminate potential off-property impact,\n\n2)  Risk reduction through safety and hazard analysis, proper employee \n\ntraining,  and the PSM program\n\n3)  Passive mitigation of spilled liquids with concrete dikes\n\n4)  Active mitigtaion of fires with a high-flow sprinkler and foam systems"
