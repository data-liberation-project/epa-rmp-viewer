The Cogeneration Facility has an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\n\nThe Cogeneration Facility, operating since 1988, is located at 5601 Eucalyptus Avenue in the City of Chino, in San Bernardino County.  Ammonia is used for the reduction of nitric oxide from the steam generator  exhaust.  Ammonia is stored in a bulk storage tank, which is designed to hold 10,936 gallons of ammonia.  However, operating procedures (administrative control) specify that maximum quantity of ammonia in the tank should be 85% of the tank design capacity.  This ammonia storage exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the EPA and CalARP RMP rules.  It also exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the federal and California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standards.\n\nAmmonia is brought to the Cogeneration Facility and transferred to the bulk ammonia storage tank.  The tank is equipped with an electrically heated vaporizer to maintain adequate vaporization and constant pressure in the storage tank during ammonia withdrawal. Vaporized ammonia is withdrawn from the tank and diluted with ambient air prior to injection into the plant's Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) zone.  The ammonia system contains the following instrumentation and controls to ensure safe operation of the system:\n\nStorage Tank Fill and Outlet Lines: Excess flow check valves (EFCV) are installed in the storage tank nozzles for the vapor return line, inlet and outlet lines of the vaporizer, drain line, and vapor supply line.  The EFCV closes the line in the event of a break to minimize the escape of ammonia to the atmosphere.  \nLeak Detectors: Two ammonia detectors are installed near the stora"

A signal is sent to a local audible alarm and remotely to the DCS located in the Control Room.\n\nStorage Tank: The tank is equipped with high pressure and high high-pressure alarms.  A water deluge system is available to cool the tank and reduce the pressure.  In addition, the tank is provided with a dual pressure relief valve to protect the tank integrity during overpresurization.\n\nAmmonia Vaporizer: High pressure or high temperature will shut down the vaporizer heater.  The vaporizer is also provided with a pressure relief valve.\n\nAmmonia Dilution System: To prevent ammonia concentrations in the dilution air stream from reaching explosive limits, power or blower failure will cause a flow control valve to close; thus stopping the ammonia flow from the storage tank.\n\nThe Cogeneration Facility is also provided with an emergency generator, which will be operational in 5 to 10 minutes on loss of main source of power.  \n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two ammonia release scenarios, identified as \"worst-case release scenario\" and \"alternative release scenario\". The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the ... maximum quantity in the largest vessel ... is released as a gas over 10-minutes,\" due to an unspecified failure. The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario\".\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for the Cogeneration Facility involves a failure of the ammonia bulk storage tank containing 9,295 gallons (52,055 pounds) of ammonia to the atmosphere over a 10-minute duration.  Only passive or administrative controls are allowed under the worst-case scenario to reduce the off-site impacts.  The storage capacity of the ammonia tank is 10,936 gallons, but administrative controls are used to fill the tank to only 9,295 gallons.  The"

      "SummaryText": "administrative controls include written operating procedures.  A secondary containment (dike) is also provided for the bulk ammonia tank.  This passive mitigation control was not taken into account for performing the off-site consequence analysis because anhydrous ammonia is not expected to pool and then evaporate slowly from the pool.  The ammonia release rate to the atmosphere was estimated at 5,205.5 lbs./min).\n\nThe bulk ammonia tank rupture, resulting in ammonia release could be caused by catastrophic events, such as an earthquake.  The released liquid ammonia is assumed to form a denser-than-air cloud consisting of ammonia vapor and liquid droplets (aerosols) and then disperse in the atmosphere.  The distance to the toxic endpoint was estimated using the EPA and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's ALOHA dense gas dispersion model. The toxic endpoint selected by EPA and CalARP rules for ammonia is 200 ppm, which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  The toxic endpoint was conservatively set by EPA to ensure public notification and that local emergency response planning takes into account the greatest possible impacted area surrounding the release point.  In practice, this type of a total failure of a bulk storage tank would be unlikely.  EPA-mandated meteorological conditions, namely atmospheric Stability Class F, wind speed of 1.5 meter per second, highest daily maximum temperature (110 deg F), and average relative humidity (65%) were used for the worst-case release scenario analysis.  The results of the dispersion modeling analysis indicated that the worst-case release scenario has offsite impacts.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is more of a possible release scenario that may occur compared to the worst-case release scenario.  Based on the process hazard analysis performed for the ammonia system, an alternative release scenario was selected.  Unlike the worst-case scenario, active controls can be applied to minimize"

The alternative release scenario selected for the analysis involves the release of ammonia gas from a crack in the one-inch flex-hose connecting the ammonia storage tank to the process.  The ammonia monitors installed at the facility and response by the emergency response team were considered as active controls, which would reduce the ammonia release duration from the cracked flex hose.  No passive mitigation systems were considered for the alternative release scenario analysis.  The ammonia vapor release rate was estimated at 2.6 lbs./min.  Since the ammonia vapor released from the cracked flex hose would be neutrally buoyant, ALOHA's neutrally buoyant model was used for the dispersion analysis.  The meteorological conditions used for the dispersion modeling were Stability Class D, wind speed of 3.0 meter per second, annual average temperature of 62 deg F, and average relative humidity of 65%. The results of the dispersion modeling analysis indicated that the alternative release scenario has offsite impacts.\n\nFinally, no ammonia releases that could have caused safety or health hazard (no deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place) occurred at the OLS Energy-Chino Cogeneration Facility during the last five years.

The Cogeneration Facility holds contractor safety briefings before allowing them near or in the process area, controls access to the process areas, and evaluates the contractor's performance.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review and Mechanical Integrity Program\n\nThe Cogeneration Facility ensures that a pre-startup safety review is completed for any new covered-by-the-rules process, or for significant modifications to an existing covered process that requires a change in the process safety information.  The Cogeneration Facility maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment.  The Cogeneration Facility mechanical integrity program includes the following:\n\n7 Written procedures for maintaining mechanical integrity through inspection and testing of process equipment, based on instructions of equipment vendors, industry codes, and prior operating experience.\n7 Implementation of the written procedures by performing inspections and tests on process equipment at specified intervals.\n7 Training of maintenance personnel in procedures for safe work practices such as lockout/tagout, line or equipment opening, and avoidance and correction of unsafe conditions.\nThe Cogeneration Facility uses a software program that assures inspection, testing, and maintenance of ammonia equipment is performed in accordance with industry practice.\n\nHot Work Permits and Management of Change \n\nThe Cogeneration Facility requires employees and contractors to employ safe work practices when performing \"hot work\" in, on, or around the covered process.

      "SummaryText": "he Cogeneration Facility uses a permit program to ensure hot work is conducted safely on or near a process involving ammonia.\nThe Cogeneration Facility provides a system and approach to maintain and implement any management of change or modifications to equipment, procedures, chemicals, and processing conditions.  This system allows Cogeneration Facility staff to identify and review safety hazards or provide additional safety, process, or chemical information to existing data before the proposed change would either compromise system safety or need training to be completed.\n\nInternal Compliance Audits\n\nInternal compliance audits will be conducted every 3 years to verify compliance with the programs and procedures contained in the RMP.  The Cogeneration Facility will assemble an audit team that will include personnel knowledgeable in the Risk Management Program rule and in the process.  This team will evaluate whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the Risk Management Program rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process.  The results of the audit will be documented, recommendations resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program will be implemented.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Cogeneration Facility investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release (serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment) so that similar accidents can be prevented.  An investigation team is assembled and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.  Information found during the investigation is reviewed by affected staff and added or used to revise operating and maintenance procedures.\n\nFive-year Accident History Summary\n\nNo ammonia releases that could have caused safety or health hazard (no deaths, i"

Instead, the facility has coordinated with local response agencies to respond to any ammonia release that may occur at the facility.  As part of the emergency response program, the Cogeneration Facility has developed and implemented an Emergency Action Plan for the purpose of protecting employee health and the environment. \n\nThe facility Emergency Action Plan has been coordinated (reviewed) with the Chino Valley Fire Department.  This agency is a member of the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and was involved with the development of a community emergency action plan.  The main elements of the Emergency Action Plan are: (1) organizational structure (chain-of-command), responsibilities of various personnel at the Cogeneration Facility, and the personnel who can provide additional information regarding the contents of the Emergency Action Plan, (2) procedures for reporting fire or other emergencies, including procedures for notifying the public and local emergency response agencies of a release, (3) emergency escape procedures and emergency escape routes assignments, including emergency evacuation procedures, routes, and safe assembly points, (4) procedures to be followed by employees who remain to operate critical plant operations before they evacuate, (5) documentation of proper first aid and emergency medical treatment necessary to treat accidental human exposures and the detailed information on emergency health care, and (6) a description of the facility alarm systems and meaning of individual alarm signals, including the evacuation alarm. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nA number of changes to improve safety (recommended actions"

This PHA was further reviewed in April 1999 under the RMP and CalARP program requirements.  Based on this PHA review, three additional recommendations were made to improve the safety of the ammonia process.  It is expected that the recommended actions will be evaluated and implemented by July 1999.  The implementation of these recommendations will further improve the safety of the ammonia system."
