      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nBackground\n\n\n\nThe Central Water Treatment Plant (CWTP) is owned and operated by the City of Riviera Beach and serves a total population of approximately 38,000 people. The facility utilizes 27 wells located throughout the City to obtain raw ground water from the surfical aquifer. The raw water is conveyed through a 5.8-mile network of 6 to 30-inch diameter water mains to the WTP where the water is processed for domestic use. As part of the process, chlorine gas is used as a disinfectant against pathogens found in the raw water. The Clean Air Act Section 112 ( r ), lists chlorine as a regulated toxic substance. Facilities that store amounts of a regulated substance greater than their respective threshold listed in Table 1 of 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 68.130, must comply with the provisions of 40 CFR part 68- the Risk Management Program (RMP). The CWTP has a maximum inventory of 16,000-lbs of chlorine gas which surpasses the 2,500-lb threshold for chlorine.  For this reason, The CWTP must meet the terms set forth in the RMP.\n\n\n\nHazard Assessment\n\n\n\nAs part of the RMP, an offsite consequence analysis (OCA) was conducted to determine the potential area effected by a worst-case and alternate release-case scenario and disclose the offsite public and environmental receptors affected by these scenarios.  \n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario was modeled using the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Table 4-3 and considered a 1-ton chlorine cylinder releasing its full contents in ten minutes. This accident could result from a cylinder wall failure or puncture.  It was determined that this scenario would have an impact on offsite public receptors located within a 1.3-mile radius from the CWTP.\n\n\n\nThe alternate release scenario considers a 3/8-inch OD flexible metal tubing connecting the 1-ton cylinders to the gas header failing. Using the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Exhibit 4-15, the release rate for a 1/4-inch hole is 9-lb/min. It was determined that thi"

      "SummaryText": "s scenario would have an impact on offsite public receptors located within a 0.1-mile radius from the CWTP.\n\n\n\nNo environmental receptors were identified for either scenario.\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nIn effort to discourage scenarios similar to the ones listed above from occurring, the CWTP has up-to-date technological equipment, is implementing standardized procedural practices, and is incorporating chlorine training and awareness programs.\n\n\n\nThe plant uses vacuum regulators to eliminate leaks or breaks associated with pressure-systems.  Warning devices such as chlorine gas detectors and a chlorine residual analyzer are used to detect chlorine leaks. These two systems are interfaced with the central control panel located in the control room. The facility is staffed 24-hours per day, 7 days per week. \n\n\n\nPlant procedural practices are safety oriented and include procedures for operating, inspecting, changing and maintaining chlorine process equipment. A training program is provided to familiarize city employees with the chlorine process and safety equipment.  Other programs are implemented to ensure information on chlorine and its hazards are available to the plant employees and contractors.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe CWTP has had no chlorine releases within the last 5-years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response\n\n\n\nThe City of Riviera Beach Utilities will not be responding directly to non-incidental releases of chlorine gas. The local emergency responder for the City of Riviera Beach CWTP will be the City of Riviera Beach Fire Department."
