This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility\u00bfs primary activities encompass custom chemical manufacturing.  We have 3 regulated substances present at our facility: Hydrochloric acid [Hydrogen chloride], Vinyl acetate monomer [Acetic acid ethenyl ester], and Vinyl methyl ether [Ethene, methoxy-].  \n\nHydrochloric acid [Hydrogen chloride] is used primarily for adjusting the pH of a portion of our wastewater effluent, and in small quantities for pH adjustment of some products.  Vinyl acetate monomer [Acetic acid ethenyl ester] is used in the production of vinyl acetate polymers and copolymers.  Vinyl methyl ether [Ethene, methoxy-] is used in the production of vinyl methyl ether copolymers.  \n\nThe maximum inventory of Hydrochloric acid [Hydrogen chloride] at our facility is 107,400 pounds.  Vinyl acetate monomer  [Acetic acid ethenyl ester], and Vinyl methyl ether  [Ethene, methoxy-] are present at our facility in quantities of 85,521 pounds, and 42,000 pounds, respectively.  \n\nIn previous RMP submittals, it was reported that our facility stored two additional chemicals, methyl chloride and isobutylene [2-methylpropene], in quantities greater than the listed threshold quantities.  Changes in our production processes have resulted in the discontinued use of these chemicals and we no longer store them in quantities above their respective threshold quant"

The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a release of a storage tank.  In this scenario 3,447 pounds of Vinyl acetate monomer [Acetic acid ethenyl ester] is released.  The Vinyl acetate monomer is released as a vapor cloud over a period of 10 minutes.   At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance of 0.85 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.26 mg/L.\n\nOne alternate release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances involves a release of Vinyl acetate monomer [Acetic acid ethenyl ester].  In this scenario, 3,447 pounds of Vinyl acetate is released through a rupture disk as the result of over pressurization of a reactor. The vinyl acetate is released as a vapor cloud over a period of 10 minutes.   Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.26 mg/L of Vinyl acetate monomer [Acetic acid ethenyl ester] is 0.34 miles.\n\nThe alternate release scenario for Hydrochloric acid (37% solution) involves a release of potentially 1,081 pounds of Hydrochloric acid from a transfer line.  The Hydrochloric acid is assumed to be released to form a pool and evaporated.  A release rate was calculated to be 3.94 lb/minute, for 10 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.030 mg/L of Hydrochloric Acid is less than 0.1 miles.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances as a class involves a release of a tank truck.  In this scenario 35,000 pounds of V"

At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance of 0.25 miles is obtained corresponding to a flammable endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.\n\nOne alternate release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances involves a release of Vinyl methyl ether [Ethene, methoxy-] from a reactor. In this scenario, 22,505 pounds of Vinyl methyl ether [Ethene, methoxy-] is released through a rupture disc as the result of over pressurization of a reactor.  The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Fire. Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of Lower flammability limit is less than 0.1 miles.\n\n4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nDanChem Technologies, Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses include HAZOPs, What Ifs, and Checklists.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 12/6/2007.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities w"

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nDanChem Technologies, Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nDanChem Technologies, Inc. carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner. The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on 11/16/2007.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at DanChem Technologies, Inc. to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.

The most recent compliance audit was conducted on 10/7/2005.  Only one recommendation was identified for an RMP regulated chemical (Vinyl methyl ether [Ethene, methoxy-]).  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nDanChem Technologies, Inc. promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nDanChem Technologies, Inc. truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility\u00bfs implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.
