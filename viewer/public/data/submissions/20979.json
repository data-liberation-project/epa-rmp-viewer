      "SummaryText": "LignoTech USA, Inc. manufactures lignosulfonate specialty chemicals by using the non-toxic  solutions known as spent sulfite liquors and other regulated and non-regulated substances. Formaldehyde, a regulated substance, is used at our facility as a raw material.  We have been manufacturing lignosulfonate specialty chemicals for over seventy years while continuously striving to protect the environment, the employees and the community from the hazards associated with these regulated substances. We have excellent accident release prevention program for formaldehyde. The program is strictly enforced at our facility. An extensive Process Hazard Analysis has been performed for formaldehyde and the hazards identified have been corrected. A worst-case scenario for formaldehyde has been determined to be a rupture of the storage tank containing a maximum amount of 7650 gallons. Due to our exceptional passive mitigation systems, less than one pound of formaldehyde will be released to the atmosphere in 10 minutes. The distance to endpoint with wind speeds of 3.4 mile per hour is 0.1 miles. In the past five years, we have had no release of formaldehyde from the storage tank or distribution system. Our Emergency Response Program has been prepared according to the requirements of the Emergency Preparedness and Community Right-To-Know Act. Copies of the program have been submitted to the Local Emergency Planning Committee of Marathon County and the Rothschild Fire Department."
