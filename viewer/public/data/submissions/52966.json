The Risk Management Program at the Clinton Complex helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner.  This program is only one component of the safety program at the plant. It is the policy of Equistar to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations, and to act responsibly in the prevention of accidental releases of highly hazardous chemicals.  The plant has a comprehensive safety program in place, establishing many levels of safeguards against a release of a hazardous substance as well as injuries and damage from a release of a hazardous substance.  \n\n \n\nAn Equistar Chemical, L.P. Risk Management Plan has been created to provide a management system for implementing the Rule at covered corporate sites. \n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program for this site is the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, which has been implemented and is in effect. Auxiliary programs such as Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures and Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan are in place and effective.  The Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures procedure establishes the proper course of action in the event of the discharge of a hazardous substance or oil.  Additionally, preventive measures and precautions pertaining to specific hazardous substances handled and stored at Equistar are described.\n\n\n\n The Equistar Clinton Complex consists of the following processes that are covered by this Rule:  High Density and Low Density Polyethylene production, and Ethylene production areas.  The Clinton plant?s key products are ethylene, low density polyethylene, and high density polyethylene.  The Clinton plant uses feedstocks of ethane and propane.  The toxic substances handled in the covered areas are as follows: Vi"

The flammable substances handled in the covered areas are as follows: 1,3-Butadiene, Butane, 1-Butene, 2-Butene, Ethylene, Hydrogen, Isobutane, 2-Methylpropene, Propane, and Propylene.\n\n\n\nThe chemical-specific precaution steps for this facility primarily concentrate on the class of chemicals known as flammables.  Measures to prevent the release of flammables are centered on complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements.  Using the standards of OSHA PSM and American Petroleum Institute (API), flammables handlers have designed their equipment and procedures to minimize the risk of a release.  General preventive measures that are strictly followed to minimize the risk of releases are described below.\n\n\n\n?    A complete, in-depth process hazard analysis is completed every five years by qualified personnel as specified by OSHA's PSM standard.\n\n\n\n?    Operating procedures are used for directing and training the operators who are requalified every three years.\n\n\n\n?    Operators, maintenance, and contractor personnel working with or close to related equipment are trained and qualified to handle it safely.\n\n\n\n?    All mechanical work plans are reviewed using critical-service work permits to assure the work is done properly.\n\n\n\n?    All critical equipment is set up on a periodic inspection plan to assure proper operating condition.\n\n\n\n?    Pre-startup reviews are held prior to starting new or modified equipment to insure that all conditions are satisfied for a safe operation\n\n\n\n?    Engineers, operators and maintenance complete a safety checklist prior to making a change in equipment or significant operating condition.\n\n\n\n?    Routine audits are conducted to assure safe practices are followed.\n\n\n\n?    All incidents are investigated and actions are taken to prevent recurrence. \n\n\n\n?

Flammable unloading station can be isolated from other operations to reduce exposure to any fires or other accidents.\n\n\n\n?    Water deluge systems can be used to displace flammable gas vapors if a leak should occur.  Also water deluge systems are used to cool vessels and pipelines during a fire situation.\n\n\n\n?    Critical processes can be computer controlled to ensure continuous monitoring of all operating parameters and immediate shutdown of the production units.\n\n\n\n?    Flammable gases are stored under two types of conditions.  One is under high pressure at ambient temperature and the other is low-pressure low temperature.  High-pressure tanks use refrigeration constructed with over one inch thick steel walls.  The low-pressure tanks use refrigeration to store the product.  Both tanks are 100% inspected by X-ray before going into service.  All tanks both high and low are on timetables to come out of service and fully re-inspected.\n\n\n\n?    Flammable gas sensors are located strategically in the plant to provide advance warning of even low levels of flammable gases in the air.\n\n\n\n?    Emergency systems are designed to quickly control leaks in tanks and pipelines.\n\n\n\n?    Safety relief valves are installed on tanks and pipelines to protect them from over pressure.\n\n\n\n?    Flares are used, in a first line defense, to burn off excess product in a high-pressure situation before the relief valves vent the product to the air, except in cases where the extremely cold temperature generated would produce metallurgic changes threatening structural integrity.\n\n\n\nThe Clinton Complex has an excellent record of accident prevention over the last 5 years.  We investigate every incident carefully to determine ways to prevent similar incidents from occurring.  The past five years have not included any significant accidents on or off site for the Clinton Complex.\n\n"

      "SummaryText": "\n\nA central corporate emergency response program policy exists with attachments as necessary to address the needs of the particular site.  This policy generally conforms to the elements of the Emergency Response Procedure.  The Clinton Plant has an emergency response team on each shift, available 24 hours per day, to respond and initiate response actions to contain, control, and if possible mitigate the release.  This team has access to on-site emergency equipment, which are appropriate for the anticipated emergency situations and capabilities of Equistar personnel.  Quarterly drills are conducted within the plant to assess and evaluate the emergency response effort at the Clinton Plant.  This could include accountability drills with personnel, evacuation drills, tabletop drills, or drills for the emergency crew only.  Annual drills are done in which outside agencies such as the Clinton Fire Dept. participate as well.  If assistance is required during an emergency response, Mutual Aid could be activated and requested to provide additional resources as necessary.  The Clinton Plant emergency response procedure has been communicated to the Local Emergency Planning Commission, Fire Department and Law Enforcement.\n\n\n\nThe Clinton plant performed off-site consequence analysis to estimate the potential for accidental release of a regulated substance that may affect the public or the environment.  The worst and alternate case release scenarios for this plant are listed below. \n\n\n\nLiquid spill and vaporization of 389,800 pounds of Vinyl Acetate Monomer from the two connected storage tanks associated with this plant. The distance to the toxic endpoint of this spill would be 4.5 miles. Rural conditions with an atmosphere of class F stability and a wind speed of 1.5 m/s were used to estimate the endpoint.  Using ?LandViewIII? software it is estimated that 9600 people could be within the 4.5 mile radius. Passive mitigation efforts include an earth dike surrounding the tanks.  Th"

      "SummaryText": "e Upper Mississippi River Wildlife and Fish Refuge is the sensitive environmental receptor within this radius. An alternative release case for this tank uses an atmosphere of class D stability and a wind speed of 3.0 m/s.  This would result in a toxic endpoint of 0.7 miles.\n\n\n\nAn alternate release scenario of 2000 pounds of Chlorine gas is assumed to occur over a ten minute period. Rural conditions with an atmosphere of class F stability and a wind speed of 1.5 m/s were used to estimate the endpoint. The distance to the toxic endpoint of this release would be 3 miles.\n\n\n\nInstantaneous and total release of 19,686,000 pounds of Ethylene from the largest storage tank associated with this plant.  The material is assumed to immediately vaporize upon release.  A vapor cloud explosion would also occur immediately upon release of the material.  The model used to predict the result is the TNT-equivalency method.  The 1 psi overpressure radius would extend 2.2 miles.  This release scenario would represent the greatest flammable substance worst-case release scenario held above the threshold quantity.   It is predicted using \"LandViewIII\" software that approximately 1,600 people could be within the 2.2 mile radius.  The Upper Mississippi River Wildlife and Fish Refuge is the sensitive environmental receptor within this radius.  Passive mitigation efforts include an earth dike surrounding the ethylene storage tank.  An alternate case release was calculated using a yield factor of 0.03 instead of 0.1.  This leads to a 1 psi overpressure radius of 1.5 miles.\n\n\n\nThe following are some of the process changes that are planned to improve safety at the Equistar Chemicals Clinton site:\n\n\n\n?    Upgrade secondary containment around pyrolysis gasoline storage tank.\n\n?
