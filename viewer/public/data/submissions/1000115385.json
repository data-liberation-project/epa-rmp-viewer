      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe owners, management, and employees of CALAMCO, Port of Stockton Terminal facility (herein referred to as the Facility) at 2323 Port Road G, Stockton, California, 95203 are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of hazardous materials. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. The Facility has a detailed emergency action plan (EAP) that will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nThe primary activities at the Facility are the receipt, storage, and shipment of anhydrous ammonia, and blending, storage, and shipment of ammonium hydroxide.\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application to the soil and for blending into mixed grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients. In addition, anhydrous ammonia is shipped for use in the refrigeration and power generation industries.\nAnhydrous ammonia is received via ocean-going ship and is initially stored in two above ground atmospheric storage tanks. The vaporization from these tanks is managed through on-site heat exchange which results in fertilizer grade (F-Grade) and/or refrigerant grade (R-Grade) ammonia.\nFour aboveground pressurized vessels store the R-Grade anhydrous ammonia, and three additional aboveground pressurized vessels store F-Grade anhydrous ammonia. Other pressurized vessels are utilized to manage tank vaporization. The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored in tanks, vessels, associated equipment, and piping is approximately 82,000,000 pounds.\nAmmonium hydroxide, or aqua ammonia, is blended on-site from the stored anhydrous ammonia and stored in one above ground atmospheric storage tank.\nThe maximum quantity of ammonia stored within solution for the"

Specifically, the industry neighbor, DTE, reportedly decided to shelter in place, which the Facility was only made aware of through correspondence received approximately five weeks after resolution of the incident. The details of the incident are reported within the RMP submittal data. CALAMCO is unaware of the approximate number of people that sheltered in place at DTE, but estimates that five people sheltered in place based on CALAMCO\u0092s understanding of the number of people that would normally be on shift at 6:00 a.m. on a Saturday.\n\nThe Emergency Response Program\nThe Facility\u0092s EAP consists of procedures for addressing releases of hazardous substances and was writt"

Section 25503, Division 6.95 of the California Health and Safety Code; and\n4. 33 CFR Part 127.\nThe Facility is a non-responding source, meaning it relies on local emergency responders in the event of an accidental release. The EAP is coordinated with the Port of Stockton, the local fire department, and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nOngoing programs, such as process hazard analysis reevaluations, mechanical integrity program, and operating procedures continually aim to improve process safety. The following is a non-exhaustive list of specific improvements that are planned to be implemented at the Facility to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\n1.\tContinuous improvement to automated shutdowns for process equipment;\n2.\tInstallation of additional gas detectors; and\n3.\tUpgrades to occupied buildings."
