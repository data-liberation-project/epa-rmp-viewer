In order to meet Carpenter Co.'s goals all management and hourly employees are held responsible for our Safety and Health Program.  To empower our people communicating policies and procedures along with training are two important elements of our program.  Auditing, investigating incidents and taking corrective measures to prevent future mishaps are the tools used to maintain our programs.  Our Chairman of the Board and CEO has set the standard for Carpenter Co. in the corporate safety and health policy which he signed.   \n\n                                                                                                                                                         THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES                                                      \n\n\n\nTo control accidental releases our company has a PM system in place to check all equipment that could cause a release or other problems.  These PMs are monitored annually by our corporate Engineering Department.  In addition to the monitoring of the PM's, Corporate annually have the Health, Safety and Environmental departments conduct audits.  These audits are in addition to departmental monthly audits.\n\n                                                                                                                           \n\n Prior to start-up a pre-start check of equipment is conducted by the employees and during a pour the computer system monitors chemical flow and if a flow problem is detected the system shuts down.  In addition to the hardware monitoring the pouring team monitors the process closely and if a problem arises then they can take the appropriate action to prevent a release.  When a railcar or tanker is being unloaded it is being monitored by the Chemical Unloader and Pouring Clerk via TV the computerized pumping system monitors "
