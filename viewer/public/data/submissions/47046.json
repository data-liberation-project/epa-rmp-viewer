Unforeseeable, if such a release does occur, our highly trained employees are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with the St. Charles Fire Department, who provides our emergency response services.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nWe have one regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is Ammonia (anhydrous).  The maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) that is expected to be present in this facility, based on process/operational requirements, is 11,729 pounds.\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario:\n\nTo perform the required off-site consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the RMP Comp program provided by the EPA.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nToxic Worst Case Analysis:\n\nThe Worst Case scenario involves a catastrophic release of all of the anhydrous ammonia from the SYSCO Food Service of St. Louis, LLC Ammonia (anhydrous) refrigeration system.  The scenario involves the release of 11,729 lb. of Ammonia (anhydrous) in a gaseous form, over 10 minutes.  The release rate (lbs/min) is calculated to be 1,172, and a distance to endpoint of 1.6 miles is obtained which effects a residential population of  6,080 persons within this distance.\n\nToxic Alternat"
