Lee Water Reclamation Facility (DBLWRF) for the City of Melbourne, Florida (the City).\n1.1 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES     (A)\nThe City DBLWRF accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures and management practices.  Our prevention program complies with all applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) 40 CFR 68.\n1.1.1 MANAGEMENT SYSTEM  (a)(1)\nThe City has a management system in place that oversees the implementation and on-going use of the RMP elements.  This program, along with other City policies, eliminates and/or reduces the likelihood of a hazardous chemical release at the plant.\n1.1. 2PREVENTION PROGRAM LEVEL 3  (a)(2)\nThe City maintains policies, procedures and systems as part of their prevention program.  The program addresses each of the EPA Program Level 3-listed 12 elements, and the elements needed to implement the RMP program, and the similar elements in place in the plants' OSHA PSM program. These are maintained in the City's Document Control System (DCS).\n1.2 THE CITY OF MELBOURNE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLING AT THE GSWRF SITE  (B)\nThe City employs 10 full-time employees, both at the facility and in field operations.  Chlorine is used as part of the water reclamation and wastewater treatment process.\n1.2.1 SITE DESCRIPTION  (b)(1)\nThe facility has covered chlorine storage.  The chlorine distribution system is contained in a process building.  The boundaries of the chlorine system subject to the RMP regulation include the bulk chlorine storage and control building, and the associated vent and exhaust systems.\n1.2.2 REGULATED SUBSTANCE  (b)(2)\nChlorine is the only regulated substance on site that exceeds the EPA 40 CFR 68 threshold quantity. \n1.3 WORST AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS (C)\nThe"

      "SummaryText": " worst and alternative case scenarios were evaluated using EPA guidance.  \n1.3.1. WORST CASE   (c)(1)\nThe worst-case release scenario involves the total release of a one-ton container to the atmosphere.\n1.3.2. ALTERNATIVE CASE   (c)(2)\nThe alternative-case release scenario involves the failure of the yoke assembly regulator piping.  The yoke assembly is the vacuum control system, which is connected to the one-ton container outlet valve. \n1.4 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM  (D)\nThe City's accidental release prevention program is based on OSHA's PSM program and EPA's RMP Level 3 prevention program.  The PSM program has been in place, and effectively used, for several years.  It is part of the plant standard operating procedure for the facility.  There are two parts to the program.  The first is the general, overall site program.  The second is the chlorine-specific action within the site program.  These programs are coordinated with the City's Fire Department.\n1.4.1. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM   (d)(1)\nFacility-wide, many elements of the prevention program are used for all operations.\n1.4.2. CHLORINE-SPECIFIC RESPONSE PROGRAM  (d)(2)\n1.4.2.1 Chlorine-Specific Policies and Procedures\nChemical-specific prevention features, at the facility, include specific procedures for the operation of the chlorine system.\n                  1.4.2.2. Facility Design\nThe chlorine storage area and the chlorine building are equipped with ambient ventilation and a fan ventilated control room.  \n            1.4.2.3.Equipment Design\nThere are two pipe systems, high and low pressure. \n1.5 FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY  (E)\nThe City's DBLWRF had no accidental releases of chlorine in the past five years, per EPA 40 CFR 67.42 (a). \n1.6 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM  (F)\nEmergency response procedures are contained in the City's Emergency Response Plan (ERP). \nThe ERP is coordinated with the Melbourne Fire Department, who in turn coordinates with the Local Emergency Planning Co"

The recommended actions have now been evaluated and will be implemented as required \nThe City continually reviews implemented and potential safety improvements for all of its operations.  Currently, the City of Melbourne management and process safety teams are reviewing potential upgrades to the design of the chlorine system, in order to increase safety."
