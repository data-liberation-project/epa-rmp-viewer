These procedures address various modes of operations, are regularly reviewed, and readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.  \n\n\n\nThe facility has a system of controls in place to prevent the catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These systems include process controls, mitigation systems, and monitoring/detection systems.  \n\n\n\nAmerican Craft Brewery, LLC also has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  The training program consists of both classroom and on the job training.  \n\n\n\nThe facility carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to insure proper operation.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nAmerican Craft Brewery, LLC has also implemented a compliance audit program to determine whether the provisions set out under the PSM standard and RMP rule are being implemented.  Corrective actions resulting from these audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n\n\nThe facility investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident, as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  \n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe ammonia system has not had an accident in the past sixteen years resulting in any of the 40 CFR 68.10(b)(1) listed consequences (death, injury, environmental restoration).  \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nIt is American Craft Brewery, LLC's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.
