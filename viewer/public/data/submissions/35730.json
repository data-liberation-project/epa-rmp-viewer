      "SummaryText": "The East Norriton-Plymouth-Whitpain Joint Sewer Authority owns and operates a 8.1 million gallon wastewater treatment plant, that is located in Plymouth Township.  In the operation the plant utilizes gaseous chlorine in two of the many treatment processes:  (1) control of activated sludge biological mass, and (2) disinfection of the effluent before it is returned to the receiving stream.  Two one-ton chlorine containers are held in the storage room with an outside storage area sufficient for up to five more containers..\n\nAs a result, accidental release prevention and emergency response policies have been instituted that include:  operation and maintenance procedures, training and incident investigation programs for handling chlorine; notification of key plant personnel during an emergency; immediately available SCBA and protective equipment to be used by trained personnel; an on-site emergency response plan and procedures for notification of local emergency planning individuals in the event of local emergency response is needed.\n\nThe worst-case scenario as described in this program is the release of the entire contents of a 1-ton liquid chlorine container in ten minutes, or 200 lb/min.  The chlorine containers in use are enclosed in a building, therefore the release rate has been reduced to 110 lb/min for the worst-case scenario, a wind speed of 1.5 meters/second and atmospheric stability class F was used.  Using a combination of local data and an approved modeling program, the distance to the Toxic Endpoint Limit (TEL) for a worst-case release was determined.  This distance, assuming the containers are enclosed in a building, is 1.87 miles.\n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario as described in this Program was based on a chlorine container isolation valve stem failure.  A release rate of 420 lb/day, a wind speed of 4.2 m/sec and atmospheric stability Class D was used.  This data, when modeled, produced no off-site impacts (TEL of 11.67 meters).\n\nThe dispersion modeling"

      "SummaryText": " for both scenarios was conducted using the SLABView Program, v2.0 by Lakes Environmental as well as site specific information.\n\nThe chlorine-specific accidental release prevention program in place at the facility provides written procedures that incorporate operational and maintenance data and training procedures for dependable use of relief valves, leak detection systems, automatic shut-off systems and alarms.  Mitigation systems in use include complete enclosure of the chlorine supply and chlorination system, an automatic container shut-off device and a chlorine scrubber system.\n\nNo incidents or accidents have occurred over the past 5 years.  Existing procedures will be maintained for identifying and recording future accidents or incidents.\n\nAn On-Site Emergency Response Program, including an evacuation plan, assembly areas and other safety information has been developed.  This Program has been coordinated with the SARA III Of-Site Response Plan, that has been included with the Program and will supersede the on-site response program in the event that an accidental release extends beyond the facility's boundaries.\n\nThe Authority will update the program as required and will review the Program every five years or when applicable on-site conditions change."
