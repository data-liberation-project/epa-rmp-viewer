      "SummaryText": "1\tEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThe Bodega Bay Public Utility District (District) has prepared a Chemical Risk Management Program (RMP) for the South Shore Wastewater Treatment Facilities (WWTP) in general accordance with State regulations. These regulations, called the California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP), are codified in the California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19, Section 5050.1, etc. CalARP regulations require the preparation of a Chemical Risk Management Plan (RMP) for industrial facilities involving regulated toxic and flammable chemicals at, or above, specified threshold quantities.\nChlorine gas is a regulated toxic chemical in use as the disinfecting agent for the disinfection of treated effluent at the WWTP. Because the quantity of chlorine gas stored at the WWTP exceeds the federal and state regulatory thresholds, the District is subject to CalARP regulations and the preparation of this RMP.\n1.1\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nIn 2009, the District implemented a California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program for the storage and handling of chlorine at the WWTP to meet the requirements of the California Health and Safety Code, Chapter 6.95, Article 2, Sections 25531 through 25543.3, Title 19 of the CCR. CalARP is California\u0092s version of the federal Risk Management Plan (RMP) program required under regulations of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA, Title 40, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68).\nThe 2014 CalARP was updated from the original CalARP report submitted in 2009. This update included a hazard assessment of the potential hazards associated with chlorine and a Program Level 3 prevention program. Emergency response procedures were, and still are described in the attached document Policy and Procedure Plan for Cleanup and Abatement of Accidental Discharges.  \nIn 2014, AMEC Environment & Infrastructure, Inc. (AMEC), and the District conducted an Off-site Consequences Analysis (OCA) of"

In addition, an alternative release scenario was evaluated using parameters described in 19 CCR 2750.4 and 40 CFR Part 68.28. \nThe 2020 RMP Update included only minor updates to various program elements as the majority of the information from the 2014 RMP remained appropriate, representative and suitable. The population estimates and development patterns used in the 2014 OCA study were not changed in 2020, as Bodega Bay had changed little in the convening five years and the data was still representative of current conditions.  \nFor 2024, the RMP has been revised in accordance with the 5-year update requirement. A new Process Hazard Assessment (PHA) and Compliance Audit were completed and all other program elements were reviewed and updated as needed.\n1.2\tStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nThe District\u0092s WWTP is located in the community of Bodega Bay, in Sonoma County, California. The District uses a regulated toxic chemical, chlorine gas, as a disinfectant in its wastewater treatment processes. Chlorine gas (CAS No. 7782-50-5) is stored as a liquid under pressure in 1-ton steel cylinders. The chlorine is stored with a maximum of two cylinders onsite. \nThe District uses a vacuum chlorination system. Chlorine gas is removed from the cylinder using a vacuum regulator and meter. The gas is distributed via a vacuum feed system using water driven ejectors that pull the gas into a chlorine solution. This chlorine solution is applied to tertiary effluent as a disinfectant. The amount of chlorine used per day ranges from 40 pounds per day to a daily maximum of 76 pounds per day.\nThe quantity of chlorine stored at the WWTP exceeds the federal and state regulatory threshold quantities of 2,500 pounds and 100 pounds, respectively (19 California Code of Regulations [CCR] Chapter 2). Based on State and Federal regulatory requirements, a Program Level 3 Prevention Progr"

      "SummaryText": "am has been prepared.\n1.3\tGeneral Accidental Release Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe CalARP regulations require a review of the accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps used by the District. The Prevention Program elements include: Safety Information, Hazard Review, Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Compliance Audits, and Incident Investigation Programs.\nPhysical safety features at the WWTP include the following:\n\u0095\tChlorination room emergency ventilation system, and\n\u0095\tChlorine leak detection in chlorination room area.\nThe facility and chlorination system is checked daily. Leak detection units are checked, calibrated, and maintained on a regular basis by operator staff.\nAdministrative safety features at the WWTP include:\n\u0095\tFormal training programs for system operators,\n\u0095\tEmergency training,\n\u0095\tMaintenance program, and an\n\u0095\tAuditing and inspection program.\nWritten standard operating procedures (SOP) are in place for the regulated chlorine processes at the WWTP. The SOPs provide a basis for operator training and a ready reference for operating and trouble-shooting the system.\nThe District is committed to maintaining the mechanical integrity of the chlorine system. A preventative maintenance system has been developed to manage the maintenance of the system. Preventative maintenance at the District includes inspections, calibration, testing, and overhaul of the chlorine equipment. The maintenance system is used to track equipment performance and to monitor the frequency of repairs and deviations from normal operating parameters.\n1.4\tFive-Year Accident History\nThe District has confirmed that no accidental release of chlorine has occurred at the WWTP in the past five years.\n1.5\tEmergency Response Program\nIn the unlikely event that a chemical release does occur at the WWTP, the District has prepared a Policy and Procedure Plan for Cleanup and Abatement of Accidental Discharges, which is included in Appendix C."

The emergency response action plan procedures have been coordinated with local emergency responders during on-site safety meetings.  An evacuation plan and map are posted at the Plant.\n1.6\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nWith the goal of improving the safety of its chlorine disinfection processes, the District will eliminate the use of chlorine gas at the WWTP by 2026. The District has prepared construction plans for the Chlorine Bleach Conversion Project which will replace the chlorine gas disinfection system with a 12.5% chlorine bleach disinfection system. Construction of the project is anticipated to begin in Spring of 2025 and to be completed by 2026.\nWhile the chlorine gas disinfection system remains active, the District will implement the RMP and will continue the process of evaluating, monitoring, and improving chlorine handling operations at the WWTP. The Hazard Review conducted for 2024 looked more closely at possible release scenarios related to natural hazards as well as the decommissioning process for the gas chlorine system once the chlorine bleach disinfection system is online."
