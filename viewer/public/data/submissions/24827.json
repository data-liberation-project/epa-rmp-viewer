Our management philosophy goals are achieved by the personal commitments of our employees and contractors, and by open communication with our employees, customers, neighbors, and with regulators. The accidental release prevention and emergency response programs we have at our facilities are part of the high standards we strive for at Koch Hydrocarbon.  Our high standards are achieved by operating in compliance with all required environmental permits and regulations, by operating and maintaining our assets in such a manner that any unpermitted release will be unintentional and acknowledged as unacceptable, by remedying any shortcomings found during regular audits of our facilities, and by reporting promptly to regulators any shortcomings found during the course of our audits as required by law.\n\nThe Mont Belvieu Fractionator Facility receives demethanized mix from three pipelines and fractionates this mix into five separate products. These products are ethane, propane, isobutane, normal butane and natural gasoline.  The products are then delivered via pipeline to third party customers.  Ethane, propane, isobutane and normal butane are the flammable substances regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that are present at the Mont Belvieu Facility. At the facility, we have no toxic chemicals above threshold quantity. The facility is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation. The purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about our operation at the facility, our programs to prevent accidents, our emergency response plans in case an accidental release should occur"

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP Regulations, our worst case release scenario for flammables would be the loss of all of the butane in our largest vessel causing a vapor cloud explosion.  In the case of the Mont Belvieu Fractionator Facility, this would involve our 105,000-gallon butane bullet.  Such a scenario is highly unlikely, however, at an overpressure of 1 psi, which is EPA's threshold for measurable impacts from a vapor cloud explosion, public receptors would be affected if this event were to occur.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases (high level alarms, emergency shutdown, etc.) and to manage their consequences, no credit for any controls or mitigation measures was taken into account when evaluating this scenario.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario, characterized as a more likely scenario, is based on a release of butane due to an overfill of a butane bullet.  We have several active mitigation measures in place to greatly reduce the chance that such an event could ever occur.  These active mitigation measures include the following:  1) the level in the vessel is continuously monitored in the control room and inventory is maintained below 50% of capacity;  2) If our customers can not receive product at any time, the product is recirculated back to the process so that the level in the vessel remains manageable;  3) level and pressure alarms are located on all bullets, and:  4) a plant-wide emergency shutdown is available if necessary.  The presence of these active mitigation measures serves to either prevent this scenario from occurring or minimizing its impact if it does occur. \n\nWe have discussed these potential releases with our employees and with local emergency response officials in Chambers County, thereby further reducing the possibility of any impact on "

Our ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of our process, detailed training of our employees, and constant emphasis on safety have helped us avoid any serious accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the additional prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n?We installed continuous pilot ignition and a failure alarm on the flare to ensure uninterrupted combustion of hydrocarbons.\n?We installed heat-activated deluge system in the compressor rooms.\n?We have hydrocarbon detectors in our compressor room to ensure that a release is detected and terminated as soon as possible.\n?We provided employees and contractors with an orientation on personal protective equipment to insure personal safety.\n?A fire water system is in place to ensure quick response to fires.\n?We provided high level alarms on our bullets in order to prevent overfilling.  \n\nThese safeguards as well as the vigilance of our trained employees have helped us operate safely at this facility since we acquired it in 1997.\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nNo incident having resulting in onsite or offsite impacts from a release of an RMP substance has occurred at the Mont Belvieu Facility since we acquired it in 1997.  Although we take pride in that record, we also place daily emphasis on our prevention and safety programs to ensure this record continues.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nAny emergency response necessary for the Mont Belvieu Facility is coordinated with the Mutual Aid of Mont Belvieu Industries (MAMBI), the Mont Belvieu Fire Department, the Chambers County Sheriff and, as appropriate, the San Jacinto Hospital, and the Texas State"

Some of the key components of the safety improvements we expect to achieve are as follows:\n\n?The Management of Change provisions ensure that we consider the potential safety and health impacts of any change we make to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures.\n?The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure continual evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in our safety standards.\n?The Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of our safety program.\n?Internal and third party compliance audits will ensure we maintain and increase our level of safety protection.\n?An ongoing dialogue with the Chambers County Emergency Management Director or his designate will ensure a constant state of readiness to respond to any potential emergencies, as well as a means to implement improvements as the need develops.
