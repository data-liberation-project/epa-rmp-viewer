Airgas policy is to comply with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Airgas has implemented specific chemical prevention steps to help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors. The following are examples of the types of safety features in place: (1) Release Detection - Hydrogen detectors located around covered process equipment to detect and alarm. (2) Release Mitigation - Personal protective equipment; e.g., personal gas detectors, protective outerwear clothing, safety googles, shoes, etc. (3) System Integrity - Automatic control and manual valves that provide isolation for Hydrogen process equipment, check valves on Hydrogen lines and pressure safety valves for the process piping and vessels. (4) Facility and Environment - Contracted emergency response specialists to support the\n\nCalvert City emergency action plan (EAP).",

This is why Airgas has established January as Safety Pledge Month at Airgas. We start the new year - each and every year - to be a time to recommit ourselves to safety by reading, embracing, and signing the Airgas Safety Pledge. The pledge is as follows:\n\n\n\nI WILL:\n\n\n\nDEMONSTRATE my commitment to regard safety as the most important aspect of my job by not allowing unsafe conditions or practices to exist.  WORK toward the attainable goal of zero accidents and zero injuries and hold myself and others accountable in reaching this goal.  STOP a job or refuse to perform a job if it is not safe or cannot be performed safely.  TAKE personal responsibility for creating and maintaining a safe environment.  PERFORM my job with the understanding that working safely is a condition of my employment with Airgas.\n\n\n\nSAFECOR is the branch of Airgas that leads the way for all safety efforts.  SAFECOR stands for Safety, Environmental, Compliance and Risk Management, and its function is to liaise with and keep up to date with regulatory agencies including FDA, DOT, EPA, OSHA, DHS and DEA. SAFECOR interprets the application of legislation to our business and produces procedures, programs, policies, manuals and training programs to comply with that legislation.\n\n\n\nThe PSM program is an integral part in accidental release prevention. Additionally, the site is equipped with three types of hydrogen/flame detectors (Point LEL detectors (catalytic bead), Ultrasonic acoustic detectors, and UV flame detectors) that will alarm when conditions warrant.\n\n\n\nIt is the facility's policy to comply with all federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations.  If an emergency occurs, it is the facility's policy to notify necessary authorities via the established communication channels as required and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\n\n\n\n\nFACILIT"

The hydrogen stream is compressed to approximately 200 to 300 psig and passed through an oil removal system, the moisture and CO2 is removed in dryers.  The stream is cooled to approximately -320 ?F and passed through adsorber beds to remove air contaminants.  The stream then passes through four ortho-para conversion catalyst beds as it is cooled to liquid temperature by liquid nitrogen and a helium turbine refrigeration system.  The liquid hydrogen is stored in specially insulated tanks for distribution by liquid hydrogen trailers.\n\n\n\nb)    Volumes:\n\n\n\nThe Hydrogen plant will produce approximately 1 to 10 Tons Per Day of liquid hydrogen which is stored in the two 50,000 gallons storage tanks.
