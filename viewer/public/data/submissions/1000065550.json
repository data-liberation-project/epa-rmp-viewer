Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\n\n\n\nThe management and employees of Gateway FS, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, ESDA, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2. The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at the facility, which is located at 10357 Riverview Drive, is the blending and storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient. The storage and handling system consists of 2 - 30,000 gallon storage tanks, loading risers, associated plumbing and nurse tanks. Access to the site is restricted to authorized\n\nFacility employees, authorized management and authorized contractors.\n\n\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 495,000 pounds. This includes the amount of anhydrous ammonia that could be stored in nurse tanks.\n\n\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario.\n\n\n\nThis facility has developed a worst-case and alternative release scenario. However, since this is security-sensitive information, it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as required by EPA regulations.\n\n\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\n\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous "

      "SummaryText": "Ammonia\". Compliance with these regulation and on-going training of our employees make up our accidental release prevention program.\n\n\n\n5. Five year accident history.\n\n\n\nThis is a new facility which recently has been made operational. Therefore, there have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility nor to our knowledge have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter-in-place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n6. The emergency response program.\n\n\n\nThis facility has:\n\n-a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n-provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n-in the event of an emergency involving anhydrous ammonia, it is our policy to notify the Red Bud Fire Department and Randolph County ESDA and request that they respond to the emergency. Our emergency action plans have been coordinated with both the fire department and ESDA.\n\n\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no specific recommendations for implementation at this time."
