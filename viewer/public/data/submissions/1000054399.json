FACILITY ACCIDENTAL RELEASE POLICY\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of the Harvey Lyman Company, A Division of The Lyman Group, Inc. (Lyman or TLG), Walnut Grove Facility (Facility) at 14301 Railroad Avenue, Walnut Grove, California 95690 are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia or aqua ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the Facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed Consolidated Emergency Response / Contingency Plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n2.    FACILITY INFORMATION\n\n??    The Facility is a retail agricultural facility whose primary activity is the storage and sale of fertilizers in addition to the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to agricultural operations in the Sacramento Delta Area of Northern California.\n\n??    Anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients. \n\n??    Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck and stored in one 14,323-gallon storage tank (bullet) at the site.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled in this process is 62,580 pounds.\n\n??    Aqua ammonia is received by truck and stored in two 20,500-gallon, above-ground tanks at the site.  The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia handled is \n\n311,600 pounds. \n\n3.    THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario were evaluated for each of the regulated processes.\n\n4.    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Facility has implemented the following prevention program elements.\n\nSafety Information:  Lyman ensures that information concerning covered processes and regulated substances are up-to-date and available for r"

The most recent review of safety information pertaining to the covered processes took place on \n\nNovember 24, 2015.\n\nHazard Review:  A hazard review of the ammonia processes is conducted every five years or as needed by changes in the processes.  The most recent update of the hazard review was conducted on June 16, 2015.  Results indicate that no high risk hazards were identified through the hazard review update.\n\nOperating Procedures:  Written standard operating procedures have been developed for the covered processes and are reviewed and revised as needed.  The operating procedures were last revised in November 2015.  Operating procedures for the Anhydrous Ammonia Process are certified annually, with the last annual certification on April 7, 2015.\n\nTraining:  The Facility staff, as well as TLG corporate staff, understands that incidents involving the accidental release of regulated substances can be reduced by having trained operations and maintenance staff.  A training program, which incorporates specific operating procedures and safe work practices, is an essential element of an effective prevention program.  The current training program is comprised of the following:\n\n??    Initial employee training;\n\n??    Periodic refresher training;\n\n??    Training provided as a result of a new equipment addition or modification;\n\n??    Competency testing involving written tests and observation following training; and\n\n??    Training records for each employee.\n\nMaintenance:  The maintenance program at the Facility is intended to preserve the mechanical integrity of the process equipment to minimize the potential for an accidental release.  The maintenance program includes equipment inspection, preventative maintenance, recordkeeping, and training.  The latest equipment inspection was conducted on \n\nNovember 23, 2015, and the latest review of maintenance procedures was conducted on\n\nNovember 20, 2015.\n\nRMP Change Management:  Operation, safety, and environmental issues "

The Facility RMP Change Management (RMPCM) procedures are used to evaluate all changes to process materials, controls, equipment, and procedures.\n\nPre-startup Review:  The pre-startup review applies to additions or modifications to the Anhydrous Ammonia Process that require the safety information to be revised or updated.  Whenever changes in affected processes are identified or planned, they must be evaluated as to the need for a pre-startup safety review.  This assessment is undertaken in conjunction with the RMPCM review.  Additionally, a pre-startup safety review is performed in conjunction with the RMPCM review when the proposed change requires modifications to the safety information.  \n\nCompliance Audits:  Periodic compliance audits to assess the effectiveness of the written plan must be conducted every three years.  Records of the audits and follow-up documentation are maintained to indicate findings and resolution of findings.  The most recent compliance audit was conducted in March 2013. \n\nIncident Investigation:  Although no incidents involving regulated substances have occurred at the Facility in the last five years, an incident investigation program is in place.  The program includes investigation requirements and reporting and would be implemented in the event of an incident.\n\nEmployee Participation:  The Facility must rely upon the operational expertise and training of its employees at all levels and disciplines to ensure safe operations.  The Facility has implemented procedures regarding employee participation to ensure consideration of their knowledge and experience in all applicable areas of the prevention program.\n\nHot Work Permit:  Hot work does not typically occur on or near the Anhydrous Ammonia Process.
