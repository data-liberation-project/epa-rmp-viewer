Therefore, this RMP is written to meet the EPA Program 3 level of compliance.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICY\n\nThis facility follows a rigorous thirteen volume Process Safety Management Program to prevent the accidental release of ammonia. The PSM program is in compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) of 29 CFR 1910.119.

Although there are doors and windows, the overall enclosure acts as a dike creating liquid pooling and limiting the liquid run-off. Ammonia leak detection is installed in this area that sounds alarms and starts emergency ventilation. The emergency ventilation is automatically controlled and discharges the engine room air through the roof which creates a lower level of concentration in the engine room for responders. It\n\nalso starts air dispersion at lower concentration levels and disperses the ammonia with greater air turbulence."

The only RMP regulated substance at this facility is anhydrous ammonia which is classified is as a toxic substance, liquefied under pressure. The definitions and parameters for the following release scenarios are based on the \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\" as described in Chapter 4: Off-site Consequence Analysis.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario (OCA-1) used in this assessment identifies the medium temperature recirculator (V-3) as the vessel with the potential to hold the largest quantity of ammonia. This is based on the system design that uses this vessel as a pump-down holding receiver. The worst-case release scenario is based on a technician using a man lift to replace a lamp near the recirculator vessel strikes the level column with the lift causing the column to fail releasing the entire vessel charge. 3,850 lbs. could be lost. The\n\nDistance to Toxic Endpoint of 0.8 miles creates a Circle of Concern that includes a residential population of 31,700 people.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario is the direct release of ammonia vapor from the service valve on the high stage compressor. The  of the release is based on the rated capacity of the pressure relief valve (33.0 lbs per min.) with a release duration of 15 minutes. The Distance to Toxic Endpoint of 0.1 miles creates a Circle of Concern that includes a residential population of 0 people.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThis facility follows the OSHA Process Safety Management Program.

Anhydrous ammonia, a substance regulated by EPA, is one of the most economical refrigerants available. However, the properties of ammonia makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions while operating the refrigeration system to prevent employee exposure, and to reduce the threat of exposure to nearby members of the community. The SARSC Frozen Combo chose to follow the EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Rule, Program Level 3, to prevent a release of ammonia from the refrigeration system. The Frozen Combo ammonia refrigeration system at the San Antonio Retail Support Center (SARSC) of H.E. Butt Grocery Company (HEB) has an\n\nestimated total of 25,120 pounds in the refrigeration systems. The SARSC Frozen Combo complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, and applicable state codes\n\nand regulations to prevent a catastrophic release of ammonia. The ammonia refrigeration system has been constructed according to the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration guidelines (IIAR). The operators of the systems are required to complete a training and certification program to operate the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention Program does not guarantee against an accidental release. An offsite consequence analysis was completed using a computer model to simulate a release of the ammonia from the refrigeration system. The worst case scenario considered the loss"

      "SummaryText": " of 10,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in the refrigeration system over a 10 minute period. The analysis showed that the ammonia vapor could travel approximately 1.2 miles. There are approximately 50,700 residents which could be potentially affected in the identified radius. There are other public receptors (schools, hospitals, day cares, nursing\n\nhomes, recreational areas, and industrial/commercial buildings) in the potentially affected area.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario, which is the most likely scenario, considered a release of ammonia from a relief valve failure inside the building. A release of 200 pounds of ammonia over a 15 minute period was considered. The computer model showed that the ammonia vapor could travel approximately 0.1 mile. There are no residents, but other public receptors (industrial/commercial buildings) are located in the potentially affected area. No administrative controls or mitigation measures were used to limit the chemical\n\nrelease distances for either scenario.\n\n\n\nThe SARSC Frozen Combo has an established Emergency Action Plan to respond to emergencies. The plan was developed in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.38 Emergency Action Plan. The plan requires employees to exit the facility during a fire or ammonia release to a safe area. The emergency agencies will be notified of the emergency. The emergency agencies will notify any potentially affected neighbors. Maintenance personnel will be available as a resource during an ammonia release emergency. The plan also addresses natural hazard emergencies, fires, bomb threats, civil disturbances, and utility outages. This location has not experienced an ammonia release in the past 5 years. The SARSC Frozen Combo wanted to evaluate the potential failures of the refrigeration system, and if the safeguards were sufficient to prevent a catastrophic release of ammonia. An updated Process Hazard Analysis was completed on the refrigeration system on September 15, 2008. Planned changes to improve\n"
