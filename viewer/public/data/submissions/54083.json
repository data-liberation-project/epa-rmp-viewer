To accomplish this elements have been organized in a way that is consistent with the corporate organization, how frequently different elements are accessed, and who needs to refer to the program.  The order of elements within this organization is not the same as they are listed in the regulations, and in some cases portions of elements may be found in more than one location.  \n\n1. THE  GIUMARRA VINEYARDS, WINERY, RISK & PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Giumarra Vineyards, Winery has updated their unified Risk & Process Safety Management Program.

The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nOur company has an exemplary safety record, one that we are quite proud of. Our company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.  We have: (1) prepared a unified program based on the PSM plan to meet CalARP obligations as well; (2) reorganized the program so that it meshes more closely with general Giumarra Vineyards, Winery business practices; and (3) reviewed plan documentation forms and responsibilities.

      "SummaryText": "nagement Plan sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees protect themselves and our neighbors.\n\n2. PROCESS DESCRIPTIONS\nThe Giumarra Vineyards, Winery facility is a processing facility for grape juice concentrate products.  The facility has two ammonia processes that provide refrigeration capacity to multiple product chillers, an aqueous ammonia storage tank which is part of a carbon filter regeneration process, and a sulfur-dioxide injection process for grape juice.\n\n3. GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE & CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n3.1 General.\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of any one of the regulated chemicals in annual pre-season safety meetings.  These employees are made aware of the potential risks of the process chemicals involved.  During these meetings we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\nGiumarra Vineyards, Winery has also conducted an off-site impact analysis of worst-case and alternate-case release scenarios for each process.  These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release.  The results of the analysees are reported in the body of the program.\n\n3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia.\nThe ammonia refrigeration systems at the Giumarra Vineyards, Winery facility are an integral part of the overall business and operate most of the year.   The West Winery Process contains a total charge of approximately 9,900 lbs and the East Winery Process contains approximately 5,900 lbs. It is extremely important that these systems are maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner.  Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration processes and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia.  In addition, the processes are checke"

These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity review of our ammonia equipment.\n\n3.3 Aqueous Ammonia.\nThe aqueous ammonia process at the Giumarra Vineyards, Winery facility is an integral part of the grape juice concentrate manufacturing process and operates year round.   The ammonia concentration in the solution is 29.4% and the Storage Tank has a 5,000 gal capacity.  As with the ammonia systems management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an aqueous ammonia leak.\n\nGiumarra Vineyards personnel monitor the aqueous ammonia process and storage tank.  In addition, the tank is checked by the vender supplying the aqueous ammonia.  The vender also assists in performing the annual mechanical integrity review of our aqueous ammonia equipment.\n\n3.4 Sulfur-Dioxide.\nThe sulfur-dioxide injection process at the Giumarra Vineyards, Winery facility is an integral part of the juicing process for grapes.  Injection of the grapes takes place during the initial crush which operates four months out of the year.   The process involves multiple 1 ton containers with a maximum intended inventory of 20,000 lbs.  Two injection points are operated with one container connected at each point.  It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner.  Giumarra Vineyards is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of exposure to sulfur-dioxide.\n\nOur refrigeration personnel also monitor the sulfur-dioxide injection process and keep an active log of all associated procedures and transactions.  In addition, the process is checked frequently during the season by the outside contractor that supplies the SO2 containers.  Snowden also assists in performing the annual mechanical integrity review of our system/process equipment.\n \n4. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nGiumarra "

EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\nThis facility?s emergency response program is based on the Cal/OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (in California CCR Title 8, Section 3220, ?Emergency Action Plans.?  Federally, Title 29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119), HAZWOPER (standard (in California CCR Title 8, Section 5192, ?Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response,? and Title 29 CFR 1910.120). \n\nStrategically, we will respond ?minimally? to a release.  Under this plan we will call emergency personel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Kern County Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team.\n\nEvery year at the beginning of the season we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including an hazardous chemical release. \n\n6. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nOur company has an outstanding safety record, one that we are quite proud of.  Many policies and procedures have been implemented to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.  Nevertheless, Giumarra Vineyards, Winery continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.  The overhaul of this Risk & Process Safety Management Program has been the primary recent improvement, and implementation of the program is our plan for improved safety in the near future.\n\nThe Risk & Process Safety Management Program has been written so that program elements are aligned with Giumarra Vineyards, Winery business practices rather than the order presented in the law.  Thus, Safe Operating Procedures are grouped together for the benefit of our system operator.  Safe Operating Policies are grouped together so that appropriate office staff may administer them.  The Emergency Action Plan is now separated out and distributed widely through the plant for easy reference.  \n\nThe Risk & Process Safety Management Program documentation forms and com"
