Hence, there was no need to conduct a worst-case scenario (WCS) with respect to toxic substances. \n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario = Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nThe WCS associated with a release of flammable materials from Enterprise's Propylene Processing Facility involves the rupture or failure of the Splitter Charge Tank, which contains a mixture of propane and propylene resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.

The tank inventory is assumed to be released, completely vaporized, and ignited resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The simulated end point distance to the 1 psig overpressure would result in off-site impacts.  Although there are numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, credit for passive mitigation was not taken into account when modeling this scenario.  All emergency response and early warning to the employees and the community would be exercised immediately if this were to occur.  All Emergency Response protocols would be in effect.  There would be no offsite environmental impact in this scenario due to the material being consumed on site.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) = Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nThe alternative release scenario is the simulation of a 3/4\" bleed valve sheer from the incoming feed line to the Splitter Charge Tank.  The line contains a liquefied mixture of propane and propylene at approximately 300 psig and 80 F.  For reasons discussed above, the simulation assumed the worst-case concentration of 100% propylene in the feed line.
