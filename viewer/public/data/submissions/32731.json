The tank inventory is assumed to be released, completely vaporized, and ignited resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The simulated end point distance to the 1 psig overpressure would result in off-site impacts.  Although there are numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, credit for passive mitigation was not taken into account when modeling this scenario.  All emergency response and early warning to the employees and the community would be exercised immediately if this were to occur.  All Emergency Response protocols would be in effect.  There would be no offsite environmental impact in this scenario due to the material being consumed on site.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) = Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nThe alternative release scenario is the simulation of a 3/4 bleed valve sheer from the incoming feed line to the Splitter Charge Tank.  The line contains a liquefied mixture of propane and propylene at approximately 300 psig and 80 F.  For reasons discussed above, the simulation assumed the worst-case concentration of 100% propylene in the feed line.  The release is assumed to continue for ten minutes and ignite in a vapor cloud explosion.  This scenario would be mitigated by means of the emergency shutdown system and the activation of the emergency response team.  All emergency response and early warning to the employees and the community would be exercised immediately if this were to occur.

      "SummaryText": ", no toxic substances were identified at Enterprise's Propylene Processing Facility as meeting the criteria or threshold limits of the RMP Rule.  Hence, there was no need to conduct a worst-case scenario (WCS) with respect to toxic substances. \r\n\r\nWorst-Case Release Scenario = Regulated Flammable Chemicals\r\n\r\nThe WCS associated with a release of flammable materials from Enterprise's Propylene Processing Facility involves the rupture or failure of the Splitter Charge Tank, which contains a mixture of propane and propylene resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  Although the concentration of the mixture in the Charge Tank varies, the mixture is predominantly propylene.  Therefore, the simulation assumed the worst-case concentration of 100% propylene inside the Charge Tank.  The tank inventory is assumed to be released, completely vaporized, and ignited resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The simulated end point distance to the 1 psig overpressure would result in off-site impacts.  Although there are numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, credit for passive mitigation was not taken into account when modeling this scenario.  All emergency response and early warning to the employees and the community would be exercised immediately if this were to occur.  All Emergency Response protocols would be in effect.  There would be no offsite environmental impact in this scenario due to the material being consumed on site.\r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) = Regulated Flammable Chemicals\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario is the simulation of a 3/4 bleed valve sheer from the incoming feed line to the Splitter Charge Tank.  The line contains a liquefied mixture of propane and propylene at approximately 300 psig and 80 F.  For reasons discussed above, the simulation assumed the worst-case concentration of 100% propylene in the feed line.  The release is assumed to continue for ten minutes and ignite in a vapor cloud explosion.  This scenari"

All emergency response and early warning to the employees and the community would be exercised immediately if this were to occur.  There would be no offsite environmental impact in this scenario due to the material being consumed on site.\r\n\r\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nWe take a systematic, pro-active approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our Process Safety Management Systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs, including:\r\n\r\n* Process safety information\r\n* Process hazard analysis\r\n* Operating procedures\r\n* Training\r\n* Mechanical integrity\r\n* Management of change\r\n* Pre-Startup Safety Review - PSSR\r\n* Compliance audits\r\n* Incident investigation\r\n* Employee participation\r\n* Hot work permit\r\n* Contractors\r\n\r\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have a multitude of programs in which our employees participate.  We have a training program in which the Operations and Maintenance personnel are specifically trained in the operation of the plant, the operating procedures, maintenance procedures, and specific other regulations and policies, as well as in all areas of emergency response.  We train, use and apply the guidelines of our PSM program, which include all of the above-listed areas.  All of these programs come under scheduled scrutiny and critique.\r\n\r\nWe have an on-going inspection program designed to search out and find deficiencies in the process equipment prior to any incident.\r\n\r\nOperations personnel make regular inspections of the equipment and processes they operate.  If something out of the ordinary is detected, it is reported to management in order to expedientl"
