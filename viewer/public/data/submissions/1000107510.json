The regulated substances, as defined by 40 CFR Part 68, which are present at the facility in more than the threshold quantity are anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\nThe Terre Haute Terminal has taken all the necessary steps to comply with all of the accidental release and chemical-specific prevention requirements as set forth in U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 40 CFR Part 68. This facility is also subject to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard 29 CFR 1910.119. The following summarizes the elements of the release and chemical-specific prevention that are in place at our facility:\n\u0095\tProcess safety information that is accurate and up to date;\n\u0095\tWell-trained operating, maintenance, and contract personnel;\n\u0095\tWritten operating procedures;\n\u0095\tMechanical integrity procedures for process equipment inspections and quality control;\n\u0095\tManagement of change and pre-startup safety review procedures;\n\u0095\tPeriodic, detailed Process Haza"

Emergency Response of the RMP is based on such designation. Notwithstanding, the Terre Haute Terminal has an extensive emergency response program with a written Emergency Response Plan (ERP). The ERP is designed as a guide to help in determining the magnitude of an incident, the steps needed to bring the incident under control and the requirements to ensure that all federal, state, and local laws are complied with. The ERP is a definitive plan that assigns responsibilities, defines several different methods of communication, designates evacuation procedures, and coordinates with outside assistance. The plan also designates the type and frequency of training that employees are required to have depending on their responsibilities. Furthermore, the plan commits the company's management team to devote the necessary resources to prepare, implement and audit the ERP.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\nRigorous training, drills, audits, cooperation with emergency responders and local officials, recognit"
