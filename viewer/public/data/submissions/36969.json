      "SummaryText": "    Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]\n\nMEMC Electronic Materials, Inc.'s St. Peters plant (MEMC - St. Peters) in \nO'Fallon, Missouri (RMP ID No. 100000094603) produces silicon wafers for the \nelectronics industry.  It is one of the largest silicon wafer manufacturing plants in \nthe world.  Located on 200 acres, it employs approximately 1,400 people.\n\nSilicon wafer manufacturing begins with other plants converting sand into ultra-\npure silicon.  MEMC - St. Peters then converts the ultra-pure silicon into silicon \ncrystal rods and cuts the rods into wafers.  The cutting results in surface damage \nthat must be removed to provide a surface where the electronic device, chip, can \nbe built by depositing layers on top of the wafer.  After lapping, etching, and \npolishing remove the surface damage, some of the wafers get an epitaxial layer in \nthe epitaxial deposition of silicon (EPI) process.  The EPI process uses the \nregulated hazardous substances covered by this RMP.  This RMP fulfills the \nrequirements of the Clean Air Act's Section 112(r) for the following three \nregulated chemicals at MEMC Electronic Materials, Inc.'s (MEMC's) St. Peters \nPlant (MEMC - St. Peters): \n\n-    anhydrous hydrogen chloride;\n-    hydrogen; and \n-    trichlorosilane.\n\nAnhydrous hydrogen chloride (HCl) is received in and used from 21,000-pound \ntube trailers and 600 pound cylinders.  The tube trailers consist of 7 separate,  \n3,000-pound hydrogen chloride cylinders and are kept in an enclosed room.  \nThere is usually one trailer onsite.  The room has a location for a second trailer to \nbe used when the first trailer of hydrogen chloride is nearing empty.  The room \nhas several hydrogen chloride sensors and a water deluge system.  If the \nhydrogen chloride sensors detect the presence of any hydrogen chloride in the \nroom, the deluge system is activated to absorb and remove the hydrogen \nchloride from the air.  The storage and usage locations of the 600-pound \ncylinders h"

      "SummaryText": "ave the same sensors and deluge systems.\n\nThe hydrogen is stored in a 20,000-gallon double-wall tank that can hold a \nmaximum of 13,000 pounds of hydrogen liquefied under pressure.  Blast walls \nlocated on the east and south sides of the tank would reduce the effect of an \nexplosion on anyone outside the plant.  The low density of hydrogen causes it to \nrise quickly and disperse.  This greatly reduces the likelihood of the hydrogen \nexploding.\n\nTrichlorosilane (TCS), is a colorless, toxic, flammable, corrosive liquid.  It is \nshipped under nitrogen pressure.  TCS is stored in 550 pound cylinders.  If \nreleased outside of the EPI process, TCS can ignite easily and produce HCL \nvapors.  Therefore, no more than two cylinders are carefully used in each of 4 to \n5 locations throughout the plant.  In addition, new, closed cylinders are stored \noutside, in a secure location.  It is only in this location that the combined weight \nof all TCS in cylinders exceeds the RMP threshold of 10,000 pounds.\n\n\n    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies [40 CFR 68.155(a)]\n\nMEMC's overall approach to chemical safety can be summarized in its Corporate \nEnvironmental, Safety, and Health Policy: \"We will strive to achieve an injury-\nfree and healthful workplace for our employees, work towards zero-effect on the \nsurrounding environment, and ensure the safety of our community neighbors.\"  \nMEMC has emphasized accident prevention from the start.  MEMC - St. Peters \nworks closely with our local fire department, Central County Fire and Rescue, \nand is an active member of the St. Charles County, Missouri Local Emergency \nPlanning Committee (LEPC).  \n\n\n    Five-Year Accident History [40 CFR 68.155(d)]\n\nMEMC policies include, at a minimum,  proactively adhering to all applicable \nfederal, state, and local laws.  The effectiveness of these policies is shown in that \nMEMC - St. Peters has never had an accidental release with offsite consequences \nin the 45-year history of the facili"

Moreover, MEMC \n- St. Peters' commitment to safety and the environment is illustrated by the \nfollowing awards: \n\n-    Liberty Mutual's Gold Award for Safety;\n-    Missouri Governor's Pollution Prevention Award;\n-    Industry Weeks' Top 10 Plant Award;\n-    Missouri Quality Award;\n-    Missouri Energy Conservation Award; and \n-    MEMC President's Award.\n\n\n    General Accident Release Prevention and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps [40 CFR 68.155(c)]\n\nMEMC - St. Peters has constantly improved its accidental release prevention \nprogram.  The basis of this program is our Process Safety Management (PSM) \nprogram.  All three RMP chemicals are included in the PSM program.  Elements \nof the PSM program include detailed, written operating procedures that are \nfollowed by trained and knowledgeable technicians.  The procedures begin with \na safety section to stress \"Safety First\" and has safety as a main theme.  MEMC - \nSt. Peters has a detailed collection of process safety information to insure safe \nchemical handling and usage.  Job Safety Analyses are also used.  Job Safety \nAnalyses are thorough reviews of jobs to identify the hazards and risks and to \nensure that the jobs are done safely.\n\nMEMC's tank and vessel inspection program and safety relief valve testing \nprogram have been in place for years.  They are part of the mechanical integrity \nprogram to insure that each piece of equipment is capable of fulfilling its \nrequirements.
