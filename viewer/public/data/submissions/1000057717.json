As part of this commitment, Ingredion has established a comprehensive safety, health, and environmental management process to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One part of this process is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at Ingredion and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at Ingredion.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the program.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nIngredion is committed to the safety of its workers and the public, the preservation of the environment, and the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Ingredion has made significant investments in process equipment, safety systems, and personnel to ensure the safety of its operations, minimize the impact of its operations on the environment, and prevent releases from occurring.  This commitment is clearly stated in Ingredion's Environmental, Health, & Safety Policy, and reinforced as a critical element in employee performance appraisals and the profit sharing plan.  A well-qualified Environmental, Health, & Safety (EHS) staff, a highly competent in-house engineering group, and a committed senior management team ensure process safety is given the highest priority.\n\n\n\nIngredion is also well prepared to respond to and contain a release if one should occur.

Regular interface with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), fire department, and other response agencies ensures a large team of experts is ready to respond should they be needed.  Familiarity with Ingredion's processes and chemicals, established emergency action plan, and extensive training ensure local emergency agencies can provide the community appropriate support if needed.\n\n\n\nChemical Processes and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nIngredion's primary business is the manufacture of specialty carbohydrate based products for food ingredients and the paper industry.  Ingredion is headquartered in Westchester, Il.   Ingredion's Richland facility has been in this location for over 20 years and is considered today to be an innovative leader in carbohydrate technology.\n\n\n\nIn the manufacture of its specialty products, Ingredion uses phosphorus oxychloride (POCl3), a chemical listed by the RMP rule as a regulated substance which is stored on site above the EPA threshold quantities.\n\n\n\nPOCl3 is stored for use in the starch modification process.  In this process a small quantity of POCl3 is reacted with starch to structurally modify or alter the basic natural starch polymer.  The resulting modified starch is used in specialty food ingredient starches.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Penford facility in Richland, Washington.  Because processes at Penford that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary and the subsequent section on emergency response address each of the OSHA PSM elements and describe the management system in place to implement the accidental prevention program.\n\n\n\n1.

To accomplish this, Ingredion encourages (and at times requires) contractors and employees at all levels of the organization to participate in these programs.  Operating unit personnel participate in hazard studies, incident investigations, periodic audits, and management of change reviews.  Teams with management, operator and contractor participation are responsible for the development of related programs and procedures.  Written policies reinforce the importance of employee participation and ensure process-related information is made available to those involved.  All employees actively participate in Ingredion's safety process.\n\n\n\n2.    Process Safety Information/Trade Secrets\n\n\n\nRecognizing the importance of developing and maintaining technical documentation, Ingredion has established documentation standards and developed a document control system.  When new or modified processes are developed, they are designed to meet or exceed all accepted trade and design standards.  Information from chemical suppliers, engineering and trade associations, regulatory agencies, and equipment suppliers is utilized to design processes.  Materials of construction, design specifications, safe operating limits, operating and maintenance procedures, chemical safety information, and other key information are collected or developed to ensure the process operates safely.  Maintenance, operating, emergency shutdown, and an emergency action plan are developed and maintained. Ingredion ensures that its processes are maintained within their process limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown and safety systems).\n\n\n\nA process safety information file index helps direct personnel to the appropriate documents.

Process Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nIngredion utilizes team-based hazard analysis techniques to help ensure all potential hazards are identified and multiple levels of protection are in place to prevent an incident.  Teams with engineers, operators, mechanics and safety professionals evaluate each component and procedure of each process.  If new processes are developed, hazard evaluations are conducted at each phase of the design and construction.  Multiple hazard evaluation techniques including hazop, what-if reviews and checklists are utilized.    \n\n\n\nTrained study leaders and written hazard study protocol ensure each study is effective.  Every change to a process is similarly evaluated, and each process is comprehensively re-evaluated at least every five years. Ingredion has established a system to ensure timely response to findings and recommendations.  The system helps ensure: recommendations are documented, actions prioritized, and responsibilities assigned; a written schedule for completing action is developed; action is taken and documented; and action is communicated to affected personnel. \n\n\n\n4.    Management of Change\n\n\n\nTo help ensure proposed changes to processes are properly evaluated before they are implemented, Ingredion has developed an effective management of change program.  All proposed changes are carefully evaluated by engineers, operators, safety professionals, and/or site management to ensure a change does not introduce an unforeseen hazard.  Changes to process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process-operating conditions), procedures, and other process changes are subject to the management of change review.  When changes are implemented, operating and maintenance procedures are updated, employees and mechanics are trained, documentation is updated, and spare parts systems are updated.

Operating Procedures\n\n\n\nIngredion maintains detailed written procedures that address various modes of process operations, including unit startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process.  These procedures are used as reference by experienced operators and provide the basis for consistent training of new operators.  Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  When process changes are made, the management of change process ensures affected procedures are updated and operators are re-trained.  Process control equipment and software have also been programmed to require compliance with operating procedures.    \n\n\n\n6.    Training\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures, Ingredion has developed a comprehensive training program for all of its employees and contractors.  New employees are required to complete a new hire orientation prior to assignment in the facility.  After successfully completing the new hire orientation, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  The new operator must demonstrate (through tests and skills demonstration) adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner prior to working independently.  In addition, all operators must successfully complete periodic refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  \n\n\n\nPrior to working at Ingredion, contractors are required to certify that each of their employees have necessary experience, credentials, and skills to ensure that the mechanical integrity of the systems is maintained.
