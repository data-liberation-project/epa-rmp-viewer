A combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning programs is used to ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment. The comprehensive accidental release prevention program covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process. Unforeseeably, if a release is to occur, in order to provide the most effective means to control and mitigate the effects of an accidental release, Cloverhill Bakery has  their own highly trained emergency response team. The response team is in complete coordination with response teams from the Chicago Fire Department and Chicago Hazardous Materials team as well as directors at local hospitals.\nControlling accidents is and will continue to be a leading focus for the company and the individual employee.\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nCloverhill Bakery is a relatively new facility operated as a wholesale bakery located in Chicago, IL.  The facility operates one ammonia refrigeration system used to cool ingredient and freeze products.  Current anhydrous ammonia inventory consists of approximately 19,000 pounds.  The system is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR1910.119) and is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA\u00bfs RM program.\n\n\nSummary of Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nFor the worst case and alternative release scenarios, the EPA Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration and the EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration (February 2008) were used for guidance.\n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO\nThe worst-case release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons: \n?\tUnder normal operating conditions, the ammonia inventory in t"

As mentioned in the Ammonia Model RMP, this scenario would be representative of a gasket leak or pump seal leak.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons: \n?\tIndustry standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of the pumps at the facility\n?\tAmmonia is not corrosive in this service and the pump is relatively new\n?\tThe facility has a preventative maintenance program in place to maintain the ongoing integrity of the pumps\n?\tThe facility emergency response procedures enable trained personnel to respond quickly to isolate potential releases from any leaking equipment\n?\tMost lines are elevated, limiting the potential for damage from"

Our management system addresses each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n\u00bf\tEmployee Participation:  This program involves the employees in establishing and implementing the program. Employees have complete access to the program. Employees are also involved when a process hazard analysis is conducted. \n\u00bf\tProcess Safety Information:  Written information has been collected which enables the employees to identify and understand the potential hazards in the systems. The written information includes the ammonia MSDS and a description of the design of the ammonia refrigeration systems.\n\u00bf\tProcess Hazard Analysis:  Formal studies using the What-If Technique have been conducted to look at the systems and identify potential hazards. \n\u00bf\tOperating Procedures:  Written, detailed procedures have been developed which describe the steps which should be followed to safely operate the ammonia refrigeration systems.\n\u00bf\tTraining:  A training program has been developed which insures that employees who directly work with the ammonia system or safety of the system are trained on all aspects of the system and on the duties which they should perform to ensure the safe operation or safe response to the system.\n\u00bf\tContractors:  All contractors are screened and evaluated before they perform work on or near the ammonia refrigeration systems.  The contractors are also periodically evaluated to ensure that they perform work by following safe work practices.\n\u00bf\tPre-Start up Safety Review:  A pre-start up safety review is completed for all new ammonia projects to verify that all safety programs are in place, training has been performed, and construction has been completed according to design standards before the project is put into use.\n\u00bf\tMechanical Integrity:  This program ensures that the amm"
