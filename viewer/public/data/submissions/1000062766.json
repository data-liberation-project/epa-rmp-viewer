The Risk Management Program includes an Accident Prevention Program that includes Safety Information, Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Compliance Audits, and Incident Investigation. Equipment included under this covered process includes (1) a 30,000-gallon pressure vessel and ancillary pumps, piping, and valves, (2) an 18,000-gallon and pressure vessel and ancillary pumps, piping, and valves, (3) 45 1,000-gallon nurse tanks, (4) 6 1,450-gallon nurse tanks, and (5) 3 1,450-gallon double set nurse tanks. Helena personnel perform the transfer of anhydrous ammonia from the storage tank to the nurse tanks.\n\n\n\nHelena receives anhydrous ammonia by a Contractor that transports the anhydrous ammonia with a commercial tanker truck. The commercial tanker truck is temporarily parked on the Facility property while the anhydrous ammonia is transferred to the on-site storage tank. The transfer process from the commercial truck is performed by the commercial tanker truck operator (Contractor). Helena does not own or operate the commercial tanker truck. The Contractor is responsible to Helena for complying with relevant operation, maintenance, and training procedures and documentation. At a minimum, the Contractor must (1) have in place and certify compliance with applicable and relevant DOT and OSHA regulations, (2) make available to Helena and EPA upon request any contractor-related documentation necessary to demonstrate compliance, and (3) certify that it has in place emergency shut-down procedures for ammonia unloading operations and that its OSHA and DOT programs comply with federal, state, and local regulatory requirements. Further, Helena will provide a copy of its Contingency Plan to its Contractor for review and a copy of its RMPr Document upon request.\n\n",

Standards codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration at 29 CFR 1910.119 are not applicable to the operations at this facility because the facility is operated as a retail operation and is exempt from the OSHA standards.  However, the OSHA standards at 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, are applicable and are included in the Risk Management Program (RMPr) document that is implemented by this Facility.\n\n\n\nThis electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the Martinsville Facility located approximately 3.7 miles southeast of Martinsville at 9666 East Angling Road Martinsville, IL 62442.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Martinsville Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Martinsville Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\n\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\n\n\nHelena has updated the RMP to report: a change in the RMP Implementation Manager and\n\nEmergency Contact; a change in the Company name; and most recent review of prevention program\n\nelements during the 3-year compliance audit.  \n\n\n\nFACILITY\n\n\n\nThe Martinsville Facility is a retail agricultural chemical facility and operates one (1) covered process that includes the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is transported to the Facility via a commercial tanker truck and then transferred to a 30,000-gallon or 18,000-gallon stationary pressure vessel.  The commercial tanker truck operator (Contractor) performs these transfer operations.  \n\n\n\nHelena stores the anhydr"

This Facility owns and operates 45 1,000-gallon, six (6) 1,450-gallon, and three (3) 1,450-gallon double set nurse tanks.  Helena performs this operation in accordance with its Risk Management Program that includes a prevention program.  \n\n \n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nWorst case and alternative case consequence analyses were completed for the ammonia storage and filling process. The worst case scenario release for the Retail Facility assumed that all the contents in the largest single pressure vessel were released.  The release was modeled as if the pressure vessel was punctured on the side at the ground level. The resulting release of ammonia was modeled as a ground level horizontal jet.\n\n\n\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario assumes a rupture of a 2-inch transfer hose caused by an impact from a vehicle or some other source during a major loading or unloading operation.  This alternative scenario also considers active mitigation of the safety equipment (i.e. emergency shutoff and excess flow valves on the commercial tanker truck; and back flow check valves and excess flow valves on the pressure vessel side of the bulkhead), and operating procedures that the Facility uses to safeguard against releases from ammonia transfer operations.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Warehouse Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Facility.  The Warehouse Manager is assisted by other Helena staff, as directed.  The Warehouse Manager is responsible for ensuring that Helena Staff are properly trained in the implementation of the Prevention Program which includes Safety Information, Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigations, and Emergency Contingency Plans.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRA"
