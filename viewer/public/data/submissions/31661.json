We operate under General Electric Company's policy for Safety, Health & Environment.  This policy states: \n\n\"GE is committed to achieving environmental, health and safety (EHS) excellence.  This is a responsibility of management and employees in all functions.  GE will strive to provide a safe and healthy working environment and to avoid adverseimpact and injury to the environment and the communities in which we do business.\"\n\n \"Requirements:  ? Assess EHS impacts before starting a new activity or project.  Consider EHS impacts in the design and production of GE's products and services.  Eliminate unreasonable risks from GE's facilities, products, services and activities.   ?Reduce the use and release of toxic and hazardous materials, prevent pollution and conserve, recover and recycle materials.  Continue to improve our EHS systems and performance as an integral part of GE's operational strategy.\"\n\nFacility Description And The Regulated Substances Handled\n\nGE Betz manufactures specialty water-treatment chemicals, primarily used for the treatment of water and wastewater in industrial process systems such as boilers and cooling towers.  \nMost of our products are formulated by blending several raw materials within a mixing vessel and then packaging into various size containers.  Depending on our customer's needs, our package types can range from small 5-gallon pails to 6000-gallon truckload quantities.\nSimilarly, our raw materials, which we receive from suppliers, come in various size containers depending on customer demand for the product and the amount necessary to meet supply limitations and production demand.\n\nThe GE Betz - Addison Plant covers 4.5 acres of property, of which 58,800 sq ft are used for offices and production facilities.  The balance is used for out"

It acts as a corrosion inhibitor by neutralizing acids and elevating pH in steam condensate, which makes it particularly useful as a component of our product line and to our customers.  This material is stored in a protected area and removed from any combustion sources.\n\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program And Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe purpose of the program is to define steps that are taken to identify, evaluate, and prevent or mitigate releases of hazardous chemicals that could occur as a result of failures in processes, procedures, or equipment.  The prevention program includes elements that cover the compilation of process safety information related to the process, performance of process hazard review to identify and evaluate potential release scenarios, development and use of operating procedures, processes for insuring proper training of employees who are involved in handling hazardous chemicals, preventive maintenance for key equipment to limit the potential for failures that could cause releases, processes for managing changes in the process and conducting incident investigations for any release events that may occur.  The prevention program also includes requirements for performing compliance audits of the implementation of the prevention program.\n\n\nThe Five-Year Accident History\n\nAt the GE Betz - Addison Plant we have not had any accidental releases that resulted in significant death, injury, property damage on-site or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property or environmental damage in the past 5 years due to the use or handling of cyclohexylamine.\n\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nOur chemical release response program contains these elements:\n\n\n- Identification of emergency organization personnel structure and funct"
