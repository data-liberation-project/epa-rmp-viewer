FPC-TX is a vertically integrated organization. It consists of eleven covered process operations, and four support organizations. The facility is located in the city of Point Comfort, Calhoun County, Texas. The facility currently employs approximately 1600 employees.\n\nThe Covered Processes are:\nOlefins 1\nOlefins 2\nPolypropylene 1\nPolypropylene 2\nHigh Density Polypropylene 1\nHigh Density Polypropylene 2\nLinear Low Density Polyethylene\nPolyvinyl Chloride\nVinyl Chloride Monomer\nEthylene Glycol\nMarine Traffic\nInland Traffic\n\nThe Risk Management Plan (RMP) was prepared by the Corporate Director of Security & Risk Management Each operating unit has appointed one individual as the person responsible for implementation of the RMP in that Unit. The Environmental, Health and Safety Department, through the Emergency Response Coordinator, oversees, provides guidance, and audits the RMP activities of the operating units.\n\nCompliance with 29 CFR 1910.119: On May 26, 1992, OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) rule went into effect. FPC-TX is covered under this rule. The PSM rule consists of fourteen (14) elements. The facility has developed and implemented the fourteen elements of this rule.\n\n\nCOVERED PROCESS - BRIEF DESCRIPTION\n\nOlefins 1 & 2\n\nCombined, Olefins 1 and Olefins 2 have twenty-two pyrolysis furnaces used to crack a range of feedstock consisting of propane (3), natural gas liquids (NGL) (2), naphtha (4), and an ethane/propane mixture (1).  The resulting products are ethylene (7), propylene (8), a mixed C4 product (9), pyrolysis gasoline (10), and pyrolysis fuel oil (11).  The furnaces are fired with fuel gas (5).\n\n \n\nPolypropylene 1\n\nThe Polypropylene I Unit utilizes BASF gas-phase reactor technology to produce polypropylene resin using propylene supplied from the Olefins Plant.

The resulting stabilized polyethylene melt is then fed to an underwater pelletizer and cut into small pellets.\n\nHigh Density Polyethylene 2\n\nIn the HDPE II Plant, polymerization occurs in an isobutane slurry using high activity proprietary catalyst in a loop reactor.  The HDPE II Plant has the capability of producing different grades of products for various applications by customers.   The HDPE II Plant is broken down into the following sections: Catalyst Preparation and Activation, Feed Preparation, Polymerization, Gas Recovery, Extrusion / Blending & Storage / Rail Car Loading.\n\nThe polymerization process reaction is continuous and occurs in a slurry phase with isobutane as the carrier solvent.  The slurry is directed to the High Pressure Flash Chamber where gases and light hydrocarbons are volatilized and exit through the top of the chamber.  Ultimately the polymer is cut into pellets and then transferred to blending silos before being loaded for product shipping.\n\n\nLinear Low Density Polyethylene\n\nThe LLDPE Plant is designed to produce Linear Low Density Polyethylene using two parallel reactor lines.  The process employs a gas phase fluidized bed reactor in which ethylene and co-monomers are polymerized using a proprietary catalyst. Ethylene, hydrogen, and a co-monomer are reacted with injected pre-polymer powder in a fluidized bed reactor to produce LLDPE.  This product is continuously withdrawn via a lateral withdrawal system for degassing and downstream process. The virgin powder is received and blended with additives for extrusion and pelletization.

The sole function of the water diluent is to facilitate heat removal from the polymerization reaction.  The reaction is initiated most commonly with an organic peroxide soluble in the monomer phase. PVC slurry is centrifuged and then dried. The clean dry PVC is stored in silos, prior to being sold by railcar, tank truck, one ton bags, and 25 kg bags. \n\nVinyl Chloride Monomer\n\nEDC is formed by oxychlorination of ethylene.  Four oxychlorination trains are used to combine ethylene, hydrogen chloride, and oxygen to form ethylene dichloride.  Purified EDC (10) is thermally cracked into VCM and HCl in the EDC Crackers. The VCM produced in the furnaces is purified, washed, dried, and sent to the Polyvinyl Chloride department for conversion to PVC.  HCl (6) is also purified to meet the quality required as the raw material for the oxychlorination section.  EDC is recycled back to the process. \n\nEthylene Glycol\n\nThe Etylene Glycol plant produces monoethylene glycol, diethylene glyco, and triethylene glycol.  The glycols are produced in two major steps.  Oxygen from the Air Separation Plant (ASP) is reacted with ethylene from the Olefins Plant to form ethylene oxide (EO). EO is produced in the Scientific Design liscensed glycol reaction and scrubbing section utilizing Mitisubishi reactors.   This safe process begins with only 10 percent EO in a hydrolysis process to produce EG.  There is no storage of EO on the site.  If the EG unit is not running, the EO unit is shut down.  The glycol is distilled into MEG, DEG, and TEG products.

      "SummaryText": "e Department. \n\n\nMaintenance Satellite Shops\n\nThe Maintenance Department has an established Satellite Shop at each operating plant. These satellite shops provide Mechanical, Electrical, and Instrument Maintenance Services to the Operating Units. The following descriptions apply to all three Maintenance Disciplines. Interactions with Operating Units are through established Equipment Route Checks, scheduled preventative maintenance, and analysis of abnormal equipment conditions. In addition to regularly scheduled maintenance activities, the Satellite shops meet weekly with Operations to discuss concerns, schedules, and abnormal analysis results. Various Maintenance services are also performed upon request from Operations through the work order system. This system allows requested work to be managed and completed in a timely manner.\n\nThe Maintenance Organization as a whole exists to support Operations and provide equipment reliability, efficiency, and therefore equipment safety.\n\nFormosa Plastics Corporation, Texas maintains continual improvement of our existing systems.  Several planned enhancements include the addition of Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA)for scenarios from our process hazard analysis with high severity/risk ranking.  These additional analysis will be included, as required, in all future PHA revalidations as well as changes to any process that may prompt a new or revised PHA.  We also plan to review and suggested improvements to the positive material identification (PMI) program to adjust to and incorporate changing industry standards and practices."
