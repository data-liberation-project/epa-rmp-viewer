All of us must incorporate safety, health, and environmental considerations into our daily business activities. \n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\n\nThe Hercules Hopewell Plant is located on 390 acres in the City of Hopewell. The facility produces cellulose derivatives that are used as thickeners in soups, gravies, pancake syrups, and toothpaste. In the construction industry these derivatives are used as thickeners for latex paints, oil drilling compounds, joint cements, and caulking. These products are also used in pharmaceuticals, inks, and the production of paper.  In the manufacture of these derivatives, RMP-covered toxic chemicals (ethylene oxide, and propylene oxide) are used as raw materials. The one (RMP) flammable present on site as a raw material is ethyl chloride. By treating cellulose from trees or cotton with lye and reacting the resulting intermediate with various chemicals, we manufacture cellulose derivatives.\n \nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nAll production processes using the RMP-covered toxic and flammable chemicals on the Hopewell Plant are covered by the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard. The plant has a comprehensive process safety management system in place. Operators are thoroughly trained about their jobs and have written operating procedures readily available via site intranet.  Operators perform observations of their equipment as frequently as hourly and at least every eight hours. Equipment is subject to the mechanical integrity program which requires inspection and testing of critical equipment sometimes as frequently as weekly and at least as required by standards, manufacturer recommendations, good engineering practice, etc. Mechanics are also thoroughly trained on their job skills and equipment inspection procedures. Each process is subject to process hazards analysis at least every five years to continually improve the safety and reduce the chance for fires, releases and spills in the operation. Management of change requires "

      "SummaryText": "that a team approve changes to processes and equipment. Most processes are computer-controlled and all are monitored continuously by operators to prevent hazardous conditions from developing.  Processes also have failsafe devices that shut down equipment before hazardous releases occur. Automatic leak detection devices are present to notify operators to take shut down actions in the event of a leak in the storage, unloading, and use areas of covered chemicals. Periodic audits to identify potentials for fire, release, or other hazards are performed by plant and corporate personnel. \n\nFIVE YEAR HISTORY\n\nIn the past five years, the Hopewell Plant has not had an accidental release of ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, or ethyl chloride that had any effect offsite or that reached any offsite location. No employee has been injured in this time period because of a release of any of these chemicals. This is a result of the prevention program described above and training that all employees receive on how to do their jobs safely. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Hopewell Plant has a written emergency response plan. This plan is coordinated with the City of Hopewell's emergency plan. The plan describes the actions employees will take in response to an emergency such as accidental chemical release, fire or explosion, or a medical emergency. All employees are trained to \"first responder\" level which means that they know what to do if they discover an emergency situation. A first responder will notify appropriate plant personnel of the emergency. This notification could be by telephone or more likely by two-way radio since most shift team members carry a radio. The plant siren would be activated to notify everyone on plant of the emergency. The Plant Emergency Response Team is trained to handle chemical releases, incipient fires, or medical emergencies. This team is equipped with an ambulance, and a hazardous materials trailer stocked with materials for responding to and stopping "

Note that plant personnel drill at least annually with local public safety personnel. \n \nCommunications with the City can be by radio, dialing 911 on telephone, or the Hopewell Emergency Notification System (HENS).  HENS is connected to local industries, public safety personnel, nearby schools, and the community center and would provide immediate notification of an emergency.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nContinuous training on operational and emergency procedures and installation of additional alarms, lighting and process controls will improve the safety of our processes and our overall safety management program."
