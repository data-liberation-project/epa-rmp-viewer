As stated on the company's website, \"Inland Cold Storage is committed to being a leader in the public refrigerated warehouse industry and in our sphere of business. We promise to provide innovative, professional services of a quality that meets or exceeds the expectations of our customers, our suppliers, and out community in general. We promise to maintain our facilities to the highest standards possible.  We will offer superior service and capabilities at a reasonable and competitive price as we stay abreast of the latest technologies available in our industry and in the general business arena. Our continuing objective is to exceed the performance of other comparable companies, in part by allowing our team members at all levels to continually improve the quality and value of our service.\"\n\nInland Cold Storage senior management is not only committed to offer superior service, but to also maintain a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  Inland Cold Storage's safety and environmental policies are administered by the Operations Manager, who conducts quarterly inspections of the facility to ensure compliance, and oversees the entire safety and environmental programs.  These programs include forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers documentation, Emergency Action Plan, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nConstruction of the ammonia refrigeration system at Inland Cold Storage was completed in April 2001.  In June 2002, the facility underwent an addition of approximately 23,000 square feet, which included a dry produce cooler (1 evaporator), an addition to the north dock (2 evaporators), cold produce c"

The system was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the Uniform Fire and Mechanical Codes.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses 21,600 pounds of ammonia for storage freezers and dock operations, which includes the initial charge of 3,000 gallons, and two subsequent additions of 600 gallons.  The majority of the system is located in the machine room including vessels and compressors.  The condensers are mounted on the roof, and all of the evaporators are located in their respective cold areas or rooftop penthouses.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Inland Cold Storage ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the Inland Cold Storage facility operates in accordance with Cal/OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation. \n\nThe Inland Cold Storage facility including each ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with the 1997 Uniform Mechanical Code which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety features include a water diffusion tank, ammonia sensors in the machine room as well as sensors near the evaporators, and automatic shut down systems.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the machine room and just outside of the machine room (high pressure receiver and condensers).  All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that are commonly piped to the water diffusion tank.\n\nIn addition to the 1997 Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility will reference the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines as an information source.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTO"

The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\nInland Cold Storage maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes due to the renovation of the facility.\n\nIn case of an ammonia emergency, Inland Cold Storage plans to evacuate all employees in the facility and alert the local emergency responders (fire department).  Inland Cold Storage plans to coordinate emergency response efforts with the fire department on a periodic and ongoing basis.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation, performed on April 25, 2006, generated mitigation measures (recommendations) to improve safety at the Inland Cold Storage facility located in Riverside, California.  The mitigation measures include additional training, key maintenance-related tests/inspection, and enhanced emergency response policies and procedures.
