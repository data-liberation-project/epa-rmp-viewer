      "SummaryText": "Performance Materials Inc RMP is tied into our Process Management Safety Program and our ISO9002:1994 Quality System.  All procedures are documented in Work Instructions for each reactor onsite.  Safety processes and equipment necessary are included.  Our approach is to prevent accidential releases from happening.  Our systems are engineered so that controls are in place to prevent releases.   Performance Materials Inc has its own Emerpartnered with Hudson Fire department and the Nashua Smarteam (HazMat) in our Emergency Response Efforts.. Management is committed to providing all resources necessary to ensure a safe work place, safe community, and do no harm to the environment.  Our facility manufactures Advanced Ceramic Materials using a composite vapor deposition process.  Susbtances used include Methyltrichlorosilane, borontrichloride, anhydrous ammonia, helium, argon, and hydrogen gases in our process.  There are 5 PBN (Prylotic Boron Nitride) and 1 SiC (SiliconCarbide) reactors on premises.   Performance Materials complies with OSHA, EPA, DOT, and State of New Hampshire regulations for storage, shipping, handling and use of all materials in the process.  Our Emergency Response Teams works with the Hudson Local Emphasis Program Committee and Fire department to ensure safety requirements are being met. Performance Materials Inc. has contracted with United Industrial Services so that in the event of accidental release, they will perform clean up activities.   Improvements are continously being made to our processes to control and prevent any types of accidental releases from occurring.  All employees are provided with ongoing safety training in our processes and hazards that may be present."
