The primary activity at the Yenter Gas Plant Facility (Facility) is the handling and compression of natural gas.  In addition, as part of the facility operation, natural gas liquids (NGL) are separated from the natural gas stream, stored on site, and sold to offsite facilities.  The purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMP) is to strive for the prevention of NGL accidental releases from the Facility and to reduce the severity of any releases which may occur.\n\n\n\nThe flammable regulated chemical mixture at the Yenter Facility is Natural Gas Liquids (NGL) which is an aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon mixture.  The flammable regulated chemicals contained in the mixture included N-pentane, isopentane, N-butane, isobutene, propane, and ethane.  These regulated chemicals have a RMP regulated threshold quantity limit (TQL) of 10,000 pounds.  The chemical abstract service (CAS) number for NGL is not applicable.  However the CAS number for the individual constituents are as follows:  Pentane 109-66-0, Isopentane 78-78-4, Butane 106-97-8, Isobutane 75-28-5, Propane 74-98-6, Ethane 74-84-0 and Methane 74-82-8.\n\n\n\nThe Yenter Facility stores up to 214,874 gallons of flammables, including the following:\n\n- 17 above ground tanks of NGL\n\n- 4 above ground tanks of propane\n\n- 1 above ground tank of BG mix\n\n- 10 out of service, pressurized condensate storage tanks\n\n\n\nThe tanks contain a maximum of 883,130 maximum pounds of regulated flammables.\n\n\n\nThe RMP*COMPTM  program developed by the CAMEO team at the Hazardous Materials Response and Assessment Division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Chemical Emergency Prevention and Preparedness Office of the Environmental Protection Agency was appli"

The worst case scenario was assumed to be the release of the total quantity of the 60,0000 gallon bulk storage tank forming a vapor cloud within the lower and upper flammability limits which detonates.  For flammable substances, the endpoint is overpressure of 1 pound per square inch (psi) for vapor cloud explosions.  The release parameters are:  wind speed 1/5 meters per second (m/s), and atmospheric stability F.\n\n\n\nUsing the flammable endpoint of 1-psi overpressure and the data contained in the RMP*COMPTM program, the WCRS distance was calculated at 0.5 miles from the Facility.  Based on a site visit of the adjacent properties within a 0.5 mile radius of the facility, the population within the WCRS area is zero (0).  Public receptors, as defined in 40 CFR 68.3, within 0.5 miles of the Facility, were not observed.  Environmental receptors, as defined by 40 CFR 68.3, within 0.5 miles of the Facility, were not observed based on review of United States Geologic Survey (USGS) topographic maps.  The Facility has not had a NGL release during the past five years.\n\n\n\nThe Facility has an Emergency Response Program which includes an Emergency Response Plan.  The Emergency Response Plan describes procedures to minimize hazards to human health and the environment.  The Emergency Response Plan includes aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  The Emergency Response Plan also includes procedures for the use of emergency response equipment and its inspection, testing and maintenance.  In the event of a NGL accident, first aid procedures for exposure, as well as procedures to inform authorities and the public are described in the Emergency Response Plan.  A general emergency practice drill is performed at least annually and includes an invitation to the ap"
