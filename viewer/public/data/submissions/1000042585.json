      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nMosaic Crop Nutrition, Henderson, Kentucky Terminal\n\n\n\nThe Mosaic Crop Nutrition, LLC Henderson facility transports and stores anhydrous ammonia. Anhydrous ammonia is unloaded from river barges at the dock and transferred via aboveground pipeline to two interconnected aboveground storage vessels of 8,000,000 gallon capacity.  The liquid anhydrous ammonia is stored in the vessels at -27 degrees F, and is transferred under pressure via pipeline through heat exchanges to an unloading station where cargo tank trucks are filled.  The anhydrous ammonia from this facility is typically used as a crop nutrient.\n\n\n\nThe RMP notes a catastrophic release scenario with a toxic endpoint of 7.8 miles, taking into consideration the 9 ft pond and dike system surrounding the tanks, and an alternate release scenario of a ruptured pipe which shows a toxic endpoint of 3.1 miles.  Public receptors are located within these radii. \n\n\n\nThe Henderson Terminal is engaged in the storage and transport of liquefied anhydrous ammonia, a highly hazardous chemical under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  Based on the quantity of anhydrous ammonia present at the Henderson Terminal, the facility is subject to the OSHA PSM requirements, and therefore, the Henderson Terminal satisfies the eligibility requirements for a Program 3 Prevention Program under EPA's RMP program.  The Henderson Terminal has a fully implemented OSHA PSM standard requirement, which is used as the RMP prevention plan to prevent accidental releases and plan for emergency actions. \n\n\n\nA brief summary of the implemented PSM program is as follows:\n\n?    Process safety information, which defines the chemical hazards, equipment, and technology in a process.  The terminal maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the ammonia storage and transportation process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process paramet"

Specific individuals are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. \n\n\n\n?    The terminal has a comprehensive program to confirm that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, processes are systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  The terminal primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience, as well as expertise in systems control technology and engineering.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\n?    The terminal maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) process startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, and (5) normal shutdown.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are reviewed and certified annually as current and accurate.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change (MOC) process.  \n\n\n\n?    To complement the written procedures for process operations, Mosaic and the terminal have implemented an employee participation plan and training for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in process operations and, after successfully"

Operators are allowed to work independently only after demonstrating, through tests and/or various skill demonstrations, that they possess adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\n?    The terminal has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\n\n\n?    The terminal conducts a pre-startup safety review (PSSR) for any new process or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, such as, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of process startup readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n\n\n?
