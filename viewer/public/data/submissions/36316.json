The mission of the organization is to protect the public health and water quality of upstate South Carolina waterways while providing the necessary infrastructure to support the local economy. WCRSA?s primary responsibility is to treat pollutants in the wastewater discharges of residential, commercial and industrial facilities within its jurisdiction before that water is returned to streams, rivers and lakes. To carry out this responsibility, it maintains a network of more than 275 miles of trunk sewer lines, over 60 pumping stations and 12 wastewater treatment facilities. There are 15 sewer sub districts (municipalities or local jurisdictions) in the WCRSA service area, which are responsible for sewer collection and lateral lines. WCRSA?s systems and services must meet guidelines and standards set by EPA and the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC).\n\nThe WCRSA Mauldin Road Wastewater Treatment Plant personnel continually strive to prevent unwanted or accidental releases of hazardous materials from their facility.  Policies in effect relate to operations and maintenance of equipment, ongoing employee training, emergency response planning and coordination with appropriate local response agencies.  These policies are embodied in the Risk Management Plan and OSHA Process Safety Manual, which together provide the means to prevent or mitigate accidental releases.\n\n    The Mauldin Road WWTP is located off Interstate-85 on Mauldin Rd.  This facility treats domestic and industrial wastewater for subsequent discharge into the Reedy River. Treatment processes include disinfection.\n\nDisinfection is accomplished by chlorination of the plant effluent prior to the effluent entering the equalization basin. Dechlorination is accomplished by sulfonation of the plant effluent just prior"

Facilities in place to accomplish this task include pumping, chlorinator equipment, and sulfonator equipment to provide a chlorine solution and a sulfur dioxide solution at rates proportional to discharge flow rates.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide for this process is stored and handled on-site in ton cylinders.  Normal operations include 6 chlorine cylinders on-line, with 6 spare chlorine cylinders in reserve and 3 sulfur dioxide cylinders on-line, with 3 spare sulfur dioxide cylinders in reserve.  The on-line cylinders are manifolded together and feed a single vacuum regulator.\n\nChlorine and sulfur dioxide are the only regulated substances maintained on-site in quantities above the threshold limit.\n\n    The general accidental release prevention program is a multi-faceted effort configured to comply with both EPA?s RMP and OSHA?s PSM rules.  Key elements include a high level of employee training, an aggressive equipment maintenance routine, detailed operation procedures, hazard reviews and management controls.\n\nChemical-specific prevention steps include availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine, and the presence of chlorine detection equipment.\n\n    The Mauldin Road WWTP has not used contractors in the past. If, however, contractors are needed in the future, the facility has a procedure in place for evaluating their safety performance. \n\n    No accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide have occurred at this facility in the past five years.\n\n    The facility has an emergency response program, which has been coordinated with the Belmont Fire Department, which is a member of the Local Emergency Response Planning Committee (LEPC).  The program includes itemized response steps including notification instructions.  \n\n    Continual evaluation of technology and operations are performed to identify improvements that may help prevent or mitigate accidental releases."
