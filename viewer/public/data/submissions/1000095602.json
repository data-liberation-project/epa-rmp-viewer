This AST is equipped with secondary containment.  Also, the Plant will receive 6,000 gallon tanker trucks alternatively delivering approximately 19.5 percent and approximately 30 percent aqueous ammonia, since the manufacturer does not produce 24 percent aqueous ammonia.  As a result, the Plant is required to develop and submit to the U.S. EPA, per 40 CFR 68, a RMP since aqueous ammonia at a 20 percent or greater concentration that is stored in the 40,000 gallon AST exceeds the threshold storage limit of 20,000 gallons as stipulated in Table 1 of 40 CFR 68.130.\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tFive-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThe Plant has had no accidents, including spills, associated with the operation of the 40,000 gallon aqueous ammonia AST in the last five years.  The tank was commissioned in March 2011.\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that Program Level 1 requirements do not include providing a prevention program.  Only Program Level 2 and 3 require a prevention program per 40 CFR 68.170 and 175, respectively.  An overview of the Plant's existing prevention program is described below to meet 40 CFR 68.155 requirements for addressing prevention requirements.\r\n\r\nThe Plant maintains the following prevention and emergency response plans:\r\n\r\n1.\tContingency Plan (for hazardous waste generated episodically)\r\n2.\tEmergency Response and Disaster Control Plan\r\n3.\tSpill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasures (SPCC) Plan\r\nThe Plant episodically generates refractory material which is classified as a hazardous.  As a result, the Plant is required to develop a Contingency Plan and to implement the Contingency Plan during a fire, explosion, or hazardous waste release (COMAR 26.13.03.05"

Also included in the Contingency Plan are additional requirements outlined in 40 CFR 262.34(d)(5)(i).\r\nAs part of preparing the Contingency Plan, the Plant also developed an Emergency Response and Disaster Control Plan that describes the actions that will be taken in the case of small or large fires, explosions, sudden or non-sudden chemical releases, natural events, public hazards (i.e., bomb threats, riots, etc.) or oil spills related to daily operations at the Plant.  The Contingency Plan mirrors the Emergency Response and Disaster Control Plan in terms of response method and response team organization to ensure consistency between the two Plans.   \r\n\r\nPursuant to the requirements of the December 5, 2008 amendments to Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 112 (40 CFR 112), as well as the Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR) 26.10.01 governing oil pollution and tank management rules, the Plant has developed and implemented a SPCC Plan.

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\r\n\r\nThis revised Risk Management Plan (RMP) was developed for Lehigh Cement Company LLC (Lehigh) per Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) solely for the purpose of storing aqueous ammonia (i.e., ammonium hydroxide) above the threshold reporting quantity of 19.5 percent.  The RMP was developed following U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) guidance documents and 40 CFR Part 68 (Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions).   This revised RMP is being submitted to reflect Program Level 1 requirements as a result of a recent U.S. EPA review of the original RMP submitted by Lehigh to the U.S. EPA in 2017.\r\n\r\nThe revised RMP describes and details the evaluation in determining Lehigh's process per \u00a768.3, Program Level assignment (\u00a768.1) and various applicable site level prevention programs (\u00a768 Subpart C).  The Plant Registration Form is presented in Section 2.0.  Section 3.0 provides the results of the hazards assessment, and Section 4.0 presented the Plant's emergency response program.   \r\n\r\nThe result of the Plant's revised risk management evaluation is summarized below:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tStorage of 24 percent aqueous ammonia in a 40,000 gallon AST triggers RMP,\r\n\u00bf\tProcess is storage of aqueous ammonia solution (CAS Nos. : 1336-21-6 and  7664-41-7), and\r\n\u00bf\tRMPComp modeling results of a worst-case release scenario (\u00a768.25) result in a Program Level 1 designation.\r\n     \r\nPer \u00a768.155, the Executive Summary of the RMP is required to include a brief description of the following: \r\n\r\n\u00bf\tThe stationary source and regulated substances handled; \r\n\u00bf\tThe five-year accident history;\r\n\u00bf\tThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies; \r\n\u00bf\tThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps; \r\n\u00bf\tThe emergency response program; and\r\n\u00bf\tPlanned changes to improve safety.\r\n\r\nDescribed below are the required elements listed above.
