The systems have computerized process control systems that monitor system performance and control their operation.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is used as a refrigerant in these systems.  Anhydrous Ammonia is a colorless gas with a pungent ammonia odor that is an irritant to the eyes, nose and throat. Anhydrous ammonia is normally shipped as a liquefied compressed gas and is present in portions of the refrigeration system as a liquid under pressure. Please refer to onsite Process Safety Information for current ammonia inventories.\n\n\n\nIn order to protect its' employees, the public, and the environment, Monson, LLC has an integrated process safety management program to prevent ammonia releases and mitigate the consequences of a release, should one occur.  The program is designed to comply with WISHA's Process Safety Management Standard (PSM) found in WAC 296-67 and EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations found in 40 CFR Part 68. \n\n\n\nThe Monson, LLC plant has an Emergency Action Plan that addresses the response procedures necessary for a release of anhydrous ammonia from a refrigeration system.  The compressor rooms are equipped with ammonia gas detectors that alarm if ammonia is detected at a concentration of 35ppm.  The refrigeration systems are designed so that major components can be isolated by closing selected valves.  In case of an accidental release, calls would be made to the Selah Police and Selah Fire Departments and to the Yakima County Emergency Services to assist in the response. \n\n\n\nDuring the last five years, there have been no reportable releases of anhydrous ammonia. Should there be an accidental release when no one is on the premises, it would be detected by the ammonia gas detectors that are connected to "

      "SummaryText": "a computer control system.  Ammonia gas detectors are installed and the computer monitors all areas where ammonia could possibly be.  When the control system detects ammonia it activates the alarm and dials emergency numbers for designated refrigeration personnel. \n\n\n\nMonson, LLC makes daily inspections of the ammonia refrigeration systems to determine if there are any potential problems; in addition,  preventive maintenance programs are in place and inspections, tests and maintenance are completed by qualified site and contractor ammonia refrigeration technicians.\n\n\n\nAs a result of the revision of the Process Safety Management Plans for Refrigeration Systems 1, 2, 3 and 4 and the Risk Management Plan for Refrigeration Systems 1, 2, 3 and 4, all aspects of the design, construction, operation and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration systems have been reviewed and approved by the PSM Committee.
