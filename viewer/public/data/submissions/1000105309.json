We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n* A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n* An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n* A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n* An overview of our emergency response program\n* An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Pioneer Cryogenic Plant located in Lincoln County, Wyoming, is owned by Enterprise Gas Processing L.L.C. and is operated by Enterprise Products Operating, L.L.C. The Pioneer Cryogenic Plant is an integrated gas processing, hydrocarbon liquid recovery and residue gas delivery facility.  The plant is designed to utilize the cryogenic turbo expander process to recover natural gas liquids from the inlet gas, and is assembled from prefabricated, skid-mounted process components and some individual foundation mounted equipment.  Produced natural gas is delivered to the facility from gas gathering systems and inlet gas pipelines.  The gas passes through inlet slug catching facilities where liquids that condense in the gas gathering systems are separated and stabilized."

Finished products are residual natural gas and extracted hydrocarbon liquids which are removed from the plant by pipeline systems.\n\nThe Pioneer Cryogenic Plant is regulated by Federal OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.  We have entered the facility as an RMP Program Level 1 facility.\n\nToxics\n\nThere are no toxic materials contained on site above the threshold limits.\n\nFlammables\n\nThe Pioneer Cryogenic Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Enterprise identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site based on process knowledge. Listed flammable substances which are stored above the threshold quantities at the Pioneer Cryogenic Plant are natural gas (methane), ethane, propane, iso-butane, normal butane, iso-pentane and pentane.  These flammables are present in the inlet natural gas, recovered liquid\nhydrocarbon product, and the plant process refrigeration system.  Stabilized field liquid condensate is also stored at the facility prior to shipment, but this liquid has a low vapor pressure and is exempt from the Risk Management Plan regulation.  The inlet gas and field condensate are naturally occurring hydrocarbon mixtures and are exempt from the RMP regulation.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components.  There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe following is a summary of the accidental release prevention program in place at Pioneer Cryogenic Plant.  The process at the facility is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation (Program 1).  Release prevention is provide"

In addition, a written safety program designed to comply with all applicable OSHA safety performance regulations is strictly enforced at all Enterprise facilities, including the Pioneer Cryogenic Plant facility.  As part of the Enterprise safety program, the facility utilizes procedures that are included in the Enterprise program, but may not specifically be required at non-PSM and/or RMP Program 1 facilities (e.g. Safe work practice training; safe work permitting and hot work permitting).\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP covered processes at Pioneer Cryogenic Plant.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe Pioneer Cryogenic Plant has safety features on many units to help contain/control a release, to quickly detect a release and reduce the consequence of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\nRelease Detection\n\n* Hydrocarbon (hazardous gas) detectors and alarms\n* Fire detectors on gas compression equipment\n* Plant video surveillance system\n* Actively managed Environmental VOC emission detection program to detect leaks throughout the plant before they can present a safety hazard.\n\nRelease Containment and Control\n\n* Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\n* Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\n* Automatic shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high pressure).\n* Secondary containment (curbs and dikes) to contain any release of liquid chemicals\n* Redundant equipmen"

The following is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five years:\n\nThis facility has had no accidental releases in the last five years which meets the criteria set forth in 40 CFR 68.10.\n\nEmergency Procedures Information\n\nThe Pioneer Cryogenic Plant maintains a written emergency procedure, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The procedures are for the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the terminal facilities.   \n\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Pioneer Cryogenic Plant is coordinated with the Lincoln County Emergency Management organization (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives.  The Pioneer Cryogenic Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Pioneer Cryogenic Plant resolv"
