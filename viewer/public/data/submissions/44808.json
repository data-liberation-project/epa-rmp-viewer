      "SummaryText": "The City of South Bend Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) facility staff is committed to safety and is continually evaluating ways to improve safety programs.  Facility staff works closely with other city and county agencies to coordinate safety and emergency response planning activities.\n\nThe WWTP uses chlorine, a regulated substance, in 1-ton cylinders to disinfect treated wastewater and sulfur dioxide, a regulated substance, in 1-ton cylinders to dechlorinate wastewater effluent prior to discharge to the St. Joseph River.  Cylinders are stored outdoors on a raised concrete slab.  Four cylinders of each substance are used indoors (as of spring 2006).  \n\nThe WWTP has safely operated the present chlorine and sulfur dioxide process equipment since they were installed.  The processes are not operated during the winter months.  Every spring, before restarting the two systems, all operators receive review training and all equipment is thoroughly inspected, tested and, if necessary, serviced or replaced, prior to start up.  The equipment for both systems is included in the facility?s computerized preventative maintenance program and is regularly inspected, tested and, if necessary serviced or replaced during the operating seasons. \n\nPrior to the start-up in April 2006, new feed equipment for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems is being installed to upgrade the systems and enhance safety. The Management of Change and Pre-Startup Review processes have been initiated for this change and will be completed prior to start-up. Remote vacuum regulators will be located at each ton cylinder to ensure that a vacuum exists throughout the system. Both chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems will consist of vacuum controlled process equipment.  A loss of vacuum in the process lines automatically closes the valve at the respective supply cylinder preventing a release of toxic gas and alerting the operators on the centralized, computerized SCADA system.

If chlorine or sulfur dioxide is detected, alarms will be activated alerting facility personnel of a possible leak (audible, visual, and on SCADA system) and the valves on the cylinders will be automatically closed (via direct acuators) to shut off the flow of gases.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for each substance was modeled according to EPA guidelines and involved the catastrophic failure of one, full 1-ton cylinder.  No mitigation measures were considered for this scenario.  It is not likely that such an event would occur.\n\nEPA also requires that an alternative release scenario be evaluated that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario.  The facility has no history of chlorine or sulfur dioxide releases under EPA?s alternative release scenarios.  Chlorine is introduced into the process through a vacuum controlled regulating valve on the cylinder in service.  If the vacuum is lost for any reason, the valve will automatically close preventing a release of chlorine.  For purposes of this Risk Management Plan (RMP), it is assumed that the connection between the vacuum controlled regulating valve and the chlorine cylinder fails, causing a release of liquid chlorine.  As liquid chlorine leaks from the cylinder, the cylinder pressure will drop causing a proportional decrease in the release rate.  To be conservative, no mitigation measures were considered for this scenario.  It is not likely that this alternative release scenario would occur.\n\nSulfur dioxide is introduced into the process through a vacuum controlled regulating valve on the cylinder in service.  If the vacuum is lost for any reason, the valve will automatically close preventing a release of sulfur dioxide.
