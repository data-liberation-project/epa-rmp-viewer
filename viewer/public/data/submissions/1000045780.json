Vicksburg, MS Refinery:  RMP Executive Summary\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nErgon Refining Incorporated is committed to operate the Vicksburg Refinery in a manner that does not endanger our employees, the environment or the surrounding community.  This commitment is demonstrated by an accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as the design of new systems, installation of equipment, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the refinery.  It is the company policy to implement reasonable controls to prevent the foreseeable releases of regulated chemicals.  However, in the event that an accidental release occurs, an emergency response plan that designates the roles of individuals has been established to mitigate the impact of the release within practical limits.  \n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Ergon Refining Incorporated refinery in Vicksburg, MS processes heavy naphthenic crude oil at a production rate of approximately 22,000 barrels per day. The products produced include a small stream of naphtha, ultra-low sulfur diesel, various hydro-treated naphthenic lube oils, and asphalt. The Vicksburg refinery will handle one regulated chemical (propane) in quantities that will exceed the threshold for which Risk Management Planning (RMP) is required with the implementation of the Propane De-asphalting (PDA) Unit. The Vicksburg facility is subject to Program 3 requirements of the RMP standards due to (1) being subject to Process Safety Management (PSM) standard for propane, (2) having the potential of causing offsite consequences, and (3) the facilityA?s standard industrial classification (SIC) code (2911).  \n\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s)\n\n\n\nFor program level 3 processes, one worst case flammable release scenario and one alternate case flammable release scenario was report"

Details of these submitted release scenarios are included in the RMP submittal information and refinery files.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program Steps\n\n\n\nThe Ergon Refining Incorporated refinery is regulated by the EPA RMP regulations as well as, OSHA PSM regulations.  The following summary addresses the necessary steps taken to comply with these regulations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nErgon Refining Incorporated (ERI) has managed a Process Safety Information (PSI) program to comply with OSHAA?s PSM Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119 (d) (1-3).  ERI recognizes the value of the good engineering and management principles promoted by these regulations and has chosen to the elements of the PSI Program to units and areas of the refinery that are not covered by PSM. With the addition of the Propane Deasphalting Unit that will lead to the threshold quantity of propane on site, the PSI program will also comply with the EPAA?s RMP Standard, 40 CFR 68.65 (a-d).  \n\n\n\nComplete and accurate written information concerning process chemistry, process technology, and process equipment is essential to an effective PSM Program and to a process hazard analysis (PHA).  The information addressed by this program is an essential resource for conducting the PHA, employee training, contractor safety, mechanical integrity, procedures, pre-startup safety reviews, management of change, emergency preparedness, and insurance and compliance audits.  Access to PSI information is provided to all employees through ERIA?s computerized document control system.\n\n\n\nPSI information and documents are required for all regulatory covered process units.

Chemical specific information, including exposure hazards, emergency response and exposure treatment is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  These documents are available to all employees via a computerized MSDS management system and in hardcopy in the refinery control room.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nThe refinery processes that contain quantities of regulated substances above threshold quantities are evaluated for potential hazards using the hazop method supplemented by checklists and what-if lists as necessary.  The evaluations are conducted by a team consisting on personnel familiar with the evaluation methods, refinery operations, maintenance, safety, training, and environmental compliance.  PHA documentation is maintained for the life of the process unit. Each process is revalidated every 5 years or sooner if significant modifications to the process deem the PHA necessary.  Findings and recommendations resulting from a hazop evaluation are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nWritten operating procedures were developed and are maintained for all processes at the Vicksburg facility.  These procedures address modes of operations such as initial startup, normal operation, temporary operation, emergency shutdown and operation, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The procedures are reviewed based on a predetermined cycle and certified as accurate and timely by knowledgeable and experienced operations staff members.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nErgon Refining Incorporated implements a comprehensive training program for newly hired operation and maintenance employees.
