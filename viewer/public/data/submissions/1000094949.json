This document describes emergency planning, prevention, and safety measures for the EIF KC Landfill Gas plant.\n\n\n\nDescription of the facility and the regulated substances handled. The EIF KC Landfill Gas Plant, located within the Johnson County Landfill, produces pipeline quality gas (high BTU gas) for sale into the interstate transmission pipeline.  The Process utilizes LP gas to boost the BTU content of the treated landfill gas collected from the Johnson County Landfill.  The propane is stored in one 18,000 gallon (66,500 pound) storage tank adjacent to the gas plant.  The propane storage tank is leased from Ferrell Gas.  Ferrell Gas performs safety inspections on the tank and shut-off valve at each re-fuel service call.  KCLFG owns and maintains the system beginning at the shut-off valve, through the plant, to the distribution point.\n\n\n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies at this facility: This facility complies with National Fire Protection Association (NFPA)-58 requirements for liquid propane (LP) gas storage, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the City of Shawnee Fire Department by calling 911 and request that they respond to the emergency. \n\n\n\nRoutine inspections, maintenance and monitoring of the gas plant equipment and facilities are also tools used to prevent releases.  These procedures are described fully in the facility's Process Safety Management Plan.\n\n\n\nWorst-case release scenario. The worst-case scenario is failure of the 18,000-gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (88% at 60 degrees F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. Since this facility is located in a relatively remote, unoccupied area, pro"

      "SummaryText": "tected by topographical elevations providing screening as well as distance to the nearest public receptors, the worst-case scenario would not affect any persons beyond the Johnson County Landfill property. \n\n\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps. This facility complies with United State Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Risk Management Program (accident prevention rule) and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. The propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law. \n\n\n\nFive-year accident history. We have never had an accidental release involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering at the EIF KC Landfill Gas plant.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program. In the event of an emergency involving our propane storage system, it is our policy to notify the City of Shawnee Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. We have discussed this policy with the fire department and representatives of the fire department have inspected our propane system. \n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety. EIF KC Landfill Gas will facilitate an annual review by local fire department officials and maintenance personnel, as well as conduct routine inspections and equipment audits, supported by annual training and awareness of EIF KC safety policies and procedures.\n\n"
