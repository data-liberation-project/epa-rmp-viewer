In service to the \n\ncommunity, the County has a history of adhering to proactive approaches for the prevention and \n\nemergency response of accidental releases of toxic substances.  Current prevention and \n\nemergency response polices adhere to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Prevention \n\nProgram and Emergency Response requirements as set forth under the 40 CFR 68 regulations. \n\n\n\n     The Facilities are located in Stuart, Florida and utilize chlorine gas in the water treatment\n\nprocess.  The Facilities maintain a non-enclosed, chlorination area and chlorination distribution\n\nsystem  on-site.  Chlorine is delivered to the central open area and stored on- site in cylinders\n\ncontaining 2,000 pounds of liquefied chlorine under pressure when full. The chlorine facility holds\n\na maximum of three (3)  2,000 pound cylinders. \n\n\n\n     The Facilities  have an outstanding performance history in conjunction with handling,\n\nstoring, maintaining and operating of chlorine gas.  No accidental releases have occurred since the\n\nsystem went into service in 1986.  The water treatment plant is manned 22  hours/day, seven (7)\n\nday/week with an operator on call.  State certified operational personnel are trained in the safe\n\nhandling, maintenance and operation of chlorine systems that comply with EPA 40 CFR 68\n\nregulations.  The chlorination system is designed utilizing latest technologies and industry specific\n\ndesign codes and standards.  The current emergency response plans are documented and coordinated\n\nwith the community emergency response officials through the Local Emergency Planning\n\nCommittee (LEPC).  Operatio"

      "SummaryText": "nal staff are trained according to these response plans. \n\n\n\n     The EPA 40 CFR 68 requires offsite consequence analysis of two (2) release scenarios \n\nfor toxic substances identified as \"worst case release\" and \"alternative release.\"  The \"worst case \n\nrelease\" is defined by EPA as \"the owner/operator shall assume that the ... maximum quantity in \n\nthe largest vessel ... is released as a gas over 10 minutes.\"  For the worst case release, EPA \n\nspecifies the parameters to use in calculating the distance the chlorine will travel to achieve its  \n\n\"toxic endpoint.\"  The alternative release is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst case \n\nrelease scenario\", such as a pipe leak.  \n\n \n\n     Utilizing the EPA's RMP* COMP Model, a  distance of 4.3 miles was calculated for the \n\nworst case release toxic endpoint and 0.30 miles for the alternative release.  As per EPA regulations,\n\nthe population is estimated within the circles defined by the radius' corresponding to the toxic\n\nendpoints.  These population values are 40,603 for the worst case and 859 for the alternative release. \n\nIt is noted that if an actual release did occur according to the alternative release scenario, the\n\npopulation at risk would be substantially less due to the plume of gas being more in the form of an\n\nelliptical pattern moving down wind of the point source rather than a circle centered on the point \n\n\n\nsource. \n\n\n\n\n\n     The use of chlorination within water treatment and wastewater treatment has yielded \n\nenormous benefits in this County related to preventing the spread of water borne diseases.   \n\nMartin County, like virtually every modern treatment facility, understands the value and risks of \n\nthis treatment procedure. Martin County has an exceptional track record of no accidental \n\nreleases in its history and remains ever vigilant in its attention to safety regarding chlorine. \n\nMartin County supports this regulatory effort to inform the public in the general vicinity of any \n\nutility"
