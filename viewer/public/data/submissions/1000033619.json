The Ironhorse Complex began operations in July 2008 and is comprised of three gas processing trains: Stagecoach, Ironhorse 1, and Ironhorse 2. \r\n\r\nThe Stagecoach Train is designed to process 200 million standard cubic feet of gas per day (MMSCF/D).  The gas is delivered from pipelines and various compressor stations.  To reduce the dew point of the gas, the facility uses a propane refrigeration system to chill the inlet gas, which first flows through a slug catcher to remove bulk liquids from the gas stream.  Ethylene glycol (EG) is injected into the inlet stream to help prevent formation of hydrates.  Natural Gas Liquids (NGL) are removed and processed to meet industry specifications.  Condensate, also removed in the process, is stabilized and removed from the site via tanker truck. \r\nNGLs are removed by significantly lowering the temperature of the inlet gas stream via propane refrigeration.  The propane system is close-looped, and the refrigerant is circulated throughout the system by a natural gas compressor.  The chilled gas stream and its associated liquids pass through a three-phase cold separator where the gas exits off the top and leaves the facility by way of the sales line.\r\n  \r\nIronhorse Train 1 is designed to process 150 MMSCF/D.  The inlet stream enters the facility and is directed through a separate slug catcher. Condensate and water are directed from the slug catcher to the separator of the Stagecoach train. The gas stream is routed from the slug catcher to an inlet filter separator/coalescer system and then to an adsorbent treater for the removal of impurities, including mercury and hydrogen sulfide, if present. The gas stre"

The closed-loop hot oil system supplies heat to multiple process vessels to aid in preventing freezing. The hot oil system is also utilized to increase the temperature of the gas stream throughout the process to facilitate the recovery of NGLs. Ironhorse Train 2 is designed to process 150 MMSCF/D.  The process description and routing of process streams are identical to that of Ironhorse Train 1.\r\n\r\nThe Ironhorse Complex stores flammable mixtures of methane, ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes (NGL) in four 60,000-gallon pressurized tanks.  Administrative controls on the NGL tanks limit the storage of NGL to 48,200-gallons per tank.  NGL is a flammable mixture subject to the RMP rule as it is primarily comprised of propane and/or ethane, with a National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Flammability Rating 4 [will rapidly or completely vaporize at normal atmospheric pressure and temperature, or is readily dispersed in air and will burn readily (e.g., propane, hydrogen) and flash point below 23\u00b0C (73\u00b0F)]. Methane, ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes are listed in 40 CFR 68.130 as regulated flammable substances.  The threshold quantity for regulated flammable substances is 10,000 pounds.  The maximum inventory of NGLs at the Ironhorse Complex is 240,000-gallons or 999,336 pounds of regulated flammable chemicals. NGL is stored at the facility in excess of the 10,000 lb. threshold quantities for flammable substances and  is therefore subject to the risk management program rule, as defined in 40 CFR Part 68.  TLLP is submitting this Risk Management Plan 5-year update in compliance with 40 CFR 68.190(b)(1). \r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History:\r\nNo accidents involving regulated substances that resulted in onsite injuries, significant property damage, or offsite response have occurred since startup.\r\n\r\nPreve"

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of TLLP processing trains. TLLP's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond in order to contain and control the release.\r\nBecause the process at the Ironhorse Complex is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) RMP regulation and also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information:\r\nTLLP must compile certain written Process Safety Information (PSI) before conducting a PHA. The PSI must include information pertaining to the hazards of highly hazardous chemicals used or produced by the process, the technology of the process, and the equipment used in the process.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA):\r\nThe Ironhorse Complex conducted a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) to help ensure that hazards associated with the various Ironhorse Complex processes are identified and controlled. Within the PHA program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. The PHA included an evaluation of routine and non-routine modes of operation for potential equipment failures, human errors, and process upsets that could result in a catastrophic consequence.\r\n\r\nTLLP held PHA study sessions in September 2012 to identify process hazards associated with the Ironhorse Complex.
