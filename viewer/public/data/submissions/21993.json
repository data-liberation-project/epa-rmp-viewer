      "SummaryText": "Our initial RMP of June 18, 2000 is being revised to reflect the addition of a new chemical and corresponding changes in worst case and alternative case scenarios.\n\n(a) ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nCytec is a leader among chemical manufacturers in its safety, health and environmental programs.  Our commitment to protect our employees and the communities that are home to our operations is an integral part of Cytec's way of doing business.  Cytec has established safety, health, emergency response and environmental policies and standards to meet or exceed all regulatory requirements.  As a member of the Chemical Manufacturers' Association (CMA), Cytec subscribes to the codes established for Responsible Care ?.\n\n(b) THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nWillow Island's Polymer Additives Department produces TDPN (tthiodipropionitrile) which is used to make antioxidants which are used in such products as polyolefins.\nThe regulated substance involved with this batch process is acrylonitrile.\n\nThe Polymer Additives Department also produces A-1846 which is used to make antioxidants for use in such products as SPANDEX ?.  The regulated substances involved with this batch process are anhydous hydrogen chloride and 37% hydrochloric acid.\n\n(c) WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe toxic worst-case scenario is the failure of a tube trailer and the release of 21,000 pounds of anhydrous hydrogen chloride.  No controls are assumed to work for this scenario. The anhydrous hydogen chloride could reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for anhydrous hydrogen chloride is the failure of the regulator and resulting release of 250 pounds of material through the relief device.  The mitigating effects of the excess flow valve, emergency shutdown systems and the fire brigade response were included in the evaluation of the possible consequences.  The released anhy"

The mitigating effects of a dike, the fire brigade response and the use of a foam application system were included in the evaluation of the possible consequences.  The evaporating acrylonitrile could reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for 37% hydrochloric acid is the overflow of a storage tank due to operator error and the release of 1,000 pounds of material.  The mitigating effect of a dike and the fire brigade response was included in the evaluation of the possible consequences.  The evaporating hydrochloric acid could reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.\n\n(d) THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nCytec's general accidental release prevention program includes:\n\n? EPA 40 CFR 68 - Risk Management Plans\n? OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 - Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals \n? OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120 - Hazardous Waste Operations & Emergency Response\n? Other EPA, OSHA, DOT and State regulations\n? Generally recognized & accepted engineering codes and standards, and\n? Cytec Safety, Health, Environmental and Engineering standards\n\nThe following engineering and administrative controls help prevent a release of anhydrous hydrogen chloride\n\n- Emergency shutdown system\n- Fire water monitors\n- Leak detection monitors\n- Remote video surveillance\n- Excess flow valves\n- Caustic scrubber for pipeline venting and purge streams\n- Safety interlocks, hard wired and computer controlled\n- Tube trailer designed to DOT specifications and Air Product's strict requirements \n- Piping designed to ASME B31.3 Category M and maintained to API 570 Class 1\n\nThe following engineering and administrative controls help prevent a release of ac"

This program outlines actions to be taken by operating department, maintenance, utilities, office, technical, visitors, contractors, and plant emergency response employees.  The plant Fire Brigade trains and drills regularly with many exercises including local outside responders.\n\n(g) PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nCYTEC Industries is constantly striving to upgrade its processes, control technology, employee training, inspection, repair and maintenance of process equipment in order to improve safety."
