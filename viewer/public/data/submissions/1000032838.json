      "SummaryText": "1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy: ConAgra Foods maintains a comprehensive safety, health, and environmental program at the plant. The program includes engineering, education, and enforcement provisions for hazard communication, spill prevention and response, hazardous waste, universal waste and waste oil management, waste water and storm water management.\n\n\n\n2. Emergency Response Program: ConAgra Foods Council Bluffs facility has developed an OSHA hazardous substance emergency response program called HAZWOPER. The HAZWOPER document contains detailed procedures for: 1) pre-emergency planning and coordination; 2) personnel roles and lines of authority; 3) training; 4) communication; 5) emergency recognition and prevention; 6) safe distances and places of refuge; 7) site security and control; 8) emergency alerting and response; 9) ammonia decontamination; 10) emergency medical treatment and first aid; 11) critique of response and follow-up; 12) personal protective and emergency equipment; and 13) medical surveillance.\n\n\n\nConAgra Foods emergency response plan (HAZWOPER) is a detailed document which discusses the role of employees and management in an emergency situation. All emergency response personnel undergo training and records of this training are maintained and updated on site. The plan outlines specific procedures for\n\nevacuations, incident alarms and alerting. Depending upon a given situation, the Fire Department will be called to provide back-up emergency responders and equipment. The Fire Department will be called for all fire related emergencies. The incident commander has ultimate control of implementation of the emergency response plan.\n\n\n\n3. Stationary Source and Regulated Substance: ConAgra Foods is a frozen meal assembly plant located at 1023 South 4th Street, Council Bluffs, Iowa. The main building houses a processing plant used for mixing, cooking, conveying, freezing, and packaging. The processed products require refriger"

The systems are approximately 500 feet apart. The South Engine Room\n\nis located in the southeast area of the building. This is the original refrigeration system. The newer system which was brought on line in February 2007 is called the North Engine Room which is located in the northwest\n\ncorner of the facility building.\n\n\n\n4. Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios: RMP*Comp was used to calculate the worst case and alternative release scenarios for the both processes (ID 1: South Engine Room, ID 2: North Engine Room).\n\n\n\n5. Five Year Accident History: There have been no reportable incidents during the past five years. However, the facility maintains records of all incident investigation reports regardless of anhydrous ammonia quantity released into the atmosphere.\n\n\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety: Based on the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for ammonia, lists of action items were developed. The status of these action items will be monitored to ensure that implementation of the safety improvements is accomplished. Monthly Safety training is conducted for all team members at this facility, in addition PSM meetings are held to review safety and PSM program elements. Refer to Process Safety Management Program for specific information."
