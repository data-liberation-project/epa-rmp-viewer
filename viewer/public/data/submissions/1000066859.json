      "SummaryText": "Process 1\n\nA-1 Operations - A-1 consists of ammonia tanks and railcar unloading which provide ammonia for neutralization of acid mixtures.  Ammonia is also fed to ketene furnaces to stop the cracking reaction from proceeding too far.  Buildings include A-1, B-3, B-5, and 352.  This process also includes railcar storage.\n\n\n\nProcess 2\n\nG-10 Agile Manufacturing - Ammonia, nitric acid, and oleum are stored in the tank farm adjacent to buildings G-10 and G-10A for the manufacture of specialty explosives.  All operations at these buildings undergo detailed PHAs specific to the process to manufacture a given explosive.\n\n\n\nProcess 3\n\nProduction of a Nitric Acid/Ammonium Nitrate Mixture - The ammonium nitrate is produced by introducing ammonia into strong nitric acid.  The resulting mixture is used in the manufacture of explosives.  The production buildings include 330 and 320.  The ammonia is stored in tank farm 301 and the strong nitric acid is stored in tank farm 320.  Both ammonia and nitric acid are supplied by railcar.\n\n\n\nProcess 4\n\nExplosives Manufacturing - Nitric acid is planned to be stored in the tank farm adjacent to building G-8 for use in the manufacture of insensitive explosives. This process is currently under construction with material planned to be stored by June 2018. \n\n\n\nExecutive Summary\n\n\n\nIntroduction / Background\n\nHolston Army Ammunition Plant (HSAAP), located on two sites in Kingsport, Tennessee, is a federal government owned, contractor operated facility. It was built in 1942 to produce RDX (cyclotrimethylene-trinitramine) and HMX (cyclotetramethylene-tetranitramine) based explosives for the Joint Munitions Command (JMC) of the US Army. In 1999 BAE SYSTEMS Ordnance Systems Inc. (OSI) became the operating contractor. While continuing to produce RDX and HMX based explosives, HSAAP has been developing newer insensitive munitions to assist the Department of Defense in meeting its requirement to provide safer products to US military personnel.

HSAAP maintains an on-site emergency response team but also has long standing agreements and coordination with local emergency planning units including Hawkins County and the City of Kingsport.\n\n\n\nOSI's Safety & Health Policy is based on the concept of Total Employee Involvement. This concept recognizes that all personnel have a shared responsibility for the prevention of accidents, damage, or loss from any controllable source. In addition, senior management at HSAAP is committed to environmental stewardship, safety, and emergency preparedness. This commitment has been demonstrated through development and implementation of an Environmental Policy Statement and a Safety & Health Policy. Additionally, OSI pursued and obtained ISO 14001 certification for its Environmental Management System in November 2006 and has maintained this certification through surveillance and recertification audits. OSI pursued and obtained ISO 18001 certification in August 2009 for its Occupational Health and Safety Management System and has also maintained this certification through surveillance and recertification audits. HSAAP has been identified as a Center of Excellence by third party auditors.\n\nThe Safety Manager sends out monthly updates on workplace safety statistics and encourages safe practices through active employee communications. Incidents and near misses are investigated, and information is shared with all personnel to help prevent similar occurrences.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nManufacturing of RDX and HMX explosives requires the use of concentrated nitric acid and anhydrous ammonia; two listed substances under the Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulation"

A smaller anhydrous ammonia tank exists at the agile manufacturing facility with the storage quantity below the threshold. However, this chemical is included in the covered process description because it is also treated as a Program Level 3 chemical by OSI. Additionally, oleum, another listed substance under the RMP regulations, is stored in one tank at the agile manufacturing facility above the threshold quantity.  The oleum is used in the process to manufacture an insensitive explosive. \n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release & Chemical-Specific Prevention Programs\n\n\n\nIn addition to the RMP, HSAAP is subject to OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) and other related emergency response rules and regulations. Since HSAAP manufactures explosives most processes are Program Level 3 under PSM rules. Safe reliable production of explosives depends on an effectively implemented safety program. Elements of HSAAP's PSM include: process safety information management, process hazard analyses, standard operating procedures, proper training, mechanical integrity checks, Change Management, Pre Start-up reviews, compliance audits, incident investigations, employee participation, hot work permitting, and contractor oversight.\n\n\n\nPersonnel are trained annually on emergency response and hazard communication. Other safety-related topics are assigned based on each employee's job duties. Standard operating procedures are reviewed annually for completeness with required updates every five years or when a process change occurs that affects the procedure. Process Hazard Analysis studies are conducted for RMP or OSHA-covered new processes or changes to existing processes or on any other process deemed necessary by the Safety Manager. Revalidation of Process Hazard Analysis studies are conducted every five years. Management of Change procedures are followed for changes to equipment or operating procedures.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia, n"

Training is very important at HSAAP. This is apparent because third party auditors have recognized HSAAP's training program as a best practice among similar facilities across the U.S. OSI also utilizes a sophisticated facility-wide notification system with voice command capabilities to alert employees and the public in the event of a hazardous vapor release.\n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\n\n\nHSAAP had three incidents involving strong nitric acid and none involving ammonia during the five-year period.  All three incidents were below the reportable quantity but resulted in OSHA recordable injuries.  Two incidents occurred at the agile manufacturing facility involving the disconnection of flexible hoses while they held residual pressure.  One incident occurred at the nitric acid tank farm for Process 3, also involving a flexible hose.  Material had leaked through a valve, entering the flex hose which became pressurized due to heat from the sun.  Follow-up actions have been completed for these incidents to prevent further incidents and releases.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency, special management systems must be employed to control the emergency response scene and coordinate emergency response personnel.  The Incident Command System (ICS) is a set of preplanned assignments and job subdivisions implemented to reduce confusion in handling the emergency. The priorities of the system are: (1) safety of employees and responders, (2) safety of others in and around the area, (3) scene stabilization, and (4) property and environmental conservation. All personnel required to respond to an emergency or remain at an emergency scene are considered emergency response personnel for the duration of the emergency.\n\n\n\nICS in"

To support this relationship an annual emergency training drill is held in conjunction with all other contract employees onsite and local emergency responders. Furthermore, HSAAP has a fully manned and trained onsite fire department with HAZMAT capabilities that responds to all types of emergencies.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nHSAAP continues to strive to modernize the facility and to constantly improve health, safety, and security through the use of the best available technology and work practices. As previously mentioned, HSAAP maintains a certified Occupational Health and Safety Management System in compliance with ISO 18001. HSAAP is also investigating the use of smaller ammonia tanks located at the point-of-use.  This should eliminate any possible offsite impacts from ammonia storage. These tanks would be filled by tanker truck, eliminating the need to bring ammonia railcars on-site removing the toxic gas worst case scenario. The nitric acid alternative releases only resulted in offsite impacts when the scenario includes release outside of the diked area. The tanks and transfers pumps all have dikes to provide passive mitigation. Some transfer lines and valves are near the edges of the dike areas. A dike program is in place to review and repair or improve dikes. Management has been made aware of the importance of this program for nitric acid. Currently the railcars that become temporary storage are inside of a secure area, monitored, and moved to the unloading areas quickly."
