The chemical accident prevention provisions require an executive summary in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) submission to EPA. Per 40 CFR 68.155, the owner or operator shall provide in the RMP an executive summary that includes a brief description of the following elements:\n\n(a) The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source;\n\n(b) The stationary source and regulated substances handled;\n\n(c) The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps;\n\n(d) The five-year accident history;\n\n(e) The emergency response program; and\n\n(f) Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Facility complies with OSHA's 29 CFR 1910.111 requirements for anhydrous ammonia storage, and it is the facility's policy to adhere to applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is KF's policy to notify the Wabash Fire Protection District, Mattoon Fire Department, Coles County Emergency Management Agency and/or the Coles County Sheriff's Office.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe Trilla Terminal stores anhydrous ammonia in two 30,000 ton refrigerated tanks (60,000,000 pounds per tank), and one 200 ton bullet tank (400,000 pounds). The total storage capacity of anhydrous ammonia at the facility is 120,400,000 pounds.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only toxic substance regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that is present at the Trilla Terminal in amounts above threshold quantity.  Propane is stored at the facility; however, it is used strictly as a fuel and is ther"

The terminal is subject to the Prevention Program/Program 3 requirements. \n\n\n\nPotential Release Scenarios\n\nThe facility evaluated both worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  KF's evaluation took into account process knowledge, hazard review, mitigation measures and safe-guards (i.e. dike, emergency shut-downs, etc.) in place.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention\n\nThe facility complies with EPA's chemical accident prevention rule (40 CFR 68) and applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.111 and relevant American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) standards.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nAn accidental release of anhydrous ammonia resulting in death, injuries, significant property damage, sheltering in place, or causing environmental damage on-site or off-site has not occurred within the past five years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the anhydrous ammonia system, it is the facility's policy to notify the Coles County Emergency Management Agency and request response to the emergency.  The facility has discussed this policy with the Local Emergency Planning Committee.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nCompliance audits will ensure that the level of safety protection at the terminal is periodically evaluated for improvements.\n\nAn ongoing dialogue with the Coles County Emergency Management Agency will ensure a constant state of readiness to respond to any potential emergencies, as well as a means to implement improvements as the need develops.\n\n"
