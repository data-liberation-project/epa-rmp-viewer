The process safety information is readily available to all employees and used by Facility personnel, the process hazard analysis team, and persons in charge of updating the emergency response plan.  Process safety information is readily available to all employees.  EagleHawk maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to maintain safe operations.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis and configuration.\n\n\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS).\n\n\n\nEagleHawk also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment at Blackhawk SW.  This information includes but is not limited to materials of construction, design pressure ratings, temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.

Within this program, the process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nEagleHawk primarily uses the hazard and operability analysis (HAZOP) and What-if/Checklist techniques to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of EagleHawk personnel who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise, and may include third parties.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures.  The team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are needed.  Any identified risks are promptly addressed.  Resolution of each finding is documented and records of the analyses are retained.\n\n\n\nTo ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not significantly deviate from the original design safety features, the facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years unless review is warranted sooner due to a significant change at the Facility.  Once again, the reviews are documented and records of the review are retained.\n\n\n\n    Operating Procedures\n\n\n\nBlackhawk SW maintains written procedures at the Facility that address various modes of process operations such as: (1) initial start-up; (2) normal operations; (3) temporary operations; (4) emergency shutdown;  (5) emergency operations; (6) normal shutdown; and (7) startup following a turnaround, or after an emergency shutdown.

The following types of safety features are used in the covered process: \n\n\n\nRelease Detection \n\n   Hydrocarbon (hazardous gas) detectors and alarms\n\n\n\nRelease Containment and Control\n\n   Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\n\n   Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\n\n   Automatic shutdown systems for specific process\n\n   Curbs or dikes to contain liquid releases\n\n   Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system)\n\n   Total plant emergency shutdown (ESD) system\n\n\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n   Hand-held and wheeled cart fire extinguishers \n\n   Personnel trained in emergency response and procedures\n\n   Personal protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus, etc.)\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n    \n\nEagleHawk has an excellent record of accident prevention.  There have been no large or small accidental releases resulting in injuries to site personnel or contractors, or offsite consequences at the Facility. \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program Information\n\n\n\nEagleHawk maintains written emergency procedures at the Facility to protect worker and public safety and the environment.  These include procedures for a fire or explosion and notifi"

      "SummaryText": "cation of local emergency response agencies in the event of an accidental release.  Employees are trained on the emergency procedures and the emergency procedures are updated when the process or Facility is modified.  Changes to the emergency procedures are administered through the Management of Change process.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency program for Blackhawk SW is coordinated with the DeWitt County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  Coordination includes periodic meetings to communicate the Facility operations, contact information, and response activities.  EagleHawk has 24/7 communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., DeWitt County LEPC Chairman, DeWitt County Sheriff, and Cuero Fire Department).  The LEPC would assist the Facility, as requested, to notify the public, control traffic, and facilitate response to an incident.  EagleHawk provides periodic refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated flammable substances in the Facility.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nEagleHawk tracks and resolves all PHA recommendations.  All personnel, employees, and contractors are encouraged to notify their supervisor of any changes or modifications to the Facility that could result in improved safety.  Plans to improve the safety include:  1)  Installation of additional process controls, such as tank gauges and/or alarms; and, 2)  Installation of process area detection systems.\n\n"
