The PHA involved Joseph Boyd (Director of Engineering) and Esteban Infante (Safety Coordinator) who are knowledgeable on the process.

The typical meteorological conditions used for these scenarios was a stability class D, wind speed 3.0 m/s, average air temperature , and average humidity.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n- High level of training of the operators.\n- Preventative maintenance programs.\n- Use of state-of-the-art  process and safety equipment.\nUse of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation of operators.\n- Performance of a process hazard analysis of equipment and procedures. \n- Implementation of an auditing and inspection program.\n\nISP will fully implement the RMP and will initiate appropriate changes as needed to maintain a safe operation.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no reportable releases at IWP in the past five years.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nThe RMP requires that the facility be capable of furnishing safety information regarding chemicals and equipment employed in the applicable process. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and used at the facility for the fumigation of seed. Aqueous ammonia is produced as a byproduct of the seed fumigation operation. \n\nThe anhydrous ammonia system includes one above ground storage tank ammonia pump, associated piping, hoses and valves for the transfer of ammonia from delivery trucks into the process. The Process Safety Information document contains information on Operating Limits, Equipment Specifications, SDS, Ammonia health hazards, Codes and Standards applied, Materials of construction, and Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams. \n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\nThe identification of potential hazards due to operational and system failures has been performed though the use of a Hazards and Operability (HAZOP) and What-if/checklist study.

The ammonia is stored in one bulk storage tank that is filled to 75% of capacity as an administrative limit.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling has to be performed to determine, if the substance is accidentally released, the distance the toxic substance could travel before it is concentration decreases to the toxic endpoint selected by the EPA (0.14 mg/L for anhydrous ammonia). The toxic endpoint is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the maximum airborne concentration below which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action. The residential population within a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance has to be defined, to estimate the population potentially affected.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two release scenarios for the process, identified as Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenario.\n\nThe Worst Case Release scenario at IWP involves the release of all anhydrous ammonia containing product. The total amount of anhydrous ammonia that potentially could be released would amass to approximately 95,532 pounds (lbs). The offsite consequences analysis for this scenario was performed for the following set of conditions.\n\nWhen atmospheric modeling for the WCS was performed using EPA assumptions, a distance to the toxic endpoint of 3.7 miles and an estimate of population potentially affected 41,148 persons were obtained for the release scenario.\n\nThe ARS involved the release of 14,314 pounds of anhydrous ammonia with a distance to toxic endpoint a"

      "SummaryText": "IWP utilizes anhydrous ammonia for the treatment of cottonseed. The anhydrous ammonia is combined with steam to destroy aflatoxin that may be present in cottonseed.\n\nWIWP maintains their ammonia onsite. Due to the nature of the operations, the ammonia is consumed. The ammonia is supplied by various vendors and brought in by tank truck.\n\nThe principle hazards associated with this process are the toxic and irritating effects of ammonia. Both the gas and liquid phases exist within the process . IWP uses both phases during the cottonseed treatment at the facility. Ammonia itself can cause sever irritation of the throat and irritation of the eyes and the skin on contact. Inhalation of high concentrations can cause pulmonary edema or a spasm of the larynx which can result in death. Ammonia itself is a colorless liquified compressed gas under its own vapor pressure (2327 mmHg @ 32F). The odor of the ammonia is an extremely pungent kind.\n\nIWP minimized the hazards associated with ammonia using engineering and administrative controls including the following:\n- Transfer operations occur in  open air.\n- Check valves, relief valve, manual shutoff valves, and other devices are utilized to protect the process and employees.\n- No ammonia is vented to the open air during normal operations.\n- No transfer operations are permitted unless at least two employees are present.\n- All transfer lines and valves are checked prior to each used. Leak checks are performed on all lines.\n- All process lines are evacuated with air before work is performed on any section of the system.\n- All personnel are thoroughly trained in the hazards of the operation and the proper procedures to be followed before they are allowed to work with the process.\n- An eye-wash and deluge fountain are located adjacent to the storage areas.\n\nThe Imperial Western Products (IWP) facility located in Coachella, California has implemented an accidental release prevention policy which involves a unified approach that integrat"
