              "Description": "PROCESS DESCRIPTION: \n\nChannel Chemical stores Formaldehyde 37% Solution in a 10,000 gallon stainless steel jacketed tank at atmospheric pressure.  The Formaldehyde storage tank is located within a diked concrete tank farm with recovery sumps. Formaldehyde is delivered in bulk by tanker trailers, and is offloaded through 2\" chemical hoses to the storage tank.  Displaced vapors travel through a vent line to a caustic scrubber.  For processing use in the plant, 300 gallon totes are filled from the formaldehyde tank by a 2\" discharge line with two shut-off valves.  These totes are moved by forklift and placed on scales, connected to air operated pumps, and pumped to glass-lined reactors for batch processing. \n\n\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:\n\nChannel Chemical has an RMP that follows the requirements for a Program 3 Prevention Program due to NAICS code 32599.  Specifically, the RMP includes:\n\n\n\n(Section 68.65) Process Safety Information: \n\nA compilation of written process safety information is provided for each regulated facility process to enable supervisors and employees to identify and understand the process hazards. This information is provided through process batch sheets, available SDS?s, and reminders posted in daily production schedules. \n\n\n\n(Section 68.67) Process Hazard Analysis: \n\nAs a \"toll\" or custom chemical manufacturer, Channel makes products using customer proprietary processes and raw materials.  Customer processes are developed, tested, and analyzed for hazards before being passed on to Channel.  New processes are sometimes demonstrated by customer personnel at Channel, who supervise Channel personnel running the processes until released to Channel for regular production.  The Director of Operations is responsible for regular reviews of safety and training practices, equipment safety, employee conformity to process health and safety rules, and general process procedures.  Changes are made on a regular basis or as necessary. \n\n\n\n(Section 68.69) Operating Procedures: \n\nProcess safety instructions and guidelines are provided by customers, and are reviewed with employees and made a part of Process Outlines used in making the various products.  General safety instructions are covered in the Employee Manual, and specific written instructions are made part of employee training, and provided in cases of more complicated equipment in check lists at the Operators Station.\n\n\n\n(Section 68.71) Training: \n\nAll employees (including Operators, Operator Assistants, and Helpers) that are expected to have any contact with any hazardous chemical at Channel Chemical are instructed in the safety and health hazards of those chemicals and the processes in which those chemicals will be used. The purpose of this training is for the protection of themselves, their fellow employees and the citizens of the nearby communities. Training is conducted in compliance with 1910.1200, the Hazard Communication standard.\n\n\n\n(Section 68.73) Mechanical Integrity: \n\nChannel Chemical?s mechanical integrity program involves daily visual inspections and weekly equipment reviews. This program has proven successful over the several years in use due to the company's small number of equipment pieces. It has served to ensure safe process operation.  \n\n\n\n(Section 68.75) Management of Change: \n\nTemporary and permanent changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, and facilities are managed to ensure effective process safety management. Process changes include all modifications to equipment, procedures, raw materials, and processing conditions.  As a toll manufacturer, these changes are almost always proposed and/or initiated by the customer.  They are then reviewed and authorized by both the customer and Channel's Director Of Operations prior to implementing the change.\n\n\n\n(Section 68.77) Pre-Startup Review: \n\nPrior to the start up of any new production process Channel goes through several steps to ensure a safe and confident process start up.  These steps include:\n\n1) Several ?paper? reviews of the process with the customer and their technical experts; and then an internal review with all departments at Channel. \n\n2) Prior to running a pilot batch of the new process, we have a ?roundtable? review with customer representatives on site, and then a walk through out in the plant including Channel department managers. \n\n3) We then complete a safety review out in the plant with the customer to ensure the planned equipment set up is adequate and safe for the planned production run.  \n\n\n\n(Section 68.79) Compliance Audits: \n\nChannel?s management is responsible for reviewing its audit compliance with OSHA?s process safety management standard 29 CFR 1910.119 at least once every three years. Channel conducts this review using Customer Process Managers and  Environmental Consultants.  \n\n\n\n(Section 68.81) Incident Investigation: \n\nChannel Chemical believes any incident that results in or could reasonably have resulted in a release of hazardous chemicals is a very serious matter.  Those involved in the incident are interviewed to determine why the incident took place and what can be done in the future to prevent the same incident from occurring.  When warranted, the toll customer is contacted for additional input regarding the situation.  \n\n\n\n(Section 68.83) Employee Participation: \n\nEmployee participation is a high priority at Channel Chemical.  From the \"Open Door Policy\" and \"Suggestions\" sections in Channels Employee Handbook to special strategy meetings, employees are always encouraged to provide input, concerns, suggestions, and strategy comments.  Channel is especially interested in the areas of process safety, employee health, and the protection of the environment.\n\n\n\n(Section 68.85) Hot Work Permit: \n\nChannel controls non-routine work performed in process areas in a consistent manner. The hazards identified involving the work to be accomplished is communicated to those performing the work and to operating personnel whose work could affect the safety of the process. No hot work is allowed in production areas without a authorized permit.\n\n\n\n(Section 68.87) Contractors: \n\nA basic screening process has been established for hiring contractors to perform work in and around Channel manufacturing processes that involve highly hazardous chemicals. The screening process is designed to ensure that the contractors hired or used can accomplish their assigned tasks without compromising the safety and health of employees at the facility. The screening program involves verbally obtaining information on the contractor?s experience and safety practices on similar job sites.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ",
