The safety and health of our employees is our number one priority at the plant, followed closely by the health and safety of our neighbors and the protection of the environment.\n\n\n\nTo minimize any risk to people and environment Channel follows state and federal guidelines in the storage and handling of these chemicals. Channel spill prevention policies include plant inspections every working shift, securing valves on storage vessels, and continual visual monitoring during the transfer of all chemicals. The company also maintains written emergency response plans in the event that there is a spill or accidental release. The plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n\n\n\nTHE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nChannel Chemical Corporation is located in the Bernard Bayou Industrial park in Harrison County, Mississippi. The company is located on an 11-acre parcel of land stretching between Seaway Road and Bernard Bayou. \n\n\n\nChannel handles only one chemical that is considered hazardous in quantities above threshold limits according to the List of Regulated Toxic Substances of 40CFR part 68.130. This chemical is Formaldehyde Solution 37%. The facility receives a tank truck of Formaldehyde Solution (4,900 gallons) an average of twice a month.  Channel stores a maximum of 5,000 gallons of the solution in a bulk storage tank, which is located in an outside diked storage tank farm. It also stores two or three back up totes (300 gallons each) of the solution.  \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM/CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThis manufacturing facility is in compliance with state and federal laws and programs concerning the prevention of chemical spills including SWPPP, EPA's Accidental R"

In addition, operators are well versed in the proper handling and monitoring of Formaldehyde Solution whenever it is used in a manufacturing process. All of Channel's employees receive regular training in spill prevention and spill clean up.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nAccording to the requirements of the EPA Risk Management Program, Formaldehyde Solution is the only chemical on Channel's plant site that falls within the parameters of this Risk Management Plan--meaning that the chemical is on the Hazardous Chemical List (CAA 112(r)), and that Channel stores it in a quantity above the List's \"Threshold Quantity.\"   There has been no accidental release related to Formaldehyde Solution in the past five years according to the definitions provided in 40 CFR Section 68.42.\n\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nChannel's Emergency Response Program is based on taking all actions necessary to reduce the threat of exposure to its employees, surrounding neighbors, and to the environment.  \n\nIncluded in these efforts:\n\n--Regular updates to the local fire department and local emergency response department including an updated list of chemicals stored on Channel's site, an updated map of where the chemicals are stored, and a copy of any SDS's for new chemicals stored on site are made available to them as needed.\n\n--Channel also tries to take representatives of the local fire department on tour of the plant whenever practical, and whenever requested by the local fire departments. This allows the department personnel to become familiar with the plant layout and ask questions about the plant and the chemicals stored here. It also allows Channel to get feedback from the fire department on improvements it might make to make the plant site safer or more accessible to emergency personnel. In addition, the fire department also trains Channel employees in the correct use of fire extinguishers on the plant site.\n\n--Channel e"
