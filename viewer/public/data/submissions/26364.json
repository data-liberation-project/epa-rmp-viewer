      "SummaryText": "Introduction\nCommonly called \"the Filtration Plant\" the water treatment facility at 319 Vliet Blvd. Cohoes, New York has been treating water for the citizens of the city since 1911.  The introduction of chlorine gas to be used as a disinfection agent is believed to have started the first half of the 20th century. \nThrough the years, as advances in science progressed, so has the equipment and safety practices implemented by succeeding administrators from City Hall to provide for the safest handling of this potentially dangerous chemical. Safety polices in place have provided the city with years of trouble free operation.\n\nFacility and Regulated Substance Description\nThe City of Cohoes Department of Public Works is responsible for the supply of water to Cohoes residents, a few town of Colonie residents and on an as-needed basis to the Village of Green Island.  The water source is the Mohawk River.  The intake for the pumping station, located at 100 Mohawk Street, is located in the forebay of the School Street power generating plant.  Water is pumped up to an 80 MG raw water storage reservoir located adjacent to and on the westerly side of the water treatment plant.  The Filtration Plant water is processed at an average rate of 2.2 MGD, to strict drinking water quality standards.\nOne of the treatment processes is the addition of chlorine gas for disinfection purposes.  Chlorine gas is the regulated chemical with regards to the Risk Management Plan.  Chlorine is purchased in 1 ton containers and up to 5 containers may be in storage on site at any one time.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\nThe worst case release scenario involves the failure of a fusible plug on a one ton chlorine container.  The projection is that the tank will empty in ten minutes, leaking at a rate of 200 lbs per minute.  The worst case scenario is estimated based on a release from only one container.\nAn alternate release scenario would involve a leak on a pigtail that conne"

There is only one tank in use at any given time.\nA release of these natures would involve the City of Cohoes Department of Public Works, Fire Department HASMAT Unit, CHEMTREC and chemical supplier, Jones Chemical.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Steps\nThe City of Cohoes Department of Public Works complies with the requirements set forth by its governing agencies.  The department also provides training to all employees at the Water Treatment Plant on a regular basis.  The facility is equipped with a 24 hour a day leak detection system.\n\nFive-year Accident History\nThere has been no accidental release of chlorine in the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThe chlorine Emergency Response Plan encompasses general information, plan implementing, evacuation procedures, onsite coordination, rescue and medical responsibilities.  It is reviewed by Water Treatment Operators and Fire Department HAZ MAT personnel often, to keep pace with the latest changes to plant personnel and treatment plant operating techniques.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nPlanned changes are to improve safety and to discontinue the use of chlorine gas at the water treatment facility all together and switch to a liquid Sodium Hypochlorite system.\n\nConclusion\nPlans for a new sodium hypochlorite are due to be up and running before the close of the year 2002. We will continue to provide a safe environment for employees and residents.\n\nChlorine Gas Leak\n1.Call the Fire Department at (518) 237-2211 and inform the dispatcher that you have a hazardous material accident.\n2.Contact the following:\n a.  City Engineer\t233-2131\n b.  Water Plant\t237-4320\n c.  Health Department\t447-4620\n (Albany County)\n d.  CHEMTREC\t1-800-424-9300\n e.

Review proposed clean up procedures with chemical supplier.\n9. If the source of the leak is unknown, tie a cloth around the end of a stick, soak the cloth with aqua ammonia (commercial 26 degree baume aqua ammonia) and hold close to the suspected areas.  A white cloud will result if there is any chlorine leak.  (Avoid any contact of ammonia with brass.) Do not use water on affected area.\n10.If a leak occurs in equipment or piping, the chlorine supply should be shut off and the pressure relieved before repairs are made.  If welding is necessary, purge the system with dry air before proceeding.\n11. If a leak occurs in a valve, shut off the chlorine supply and relieve the pressure in the piping before attempting to tighten the packing gland or packing gland nut.  If this does not stop the leak, the container valve should be closed.\n12. Contact the chlorine supplier: Jones chemical @ 1-888-293-8321.  Inform them of the situation and request assistance if necessary.\n13. If a chlorine leak occurs during transportation of the containers, the vehicle should be driven to an open, unpopulated area and emergency repairs should be made as soon as possible.\n14. If a vehicle transporting chlorine containers is involved in an accident, the containers should be removed from the vehicle.  If any of the containers are leaking, they should be moved to an open, unpopulated area and repaired.\n15.
