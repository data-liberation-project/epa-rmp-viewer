Ammonia is also fed to ketene furnaces to aid in the reaction.  Buildings include A-1, B-3, B-5, and 352.  This process also includes railcar storage. There has been an increase in railcar storage which is represented in the covered process quantity.\r\n\r\nProcess 2\r\nG-10 Agile Manufacturing - Ammonia, nitric acid, and oleum are stored in the tank farm adjacent to buildings G-10 and G-10A for the manufacture of specialty explosives.  \r\n\r\nProcess 3\r\nProduction of a Nitric Acid/Ammonium Nitrate Mixture - The ammonium nitrate is produced by introducing ammonia into strong nitric acid.  The resulting mixture is used in the manufacture of explosives.  The production buildings include 330 and 320.  The ammonia is stored in tank farm 301 and the strong nitric acid is stored in tank farm 320.  Both ammonia and nitric acid are supplied by railcar. There has been an increase in railcar storage which is represented in the covered process quantities.\r\n\r\nProcess 4\r\nNitration process - Nitric acid is stored in the tank farm adjacent to building G-8 for use in the manufacture of insensitive explosives.\r\n\r\nProcess 5\r\nNitric Acid and Sulfuric Acid Concentration unit for reuse of an internal nitric acid stream or concentration of purchased weak nitric acid.

It was built in 1942 to produce RDX (cyclotrimethylene-trinitramine) and HMX (cyclotetramethylene-tetranitramine) based explosives for the Joint Munitions Command (JMC) of the US Army. In 1999, BAE SYSTEMS Ordnance Systems Inc. (OSI) became the operating contractor. While continuing to produce RDX and HMX based explosives, HSAAP has been dev"

Insensitive munitions are less likely to detonate during handling when exposed to unexpected conditions such as heat, shock, and impact. \r\n\r\nAccident Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nHSAAP has had an excellent safety record over the past 77 years and strives to maintain this outstanding record.  HSAAP maintains an on-site emergency response team but also has long standing agreements and coordination with local emergency planning units including Sullivan County LEPCs and the City of Kingsport.\r\n\r\nOSI's Safety & Health Policy is based on the concept of Total Employee Involvement. This concept recognizes that all personnel have a shared responsibility for the prevention of accidents, damage, or loss from any controllable source. In addition, senior management at HSAAP is committed to environmental stewardship, safety, and emergency preparedness. This commitment has been demonstrated through development and implementation of an Environmental Policy Statement and a Safety & Health Policy. Additionally, OSI pursued and obtained ISO 14001 certification for its Environmental Management System in November 2006 and has maintained this certification through surveillance and recertification audits. OSI pursued and obtained ISO 18001 certification in August 2009 for its Occupational Health and Safety Management System and has also maintained this certification through surveillance and recertification audits. HSAAP has been identified as a Center of Excellence by third party auditors.\r\nThe Safety Manager sends out monthly updates on workplace safety statistics and encourages safe practices through active employee communications. Incidents and near misses are investigated, and information is shared with all personnel to help prevent similar occurrences.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nManufactu"

      "SummaryText": "ring of RDX and HMX explosives requires the use of concentrated nitric acid and anhydrous ammonia; two listed substances under the Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations. HSAAP has four nitric acid tank farms and two anhydrous ammonia tank farms. A smaller anhydrous ammonia tank exists at the agile manufacturing facility with the storage quantity below the threshold. However, this chemical is included in the covered process description because it is also treated as a Program Level 3 chemical by OSI. Additionally, oleum, another listed substance under the RMP regulations, is stored in one tank at the agile manufacturing facility above the threshold quantity.  The oleum is used as a dehydrating agent in the manufacturing process. \r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release & Chemical-Specific Prevention Programs\r\n\r\nIn addition to the RMP, HSAAP is subject to OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) and other related emergency response rules and regulations. Since HSAAP manufactures explosives most processes are Program Level 3 under PSM rules. Safe reliable production of explosives depends on an effectively implemented safety program. Elements of HSAAP's PSM include: process safety information management, process hazard analyses, standard operating procedures, proper training, mechanical integrity checks, Change Management, Pre Start-up reviews, compliance audits, incident investigations, employee participation, hot work permitting, and contractor oversight.\r\n\r\nPersonnel are trained annually on emergency response and hazard communication. Other safety-related topics are assigned based on each employee's job duties. Standard operating procedures are reviewed annually for completeness with required updates every five years or when a process change occurs that affects the procedure. Process Hazard Analysis studies are conducted for RMP or OSHA-covered new processes or changes to existing processes or on any other process deemed necessary by the Safety Manager.

Management of Change procedures are followed for changes to equipment or operating procedures.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia, nitric acid, and oleum areas utilize a variety of technologies to prevent accidental chemical releases including the following:  dikes, deluge systems, detection monitoring, process control alarms, automatic shutoffs, and annual training. Training is very important at HSAAP. This is evident as third party auditors have recognized HSAAP's training program as a best practice among similar facilities across the U.S. OSI also utilizes a sophisticated facility-wide notification system with voice command capabilities to alert employees and the public in the event of a hazardous vapor release.\r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History\r\n\r\nHSAAP had two incidents involving strong nitric acid and none involving ammonia during the five-year period.  Each incident was below the reportable quantity but resulted in OSHA recordable injuries.  These incidents involved the disconnection of flexible hoses while they held residual pressure. Incident investigations and the resulting follow-up actions have been completed to prevent further incidents and releases. There was a recent incident involving a PSM covered process at HSAAP. This process is not an RMP covered process and there are no RMP covered chemicals stored at this location, which is why it is not included in the 5-yr accident history. The incident, which occurred on 3 JAN 2019 resulted in a fire and an explosion at the facility. There were two OSHA recordables associated with this incident, one from smoke inhalation and a preventative steroid was administered to a second individual. There were no other injuries and no offsite impacts. The facilities at HSAAP are sited at safe distances to ensure protection of personnel and the public and to prevent propagation to adjacent processes. The incident investigation has been very thorough and is still underway.\r\n\r\nEmergency Respons"

The Incident Command System (ICS) is a set of preplanned assignments and job subdivisions implemented to reduce confusion in handling the emergency. The priorities of the system are: (1) safety of employees and responders, (2) safety of others in and around the area, (3) scene stabilization, and (4) property and environmental conservation. All personnel required to respond to an emergency or remain at an emergency scene are considered emergency response personnel for the duration of the emergency. This system was proven effective during the 3 JAN 2019 incident.\r\n\r\nICS includes coordination with local emergency planning units including Sullivan County LEPCs and the City of Kingsport. To support this relationship an annual emergency training drill is held in conjunction with all other contract employees onsite and local emergency responders. Furthermore, HSAAP has a fully manned and trained onsite fire department with HAZMAT capabilities that responds to all types of emergencies.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nHSAAP continues to strive to modernize the facility and to constantly improve health, safety, and security through the use of the best available technology and work practices. As previously mentioned, HSAAP maintains a certified Occupational Health and Safety Management System in compliance with ISO 18001. HSAAP is evaluating the use of smaller ammonia tanks. This should reduce potential offsite impacts from ammonia storage and delivery. These tanks would be filled by tanker truck, eliminating the need to bring an ammonia railcar on-site, which is currently the largest quantity stored onsite. The nitric acid alternative releases only resulted in offsite impacts when the scenario includes release outside of the diked area. The tanks and transfer pumps all have dikes to provide passive"
