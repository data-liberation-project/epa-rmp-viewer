      "SummaryText": "This is to inform all interested person, including employees that Cargill Value Added Meats is complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard (called Process Safety Management or PSM), Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, and EPA's Risk Management Program regulations (called RM Program), Title 40 CFR 68, to deal with risk involved with storage, handling, and processing of hazardous chemicals. In this way we promote overall plant, worker, and public safety. These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid physical property damage. Our EHS Programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, and manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities. Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could ne involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process. Our EHS programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment. These rules are detailed and improved as necessary. They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility. Anhydrous Ammonia is used as a refrigerant at Cargill Value Added Meats. Mechanical refrigeration is a thermodynamic process rather than a chemical process. Ammonia, the refrigerant is used as a heat transfer media to maintain a desired temperature in an enclosed environment. The refrigeration cycle consists of four processes: evaporation, condensation, compression, and expansion. Evaporation and condensation are designed to alter the quantity of energy associated with the refrigeran"

      "SummaryText": "t. Compression and expansion are designed to change the availability of the associated energy. The ammonia refrigeration cycle is in a closed system utilizing fluid temperature, pressure, and latent heat of vaporization must be applied to the liquid. Cargill Value Added Meats utilizes the ammonia refrigeration system for keeping plant processing areas at a constant temperature, preserving product, chilling water, and making ice. Since Cargill Value Added Meats exceeds the threshold quantity for ammonia, we will comply with a Program 3 prevention program. This will help to provide a safer environment for employees and the community, plus make the refrigeration system more efficient. All elements of the prevention program have been implemented. Cargill Value Added Meats emergency response program is based on the OSHA requirements for Emergency Response Plans (20 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120). We have trained employees for emergency response and maintain a written emergency response plan. This plan is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Waco Fire Department. We conduct annual drills for implementation of the emergency response plan at the facility with the participation of the LEPC and fire department."
