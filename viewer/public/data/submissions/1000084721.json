The stationary source is Brewster Cheese located at 675 Wabash Ave. S. Brewster, OH 44613. The only RMP regulated substance in this facility is anhydrous ammonia, which is classified as a toxic substance, liquefied under pressure. The refrigeration system in this facility does not meet the requirements of Program 1. It is subject to OSHA's PSM standard. Therefore, this RMP is written to meet the EPA Program 3 level of compliance.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees that Brewster Cheese is complying with OSHA Process Safety Management Standard (called Process Safety Management or PSM), Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, and EPAs Risk Management Program regulations (called RMP Program), Title 40 CFR Part 68, also Brewster Cheese Corporate Safety Policies, to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and processing of hazardous chemicals. In this way we promote overall plant, worker, and public safety. These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\r\n\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Process Safety Management, and safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities. Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they foc"

They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nBrewster Cheese has two systems that are separated by state route 93. Our Westside system is used for process. The Westside system is under the 10,000 pound threshold and is used this to cool product and dehumidify air. This RMP submittal is for the Eastside system (Warehouse). The Eastside (Warehouse) is used to finish the process of making cheese, mostly Swiss. We use this system to operate the Evaporators (21 units). In this engine room we have one Receiver, two Accumulators, three Transfer Tanks; four Screw Compressors, and two Evaporator Condensers. The Warehouse system uses approximately 10,800 lbs of NH3.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Brewster plant has developed an OSHA PSM program for our ammonia refrigeration system. Ammonia falls under the RMP Program 3 prevention program, which is similar to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program. EPA has said that if the process is subject to OSHA PSM, then it is subject to RMP Program 3. Thus, the Brewster facility's ammonia PSM program also meets the requirements for the RMP document.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are several aspects of the prevention program that are key:\r\n\r\na.) Since most of the pipe work is out of the way of people and the machinery, there is less of a chance of an ammonia release.\r\n\r\nb.) The plant maintains good training, certification and employee awareness of operating procedures.\r\n\r\nc.) The plant has developed a strong preventive maintenance and inspection program.\r\n\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThis facility emergency response program is based on the OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120).
