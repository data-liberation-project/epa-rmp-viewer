The air-cooling evaporators receive liquid from the high temperature recirculator. The evaporators contain a set of continuous coils through which the low pressure liquid flows. Due to the low pressures and temperatures maintained in the evaporator, the liqu"

In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Central City Cooling's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\r\nCentral City Cooling has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\r\n\r\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Central City Cooling has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\r\n\r\nFor the future, Central City Cooling now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a living document. It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Central City Cooling employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Central City Cooling will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety."

The EPCS consists of a crossover solenoid valve which connects the high stage discharge (HSD) pipe to the high temperature suction (HTS) pipe. The EPCS operates as follows: \r\nEPCS is activated at not greater than 90% pressure relief valve setting (e.g. 270 psig or less) [ANSI/IIAR 2-2014 Appendix I.4.5.3] \r\nUpon activation, all compressors are stopped by a means that is independent of all other safety controls [ANSI/IIAR 2-2014 Appendix I.4.5.6] \r\nUpon activation, crossover solenoid valve is opened [ANSI/IIAR 2-2014 Appendix I.4.5.6] \r\nUpon activation, a signal is provided to personnel responsible for refrigeration system maintenance [ANSI/IIAR 2-2014 Appendix I.4.5.7] \r\nEPCS remains active until manually reset [ANSI/IIAR 2-2014 Appendix I.4.5.8]\r\nEPCS crossover isolation valves are locked open [ANSI/IIAR 2-2014 Appendix I.4.4.2] \r\n\r\nRelief Valves\r\nAll ASME pressure vessels and positive displacement compressors are equipped with relief valves designed to relieve pressure and protect the equipment from rupturing. Details regarding the relief valves are summarized below:\r\nEach relief valve has a set pressure equal to or less than the MAWP of the equipment that the relief valve protects;\r\nEach relief valve has a capacity which meets or exceeds the requirement of ANSI/IIAR 2-2014 Addendum A \u00a715.3.8;\r\nAll relief valves are connected to a common manifold which terminates into the ammonia diffusion tank;\r\n\r\nDiffusion Tank\r\nThe refrigeration system is equipped with an ammonia diffusion tank which mitigates most of the hazards associated with a relief valve lifting. The relief valve discharge piping is terminated at the bottom of the ammonia diffusion tank. The ammonia diffusion tank is 8' dia. x 16' high (6,000 gallon capacity). A"

Under normal conditions, the ammonia diffusion tank contains water.\r\n\r\nScrew Compressor Safety Devices\r\nEach screw compressor has numerous safety devices to protect the compressor and the associated equipment. The following list summarizes the safety devices built into each screw compressor package:\r\nHigh Discharge Pressure Cutout - The high discharge pressure cutout, will shut down the compressor if the discharge pressure equals or exceeds the setpoint.\r\nLow Suction Pressure Cutout - The low suction pressure cutout will shut down the compressor if the suction pressure is equal to or less than the setpoint.\r\nOil Pressure Cutout - The oil pressure cutout will shut down the compressor if the oil pressure equals or deviates below the setpoint.\r\nHigh Oil Temperature Cutout - The high oil temperature cutout will shut down the compressor if the oil temperature equals or exceeds the setpoint.\r\nLow Oil Temperature Cutout - The low oil temperature cutout will shut down the compressor if the oil temperature equals or falls below the setpoint.\r\nDischarge Temperature Cutout - The high discharge temperature cutout will shut down the compressor if the discharge temperature equals or exceeds the setpoint.\r\n\r\nHigh Level Float Switch\r\nThe high temperature recirculator, low temperature recirculator, and medium suction accumulator are equipped with a high level float switch that is wired to shut down the compressors in the event of a high liquid level in the vessel.

Under normal conditions, the vacuum tube chiller contains low pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nMedium Suction Accumulator\r\nThe purpose of the medium suction accumulator is to subcool the high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver. This subcooled liquid is sent to the high temperature recirculator and vacuum tube chillers. In addition, it prevents liquid from entering the compressors. The medium suction accumulator receives vapor from the surge drums and separates any residual liquid from the vapor to allow only the vapor to be piped to the suction of each compressor. The medium suction accumulator is equipped with a high level float switch that is wired to shut down the compressors in the event of a high level situation. This prevents liquid ammonia from entering the compressors. Under normal conditions, the main suction accumulator contains low pressure vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nCompressors\r\nThe purpose of the compressors is to raise the temperature and pressure of the low pressure gas in order to reject the heat absorbed in the evaporator to the atmosphere. The compressors receive low pressure vapor from the medium suction accumulator or recirculator and discharge high pressure vapor to the evaporative condensers. The compressors are equipped with high discharge pressure cutouts to shut the equipment off if the pressure exceeds the setpoint. Under normal conditions, the compressors contain both high and low pressure vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nEvaporative Condensers\r\nThe purpose of the evaporative condensers is to reject the heat absorbed in the evaporators to the atmosphere. The evaporative condensers receive high pressure, superheated vapor from the compressors and supply high pressure liquid to the high pressure receiver. The condensers use air and water to cool the warm ammonia as it passes through a series of tubes within the condenser. As the c"

Under normal conditions, the evaporative condensers contain high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nAuto-Purger\r\nThe purpose of the auto-purger is to remove non-condensable gases from the system without requiring the system to be manually opened. The auto-purger consists of the following components: water bubbler, foul gas line, liquid line, suction line, water line, drain line, and remote purge point solenoid valves. The auto-purger removes non-condensable gases by refrigerating the foul gas so that the ammonia vapor condenses to liquid and can be returned to the system. The non-condensable gases are removed from the system through the water bubbler. Under normal conditions, the auto-purger contains small quantities of ammonia and water. \r\n\r\n1.2.5 Safety Systems\r\n\r\nAmmonia Detection System\r\nThe detection system is interlocked with the refrigeration system controls as follows:\r\nTwo (2) ammonia detectors are installed within the machinery room;\r\nIf the ammonia concentration exceeds 25 ppm, visual alarms will be initiated outside the machinery room; in addition, exhaust fan 1 will be activated;\r\nIf the ammonia concentration exceeds 125 ppm, exhaust fan 2 will be activated;\r\nIf the ammonia concentration exceeds 150 ppm, audible alarms will be initiated outside the machinery room;\r\nIf the ammonia concentration exceeds 5,000 ppm, the refrigeration machinery inside the machinery room will be de-energized;\r\nAn ammonia detector is installed in each refrigerated docks/rooms;\r\nIf the ammonia concentration exceeds 25 ppm, visual alarms will be initiated;\r\nIf the ammonia concentration exceeds 35 ppm, audible alarms will be initiated;\r\nAt each level, the ammonia detection system is interlocked with an automatic dialing system which sends an email and text messages out to facility management.

During these meetings we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\r\n\r\nCentral City Cooling has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release.
