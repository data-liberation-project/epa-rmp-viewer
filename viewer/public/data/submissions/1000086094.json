      "SummaryText": "Standard Hemp in 2019 purchased an existing Agricultural Cold Storage facility to dry and process Hemp. In 2021 the corporate name is changing to People's Farming, LLC. Staff and operation remains mainly the same. The facility originally had 2 separate mechanical rooms, Cold Storage buildings and refrigeration systems since they were used at different times of the year for different Agricultural products. Now both buildings are used for Hemp processing at the same time, so connecting the 2 smaller rooms to the main refrigeration system is more cost effective than updating the older equipment room. The Minor change is being done with an MOC process. All of the equipment in the older mechanical room will be disconnected permanently. There is plenty of capacity in the Main refrigeration system for the small addition. The NH3 refrigerant was transferred to the main system in March 2020 with demo and new piping to be completed in 90 days. The Worst Case and Alternate Case were not effected by eliminating the much smaller process. The Risk Management Program at People's Farming, LLC complies with US EPA and Cal ARP requirements.\n\n\n\nThe procedures for complying with the RM Program regulations are outlined by the following major steps:\n\n1.    Identify Covered Processes\n\n2.    Determine Program Level\n\n3.    Establish a Management System\n\n4.    Conduct a 5-year Accident History\n\n5.    Perform Hazard Assessments\n\n6.

Prepare a Risk Management Plan (RMP)\n\n\n\nPublication or sharing of OCA portions of RMP materials can be in violation of the Chemical Safety Information, Site Security and Fuels Regulatory Relief Act (PL106-40). \n\n\n\n1.

It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities revolve around processing and storage of tree fruit.  This activity is consistent with SIC 0723/ NAICS 115114 post harvest crop activities. Anhydrous ammonia is the major regulated substance present at our facility.  The entire ammonia inventory is attributed to use as a refrigerant. Ammonia (anhydrous) is used as a refrigerant in a closed loop refrigeration system. \n\n\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario mandated by the RMP Rule is a standardized hypothetical situation intended to promote \"dialogue\". According to the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration \"The worst-case situation represents an extremely improbable (and for many facilities impossible) set of circumstances rather than a credible accident scenario. Release quantities and hazard distances derived there from for the worst-case scenario should not be used as a basis for emergency response planning.\"\n\n\n\nTo evaluate the worst case and alternative release scenarios for ammonia we have used the methodology given in the Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration by SAIC.  To perform the required offsite consequence analyses for other substances we have used.  Details are not provided in the Executive Summary. An alternate case scenario has also been evaluated and included. \n\n\n\n\n\n4.

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What if /Checklist.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner and less than 2.5 years unless coordinated with the UPA.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, People's Farming, LLC. maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nPeople's Farming, LLC has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nPeople's Farming, LLC carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.
