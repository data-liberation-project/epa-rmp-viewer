      "SummaryText": "The International Paper Mill at Franklin, Virginia is committed to operating in a manner than provides for the safety of its employees and neighbors and for the protection of the environment. A key element of this commitment is the safe and proper handling of chemicals. The mill implements controls to prevent accidents or releases of hazardous substances. In the event of an accidental release, mitigation steps are taken to contain, control and stop the release.\n\nThe mill is an integrated pulp and paper manufacturing facility located on 1371 acres of property in the southwestern corner of Isle of Wight County, Virginia. One substance, chlorine dioxide, is utilized at the site to bleach pulp. This substance is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions.        \n\nInternational Paper is committed to continuously improve the safety of its processes. One example of this commitment is the elimination of the use of elemental chlorine for bleaching, which was implemented in April 2001. Additionally, ongoing activities, including training, process hazard analysis, and auditing, are used to identify ways to continually improve the operation of these processes.\n\nAs required by the Risk Management Planning rule, worst case and alternative release scenarios were analyzed. The worst case scenario is prescribed by the rule. For this site, it is an instantaneous spill of entire contents of one of the two 130,000 gallon chlorine dioxide storage tanks. The solution would spill into a 1 centimeter deep puddle and evaporate quickly due to high volatility of chlorine dioxide. Alternative releases must also be reviewed. \n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine dioxide is a gasket leak at a pump discharge. This would result in a release of 220 pounds of chlorine dioxide in 20 minutes. Mitigation measures considered in this scenario were emergency shutdown systems.\n\nEach of these release scenarios has potential off-site consequences. For the alternative r"
