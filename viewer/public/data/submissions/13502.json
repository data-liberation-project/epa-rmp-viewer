The process is regulated by Cal OSHA Process Safety Management of Acutely Hazardous Materials, Title 8 California Code of Regulations 5189 and 19 California Code of Regulations 2735 California Accidental Release Prevention Program.  This is a RMP/CalARP Program Level 3 facility.  The facility has developed a prevention program described below.\n\nThe Bakersfield Terminal has a commitment to employee and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.  \n\nThe prevention program exceeds the requirements of this regulation and includes the following: Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor Evaluation, Contractors and Visitor Orientation, Pre-Job Start-Up Review, Mechanical Integrity, Code of Safe Work Practices (Hot Work Permit, Confined Space Entry, Control of Hazardous Energy), Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Emergency Planning and Response, and Compliance Audits. \n\nTraining includes employee responsibilities in the process safety management program, National Propane Gas Association-certified employee training program, hotwork permit procedure, code of safe work practices, and operating procedures.  All visitors onto the property must undergo a site safety orientation and check in prior to each visit. Planned changes to improve safety have been established based on compliance with the process safety management audits and revalidation of the process hazard analysis. The last process hazard analysis was May 1999. \n\nThe facility receives, stores and dis"

There are 30 tanks with a capacity of approximately 40,000 gallons and 5 tanks with a capacity of approximately 32,000 gallons.  The tanks are administratively controlled to hold liquefied petroleum gas or natural gasoline at 85% maximum capacity, 34,000 gallons and 27,200 gallons respectively.  \n\nCoast Energy Group maintains an emergency response plan in compliance with local emergency response agencies.  The Bakersfield Terminal has a Hazardous Materials Business Plan on file with the Kern County Environmental Health Department - Certified Unified Program Agency.  The facility maintains an air pollution control district permit to operate with the San Joaquin Valley Unified Air Pollution Control District.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the facility operators are trained to sound the alarm, shut off the source from a safe location or activate one of the emergency shutdown devices, contact 9-1-1 and secure the area.  The 9-1-1 system is used to notify the Fire Department.\n\nBased on the criteria set forth 40 CFR 68.10 and 19 CCR 2735.4, this facility has not had an accidental release.  This information was verified by reviewing records from the Kern County Environmental Health Department - Certified Unified Program Agency.\n\nThe worst case release scenario is based on a version of the Baker-Strehlow vapor cloud explosion model created by Quest Consultants, Inc.  The worst case release simulation of 181,442 pounds of natural gasoline resulted in a 1 psi explosion overpressure distance of 0.1 miles.  This simulation assumed medium fuel reactivity, medium obstruction and a 3-dimensional expansion. This distance impacts public receptors of an adjacent farm and a resident population of 6.  In addition, although there are numerous controls in place, none were taken into account for evaluating the worst case scenario.  The alternative release scenario for this process is a hose rupture while pumping natura"

      "SummaryText": "l gasoline.  This scenario was modeled using CANARY by Quest Consultants, Inc. which includes a momentum jet (Ooms) and heavy gas model (SLAB) appropriate for simulating this type of release.  This scenario assumed the pump continued to operate at a rate of 255 gallons per minute (gpm) for 10 minutes after the hose ruptured.  In addition, a 3 meter/second wind speed, an atmospheric stability of \"D\" (neutrally buoyant), a 70% relative humidity and an ambient temperature of 1000F were assumed.  The simulation calculated that 13,270 pounds of material were released in the assumed time frame.  The resulting simulated vapor cloud traveled 0.06 miles downwind to reach the lower flammable limit (LFL) for the natural gasoline (1.38%).  Mitigation measures were taken into account when selecting the alternative release scenario. This consisted of reviewing the use of relief valves, check valves, manual shutoff valves, automatic shutoffs, startup and operating procedures, grounding equipment, and excess flow devices.  The facility operator and truck driver are also in attendance during transfer operations.\n\nThe engineering and administrative controls in place have been established to reduce the risk of an accidental release of identified hazards.  Coast Energy Group is committed to operations which are safe for employees and the surrounding community."
