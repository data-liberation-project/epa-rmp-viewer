As a reflection of our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations, we submit this plan to address the hazards inherent with the use of arsine, hydrogen sulfide, chlorine, and hydrogen selenide.  Our program addresses safety precautions regarding the handling and operation of these covered systems as well as proper training for those who operate and maintain the chemicals. The company training policy requires that all employees will be properly trained for a job position before assignment to that job.\n\n\n\nMatheson Tri-Gas, Inc. senior management is not only committed to offer superior service, but to also maintain a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  Matheson Tri-Gas, Inc's safety and environmental policies are administered by the Plant Manager with the assistance of Corporate Environmental Compliance.  Periodic inspections of the facility are conducted to ensure compliance and to oversee the entire safety and environmental programs.  These programs include various safety programs, the Emergency Response Plan, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nMatheson Tri-Gas, Inc. manufactures industrial grade gases and transfills into compressed gas cylinders of varying s.  The business is located at 1700 Sceptor Road in Waverly, Tennessee.\n\n\n\nARSINE\n\n?    Covered Process: Arsine Storage\n\nOnce the Arsine is trans-filled from the cryogenic vessels to the cylinders, the arsine cylinders are moved and located at the Arsine Storage Area until shipment for a customer is requested.  Due to the amount of Arsine cylinders stored at an individual time in a specified area, the Arsine Storage does meet regulated threshold quantities.\n\n\n\nHYDROGEN SULFIDE\n\n?    Covered Proce"

Currently the Matheson Tri-Gas New Johnsonville facility purchases Hydrogen Sulfide from a vendor, where it is stored onsite in cylinders until distribution to customers.\n\n\n\nHYDROGEN SELENIDE\n\n?    Covered Process: Hydrogen Selenide Storage\n\nThe Matheson Tri-Gas New Johnsonville facility also contains a Hydrogen Selenide Fill Process.  The Fill Process is completed in a batch process, where raw materials are reacted to create Hydrogen Selenide.  The Hydrogen Selenide product is placed into cylinders which are stored until a customer order.\n\n\n\nCHLORINE\n\n?    Covered Process: Chlorine Storage and Purification\n\nThe Matheson Tri-Gas facility fills chlorine ton containers to various purity grades. Commercial grade liquid chlorine is received in ton containers. Once the containers arrive at the facility they are offloaded and placed in the designated storage area used until needed for purification. As receiving tons are filled they are carted back to the storage area. \n\n\n\nChlorine is processed in Building 210 and chlorine ton containers are kept outside of Building 210. When chlorine ton containers are ordered, they are transferred to Building 200 for pickup.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Matheson Tri-Gas, Inc. facility has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.  \n\n\n\nIn addition, Matheson Tri-Gas, Inc. has developed a preventive maintenance program in which each cylinder/ton container is inspected upon delivery. All cylinder maintenance is performed in house by Matheson Tri-Gas, Inc. employees. Each cylinder is equipped with a fusible relief plug which protects the equipment from overpress"

To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n  3.) To protect the environment.\n\n  4.) To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, chemical health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  \n\n\n\nMatheson Tri-Gas, Inc. personnel circulate throughout the facility, taking note of unusual conditions. In the event that a chemical leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will alert any personnel in the immediate area who are unaware of the danger and the Matheson Tri-Gas, Inc. management.\n\nManagement will determine what procedures and personnel are necessary to remedy the problem. Emergency agencies will also be notified as necessary as outlined in the Emergency Response Plan.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no significant releases of regulated substances from covered processes over the past five years (October 2007 - October 2012) that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantities for each of the chemicals.  In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from a release of a regulated substance.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Process Hazards Analysis, including a Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study and a facility inspection, provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the Matheson Tri-Gas, Inc. facility. The studies were completed separately based on the chemical:\n\n\n\nMatheson Tri-Gas, Inc. management is planning to complete several items over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for "
