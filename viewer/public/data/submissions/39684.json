      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - Westside Facility - Sutter Home Winery, Inc.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nSutter Home Winery, Inc. has established a Risk Management Plan according to EPA's regulations (40 CFR Part 68) for the Ammonia Refrigeration System at its Westside Facility to enhance its already existing safety programs.  Sutter Home is extremely cautious in the handling of all chemicals and is very diligent about safety for its employees and its communities.  Sutter Home staff is highly trained and utilizes modern equipment to provide safeguards.  The Ammonia Refrigeration System, that contains the regulated substance anhydrous ammonia, is used for chilling wine and for cooling down wine storage tanks and maintaining them at a cold temperature.  \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nSutter Home has an emergency response plan in effect to handle potential emergency situations at this facility.  This plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nKey elements of the Emergency Response Plan include key phone numbers and contact points, plans for evacuation, fire, injury, earthquake, hazardous material spill, and ammonia health hazards \n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe Ammonia System Refrigeration System at the Westside Facility is a single stage system comprised of 3 compressors, one evaporative condenser, one high pressure receiver, one pumped recirculator, two wine flooded wine chillers and piping and valves that serve jacketed wine tanks.  Vaporization of ammonia at different points of the system provides the needed cooling effect.  \n\nLiquid ammonia is pumped from the recirculator to various tank jackets and wine chillers.  By controlled vaporization of liquid ammonia the desired cooling effect is obtained.  Vaporization is achieved by either passing the liquid ammonia through a narrow passage (an expansion v"

      "SummaryText": "alve) or by controlling the pressure (which in turn controls the vaporization rate) of a flooded heat exchanger .  From these loads ammonia vapor (which often is mixed with liquid ammonia) returns to the recirculator.  The recirculator acts as a separator.  The liquid from the returned ammonia accumulates at the bottom of the recirculator, from where the pumps take suction.  The vapor in the upper part of the recirculator gets drawn by the compressors.\n\nThe compressors pressurize ammonia vapors considerably.  In this process the ammonia gas heats up as well.  The discharge of the compressors passes through the evaporative condenser, where cold water on the external side of the cooling tubes, causes the ammonia temperature to drop below its condensation point and causes the ammonia gas to turn into liquid.  The liquid from the evaporative condenser collects in the high-pressure receiver.  \n\nAs the refrigeration system operates the liquid level in the recirculator drops.  The lost ammonia is replenished by the liquid in the high-pressure receiver.  The level switches on the recirculator cause the automatic control valves to open and allow liquid ammonia, which is at higher pressure in the receiver than the pressure in the recirculator, to open and make-up the ammonia taken by the compressors.\n\nAmmonia refrigeration system is equipped with many safety features.  System control is achieved primarily by local automatic control units that control liquid level, temperature and pressure.  The compressors are equipped with shutoff mechanisms based on pressure (high and low) and temperature.  All relief valves discharge into a water diffusion tank, where ammonia is absorbed into water to minimize accidental atmospheric discharges. \n\nThe system is controlled automatically and under normal conditions there is little need for the operators to intervene with the operation of the system.  The operators, however, check the system periodically and provide the needed test, inspection"

All elements of the system are subjected to a periodic inspection, testing and preventative maintenance program.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nSutter Home Winery, Inc. has implemented a Process Safety Management (PSM) program at the Westside Facility to manage the safety aspects of the Ammonia Refrigeration System.  The program includes strict requirements for written operating procedures, personnel training, contractor safety, equipment maintenance, incident investigation, process hazard analysis, management of change and periodic review or audit of program elements.  Management of change element addresses proper implementation of system updates to ensure that all changes are reviewed properly by knowledgeable persons, all engineering documents and operating procedures reflect the change, and personnel are trained on the change.   Process Safety Management also requires a pre-startup safety review to ensure that the system is properly reviewed before it is put back into service after a major change.  \n\nIn addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices outlined by industry sources.  \n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThe five-year accident history (July 1999 to July 2004) for the Westside Facility reveals have been no reportable releases of ammonia at the facility in the past 5 years that had lead to an injury, fatality or environmental impact.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSeveral process and management system improvements are being considered and implemented as a result of the technical studies done in the course of the development of the PSM and RMP Programs.  The main focus of the improvements is on issues recommended to be included in the operating and maintenance procedures and specific tests, inspection and maintenance activities to be conducted as part of the mechanical in"
