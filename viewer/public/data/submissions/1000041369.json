The TDI is delivered to the site in a bulk tanker and pumped directly into the storage tank. The storage tank is located in a self-contained, two hour fire rated room with one four foot by seven foot fire door located three and one half feet above the floor level. The room serves as a diked area and will contain more than 40,000 lb. of spilled TDI.\n\n\n\nIn calculating the worst-case release scenario, it is assumed that the TDI storage tank ruptures and 40,000 lb. of TDI are released into the contained area. The total surface area of liquid exposed to the room is 178 square feet and the only point of release to the rest of the building and the atmosphere is through the 4'x7' fire door. The model used for calculating the distance to the toxic endpoint is taken from Chapter 12 of\n\n\"Risk Management Program Guidance For Chemical Distributors (40 CFR Part 68\").\n\n\n\nAn active preventative maintenance program is carried out, specifically weekly checks of pumps, valves, piping and storage tank. These checks are entered into a log book. Safety training on the handling and emergency response to accidental releases of TDI are performed regularly with all production employees. Manufacturers and suppliers of TDI visit our facility to perform training on the the safe handling and response to accidental releases of TDI.\n\n\n\nThere has been no releases of TDI in the past five years.\n\n\n\nOur emergency response program is on file with:   ATTN : TRICIA SMITH\n\n\n\n          Oakland County Emergency Response Manager, LEPC\n\n          1200 North Telegraph Road\n\n          Pontiac MI 48341\n\n          (248)858-5300 OR 248-858-5371\n\n\n\n          Mr. Jeffrey Key\n\n          Orion Township Fire Chief, Station No. 2\n\n          200 East Silverbell Road\n\n          Lake Orion MI 48359\n\n          (248)693 - 9701  OR 911 FOR EMERGENCY\n\n\n\nSafety training and preventative maintenance programs continue to ensur"
