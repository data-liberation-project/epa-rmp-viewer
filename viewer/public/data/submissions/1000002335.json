      "SummaryText": " 801 Dye Mill Road, Troy, Ohio. The main building houses a processing plant used for mixing, cooking, conveying, freezing, and packaging. The processed products require refrigeration for processing and storage. Anhydrous ammonia is the primary refrigerant used. There are two ammonia refrigeration systems completely separate from each other. The systems are approximately 350 feet apart. The Engine Room #1 is located in the south-central area of the building. This is the original refrigeration system. It contains approximately 10,763 pounds of ammonia. The other system which was brought on line in 1997 is called the Engine Room #2 which is located in the northeast corner of the facility building. It contains approximately 18,183 pounds of ammonia.\n\n4. Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios: RMP*Comp was used to calculate the worst case and alternative release scenarios for the both processes. One worst-case for both processes and one alternative case for each process have been considered.\n\n5. Five Year Accident History: There have been no reportable incidents or accidents during the past five years.\n"
