EPA requires regulated facilities to submit Risk Management Plans describing the risk management program at its facilities. This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management system at the Columbus Mill.  \n\n\n\nAccidental release and emergency response policy:\n\n\n\nTo protect the environment and the health and safety of our employees and the public, we expect full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. The facility's emphasis on accident prevention is demonstrated by having one of the lowest Recordable Injury Rates in the industry, being among the first pulp & paper facilities in the United States to achieve OSHA Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) Star status and through emphasis on continuous improvement in its safety programs. \n\n\n\nThe emergency response program has a trained emergency response team with equipment for responding to on-site fires, hazardous material releases, emergency medical response and rescue. The program has a dedicated emergency response coordinator responsible for coordinating the weekly training and development of the emergency response team. Response activities have been discussed with the Lowndes LEPC and county fire departments and LEPC meetings have been conducted at the facility to increase their awareness of the hazards at the plant as well as the resources. \n\n\n\nThe commitment to an injury free work environment is supported by a safety management system that includes\n\n?    OSHA Star Voluntary Protection Plan certification\n\n?    Plant Safety & Health Guideline Documentation including Safe Work Practices\n\n?    Job Safety Analysis\n\n?

The facility manufactures bleached kraft pulp and employs about 350 employees. The bleached kraft pulp operation manufactures papergrade and fluff pulp. The papergrade and fluff pulp is sold and made, respectively, into fine paper and absorbent products such as diapers.\n\n\n\nChlorine dioxide is the only RMP covered chemical used, manufactured or stored on the plant site in quantities above the designated Threshold Quantity. Chlorine dioxide (ClO2) gas is a yellowish/green gas used to bleach kraft pulp. There are 2 ClO2 solution storage tanks with a volume of 94,000 gallons each. The chlorine dioxide generator is capable of manufacturing about 600 gallons/minute at a concentration of about 11.2 grams/liter solution (1.12%). \n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program:\n\n\n\nThe Columbus Mill accident prevention program for chlorine dioxide complies wit"

In the worst-case situation, this type of release would coincide with meteorological conditions that would result in minimal dilution of the vessel contents. The endpoint for toxic substances is the maximum airborne concentration below which nearly all individuals can be exposed for up to one hour without developing serious health effects which could impair the ability to take protective cover.  The toxic endpoint for Chlorine Dioxide is 0.0028 mg/L (Appendix A of Part 68).  The distance to endpoint was determined using RMP*Comp, a software program developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario for the Columbus Mill facility involves a tank rupture, which would result in the release of both of tanks, since the tanks are in communication.  \n\n\n\nHazard Assessment, Alternative Release Scenario:\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario is an event more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario and will reach an endpoint offsite, unless no such scenario exists. In determining the distance to endpoint for the alternative release scenario, any mitigation controls employed in the process can be used.  The distance to endpoint for the alternative release scenario was determined using RMP*Comp.\n\n\n\nThe most likely alternative scenario for the Columbus Mill facility would also involve a tank rupture.  The release rate would be approximately 5.4 pounds per minute for ten (10) minutes.  There are gas detectors inside the secondary containment that trigger an alarm in the event of such a release.  Approximately 50 yards from the tanks is another gas detector which adds another level of warning.  The detectors would allow for faster mitigation"

Employees are trained through self-taught learning materials including operation manuals, educational modules and computer based education programs. In addition, employees are trained one-on-one through on-the-job training in the field. Employees are encouraged to identify education needs and take part in education development and implementation. Skills are demonstrated through written exams, oral exams, and through proficiency demonstrations. The requirements of 40 CFR Part 68 allows the responsible official of the facility to certify that any employee involved in the process has been trained regarding process operations.  This certification can be found in Appendix B, Form 4. \n\n\n\nRefresher training is required as well as the initial training.  Refresher training will be provided at least every three years, but can be more often, as needed.

Audit reports, response plans and status updates are shared with affected employees. \n\n\n\nThe minimum requirements for the compliance audit include performing an audit at least once every three (3) years; maintaining the last two (2) audit reports at a minimum; conducting audits by at least one (1) person knowledgeable in the process; documenting the appropriate response to each finding; and documenting any deficiencies found and corrective actions taken. \n\n\n\nIncident Investigation: \n\n\n\nThe Columbus Mill facility investigates all incidents that could have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so that similar accidents/incidents can be prevented. Team members are involved in incident investigation since their knowledge and skills in operation and maintenance are necessary to conduct the investigation. Once investigation team reports become available, the results and recommendations of the team are made available to those working in the process or operation. Communication is in the form of a report, which is circulated among employees and is discussed in scheduled safety meetings and in ad hoc meetings with team members. \n\n\n\nA report of the incident will be prepared at the conclusion of the investigation which includes at a minimum the following:\n\n\n\n1.     Date of incident;\n\n2.     Date investigation beg"

Team members participate in compiling process safety and maintenance information with field checks to verify the accuracy of P&IDs, loop drawings, and equipment drawings used in normal work  processes and through communication of observations made during the normal conduct of their work-particularly those that reflect operational safety hazards.\n\n\n\nHot Work Permits (Safe Work Practices): \n\n\n\nThe Columbus Mill establishes a hot work permit program to control activities which may result in fires or explosions in covered processes. Team members, with appropriate job skills and experience, participate in the review of safe work practice procedures through their involvement with safety sub-teams, site-central safety core team, or ad-hoc task teams. A cross section of knowledgeable team members may be called upon to draft procedures and revisions to procedure. During the development or changes to critical activity procedures, emphasis is placed on involving a core functional team that will be affected by the procedure.  A permit issued shall document that the fire prevention and protection requirements of 29 CFR 1910.252 have been implemented prior to beginning hot work operations.  It shall indicate the dates authorized for hot work and identify the object on which the hot work is to be performed.  The permit shall be kept on file until completion of the hot work operations.\n\n\n\nContractors: \n\n\n\nThe Columbus Mill facility has established a program to ensure that contractor activities are performed in a safe manner.

They often work side-by-side with contract employees and have a high level of knowledge about how the contractor's work can affect or be affected by the process or adjacent processes. Each site team member and contract employee is encouraged to ask questions and to raise concerns about unsafe work activities or conditions. Site team members are expected to inform contract employers of the potential hazards of fire, explosion or toxic releases when repairing equipment so that contractors can work on it safely. Contractors are given a PSM Safety Orientation to the hazards of the process, how to protect themselves from those hazards and what to do in the event they do get exposed. After the Safety Orientation they must pass a written exam to document their understanding of the material presented. \n\n\n\nEmergency Planning and Response: \n\n\n\nThe Columbus Mill facility has established a written emergency response program to help safely respond to accidental releases of hazardous substances. A formal review process to solicit and obtain employees input on millwide procedures exists to improve site emergency response plans. Employees and participants in both safety incidents and drills conduct critiques to get comments and observations, identify learnings, identify opportunities for performance improvement and improve both emergency response planning and responder performance. Communication to both team members and contractors takes place on both formal and informal levels so that there is a complete understanding of the actions one should take in an emergency situation. The written plan, which is consistent with the approach in the National Response Team's Integrated Contingency Plan Guidance (\"One Plan\"), contains the following elements:\n\n\n\n1.    Procedures for informing the surrounding public and local emergency response agencies in the event of an accidental release from the facility;\n\n2.
