Arkansas Eastman is a manufacturer of specialty organic chemical intermediates that are used by Eastman's customers in a variety of consumer products ranging from paints and coating, to prescription medicines, to household detergents.  Arkansas Eastman has RMP regulated flammables consisting of acetaldehyde, ethyl mercaptan, and propylene.  In addition, the facility uses chlorine, crotonaldehyde, oleum, and anhydrous hydrogen chloride, which are RMP regulated toxic substances. \n\nArkansas Eastman has a long-standing history of protecting the health and safety of employees, the community, and the environment.  This is evidenced through over 20 years of safe operations and excellent environmental stewardship, through our commitment to the principles of Responsible Care., and through our recognition by OSHA as a \"STAR\" site in OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program.  To protect people, property, and the environment, we use multiple systems-or layers of protection-where one system is designed to backup another system.  The first layer involves accident prevention by identifying and reducing risks during the design and before startup of new manufacturing processes.  The second layer involves operating and mantaining equipment and processes in a manner that reduces risks and minimizes incidents.  The third layer involves maintaining the capability to respond to and control incidents in a timely manner.\n \nHazard Assessment Results\nAll covered processes at Arkansas Eastman are regulated as Program 3.\n\nThe worst case scenario associated with the release of a flammable substance at Arkansas Eastman is a vapor cloud explosion involving the full storage tank of ethyl mercaptan.

There are no off-site consequences associated with this scenario. To reduce the potential for an incident, several layers of protection are in place to minimize the effects of both the worst case and alternative case ethyl mercaptan scenarios.  These layers of protection include: 1) a water deluge system that provides fire protection for the unloading station and storage tank, 2) an emergency shutdown switch in each control room, 3) concrete enclosures around the tank to contain any spills, 4) sensors to detect any leaks, 5) specialized equipment on delivery trucks with specially trained drivers to minimize leaks.\n\nThe worst case scenario associated with toxic substance processes at Arkansas Eastman is the instantaneous release of the entire contents of a railcar of chlorine.  There are numerous controls in place that minimize the potential for such an incident and also to manage consequences if one should occur.  However, no credit for these controls is taken into account in evaluating this scenario.  When such controls are not considered, the effects of this scenario could have an off-site impact of 25 miles based on EPAs OCA Guidence Reference Table.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine is a failure of the one-inch discharge line between the emergency discharge shutdown valve and the chlorine weigh tank that supplies the production facility.

Our record over the last 5 years indicates good progress toward that goal.  There has been one incident involving a RPM chemical with only minor on-site effects.  There have been zero incidents with off-site effects.  Arkansas Eastman is an OSHA VPP STAR site.\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program Steps\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at Arkansas Eastman.  Because processes at Arkansas Eastman that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\nArkansas Eastman has management systems in place which meet the requirements of RMP and ensure full employee participation.

The purpose of the team is to assess and ensure that the company's safety processes and initiatives support its vision of a work place free of unsafe acts, behaviors and conditions.\n\nArkansas Eastman encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to extensive information created as part of Arkansas Eastman's accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees are involved in the accident prevention program are documented in employee participation plans that address each accident prevention program element.  In addition, Arkansas Eastman has a number of initiatives underway that address process and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include a program entitled \"Employee Development System for Safety\".  Each employee works with his immediate supervisor to determine individual and specific opportunities for improving safety performance.  Another initiative is Arkansas Eastman's Safety Concerns Process which is a process for reporting safety concerns and ensuring that such concerns are addressed promptly.  A third initiative is called the Arkansas Safety Awareness Process, a program where employees make random observations of their co-workers to help identify and eliminate at-risk behaviors.. Additionally, Arkansas Eastman participates in OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) to supplement its efforts for employee participation. The VPP lists guidelines for employee participation.  \n\nProcess Safety Information\nArkansas Eastman keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.

This information is normally compiled in a Process Safety Information (PSI) binder. The PSI and referenced documents are readily available to employees as part of the employee participation plan.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nArkansas Eastman has a comprehensive Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards before the manufacturing process begins.\n\nArkansas Eastman uses a PHA technique that is appropriate to the complexity of the process being studied.  There are four techniques in use at Arkansas Eastman.  These are Check List, What If, What If-Check List, and Hazard and Operability Analysis.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating, maintenance, chemical, and engineering expertise and experience.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures.\n\nImplementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on the relative risk rankings assigned by the PHA Team.  These rankings help ensure  accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA Team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained for the life of the process.\n\nAll processes undergo a revalidation PHA at least every five years as long as the process is active.\n\nOperating Procedures\nArkansas Eastman maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as: 1) unit startup, 2) normal operations, 3) temporary operations, 4) emergency shutdown, 5) normal"

These procedures are used as a reference by experienced operators and provide the basis for consistent training of new operators. The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the Management of Change Process.  Department Superintendents certify these procedures annually as accurate.  The Process Safety Review Committee reviews them at least every five years.  \n\nTraining\nTo compliment written procedures for process operations, Arkansas Eastman has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  Each new employee receives basic training in department operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is provided training on process-specific duties and tasks.  This is done through an operator apprentice program or by pairing the new operator with an experienced operator for an appropriate period of time.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skill demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they may work independently.  Refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  Training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\nArkansas Eastman uses contractors to supplement its construction, maintenance and related services workforce.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, Arkansas Eastman has procedures in place to provide contractors information on the hazards in their work area.  In addition, Arkansas Eastman has a process for the selection of contractors and evaluation of their safety performance.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\nArkansas Eastman conducts a PSSR for any new process, new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.

Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by either equipment or human failures.\n\nArkansas Eastman also has safety features on processing units to help: 1) quickly detect a release, 2) contain and control a release, and 3) reduce the consequences of a release.  Some examples of safety features that compose the layers of protection at Arkansas Eastman are gas detectors/analyzers, relief valves, scrubbers, automatic shutdown systems and containment areas.\n\nEmergency Response Program Information\nThe overall emergency response program for Arkansas Eastman is coordinated with the Independence County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  The LEPC includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The committee meets regularly to develop community emergency response plans and to conduct community-wide drills.  Arkansas Eastman has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations.  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  Arkansas Eastman also conducts its own periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and/or emergency response organizations.  Arkansas Eastman provides annual refresher training (more frequently if necessary) to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances at Arkansas Eastman. \n\nArkansas Eastman has a written emergency response program in place to protect employees, contractors, the public, and the environment.
