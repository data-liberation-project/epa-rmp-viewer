As part of this commitment, Stepan Company has established operations and management systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One part of this system is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage chemical risk at Stepan Company\u00bfs Millsdale Plant and complies with the Environmental Protection Agency\u00bfs (EPA) regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Program Rule (RMP Rule).  One of the requirements associated with the RMP Rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at Stepan Company\u00bfs Millsdale Plant.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirements associated with the RMP Rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at Stepan Company\u00bfs Millsdale Plant.\n\n1.1\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nStepan Company is committed to the safety of Stepan Company employees, public, and preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Stepan Company implements controls to prevent   releases of hazardous substances.  In the event of a chemical release, trained personnel will respond to control and contain such releases.  Stepan Company evaluates each situation, evacuates employees as necessary, and contacts the local fire department to control and contain the release to prevent and/or reduce the consequences of the release.  The Millsdale Plant will also contact Will County Emergency Management Agency (EMA) to assist with emergency management if necessary.   \n\nWill County Emergency Management Agency (EMA) has established a Chemical Emergency Preparedness Plan to coordinate emergency response activities and communicate"

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for operating conditions, chemical inventory, and equipment design information.  The facility management of change procedure (MOC) is used to maintain up to date information.  The documents are accessible to all employees electronically from their computers.\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and treatment are provided in the material safety data sheets (MSDS).  This information is supplemented by information that addresses known corrosion concerns and hazards associated with reactivity.  Each regulated process has defined operating limits for key process variables.  The processes are operated within these limits using process controls (hardware and software), trained personnel and alarms/safety shutdown systems.\n\nThe Stepan Company\u00bfs Millsdale Plant also maintains technical documents and specifications related to the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes material of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, area electrical classification, and design of safety systems.

Stepan Company is a leading merchant producer of surfactants that are the key ingredients in consumer and industrial cleaning compounds.  Manufacturers of detergents, shampoos, lotions, toothpastes, and cosmetics depend on surfactants to achieve the foaming and cleaning qualities of their products.  Stepan Company\u00bfs Millsdale Plant handles four (4) substances regulated by the RMP rule in sufficient quantities to be covered by the regulation.  \n\n\t\tSulfur trioxide (SO3 ) is delivered by rail car, stored on site, and used in the sulfonation processes.  There are five (5) sulfonation processes located at the Millsdale Plant site.  The sulfonation processes receive sulfur trioxide from two (2) bulk storage tanks.  The sulfonation processes manufacture various sulfonic acids which may be sold to customers for the production of detergents and cleaning products, or further processed within Stepan Company.  \n\nSulfur trioxide (SO3 ) is also delivered to the Millsdale Plant via truck for use in the Process Technology Department (PTD).  The PTD uses sulfur trioxide to manufacture various sulfonic acids on a smaller scale than the production processes.  Sulfur trioxide is classified as a toxic liquid in the RMP Rule.\n\n\t\tEthylene oxide (EO) is delivered by rail car, stored on site, and used in the alkoxylation process.

In addition, personnel training regarding the change may be provided when necessary.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\nStepan Company\u00bfs Millsdale Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  The procedure assures construction is completed within design specification and confirms the integrity of the equipment once installed.  The procedure also includes process commissioning tests using non-hazardous fluids to confirm systems function as desired. \n\n The PSSR process uses checksheets and checklists to manage construction and documentation that the process is ready to operate.
