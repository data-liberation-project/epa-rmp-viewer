Ammonia is a hazardous substance that must be handled properly in order to prevent accidental releases and injuries.  It is the policy of Safeway, Inc. - Los Angeles Milk Plant to conduct all operations (including the ammonia refrigeration system) in a safe manner.  This policy extends to all employees and contractors at the facility.  Safeway, Inc. - Los Angeles Milk Plant implements this policy toward chemical and general safety through ongoing employee participation, training, written operating procedures, maintenance, inspections, safety committee meetings, and safety reviews/evaluations.  These programs are in effect at the facility to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  \n\n\n\nSafeway, Inc. - Los Angeles Milk Plant's senior management is not only committed to offer superior service, but to also maintain a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  The facility maintains a Safety Committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  Safeway has an Emergency Response Plan (Plan) in effect, which is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM document maintained at the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Safeway, Inc. - Los Angeles Milk Plant was designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and loca"

The facility is located at 3361 South Boxford Avenue, Commerce, CA 90040.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses approximately 38,000 pounds of ammonia within a closed system for the purpose of manufacturing dairy products.  The system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for the production and storage of dairy products.\n\n\n\nThe area immediately surrounding the facility is urban with largely industrial complexes and the nearest residential areas to the north and southwest.  The facility is approximately ? mile southwest of Interstate 5 and ? mile east of Interstate 10.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines and standards including the following:\n\n\n\n?    IIAR Bulletin 107, \"Suggested Safety and Operating Procedures When Making Ammonia Refrigeration Tie ins\"\n\n?    IIAR Bulletin 109, \"Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safe Ammonia Refrigeration System\"\n\n?    IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\"\n\n?    IIAR Publication R 1, \"A Guide to Good Practices for the Operation of an Ammonia Refrigeration System\"\n\n\n\nIn addition, Safeway, Inc. - Los Angeles Milk Plant prepared and implemented a PSM program in 1995.

The PHA was revalidated on June 2, 1999, April 27 & 28, 2004, June 4, 2009, and most recently on March 5-6, 2019. The PSM prevention programs included developing written operating and maintenance procedures as well as other policies and programs to manage the handling of ammonia at the facility (M"

The computer system is connected to controls and status indicators throughout the refrigeration system intended to minimize potential ammonia related accidents and to allow operators to monitor system operations. This monitoring system is comprised of liquid level controls, pressure and temperature controls and indicators, as well as other system safeguards and methods for allowing the computer (or facility operators) to effectively monitor and control refrigeration operations.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nEPA's RMP regulation defines \"accident\" as the following:\n\n\n\n\"The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process.\n\n\n\nThe release must have caused at least one of the following:\n\n\n\n?    On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (?68.42(a)); or\n\n?    Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (?68.42(a)).\"\n\n\n\nBased on the above definition and an investigation into the facility's accident history conducted at the time of the Process Hazard Analysis (March 5-6, 2019), there have been no significant releases of ammonia that meet that definition in the last five years (March 2014 - March 2019). \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Safeway, Inc. - Los Angeles Milk Plant has an emergency action plan in effect.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM document and in the Business Plan for the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n1.  To save lives.\n\n2.  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n3.  To protect the environment.\n\n4.
