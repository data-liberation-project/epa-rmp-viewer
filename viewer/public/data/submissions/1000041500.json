Vinyl acetate is purchased from an outside vendor and is delivered to the Plant via tank truck on an \"as needed\" basis.  The tanker's contents are unloaded at an unloading station by plant operators into an above ground bulk storage tank identified as U-33 which is located on the East Side of the plant.  The maximum capacity of the bulk storage tank is 12,000 gallons.  Vinyl acetate is pumped from the bulk storage tank through an enclosed piping system into the production area where it is fed into the polyethylene unit.\n\n\n\nThe plant's stationary source of ethylene consists of three reaction vessels.  Ethylene is brought into the plant from either of two outside sources via pipeline on a continuous basis.  Ethylene is transferred through an enclosed piping system into the production area where it is fed into the three reactors in the polyethylene wax unit.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n3)    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps: \n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program at the Honeywell Orange Plant consists of 12 elements.  Each of these elements is described below, together with chemical-specific prevention steps, as applicable.\n\n\n\n3a. Process Safety Information\n\n\n\nWritten process safety information is compiled before conducting process hazard analyses for the manufacturing processes including vinyl acetate and ethylene.  This enables the employees involved in operating these processes to identify and understand the potential hazards associated with the processes.  The information compiled includes data on the safe use and handling of the regulated chemicals (e.g., Material Safety Data Sheets), data on the process technology (e.g., Process Flow Diagrams, process chemistry, flow rates and storage capacities, operating limits"

The process safety information shows compliance of the process design with generally accepted good engineering practices.\n\n\n\n3b. Process Hazard Analyses\n\n\n\nProcess hazard analyses for the manufacturing process have been completed in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.119(e) (OSHA Process Safety Management).  These process hazard analyses are updated and revalidated in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.119(e), and are retained on plant for the life of the process.\n\n\n\nIn general, one or more of the following methodologies are used to complete each process hazard analysis: (a) what-if evaluation; (b) checklist; (c) hazard and operability study (HAZOP); (d) failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA); (e) fault tree; (f) process mapping; and (g) cause and effect matrix.  Each process hazard analysis addresses the process hazards, process incident history, process control devices and detection systems, evaluation of failure of process control devices, equipment location, and human factors.  A team of employees having experience and knowledge of the process design and operation, and knowledge of how to complete a process hazard analysis perform each process hazard analysis.  The Management of Change process (described below) is used to track and document process changes, which occur as a result of recommendations from process hazard analyses.\n\n\n\n \n\n3c. Operating Procedures\n\n\n\nWritten operating procedures are prepared for the manufacturing processes including vinyl acetate and ethylene.

Written procedures are also provided for specific operations such as lockout/tagout, confined space entry and line breaking.\n\n\n\n3d. Training\n\n\n\nEmployees currently engaged in operating the manufacturing processes using vinyl acetate and ethylene have received training to ensure they have the required knowledge, skills, and abilities to safely carry out the requirements specified in the written operating procedures.  Refresher training is provided every three years at a minimum, or sooner if warranted by changes to operating conditions, equipment or procedures.  Where refresher training is required more frequently than every three years, it is triggered through the Management of Change process (described below).  Training records are maintained for each employee to show the date training was conducted and the material covered by the training.\n\n\n\n3e. Mechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nHoneywell Orange maintains the mechanical integrity of equipment used to process and handle vinyl acetate and ethylene.  Such equipment includes pressurized vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, pressure relief and vent systems, emergency control devices, pumps, and valves.

A pre-startup safety review is also conducted for process changes where the approved Request For Change indicates a change in the process safety information is required.  A team of employees having knowledge of the process, equipment, procedures and safety requirements operating conditions conducts the pre-startup safety review, procedures and safety requirements.  All items on the pre-startup review checklist must be satisfied prior to commencing startup.\n\n\n\n3h. Compliance Audits\n\n\n\nSelf-assessed compliance audits for the process are conducted annually to ensure that the elements of the general accidental release prevention program are up to date and are being implemented.  Personnel having experience and knowledge of the covered processes and knowledge of the program requirements conduct the compliance audits.  Records of the compliance audit reports are maintained to document the results of the audits and corrective actions taken, as appropriate.\n\n\n\n3i. Incident Investigation\n\n\n\nAll incidents that resulted in, or could have resulted in, a release of vinyl acetate or ethylene are investigated promptly.  The incident investigation starts with the completion of an Incident Investigation Report prepared by the supervisor on duty at the time of the incident, and is distributed to the incident investigation team.

Follow-up actions which are taken as a result of the recommendations in the incident investigation report are documented, and records of the reports and follow-up actions are maintained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n\n\n3j. Employee Participation\n\n\n\nAll employees at Honeywell Orange have opportunities to access and participate in the sharing of information related to process safety for the processes involving vinyl acetate and ethylene. Employees in the maintenance and operating areas attend monthly safety meetings to review incidents, learn about new or modified processes, and discuss specific safety awareness topics.  A special committee named the Employee Health, Safety and Environmental committee made up of employees from each of the functional areas of the plant, meets monthly to review the status of in-progress safety action items, review safety policies and procedures for the plant, and recommend changes if necessary.  Employees routinely have opportunities to participate in other safety processes under the prevention program such as process hazard analyses, management of change, employee training and incident investigations.\n\n\n\n3k. Hot Work Permits\n\n\n\nHoneywell Orange has established a hot work permit system.  Under the system, a hot work permit must be issued prior to commencing hot work operations.

A separate hot work permit must be issued for each hot work operation, and a separate hot work permit must be issued for each day.  A copy of the hot work permit must be displayed at the job location while hot work is in progress, and the permit is maintained on file after the completion of the hot work. \n\n3l. Contractors\n\n\n\nPrior to retaining contractor services for work in the process area, the contractor's safety performance and program is evaluated.  This includes a 3 year review of the contractor's Total Case Incident Rate (TCIR), review of OSHA recordable injuries and illnesses and corrective actions, review of Lost Work Day Cases Away (LWDCA) and corrective actions, review of the contractor's safety program including safety policies, training, and medical monitoring, and review of any applicable plant-specific health and safety plan prepared by the contractor.  The information supplied by the contractor is retained on plant while the contractor is engaged in work activities.\n\n\n\nPrior to commencing work at the plant, each contractor employee receives a safety orientation provided by Honeywell.  The safety orientation covers information on the hazards associated with the process areas where the work will be performed, safety procedures and systems to be used, overview of the plant emergency response program including specific procedures to be followed in case of emergency, and a review of plant safety rules and applicable operating procedures.  A record of each contractor employee's sign-off on the safety orientation is maintained on file at the plant, including the date the training was completed.
