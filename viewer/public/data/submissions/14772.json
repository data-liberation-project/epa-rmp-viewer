      "SummaryText": "To ensure employee safety, and reduce the potential for exposure to the community, Oakmont Water Authority (OWA) provides awareness training on the chemical hazards of chlorine and the safe handling of hazardous materials at the facility.  Personnel working with hazardous materials are trained in safe operating procedures, the proper utilization of safety equipment and safeguards, and maintenance techniques required to operate in a safe and efficient manner.\n\nOWA is a water treatment facility located along the Allegheny River that utilizes chlorine in its' treatment process.  The chlorine is contained inside a brick structure (the chlorine building) in three one ton cylinders for the pre-treatment process.  OWA employs a dual regulator vacuum system with an automatic switchover and one cylinder as an extra.  Two cylinders are connected to a manifold and the valves are opened to activate one tank and put the other on standby.  The third cylinder is backup.  The chlorine gas passes through the regulator and travels to the chlorinators located in an enclosed room below.  The chlorinators adjust the feed rates to produce an appropriate mixture of domestic water and chlorine relative to the raw water being treated.  The mixture travels through the solution line to the application point where it is injected into the raw water being pumped from the river.\n\nIn the case of a catastrophe affecting chlorine at the facility, the worst case scenario would involve the release of the contents of a one ton cylinder in a ten minute period.  According to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) RMP Guidance for Waste Water Treatment Plants Reference Tables, the contents of the cylinder would be released at the rate of 200 pounds/minute.  If the cylinder was not enclosed, and there are no controls, the release would have an impact on the environment and population up to a distance of 1.3 miles in an urban setting.  The cylinders are in an enclosed area which would reduce the potent"

      "SummaryText": "ial of release of chlorine into the environment.\n\nA more likely occurence would involve a leak in the cylinder, valves, connectors or piping involved in the process.  A vacuum system for distribution of chlorine has been installed at the facility to reduce the likelihood that a chlorine release offsite would occur.  The vacuum system automatically eliminates chlorine distribution if a leak occurs between the regulator and the chlorinators inside the building.  Remote sensors and alarms alert operators of a chlorine discharge within the enclosure.  Using the RMP Guidance for Waste Water Treatment Plants, if damage was done to a cylinder during the loading or unloading procedure, the offsite impact would encompass .1 miles.\n\nOWA has implemented a prevention program to reduce the potential for an accidental release.  The process equipment is evaluated against best engineering practices and adheres to codes and standards regulating the water treatment industry.  Supplier manuals and maintenance instructions are used as a basis for scheduled maintenance activities and equipment changes.  Training on operating procedures, the safe handling of chlorine, and inspection and testing procedures, are in place to reduce the potential for an accidental release.  Operators inspect the process on an hourly basis and monitor chlorine sensors from a remote control panel.  Personnel are trained in the use of Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) and the use of repair kits for one ton and 150 pound cylinders.\n\nThe facility emergency response plan has been approved by the Local Emergency Planning Committee of Allegheny County.  Edward Adams, Facility Emergency Response Coordinator, or his assistant, Carl Schultz, may be contacted at 412/828-9508.  If an emergency exists, the facility emergency coordinator will notify Oakmont Fire Department, the Oakmont Police Department, SARA, the PA Emergency Response Commission, Emergency Medical Services, and the National Response Center, if req"

Employees have been trained in the use of safety equipment (SCBA's), evacuation procedures, and public notification procedures.\n\nA more intensive training program is being adopted to focus on the chlorine process and the controls required to improve safety for employees and the public.  Employee initial training and retraining will be conducted as required by SARA Title III.  Maintenance procedures with documented schedules have been implemented to ensure that potential equipment failures are reduced due to improved maintenance and inspection activities.  Additional procedures have been documented and implemented to improve the safety operations at the facility."
