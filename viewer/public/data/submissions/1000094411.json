Emergency Response Plan\r\nOur facility has a written emergency response plan to respond to accidental releases of hazardous\r\nmaterials. The plan addresses aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and\r\nmedical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public.\r\nThe plan is updated to reflect pertinent changes taking place within our processes that may require a modified emergency response. Emergency responders are trained or drilled on an annual basis.\r\nAnderson County Department of Emergency Services is the Local Emergency Planning\r\nCommittee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified."
