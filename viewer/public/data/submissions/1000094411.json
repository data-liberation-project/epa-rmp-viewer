We have one regulated substance above the RMP threshold quantity present at our facility. There are no regulated toxic substances on-site. The regulated flammable substance is Isobutane.  Isobutane is received and stored in its pure state, and it is used as a refrigerant in the cooling system of each refrigeration unit. The maximum quantity of Isobutane stored on-site is 12,600 gallons (59,220 lbs).\n\n\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention\n\nrequirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.
