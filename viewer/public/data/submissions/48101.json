The facility is situated south-east of LaCygne  Lake.  The property surrounding the LaCygne Station is rural.\n\nAmmonia System Description\n\nThe ammonia storage tanks are designed to be filled by a tanker truck at a dedicated loading station.  For the NOx control systems, ammonia vapors will be drawn from the tanks, regulated for pressure, mixed with air, and injected into the boiler flue within the ammonia injection grid.  In combination with the catalyst in the selective catalytic reduction unit, nitrogen oxides will be reacted and emissions of the pollutant will be reduced.\n\nProcess Hazard Assessment (PHA)\n\nProcess hazard assessments were performed using a \"What If\" type analysis for the Unit #1 ammonia system.  This analysis utilizes a brainstorming approach, in which a team of people familiar with the process asks questions about possible undesirable events.  The \"What If\" analysis results in a listing of undesirable events with their consequences, safeguards, and  recommendations for risk reduction.  Comments and recommendations are summarized in the Process Hazard assessment section of the Risk Management Program.\n\nPrevention System\n\nThe LaCygne Generating Station will have operation, maintenance, and inspection procedures for the anhydrous ammonia system.  There will be Operation and Maintenance manuals for each major piece of equipment,and personnel will receive tra"

Standard operating procedures (SOPs) for startup, shutdown, normal operation and emergency operation of the ammonia storage systems will be in place when operation begins.  The SOPs wlil be written and posted in appropriate areas.  Personnel will be trained annually on safety concerns and general operation procedures as well as emergency procedures.\n\nAmmonia sensors and alarms are in place to detect an ammonia release.  A fogging system to mitigate the impact of a release is in place.\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nKCP&L will respond to ammonia releated emergencies by notifying the Local Emergency Planning Commission and by evacuating its personnel, when needed.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThe LaCygne Generating Station has no ammonia releases in the past five years which need to be reported in the five year accident history."
