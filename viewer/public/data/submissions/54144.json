An EC is on-site or on-call 24 hours per day, seven days per week.  It is the EC's responsibility to determine the degree of any emergency condition and coordinate response actions accordingly.  RIS employs an Emergency Response Team  to act as first responders during most emergency situations.  These qualified and trained RIS employees immediately clean up chemical spills and extinguish small fires.  They are trained in first aid and CPR and provide limited medical assistance to injured employees.  The EC may assemble the appropriate response team for any emergency situation by utilizing ERT members, Operations personnel, safety and health professionals employed by RIS, and any appropriate off-site emergency management personnel. \n\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nRIS has a continued commitment to maintain and improve safety at its facility. RIS would like to emphasize that its business success and its commitment to protection of human health and the environment are consistent and complementary goals.  We believe that much can be done to prevent environmental accidents, and we are committed to maintaining an environmentally sound, safe, and healthy workplace for the benefit of our employees and our community.  We are committed to complying with State and Federal regulations regarding working conditions and accident prevention.  We will communicate our safety, health and environmental achievements and challenges openly, honestly, clearly, and professionally with employees, customers, our community, and government agencies."

Discussions at this meeting include the location and layout of the facility, properties of hazardous wastes and the associated hazards, places where facility personnel will normally be working, entrances to and roads inside the facility, evacuation routes, the potential associated hazards of emergency response and any changes that have been made to the emergency response plan.  In addition, the responsibilities of each party is reviewed.\n\nSince 1999, RIS has voluntarily participated in the OSHA On-Site Consultation Program through the Ohio Department of Commerce, Division of Labor and Worker Safety.  This program provides an independent evaluation of the RIS health and safety programs by an OSHA consultant.  Evaluations are made on all aspects of these programs through inspections and employee interviews.  RIS became the fourth company in Ohio to have earned the Safety and Health Achievement Recognition Program (SHARP) certification in October 2003.  Having this independent input has enabled RIS to strengthen its outstanding programs and to better incorporate employee involvement in its efforts.    \n\n\nFacility Information\n\nRIS is a commercial hazardous waste treatment and storage facility located in rural Lorain County, Ohio.  RIS began its waste management operations in 1949.  Its primary method of waste treatment is and has always been incineration.  The entire RIS facility encompasses approximately 80 acres and is surrounded by farmland, dense woodland and a small residential area.  RIS thermally treats non-hazardous and hazardous solid and liquid wastes including spent solvents, paint solids and off specification chemicals and chemical products from manufacturing facilities.  RIS has drum and bulk storage capabilities and is permitted to store waste for treatment in tanks and in a covered, open sided container storage facility.\n\nRIS complies with State and Federal regulations for hazardous waste treatment and storage facilities (RCRA).

These processes include:\n\n1) CSF storage\n\n2) Movement and handling of bulk waste (tankers and roll-off containers) and small containers on-site (including waste repackaging activities performed outdoors, and staging and set-up for processing near the incineration system)\n\n3) Waste management activities at the Process Dock, placement and storage of liquid wastes in the Tank Farm tanks, and processes in RIS' Metering Building\n\n4) Waste feeds to the Incineration System include several mechanisms that individually would not exceed a TQ although there is a potential  to exceed a TQ collectively \n\nTo determine the applicability of this Accidental Release Prevention regulation to the RIS facility, RIS initially reviewed its records for a three year period to determine which of the regulated chemicals were received and managed at RIS above the listed Threshold Quantity (TQ). RIS continues a review process to determine potential applicability. The following list provides the names of the chemicals being registered.  It is important to note that these chemicals are received from manufacturers as wastes and waste mixtures rather than as products.\n\n\tToxic Substances\nChloroform\nFormaldehyde\nHydrochloric Acid\nMethyl Mercaptan\nTitanium Tetrachloride\nVinyl Acetate Monomer \n\n\nHazard Assessment\n\nThe regulated chemicals that are received above the TQ are then evaluated in an off-site consequence analysis that considers management of these chemicals in the processes described above.

      "SummaryText": "analysis and an Alternative Case analysis are run following standard assumptions found in U.S. EPA's Off-Site Consequence Analysis Guidance and specified modeling program.  \n\nWe want to emphasize that the possibility of these scenarios actually occurring is very remote for several reasons.  First, the registered chemicals are being registered because they have the potential to exist briefly onsite.  In most cases, RIS does not exceed the threshold quantity.  Secondly, the assumptions used to determine the worst case off-site release scenarios were highly conservative. These scenarios do not take into account the preventative measures currently incorporated into RIS' standard operating procedures, or the emergency response procedures that would minimize or prevent potential off-site releases.  For example, routine inspections of tanks, tankers and other containers help prevent the potential for a spill. In the event of an incident, materials would be secondarily contained. Secondary containment is designed to mitigate releases.    In addition, RIS' ERT members would immediately act to contain and clean up the waste material, and the release rate to the air would be minimal. \n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nRIS has not had an accidental release of a regulated chemical within the last five years at the RIS facility. \n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nRIS has plans and agreements in place with local response organizations to respond to emergencies at the RIS facility.  RIS' Contingency Plan addresses various types of potential emergency situations, including spills, fires, civil unrest, employee injuries, earthquakes and high winds. Under its Contingency Plan, RIS will notify and work with the local LEPC, the local fire departments, sheriff, and hospital to control most emergency situations.  A crisis communication plan also is in place to address more serious incidents with members of the local community.  In extreme emergency situations, RIS may notify and seek assistance"

      "SummaryText": "3/23/09\n\nRisk Management Plan for Ross Incineration Services, Inc.\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe purpose of this Executive Summary is to provide the public with information about Ross Incineration Services, Inc., (RIS) Risk Management Plan (RMP).  RIS is a commercial hazardous waste treatment and storage facility that processes substances covered by the accidental release prevention regulations under section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.  All facilities covered by these regulations must develop and implement programs that prevent accidental releases of regulated substances and reduce the severity of those releases that may occur. These risk management programs must be described in a RMP. The RMP must include a hazard assessment, a prevention program and an emergency response program.  The RMP was originally submitted to the U.S Environmental Protection Agency by June 21, 1999.  The RMP rule requires sources to update and resubmit RMPs at least every five years or sooner if any changes occur.  RIS has developed its risk management programs and submitted its RMP to comply with these regulations. \n\nIt is RIS' policy to provide its employees with a safe work environment and its neighbors with a safe environment in which to live.  RIS is committed to providing employees with safe equipment.  RIS is also committed to complying with State and Federal regulations regarding working conditions and accident prevention.  The personal health and safety of RIS employees and neighbors is of primary importance.  To this end, RIS maintains safety and health programs that employ an aggressive approach toward injury and illness prevention and a safe work environment.\n\nRIS operates within guidelines set by its Statement of Safety, Health and Environmental Policy, which is as follows:\n\n- \tOur business success and our commitment to protection of human health and the environment are consistent and complimentary goals.\n\n- \tWe will demonstrate leadership in protection of human he"

This group of regulations requires RIS to operate under strict specifications.  Under these regulations RIS is also required to operate under a Part B permit.  The purpose of the RCRA regulations (and the Part B permit) is to assure that RIS operates its processes in a manner that protects human health and environment.  The RIS facility operation was designed to prevent accidental releases as well as mitigate potential releases.  Daily inspections are conducted for the operational processes, storage areas and secondary containment areas.  Additional inspection and monitoring (also required by RCRA and the Part B permit) are also conducted to assure that the processes are operating within permitted and regulated specifications.   \n\nRIS firmly believes that a release of a hazardous chemical from its facility that would adversely impact the environment or cause concern to human health is very unlikely.  Waste management processes at RIS are engineered and constructed with controls to prevent or mitigate off-site releases of hazardous chemicals to the envir"

RIS' Emergency Response Program minimizes hazards to human health and the environment from fires and unplanned releases of hazardous waste constituents from facility operations.  This program includes provisions to coordinate on-site emergency response personnel if a chemical spill or fire were to occur.  It also includes provisions to coordinate response to site emergencies, if necessary, with local, State and Federal emergency management personnel.  Emergency Coordinators (EC) and Emergency Response Team (ERT) personnel employed by RIS are trained to control chemical spills and fires to minimize the possibility of an off-site release of hazardous chemicals.\n   \nRIS employees receive extensive training to enable them to perform their jobs correctly and safely.  Each RIS operations employee receives hundreds of hours of supervised, on the job training to learn operating procedures and proper techniques to operate process equipment and machinery.  All RIS employees receive 40 hours of RCRA and OSHA training within their first six months of employment.  This safety training helps RIS employees recognize and manage the hazards associated with their jobs.  It also provides organized and consistent procedures to respond to emergency situations, including chemical spills and fires.  Refresher training is provided annually to apprise each employee of facility process upgrades, potential process hazards, and safety procedure changes.  RIS trainers review emergency response responsibilities, contingency plan implementation criteria and site evacuation procedures during this annual training.  Additionally, each RIS employee attends monthly safety training sessions where he or she focuses on applicable OSHA safety procedures and established safety programs.  Qualified safety and health professionals provide training at RIS.\n\nRIS personnel meet annually with the local emergen"
