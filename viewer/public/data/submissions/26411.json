(Milkco) submits this Risk Management Plan (RMP) for operations at their Asheville, North Carolina facility.  Milkco's operations include the processing and packaging of milk products, orange juice and flavored drink products.  Milkco has been in operation at this facility for over 17 years and provides over 200 jobs to the local community.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nMilkco is committed to protecting the health of its employees, the surrounding community, and the environment; therefore it is Milkco policy to maintain compliance with 40 CFR 68 as well as Occupational Safety and Health Organization (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations promulgated as Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations Chapter 1910, Section 119 (29 CFR 1910.119), and OSHA's Hazardous Operations and Emergency Response regulations (29 CFR 1910.120).\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nMilkco is required to maintain low temperatures in the milk processing areas of the plant that are within standards required by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to ensure quality in the final products.  Milkco uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant to maintain the 18,000 ft2 storage area within the required range of operating temperatures.  Milkco's refrigeration system consisting of a high-pressure receiver, recirculator, compressors, evaporators, condensers, and piping can contain a quantity of anhydrous ammonia in excess of the 10,000 pound threshold given in 40 CFR 68 Appendix A.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario\n\nAs required by 40 CFR 68 Subpart B, Milkco has evaluated a worst-case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia using the parameters specified by the EPA.  Milkco's worst case release scenario is the rupture of the largest single tank (high-pressure receiver) o"

Using the EPA's RMP*Comp( program, it was determined that the distance to the toxic endpoint in this worst-case scenario has the potential to result in an offsite release.  The worst-case release scenario was developed following EPA regulations and is not considered to be a likely release scenario.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios\n\nMilkco evaluated several options to be considered as alternative release scenarios.  After careful consideration, Milkco decided to include two alternative release scenarios in their RMP document.  The alternative release scenarios were developed for evaluation because they are expected to be more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario.\n\nThe first alternate release scenario (Alternative Release Scenario 1) identified by Milkco would be the failure of a transfer hose.  In developing the release parameters of Alternative Release Scenario 1, Milkco considered average response time to shut the system down.  The other alternate release scenario (Alternative Release Scenario 2) identified by Milkco would be a 1/2-inch process piping break.  In developing the release parameters of Alternative Release Scenario 2, Milkco considered average response time to shut the system down and passive mitigation provided by the building structure.  Using EPA's RMP*Comp program and EPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance Document, the distance to the toxic endpoint in either alternative release scenario has the potential to result in offsite consequences.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nTo prevent and mitigate accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia, Milkco has implemented several precautionary measures.  Milkco has developed and implemented a process safety management (PSM) program.  As such, the anhydrous ammonia system has been evaluated for release potential.  Some of the co"

Milkco encourages employee participation in the development of the control measures used at the plant.  Employees have the opportunity to voice opinions, concerns, questions, or ideas during the monthly training sessions or during the quarterly safety meetings.  Conversely, Milkco employees may approach their supervisor directly or place suggestions in the suggestion box for topics that require more immediate attention.\n\nMilkco understands that maintaining the refrigeration system in good working order is essential to preventing accidental releases.  As such, an independent engineering company conducts preventive maintenance on the process equipment on a monthly basis.  The preventive maintenance program is scheduled, documented and managed to ensure that regular maintenance occurs on the system.  In addition, an independent third party conducts testing (thermographic studies) semi-annually to ensure the mechanical integrity of critical refrigeration system components.\n\nTo confirm that control measures are effective in maintaining the safe operation of the plant, regularly scheduled audits are performed on the ammonia refrigeration system.  In accordance with the PSM program, Milkco will conduct compliance audits every three years.  Since the ammonia system was recently installed in 1997, the first compliance audit will be conducted in the year 2000.  The local fire department does not conduct formal audits; however, Milkco occasionally invites the fire department to tour the facility.  In addition, the following agencies audit"

Included in the emergency response program are measures to be taken internally by Milkco and procedures to inform local emergency response agencies.\n\nMilkco has trained approximately 17 on-site personnel to respond to accidental ammonia releases and other emergencies.  These personnel are trained in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120, OSHA's Hazardous Operations and Emergency Response regulations according to their duties and function.  Five of these personnel are trained to the level of Incident Commander and 12 personnel are trained to the technician level.  They receive annual update training.\n\nTo assure that the local municipal response agencies are familiar with Milkco's emergency response procedures, copies of the emergency response document have been submitted for review and approval by the local agencies.  Buncombe County Emergency Management Committee (EMC) has reviewed Milkco's emergency response procedures.  In the event of an anhydrous ammonia release resulting in offsite consequences, the general public will be notified by the EMC.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nMilkco is currently in the process of installing a fire sprinkler system with automated and manual controls.  Also, Milkco has implemented a continuous training program to improve safety awareness."
