In April 2001 we assumed control of our plant in Claiborne, AL (Formerly Claiborne Energy). This plant was originally designed to fractionate liquefied petroleum gas. All equipment related to the fractionation process was sold and all that remains is four tanks to hold our finished product for shipment to our customers. This plant was built according to all Federal, State and local requirements and in strict compliance with all applicable NFPA standards. All the requirements of NFPA 58 to control accidental release were built into this plant and we have always strived to keep up with changing regulations for the products that we handle, and also any new safety devices that help insure that we do not have a chemical release.\n\nTechnical Propellants, Inc. takes a very responsible attitude toward safety! Proper emergency planning and response are important elements of any safety and health program to help minimize employee, public and environmental concerns. This commitment is demonstrated by our accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures maintainence and employee training. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Mexia Fire Department and other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nWe are a manufacturer of aerosol propellants. We receive raw LPG; ie-Propane, Isobutane and Butane into our plant by tank trucks. We process this material through molecular sieves to take out impuritities, it is then stored in tanks awaiting shipment. Per our customer specifications we load these materials by themselves or blend them together into our tank trailers for shipment.\n\nTechnica"

We have always and will continue to keep up with any new and improved measures that will help us maintain the highest standards possible to insure safety.\n\nThere has been no accidental release of regulated or other chemicals at this facility in the past 5 years.\n\nTechnical Propellants, Inc. has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA standards. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including employee training, evacuation routes, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety at our plant will include the updating of any new or improved safety and mitigation devices required by NFPA 58 that governs our facility. We will also update the training of our employees to insure their safety awareness."
