It is currently owned and operated by Merit Energy Company (MEC).\n\u00bf   MEC maintains a commitment to worker and public safety as evidenced by the resources invested in accident prevention and in the consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the plant.  \n\u00bf   MEC maintains a code of safe work practices under the umbrella of the Illness and Injury Prevention Program (IIPP).\n\u00bf   The process plant is regulated under Cal OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 California Code of Regulations Section 5189.  \n\u00bf   The MEC PSM Program has fourteen elements paralleling the regulatory structure.  Merit Energy has in place programs, policies and procedures to address each of these 14 elements.  A brief summary of the MEC PSM program is presented below.\n\u00bf   Employee Participation \u00bf MEC employees receive PSM training, are involved in Process Hazard Analyses, and participate in the Management of Change Process.\n\u00bf   Process Safety Information \u00bf MEC maintains plant mechanical and process information under the specification of the PSM program.  \n\u00bf   Process Hazard Analysis \u00bf The facility has only been under Merit Energy operatorship since July of 2001, however prior operators have conducted an original PHA (1993) and one revalidation (1998).  The facility is due for a second revalidation in 2003.\n\u00bf   Operating Procedures \u00bf Prior operators of the facility programmed a computer based system to handle operating procedures and operator training.  MEC is in the process of updating this system. \n\u00bf   Training \u00bf MEC relies on a combination of classroom and computer based training for PSM purposes.\n\u00bf   Contractors \u00bf MEC requires companies providing services to provide PSM trained and qualified personnel.  Contractor safety and training programs are reviewed by MEC personnel.   In addition all contractor employees and visitors working in or near the process areas are required to att"

The Mechanical Integrity part of the prevention program includes ultrasonic testing of process lines and vessels.\n\u00bf   Hot Work Permit \u00bf MEC utilizes a Hot Work Permit system to control the use of fire or spark producing activity in process areas.\n\u00bf   Management of Change \u00bf MEC has in place a Management of Change policy that governs any change that may affect process safety.  MEC personnel are trained in MOC procedures and involved in MOC execution.\n\u00bf   Incident Investigation \u00bf has a policy for prompt and effective investigation of all workplace injuries, incidents or near misses.  \n\u00bf   Emergency Planning and Response \u00bf MEC revised the facility Emergency Response Plan in February of 2002.  Tabletop training drills were conducted in training sessions attended by all MEC employees at the facility.\n\u00bf   Compliance Audits \u00bf Prior owner/ operators have conducted compliance audits on the required three year intervals.   The last was completed in December of 1999.  The next is due in December of 2002.\n\u00bf   The plant is functionally divided into three sections: Gas Plant, Compression Storage, and Refrigeration Skid.  The main function of the facility is to extract liquid hydrocarbons and prepare produced gas for sales.  The natural gasoline liquids are stored in multiple pressure vessels, the largest being 80,000 gallons.  \n\u00bf   MEC maintains an emergency response plan in compliance with local emergency response agencies.  The South Coles Levee Gas Plant has a Hazardous Materials Business Plan on file with the Kern County Environmental Health Departmen"

The 9-1-1 system is used to notify the Fire Department.\n\u00bf   Based on the criteria of 40 CFR 68.10 and 19 CCR 2735.4, this facility has not had an accidental release in the last 5 years.  This information was verified by the reviewing records from the Certified Unified Program Agency.\n\u00bf   The worst case release scenario of 389,645 pounds of liquefied petroleum gasoline liquids, is based on the Environmental Protection Agency model.  The scenario indicates a 1 psi overpressure distance of 0.6 miles.  This distance does not impact public receptors. \n\u00bf   This is a remote facility.  All visitors onto the property must undergo a site safety orientation and check in prior to each visit.  \n\u00bf   Seismic parameters were addressed by conducting a walkthrough of the facility and reviewing the mechanical integrity records.  There were no significant indications of deterioration."
