      "SummaryText": "?   The South Coles Levee Gas Plant was built in the 1940?s.  It is currently owned and operated by Merit Energy Company (MEC).\n?   MEC maintains a commitment to worker and public safety as evidenced by the resources invested in accident prevention and in the consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the plant.  \n?   MEC maintains a code of safe work practices under the umbrella of the Illness and Injury Prevention Program (IIPP).\n?   The process plant is regulated under Cal OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 California Code of Regulations Section 5189.  \n?   The MEC PSM Program has fourteen elements paralleling the regulatory structure.  Merit Energy has in place programs, policies and procedures to address each of these 14 elements.  A brief summary of the MEC PSM program is presented below.\n?   Employee Participation ? MEC employees receive PSM training, are involved in Process Hazard Analyses, and participate in the Management of Change Process.\n?   Process Safety Information ? MEC maintains plant mechanical and process information under the specification of the PSM program.  \n?   Process Hazard Analysis ? The facility has only been under Merit Energy operatorship since July of 2001, however prior operators have conducted an original PHA (1993) and one revalidation (1998).  The facility is due for a second revalidation in 2003.\n?   Operating Procedures ? Prior operators of the facility programmed a computer based system to handle operating procedures and operator training.  MEC is in the process of updating this system. \n?   Training ? MEC relies on a combination of classroom and computer based training for PSM purposes.\n?   Contractors ? MEC requires companies providing services to provide PSM trained and qualified personnel.  Contractor safety and training programs are reviewed by MEC personnel.   In addition all contractor employees and visitors working in or near the process areas are required to att"

As part of the Management of Change process MEC will not allow new or modified equipment to be started up with the completion of Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) form. \n?   Mechanical Integrity (MI) ? MEC has in place a MI program that provides guideline and requirements for preventative maintenance and inspection of critical process equipment. The Mechanical Integrity part of the prevention program includes ultrasonic testing of process lines and vessels.\n?   Hot Work Permit ? MEC utilizes a Hot Work Permit system to control the use of fire or spark producing activity in process areas.\n?   Management of Change ? MEC has in place a Management of Change policy that governs any change that may affect process safety.  MEC personnel are trained in MOC procedures and involved in MOC execution.\n?   Incident Investigation ? has a policy for prompt and effective investigation of all workplace injuries, incidents or near misses.  \n?   Emergency Planning and Response ? MEC revised the facility Emergency Response Plan in February of 2002.  Tabletop training drills were conducted in training sessions attended by all MEC employees at the facility.\n?   Compliance Audits ? Prior owner/ operators have conducted compliance audits on the required three year intervals.   The last was completed in December of 1999.  The next is due in December of 2002.\n?   The plant is functionally divided into three sections: Gas Plant, Compression Storage, and Refrigeration Skid.  The main function of the facility is to extract liquid hydrocarbons and prepare produced gas for sales.  The natural gasoline liquids are stored in multiple pressure vessels, the largest being 80,000 gallons.  \n?   MEC maintains an emergency response plan in compliance with local emergency response agencies.  The South Coles Levee Gas Plant has a Hazardous Materials Business Plan on file with the Kern County Environmental Health Departmen"

In the event of an accidental release, the facility operators are trained to sound the alarm, contact 9-1-1, shut off the source from a safe location or activate one of the emergency shutdown devices, and secure the area.   The 9-1-1 system is used to notify the Fire Department.\n?   Based on the criteria of 40 CFR 68.10 and 19 CCR 2735.4, this facility has not had an accidental release in the last 5 years.  This information was verified by the reviewing records from the Certified Unified Program Agency.\n?   The worst case release scenario of 389,645 pounds of liquefied petroleum gasoline liquids, is based on the Environmental Protection Agency model.  The scenario indicates a 1 psi overpressure distance of 0.6 miles.  This distance does not impact public receptors. \n?   This is a remote facility.  All visitors onto the property must undergo a site safety orientation and check in prior to each visit.  \n?   Seismic parameters were addressed by conducting a walkthrough of the facility and reviewing the mechanical integrity records.  There were no significant indications of deterioration."
