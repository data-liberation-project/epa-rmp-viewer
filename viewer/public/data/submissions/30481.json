Chlorine is used as part of the water treatment process. The plant is located just off Highway 264 across from the Beaufort County Community College. There have been no chlorine incidents or accidents in the most recent Five-Year history period.\n\nThe Process Safety Management (PSM) that was completed in 1996 has been maintained current for the past five years. The PSM compliance also demonstrates our compliance with the Risk Management Program (RMP) Prevention Program. Key activities have included:\n\noAn annual review of  all chlorine, PSM and RMP procedures\noThree Year Refreshed training conducted on November 14, 2003\noA Process Hazards Analysis conducted on December 15, 2000 \noSelf Audits every three years with the last one on May 12, 2004\noA comprehensive Mechanical Integrity program that uses a computer-based maintenance scheduling program\noAn annual review and update of the Emergency Response Plan including periodic drills with the Washington Fire/Rescue Department\n\nIn addition to these compliance activities, the City of Washington has implemented these chlorine safety controls\n\noThe plant computerized SCADA system monitors the chemical release alarms 24 hours a day\noAny active mitigation would be applied by the Haz-Mat team and support personnel of the Washington Fire/Rescue Department. \n\nWithin the Utilities department, there are monthly safety meeting to review an OSHA subject or discuss a safety issue. Routine training is conducted for topics such as:\n\noHazard Communications\noPersonal Protective Equipment\noLockout/Tagout\noSite Security\noConfined Space\n\n\nAs a result of our programs, the plant has had an excellent safety record. We plan to continue our emphasis on safety to maintain and improve our safety performance."
