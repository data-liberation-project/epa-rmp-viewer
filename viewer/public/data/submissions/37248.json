Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Alco Chemical are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safey.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installlation, operating procedures, maintenance and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent potential releases of regulated substances.\n\n2.     The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur faciliy's primary activities encompass water based batch reactions.  We have three regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include 1) Carbon Disulfide, 2)  Dimethylamine solution in water and 3) Ethylenediamine.  The regulated substances at our facility are involved in several uses.  The primary use of all substances  is in producing additives for industrial cooling water treatment for prevention of disease causing bacterium and algae.  They are also used to reduce harmful bacterial growth in  the sugar manufacturing industry.\n\n3.       The Worst Case Release Scenarios and the Alternate Case Scenarios including adminstrative control and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario:\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our faciltiy, we have used SLAB models &  look up table.\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps  to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  Our release prevention plan involves both fixed systems and various elements described in OSHA's Process Safety Management standard.   All of these are discussed i"

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nWe have fixed systems such as deluge system, sprinklers, fire monitor nozzles, elevated monitor nozzles, remotely operated nozzles, dikes, and run off collection system.  Any or all of these would be activated depending upon the gravity of situation.  However, we also have other components to our Prevention Program.  These are briefly described below.\n\n4.1    PROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n         -----------------------------------------\n         Alco Chemical maintains a detailed record of safety information that decribes the chemical hazards, operarting parameters and equipment designs associated with covered processes.\n\n4.2     PROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n          --------------------------------------\n         We conduct comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associted with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodolgy used to carry out these analyses is HAZOPS.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n4.3     OPERATING PROCEDURE\n          -------------------------------\n          For the purpose of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Alco Chemical maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial start up, normal operations, emergency shut down, emergency operations, and normal shut down.  Alco Chemical does not use temporary mode of operations.  The information is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.  Alco Chemical is an ISO 9001 certified  facility.  ISO (International Standard Organization) accreditation requires  Alco to maintain its operating procedures current and establishes internation"

As a requirement for maintaining Alco's ISO certification, Alco Chemical reviews its operating procedures on a regular basis.\n\n4.4     TRAINING\n          -----------\n          Alco Chemical has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  \n\n4.5     MECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n          ------------------------------\n          Alco Chemical carries out highly documented maintenance inspections on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these inspections inlude among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shut down systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried  out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices and elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management standard.  Furthermore, these personnel are provided specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n4.6      MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE  \n           ---------------------------\n           Written procedures are in place at Alco Chemical to manage changes in process chemicals,     technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and  are trained to deal with the modification.\n\n4.7     PRE-START UP SAFETY REVIEWS\n          -----------------------------------------\n          Pre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and  modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Alco Chemical.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe start up prior to placi"
