Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe Tip Top Poultry, Marietta Facility, recognizes management's responsibility in protecting its employees, the public, the environment, equipment, and property.  The safety and health of all personnel are of primary importance.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the Marietta facility.\n\n\n\nTo accomplish the company's goal in preventing accidents, the facility has established a Plant Safety Program.  The objectives of the Plant Safety Program are to: maximize safety performance, eliminate human suffering resulting from injuries and accidents and reduce losses associated with damage of property.\n\n\n\nOne of the activities associated with the Plant Safety Program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response programs which are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119), and EPA's Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68). The Plant Manager is responsible for implementation of the Risk Management Program.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response program is to prevent the occurrence and minimize the consequences of significant releases of anhydrous ammonia, including exposure, fire or explosion.  Overall, these programs help prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses, environmental impacts and physical property damage.\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs help prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, and/or equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the "

Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe Tip Top Poultry, Marietta, GA facility is a chicken processing facility which receives live chickens and processes them for distribution via slaughter, chilling, cutup, packaging, and then chilling or freezing them.  The facility operates two separate ammonia refrigeration systems to provide cooling and freezing capabilities for processing and storage areas.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in the combined systems is in excess of 10,000 pounds.  The inventory in the Engine Room 1 system is approximately 12,000 pounds.  The inventory in the Engine Room 3 system is approximately 12,000 pounds giving a combined total of 24,000 lbs. \n\n\n\nThe Engine Room 1 system is a High/Intermediate pressure system used to cool processes and workspaces throughout the facility.  The Engine Room 3 system is a Intermediate/Low pressure system used to cool docks and storage areas and provide refrigeration for Freezers operating down to -30 deg. F.\n\n\n\nAn ammonia release from the system poses a risk of offsite public and/or environmental injury or impact.  The system is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119).  The system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's RMP (40 CFR Part 68) program.\n\n\n\nC.   Summary of Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario at the facility for the ammonia refrigeration process involves the release of 7,400 pounds of anhydrous ammonia over a 10 minute period from Engine Room #1 due to the failure of the high pressure receiver (V-1) in the Engine Room 1 system when the entire system volume is pu"

Under worst-case weather conditions the toxic endpoint is 1.0 miles. This distance has been calculated based on the RMP Comp method provided in EPA's Risk Management Program (40 CFR 68) Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n\n\n- The worst-case weather conditions which were used for this scenario are not typical and industry standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of the receiver.  \n\n- The receiver is located in a low traffic area within the engine room which minimizes the possibility of loss of containment due to vehicular impact (e.g., from forklifts etc.)\n\n- Ammonia is not corrosive in this service.\n\n- Pressure safety valves limit operating pressure in the receiver.\n\n- The facility has a preventive maintenance program in place to maintain the on-going integrity of vessels.\n\n- The facility has a training program designed to ensure that the system is operated by qualified personnel\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario for ammonia at the Marietta, GA facility involves the release of ammonia for a period of 30 minutes through a defective pressure safety valve, which lifts to relieve high system pressure but fails to reseat properly (PSV) at a rate of 56.7 lbs/min.  Under alternative release weather conditions, the toxic endpoint is calculated by RMP Comp at .1 miles.  This distance has been calculated based on the method provided in EPA's Risk Management Program (40 CFR 68) Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration using the RMP Comp program.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n\n\n- Industry standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of the pressure relief devices.\n\n- The system is operated at considerably lower pressures compared to the PSV's relief pressure setting.\n\n- Ammonia is not corrosive in this service.\n\n-"

Employees are involved when a process hazard analysis is conducted.  The program also ensures that all employees have complete access to the program.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information: Information has been collected which enables the employees to identify and understand the potential hazards in the refrigeration systems. The written information includes the ammonia SDS and a description of the design of the ammonia refrigeration systems.  Information is complete per the PSM/RMP requirements.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis: Formal studies using the What-if and What-If/Checklist Techniques have been conducted to examine the ammonia refrigeration system and identify potential hazards.  PHAs are reviewed on a five-year basis. Any recommendations made either have been resolved or are part of ongoing work to improve facility safety.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:  Written, detailed procedures have been developed which describe the steps which should be followed to safely operate the ammonia refrigeration system.  Procedures are reviewed annually and updated if necessary.\n\n\n\nTraining: A training program has been developed which ensures that employees are trained on all aspects of the system and on the duties which they should perform to ensure the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n \n\nContractors: All contractors are screened and evaluated before they perform work on or near the ammonia refrigeration systems.

The review verifies that all safety programs and procedures are in place, that training has been performed, and construction has been completed according to design standards before the project is put into use. They are also performed when there is a change in the process safety information.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:  Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) are developed for each process covering all the equipment controls and process operations.  The SOPs are developed consistent with PSM/RMP requirements.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity:  This program ensures that the ammonia refrigeration systems are built and maintained using recommended and recognized preventive maintenance procedures to minimize unexpected breakdowns or failures.  Maintenance personnel are trained regularly, and spare parts and maintenance supplies are used which are consistent with good engineering practices and manufacturer's recommendations.\n\n\n\nHot Work Permit: This permitting procedure for all hot work ensures that a signed permit is obtained prior to any cutting, welding, or burning; this indicates that all necessary precautions have been taken.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change: Procedures are designed to ensure that all changes made to the ammonia refrigeration systems are properly reviewed for safety and against Best Engineering Practices criterion, that all the necessary and required information is obtained updated and that safety evaluations, e.g. PHA, have been performed.
