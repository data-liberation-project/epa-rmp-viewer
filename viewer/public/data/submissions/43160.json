Many of our employees are members of Local Emergency Planning Committees.  Our facilities have written emergency preparedness plans that are updated regularly.  \n\nAshland facilities typically host open houses every 3 to 5 years as an opportunity for neighbors to learn about our commitment to safety.  Ashland makes an effort to support our communities through sponsorship of local activities and participation in many local organizations.\n\nA description of the facility and the regulated substances handled:  \n\nThis facility is a chemical distribution warehouse.  Pentane arrives via rail car and tanker truck, is stored in an above-ground storage tank, is repackaged into drums, is transferred to storage, and subsequently loaded for shipment.  Isopentane arrives via tanker truck is repackaged into drums, is transferred to storage, and subsequently loaded for shipment.  \n\nFor more information, visit our web site at www.ashland.com or contact the Plant Manager.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThis facility is operated in strict accordance with the USEPA prevention program requirements.

      "SummaryText": "ating procedures.  Our management system procedures ensure rigorous training for operations employees, numerous management checks and balances, and strict attention to changes in the operations with a thorough review and examination of potential incidents that could lead to an accidental release.  Ashland maintains a 24-hour corporate emergency reporting system that can speedily coordinate emergency response with management and quickly communicate key first aid or medical information to local health care providers.  This facility has emergency medical treatment information readily available for use in an emergency.  \n\nFive-year accident history: \n\nWe have never had a release of pentane or isopentane that has resulted in or could have resulted in an offsite impact.\n\nThe emergency response program:\n\nOur employees will not respond offensively to releases of hazardous materials, but will rely on local emergency responders in the event of a release.  Our employees regularly undergo training in defensive emergency response actions.  This facility regularly invites the local fire department and emergency responders to tour and inspect our plant and gain familiarity with our operations.  This facility has a written emergency preparedness plan that is updated regularly.  \n\nPlanned changes to improve safety: \n\nOur facility continually evaluates and implements employee suggestions and recommendations resulting from routine hazard reviews.  We make changes to improve safety based on comments and information developed within our organization and the industry.  Toward continuous improvement, we are looking at ways to minimize risk through process improvement and re-design.  Ashland is committed to the Amercian Chemistry Council's Responsible CareSM Initiative Management Code on Process Safety."
