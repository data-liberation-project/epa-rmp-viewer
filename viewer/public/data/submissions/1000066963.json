This commitment is reflected in the safety and environmental programs that are implemented at the facility.  For example, written procedures have been created for operating the ammonia refrigeration system.  Only trained operators are permitted to perform system operations.  Arctic Glacier USA has also developed a robust maintenance program to ensure the equipment is in good operating condition.  All of these programs are geared towards the prevention of an accidental release at the facility.  In addition, these programs incorporate emergency procedures to mitigate the effects of a release if it does occur.  At such an event, emergency coordinators will assess the situation and notify outside responding agencies as necessary.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nArctic Glacier USA is located at 2003 S. Cherry Avenue in Fresno, California.  Ammonia is used in the facility's refrigeration system to provide cooling for production and storage of ice.  The system uses a maximum of 14,000 pounds of ammonia.  A description of how the process operates is presented below:\r\n\r\nThe refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of high pressure liquid ammonia from the High Pressure Receiver to the Subcooler and Direct Expansion Evaporators (Room 6 & 7). Subcooled liquid is sent to the Low Temp Pump Receivers (2), Ice Bin Surge Drum & Evaporator, Room 2 Surge Drums and Evaporators, and Tigar Turbo Ice Maker and Surge Drum. The two Pump Receivers send recirculated liquid to the Turbo Ice Makers and Freezer Evaporators (Room 3, 4, & 5). The vapor from each piece of equipment is returned through the main suction header to the Accumulators (2).  Each accumulator has an associated Transfer Vessel which sends liquid to a third Transfer Vessel which returns liquid ammonia to the High Pressure Receiver."

A common discharge header delivers hot gas to selected evaporators for defrost purposes.  The main discharge header is sent to the condensers (3) where it is condensed to a high pressure liquid and returned to the High Pressure Receiver.\r\n\r\nArctic Glacier USA operates the refrigeration system at the facility 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The facility has full time maintenance operators. Preventative maintenance is conducted by the maintenance staff and, as needed, the refrigeration contractor.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \r\n\r\nArctic Glacier USA has developed an accidental release prevention program for compliance with the OES CalARP regulation.  The program includes but is not limited to the following elements:\r\n\r\n\u00bf Safety information regarding the chemical hazards, and operating and technical specifications for the equipment;\r\n\u00bf Written procedures for operating and maintaining the processes;\r\n\u00bf Training for employees involved with system operations and maintenance;\r\n\u00bf Written procedures for managing system changes and startup of a modified process;\r\n\u00bf Investigating releases and near misses and implementing measures to prevent recurrence;\r\n\u00bf Written procedures for conducting hot work on or near the regulated processes;\r\n\u00bf Contractor management policies to ensure contract employee safety while on facility premises; \r\n\u00bf Audit procedures for ensuring that the programs are being implemented in accordance to the regulations; and \r\n\u00bf Employee involvement in program development and implementation. \r\n\r\nIn addition, engineering controls have been implemented to reduce the chance of an accidental release to the environment.  These are comprised of equipment monitoring systems and safety cutouts to shut off the equipment when operating parameters exceed safe operating limits.  Relief valves on pressurized ammonia vessels prevent equipment rupt"

Regular inspections and tests are performed to ensure these controls are in good working order.\r\n \r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nA review of the facility's five year accident history showed that there have been no incidents at the facility that meet the RMP criteria for a reportable accident (onsite deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place).  In addition, there have been no incidents at the facility in the last five years that resulted in a release of more than the Federal Reportable Quantity (100 pounds). \r\n\r\nThe facility did have one release in October 2017 in which the oil return line from the coalescer on the oil side of Compressor #5 released oil and ammonia vapor into the engine room. The refrigeration contractor was onsite and activated the E Stop and closed the King valve to stop the release. As a precautionary measure the building was evacuated and notifications were made to the NRC, state and CUPA. It was determined that metal fatigue and harmonic vibration caused the stainless steel tubing compression fitting to break. Repairs were made to the line. Less than 25 lbs of ammonia mixed with oil were released.\r\n\r\nThey also had one near miss that involved a forklift impacting a small pipe on LTA-1 in the engine room however no ammonia was released from the system. \r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nArctic Glacier USA has developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) for the purpose of protecting employees and the surrounding community.  The EAP covers procedures for: 1) evacuating and accounting for visitors and employees, 2) dealing with an ammonia release and other foreseeable emergencies that could occur onsite, 3) notifying external agencies and emergency response personnel, and 4) administering first aid measures for ammonia exposure.  Employees are informed of the elements of the EAP.  In the event of"

The recommendations mainly consist of formalizing procedures, implementing practices consistent with industry standards, and performing inspections and tests to maintain the integrity of the equipment.  Arctic Glacier USA has implemented several of these action items and is moving forward with completing the remaining outstanding recommendations.   In addition, the facility plans to continue providing employees with a safe work environment through continued training on current policies and procedures, and conducting audits to identify deficiencies and make improvements."
