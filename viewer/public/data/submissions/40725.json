Burlington Consumers Cooperative policy is to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulation in order to:\n1. Prevent unnecessary human exposure,\n2. Reduce the threat to employees health, and \n3. To reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.\nSafety depends upon the manner in which an accidental release is handled, combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of the operation, the safe handling procedures used and the training of personnel.\n\nBurlington Consumers Cooperative complies with the provision of \"Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61-1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  Burlington Consumers Cooperative emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority, the LEPC and any potentially affected neighbors.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia\nAt this facility, anhydrous ammonia is stored and distributed for resale to farmers and other customers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received by truck, and stored in an 18,000 gallon tank.  The anhydrous ammonia is distributed for direct application.\n\nThe maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored at this facility is 71,500 pounds (18,000 gallon tank times 4.67 pounds/gallon times 85%).\n\nRELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia\nWorst case scenario - Failure of the 18,000 gallon tank when filled to 85% capacity would release 71,500 pounds.  The anhydrous ammonia would be released as a gas over"
