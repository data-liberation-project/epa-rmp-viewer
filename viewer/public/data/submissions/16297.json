      "SummaryText": "1.  The Facility Policy:  The owners and family employees of Avery Fertilizer are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training of all persons that work with the material.  Should an accidental release occur, we have oriented the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information:  The primary activity at Avery Fertilizer is the storage for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The maximum quantity stored would be 56,078 pounds in the facility's one tank.  The water capacity of this tank is 12,000 gallons.\n\n3.  Worst Case Scenario:  The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as a gas over 4.5 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 56,078 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards and company procedures.  A release of this magnitude would cause off-site consequences.\n\nThe alternative-case scenario is assumed to be a release from the rupture of a 1.5 inch transfer hose with 7,100 lbs released over 2 minutes.  Off-site consequences are likely.\n\n4.  Accidental Release Program:  Avery Fertilizer complies with the rules and regulations relating to the Handling and Storage of Anhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions, Equipment, Containers and Storage Facilities.  These regulations administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture are consistent with ANSI K61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  \n\n5.  Five Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the past five years that "

Emergency Response Program:  Avery Fertilizer has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and provides state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III of EPCRA.  Our emergency response action plan has been reviewed with the local fire department and provided to the local emergency planning committee for coordination in the community response planning.\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety:  Safety improvements are an on-going process at Avery Fertilizer.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
