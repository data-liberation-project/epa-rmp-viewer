      "SummaryText": "Doug Kline Crop Service, Inc, further referenced as DKCS has the following response. There is an emergency plan to rely on on outside contractors in the event of a major vessel rupture. There has been no history of any accidents or releases at this facility. There has been no injuries related to Ammonia at this facility. It is the management plan to minimize storage volumes and length of time stored of NH3 at inspection of equipment, including piping, valves and popoffs, with daily inspection in season, and operator training of all employees. DKCS is in compliance with state operational proceedures. The last hazard review at this facility was Friday, October 31, 2008. DKSC has ammonia stored in 2 tanks, a 30,000 and a 18,000 vessel, which have independent plumbing. A worst case release would involve 60,000 lbs of NH3 at 15,000 lbs a minute with an endpoint distance of 1.2 miles effecting a population density of 2,500 people in four minutes with a wind speed of 1.5 miles an hour. The major hazard would be toxic gas release due to one of the following, overpressurization, corrosion, overfilling, or equipment failure. The alternative release would involve 6,000 lbs of NH3 and effect 1,250 people in a radius of .56 miles with a wind speed of 3 mps in 2 minutes. In summary there is a potential for a major number of injuries and possible resuting deaths in a worst case problem and a potential for a number of injuries in an alternative release event. Employee awareness and management is the key to limiting exposure to toxic fumes. It is noted that a major release of 60,000 lbs of NH3 would require outside contract help and local emergency response to limit injuries and death."
