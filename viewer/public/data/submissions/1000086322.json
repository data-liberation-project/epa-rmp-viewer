(Univar Solutions) is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nUnivar Solutions is a wholesale chemical distributor serving a number of U.S. industries. Founded in 1924, the company supplies the food industry, chemical compounders, pharmaceuticals, mining, forest products, oil and gas producers, electronics, coatings, public utilities and many other key industries with the chemical raw materials required to produce or refine products used in numerous end-use markets.\n\n\n\nOne (1) of the products stored and handled (37% Hydrochloric Acid) at the facility is subject to EPA's Risk Management Program rule (40 CFR Part 68) and two (2) of the products stored and handled (37% Hydrochloric Acid and 30% Aqua Ammonia) are subject to California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Regulations, 19 CCR 2770.5. These products are delivered to the facility by common carrier truck in sealed, UN Specification containers and stored in our warehouse until distributed to end-use customers. The products are warehoused in their original factory-packaged sealed containers, and are not opened, used, or repackaged in any way prior to sale. Univar Solutions must maintain sufficient inventory to meet customer demand, but for safety and business reasons we also attempt to maintain those levels as low as possible. \n\n\n\n3.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nUnivar Solutions has taken all the necessary steps to comply "

      "SummaryText": "with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68. \n\n\n\nChemical-specific prevention steps undertaken at our facility include the following:\n\n?    Maintaining minimal inventory.\n\n?    Developing Standard Operating Procedures on safe handling of the material and reviewing annually to ensure they are maintained current and up-to-date.\n\n?    Providing emergency response training on how to respond, if a release occurs.\n\n?    Storing and handling the materials in appropriate and sealed UN Specification containers, and in designated locations based on compatibility and safety considerations.\n\n?    Ensuring that materials remain in their original sealed factory packaging and containers are not opened for any reason.\n\n\n\n4.    Five-year Accident History\n\nThis is the initial submission of the RMP.  The site has not had the regulated substances onsite in the last five years.\n\n\n\n5.    Emergency Response Plan\n\nThe facility has a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials. The site is a defensive responder and has coordinated their emergency response plan with local emergency responders.\n\n\n\n6.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nRecommendations from the 2020 PHA will be implemented. The facility continuously looks for opportunities to improve their safety program during site walks, from employee recommendations and from incident investigations.\n\n"
