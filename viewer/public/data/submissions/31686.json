              "Description": "The Dairyman's Land O'Lakes facility contains 4 refrigeration system processes which use Anhydrous Ammonia. The largest process at the facility is the Plant 1 & 2 main refrigeration system. The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia in the Plant 1 & 2 system process is 25,688 pounds. Although the Plant 1 & 2 ammonia refrigeration system is the only process present above the EPA threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds, the facility has choosen to designate all Anhydrous Ammonia refrigeration systems at the facility as Program Level 3 processes and subject to the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals Standard (29 CFR 1910.119). Everything contained in the plant 1 & 2 Main refrigeration system prevention program applies to all 4 anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system processes, with no exceptions. The reportable quantity for ammonia is 100 pounds.\n\nThere are two types of cooling systems utilized in the Dairyman?s Plant 1 & 2 Main refrigeration system:  absorption and vapor compression.  In the absorption (or flooded) type system, liquid ammonia flowing from the receiver through coils of a heat exchanger, where either water or glycol are flowing counter currently on the shell side of the coils, is cooled by the liquid to vapor phase change of ammonia as it boils.  The ammonia vapors are then compressed and liquefied in a condenser for reuse.\n\nA vapor compression system consists of four basic components; the compressor, condenser, expansion valve, and evaporator.  The cycle involves two pressures, high and low, which enables the system to produce a continuous cooling effect.  Low pressure vapor is compressed, raising temperatures and pressure levels.  During compression, heat of compression is added to the vapor as the pressure is raised.  At the condenser, the high pressure vapor is liquefied by cooling.  The liquid ammonia flows from the condenser to an expansion valve where its pressure and temperature are reduced.  The ammonia moves to the evaporator where it absorbs heat from a fluid being cooled.  Vaporized ammonia then flows to the compressor suction to complete the refrigeration cycle.\n \nThe ammonia vapors from both types of cooling systems flow through a liquid accumulator where any entrained liquids are knocked out of the gas stream prior to being compressed.  This prevents damage to the compressors.  The accumulated liquids are pumped back to the receivers.\n\nThe Dairyman?s Plant 1 & 2 Main refrigeration system is a closed loop system and designed to run continuously.  When required, the refrigeration system is recharged with ammonia by off-loaded bulk ammonia to the ammonia receivers.  Ammonia is off-loaded through the tanker's flexible hose connected to the receiver's hard piped charge line.  Recharging only occurs when there has been a loss of ammonia from the system.  Under normal operation, these losses result from fugitive sources (i.e., pump seals, valves, flanges) and from routine maintenance of equipment.\n\nPiping and Instrumentation Diagrams;\n \nComprehensive and up to date piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs) for the 4 anhydrous ammonia refrigeration systems are maintained by the Plant Engineer.  \n\nVentilation System Design;\n\nThe facility has three ammonia engine rooms.  The plant 1 engine room ventilation system consists of three air intake areas and two exhaust fans. The plant 3 engine room ventilation system consists of three air intake louvers and two exhaust fans. The plant 4 engine room ventilation system consists of three air intake louvers and two exhaust fans as well.  One exhaust fan in each of the engine rooms is run continuously. When ammonia is detected at a concentration of 300 PPM the detector automatically activates the emergency ventilation exhaust fans. The ventilation system design data is maintained by the Plant Engineer.\n\nSafety Systems;\n\nAmmonia sensors and control panels are installed in each of the three engine rooms and automatically activate the ventilation system and audible /visual alarms inside and outside the engine rooms. A sail switch is provided on each of the engine rooms continuous exhaust fans.  If a fan fails to operate properly, the sail switch activates an audible/visual alarm inside and outside the engine room.\n\nSafety systems design data are maintained by the Plant Engineer.\n\nInformation Pertaining to the Hazards of Ammonia are contained in the MSDS for anhydrous ammonia.  The MSDS meets the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.1200 (g).  This information is also provided as part of each Maintenance Departments Ammonia Refrigeration System Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) Manual.\n\nMaterials of Construction;\n\nInformation on the materials of construction is provided in the facility refrigeration system specifications and on construction drawings maintained by the Plant Engineer.  \n\nElectrical Classification;\n\nThe engine room and plant are not managed as classified areas.  The three engine rooms have ventilation systems that meet current ASHRAE ventilation standards, which exempts the engine rooms from being operated as a classified area. Ventilation system design data is maintained by the Plant Engineer.\n\nMaterial and Energy Balances;\n\nMaterial and energy balances have been developed for the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system and are maintained by the Plant Engineer.\n\nRelief System Design;\n\nThe facilities refrigeration system anhydrous ammonia relief system is designed in accordance with ANSI/ASHRAE standard 15-2001 specifications and are contained on construction drawings maintained by the Plant Engineer.  \n \nDesign Codes and Standards;\n\n2001 Uniform Mechanical Code; Chapter 15, Mechanical Refrigeration Equipment\n\n1988 Uniform Fire Code; Article 63, Mechanical Refrigeration Article 80, Hazardous Materials\n\nASME/ANSI B31.3-1999 Edition; Process Piping\n\nASME B31.3 - 1999 Edition; 345 Testing\n\nANSI/ASHRAE 15 ?2001; Safety Standard for Mechanical Refrigeration\n\nANSI/IIAR2 ? 1999; Equipment Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical \nRefrigerating Systems\n\nIIAR Bulletin No. R1-1983; Good Practices for the Operation of an Ammonia \nRefrigeration System\n\nIIAR Bulletin No. 107 ? 1997; Suggested Safety and Operating Procedures When \nMaking Ammonia Refrigeration Plant Tie-Ins\n\nIIAR Bulletin No. 108; Water Contamination in Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\n\nIIAR Bulletin No. 109 ? 1997; IIAR Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safe \nAmmonia Refrigeration System\n\nIIAR Bulletin No. 111 ? 1991; Ammonia Machinery Room Ventilation\n\nIIAR Bulletin No. 112 ? 1998; Ammonia Machinery Room Design\n\nIIAR Bulletin No. 114 ? 1991; Identification of Ammonia Refrigeration Piping and System Components\n\nIIAR Bulletin No. 116 ? 1992; Avoiding Component Failure in Industrial \nRefrigeration Systems Caused by Abnormal Pressure or Shock\n\nCCR, Title 8, Section 458 ?

The potential hazards associated with these operations have been identified through a formal process hazard assessment and any action items will be addressed in a timely manner.\n\nWritten Operating Procedures;\n\nWritten Standard Operating Procedures (SOP's) for the Dairyman's facilities 4 anhydrous ammonia refrigeration processes have been developed in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard (29 CFR Part 1910.119). The facilities SOP's provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in each covered process, consistent with the process safety information. The operating  procedures include the following information:  \n\n? Steps involved in initial startup; startup after an emergency shutdown or turnaround; normal operations; temporary operations; normal shutdown; and emergency operations and shutdown procedures, including the condition under which shut down is required and the assignment of emergency shutdown responsibilities to qualified personnel.\n\n? Process conditions and operating steps necessary for safe operation.  \n\n? Consequences of deviations and responses to correct or avoid deviations from the process limits for safe operation.  \n\n? Release information, such as the properties and hazards of materials used in the process, precautions to prevent exposures, remedial actions for a release, any special or unique hazards, and procedures for quality control of raw materials and hazardous chemical inventories.  \n\n? Functions of safety systems.  \n\n? Safe work practices, for activities such as lockout/tagout, confined-space entry, line breaking and vessel opening, and control over personnel entering and exiting a facility.  \n\nThe operating procedures are readily accessible to the operators and are reviewed as often as necessary to ensure that they remain current.  The accuracy of the procedure is certified annually. \n \nMechanical Integrity;\n\nWritten procedures have been developed to ensure the mechanical integrity of the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration process equipment, including pressure vessels, storage tanks, pumps, piping systems, relief systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, alarms, and interlocks.  These procedures include the following:\n\n? Tests and inspections to be performed and their frequency;\n\n? Training for maintenance personnel in the above-described procedures and an overview of the process and its hazards;\n\n? Test and inspection documentation, including the date of the test or inspection, the name of the person performing the task, the identity of the equipment, the task performed, and the results of the test or inspection;\n\n? Procedures for correcting deficiencies either:  (1) before further use of the equipment, or (2) in a timely manner when precautions are taken to ensure continued safe operation; and \n\n? Quality control procedures to ensure maintenance equipment, materials, and spare parts meet design specifications and are properly utilized.\n\nThe tests, inspections, and their frequency are on manufacturers recommendations, codes and standards, or good engineering practice.\nPresently, the following maintenance activities are conducted:\n\n? The system performance is reviewed during each operating shift and system parameters are logged.  Maintenance personnel walk through the facility three times daily to visually inspect the system.  If anything unusual is noted it is either immediately repaired, or a work order is generated to initiate the repair or modifications.\n\n? Any unusual performance or ammonia odors are promptly investigated by maintenance personnel.  \n\n? Parts are only replaced with their identical components unless authorization is given by the Plant Engineer and a Management of Change form is completed.  \n\n? Copies of equipment information are kept in the Maintenance office.  \n\n? Associates involved in the PM program are trained in the anhydrous ammonia processes and hazards.  The maintenance staff is trained by more experienced staff that is qualified in the maintenance and operation of the equipment.\n\n? Deficiencies are corrected as required to maintain a safe working environment.  Maintenance materials, spare parts, and equipment have been reviewed for compatibility with the anhydrous ammonia processes.\n\n? The facility is insured for fire.  The fire protection system including fire extinguishers are inspected each year.  The boilers are insured and inspected annually by an outside contractor.  Pressure vessels are inspected annually by the insurer.\n\nEquipment maintenance records are kept in the maintenance office.  The records are kept indefinitely.  \n\nAccess Control Procedures;\n\nPlant 1 power yard is fenced and gated, access is restricted to authorized personnel. Exterior doors to both plant 3 and 4 engine rooms are locked.\n\nContractors;\n\nThe management of contractors working within the facility is a significant part of the prevention program.  The facility has a comprehensive contractor management program.  The contractor management program begins with an initial screening of the contractor.  Then, maintenance management personnel are assigned to oversee each aspect of contractor management.  The following elements summarize the main points of the facility's contractor management program:\n\nAll contractors must supply required information to complete the facilities Contractor Pre-Qualification Checklist prior to being approved for work.\n\nAll ammonia refrigeration contractors are assigned an internal manager.\n\nContractors are required to check in each day.\n\nContractors are required to follow all facility environmental, health, and safety rules or are subject to dismissal.  Each contract work area is monitored periodically for health and safety compliance by the area supervisor.  \n\nContractor is escorted to work area the first day and monitored by Dairyman's staff throughout the project.\n\nPeriodically during large projects, or at the conclusion of smaller ones, each contractor is evaluated (using a Contractor Safety Performance Evaluation Form) for compliance with safety requirements.  Based upon this performance assessment, a decision is made as to whether the contractor will be permitted to remain on the bid list.\n\nAll contract employees working on the anhydrous ammonia system receive a comprehensive site orientation session covering topics contained in the Contractor Orientation Checklist.  \n\nAll hazardous work performed by the contractor requiring the completion of permits (e.g., hot work, lockout /tagout, etc.) is conducted in accordance with the facility procedures.  \n\nContractors must make a verbal report to Dairyman's by the end of the shift, and produce a written report to the Facility Safety Manager of any injuries; vehicle incidents; and incidents involving damage to property, spills, fires, theft, or loss of equipment, prior to the end of the next working day.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews;\n\nThe Dairyman's facility conducts pre-startup safety reviews (PSSRs) on any new or modified equipment or facility to confirm that the as-built installation meets the design specifications. That adequate safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place, and that operators are trained in these procedures before starting of the equipment.\n\n\nManagement of Change Procedures;\n\nThe Dairyman's facility has developed modification control procedures to be used when the technical basis of a design and/or the equipment design basis changes.  These procedures apply to any additions, deletions, or modifications to process chemicals, technology, equipment, and operating procedures.  However, these procedures do not apply to replacements in kind (RIK).  \n\nThe modification control procedures ensure and document that the following issues are addressed prior to making any change:  \n\nThe technical basis of the proposed change,\n\nAny related safety and health considerations,\n\nAny necessary operating procedure modifications,\n\nThe necessary time period for making the proposed change, and \n\nRequired authorizations for the proposed changes.\n\nAll personnel affected by the change, including contract employees, must be trained in and informed of the change before the implementation of the change.  For changes involving operating procedures and process safety information, the procedures and process safety information must be updated. \n\nHot Work Program;\n\nThis facility has developed a system for issuing permits for all hot work operations conducted on or near a covered process (e.g., process involving anhydrous ammonia).  The permit (1) documents compliance with OSHA's fire prevention and protection requirements, which are presented in 29 CFR 1910.252(a); (2) identifies the time period authorized for hot work; and (3) identifies the equipment on which the hot work is to be performed.  The permit must be issued before the start of the hot work and must be kept at the site where the hot work will be performed. \n\nFacility Permit System;\n\nHot work is any activity within an area that could potentially produce a spark or involve an open flame.  The Hot Work Policy and Permit System  outlines the requirements and responsibilities associated with conducting hot work at the facility.  The facility maintains an effective hot work permit procedure as part of an overall hot work system.  The written program for hot work contains the following:\n  \nThe Plant Engineer, Maintenance Manager/Foreman, Production Supervisor, PSM Coordinator or the EHS are qualified to authorize the performance of hot work.\n\nA list of locations where hot work permits are required (or hot work permits are not required). \n\nA training program for associates designated to authorize hot work (e.g., maintenance and operating personnel).  This training program includes specific instructions on:\n\nThe types of hazards to look for, precautions that can be taken, and locations and situations in which hot work is prohibited; \n\nThe use, calibration, and limitation of lower explosive limit (LEL) monitoring equipment; \n\nWhen cutting and welding is permitted;\n\nLocation of fire safe areas;\n\nSafeguards used while cutting, welding and using open flame;\n\nProper use of fire extinguisher;\n\nUnderstanding of inspection area before and after work completed;\n\nMaintenance of cutting and welding equipment;\n\nUse of Permit; and\n\nUse of combustible gas detection instruments.\n\nHot work permit applications are available in the maintenance shop.  Approved and/or completed hot work permits are maintained in the office of the Maintenance Manager for one year after the job has been completed.\n\nIncident Investigation:\n\nDairyman's incident investigation procedures have been developed to investigate catastrophic releases of a highly hazardous chemical in the workplace or situations that could have resulted in such a catastrophic release.  These procedures include the following required activities:  \n\nInitiate the investigation as soon as possible and no later than within 48 hours of the incident.\n\nEstablish an incident investigation team that includes:  (1) at least one person knowledgeable about the subject process; (2) other individuals with appropriate knowledge and experience to thoroughly analyze and investigate the incident; and (3) a contract employee, if the incident involved a contractor.\n\nPrepare an incident report for each incident.

              "Description": "The Dairyman's Land O'Lakes facility Plant 1 Ice Bank ammonia refrigeration system process contains 7,633 pounds of anhydrus ammonia. Although the Plant 1 Ice Bank ammonia refrigeration system is not above the EPA threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds, the facility has choosen to designate this Anhydrous Ammonia refrigeration system process as a Program Level 3 process and subject to the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals Standard (29 CFR 1910.119). Everything contained in the plant 1 & 2 Main refrigeration system prevention program applies to the Plant 1 Ice Bank anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system process, with no exceptions. The reportable quantity for ammonia is 100 pounds.\n\nTh Dairyman?s Plant 1 Ice Bank refrigeration system is a latent heat storage unit which stores refrigeration in the form of ice. The latent heat storage resulting from the change in state from water to ice is the key\nto the success of these units. Large quantities of refrigeration can be stored in a relatively small space. The ice is produced during periods of low demand for refrigeration or electrical energy. It is then used at a later time in the form of 32o F to 34o F cooling water:  The cooling process is the absorption (or flooded) type were liquid ammonia is flowing from the receiver through coils of the Ice Bank heat exchanger, where water is flowing counter currently on the outer tube side of the coils, is cooled by the liquid to vapor phase change of ammonia as it boils. The ammonia vapors are then compressed and liquefied in a condenser for reuse.\n\nA vapor compression system consists of four basic components; the compressor, condenser, expansion valve, and evaporator (Ice Bank).  The cycle involves two pressures, high and low, which enables the system to produce a continuous cooling effect.  Low pressure vapor is compressed, raising temperatures and pressure levels.  During compression, heat of compression is added to the vapor as the pressure is raised.  At the condenser, the high pressure vapor is liquefied by cooling.  The liquid ammonia flows from the condenser to an expansion valve where its pressure and temperature are reduced.  The ammonia moves to the evaporator (Ice Bank) where it absorbs heat from a fluid being cooled.  Vaporized ammonia then flows to the compressor suction to complete the refrigeration cycle.\n \nThe ammonia vapors from this cooling system flow through a liquid accumulator where any entrained liquids are knocked out of the gas stream prior to being compressed.  This prevents damage to the compressors.  The accumulated liquids are pumped back to the receiver.\n\nThe Dairyman?s Plant 1 Ice Bank refrigeration system is a closed loop system and designed to run continuously.  When required, the refrigeration system is recharged with ammonia by off-loaded bulk ammonia to the ammonia receivers.  Ammonia is off-loaded through the tanker's flexible hose connected to the receiver's hard piped charge line.  Recharging only occurs when there has been a loss of ammonia from the system.  Under normal operation, these losses result from fugitive sources (i.e., pump seals, valves, flanges) and from routine maintenance of equipment.",

              "Description": "The Dairyman's Land O'Lakes facilities Plant 4 ammonia refrigeration system contains 2,400 pounds of Anyhydrous Ammonia. Although the Plant 4 ammonia refrigeration system is not above the EPA threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds, the facility has choosen to designate this Anhydrous Ammonia refrigeration system process as a Program Level 3 process and subject to the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals Standard (29 CFR 1910.119). Everything contained in the plant 1 & 2 Main refrigeration system prevention program applies to the Plant 4 anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system process, with no exceptions. The reportable quantity for ammonia is 100 pounds.\n\nThere are two types of cooling systems utilized in the Dairyman?s Plant 4 anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system:  absorption and vapor compression.  In the absorption (or flooded) type system, liquid ammonia flowing from the receiver through coils of a heat exchanger, where either water or glycol are flowing counter currently on the shell side of the coils, is cooled by the liquid to vapor phase change of ammonia as it boils.  The ammonia vapors are then compressed and liquefied in a condenser for reuse.\n\nA vapor compression system consists of four basic components; the compressor, condenser, expansion valve, and evaporator.  The cycle involves two pressures, high and low, which enables the system to produce a continuous cooling effect.  Low pressure vapor is compressed, raising temperatures and pressure levels.  During compression, heat of compression is added to the vapor as the pressure is raised.  At the condenser, the high pressure vapor is liquefied by cooling.  The liquid ammonia flows from the condenser to an expansion valve where its pressure and temperature are reduced.  The ammonia moves to the evaporator where it absorbs heat from a fluid being cooled.  Vaporized ammonia then flows to the compressor suction to complete the refrigeration cycle.\n \nThe ammonia vapors from both types of cooling systems flow through a liquid accumulator where any entrained liquids are knocked out of the gas stream prior to being compressed.  This prevents damage to the compressors.  The accumulated liquids are pumped back to the receivers.\n\nThe Dairyman?s Plant 4 refrigeration system is a closed loop system and designed to run continuously.  When required, the refrigeration system is recharged with ammonia by off-loaded bulk ammonia to the ammonia receivers.  Ammonia is off-loaded through the tanker's flexible hose connected to the receiver's hard piped charge line.  Recharging only occurs when there has been a loss of ammonia from the system.  Under normal operation, these losses result from fugitive sources (i.e., pump seals, valves, flanges) and from routine maintenance of equipment.",
