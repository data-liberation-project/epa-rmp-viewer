At the local level, the program is implemented by the Certified Unified Permitting Agency (CUPA). For facilities operating within the City of Tulare, the CUPA is the Tulare County Environmental Health Department.\n\nThe Dairyman's, Division of Land O' Lakes, Inc. facilities consist of a creamery, engaged in the production of dairy products such as powered milk, cheese and butter from raw milk. Five (5) separate dairy processing facilities presently exist.\n                           \nAnhydrous ammonia, a regulated chemical is present above threshold quantities at the Dairyman's Division of  Land O'Lakes, Tulare facility. There are four individually covered anhydrous ammonia refrigeration processes with a total inventory of 37,827 pounds present on-site. The plant 1 & 2 main refrigeration system is the largest process at the facility but due to it's close proximity to the plant 1 Ice Bank anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system (stationary source) both refrigeration systems are conciderd to be one process under the EPA's reporting guide lines. Plant's 3 and 4 anhydrous ammonia refrigeration processes are stand alone systems and both combined contain less than the EPA's threshold quantity of anhydrous ammonia. Although the Plant 1 & 2 anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system is the only process present above the EPA threshold quantity, the facility has choosen to designate all Anhydrous Ammonia r"

A preventive maintenance check for inspection has been developed.  Piping and Instrument Drawings (P&ID?s) of the system including safety devices such as relief valve locations are mapped out in the facilities command center.  \n\nSafe Distance and Safe Places of Refuge;\n\nSafe distances will be determined by using the DOT Emergency Response Guidebook.
