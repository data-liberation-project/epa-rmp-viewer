      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nThe City of Defiance, Ohio is committed to the RMP requirements under 40 CFR Part 68 and recognizes the responsibility to prevent harm to employees and the public due to a chlorine release or a sulfur dioxide release. Defiance\u00c2\u00bfs accidental release prevention program integrates management practices, safety procedures, employee participation, process safety and operating information, process hazard analysis and compliance auditing, pre-start up reviews, mechanical integrity, management of change procedures, incident investigation, emergency planning and response, and updating practices and procedures. Applicable requirements for Program 3 Risk Management Programs are adhered to. The emergency response program is tailored with respect to the available emergency responders and the Defiance County LEPC and includes notification procedures as well as plant evacuation procedures.\n\nThere are two processes involved at the Defiance WPC facility. One is the storage of chlorine and sulfur dioxide containers. The second is the feeding of chlorine and sulfur dioxide to the WPC effluent.\n\nThe chlorination system for the Defiance WPCP is used to disinfect wastewater prior to discharge to the Maumee River. The chlorination facilities include outside storage for one-ton containers, a chlorine scale and feed room, various safety equipment and controls, two chlorinators, the necessary cylinder handling equipment, a chlorine gas alarm system and a residual chlorine analyzer. Normally chlorine is supplied from two one-ton containers connected to the process feed piping. The cylinders in service are controlled automatically using a switchover device that limits operation from a single cylinder. Plant operators check the operation of the chlorination system at least once each shift and respond to trouble or warning alarms.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis considers two chlorine release scenarios as the worst-case scenario and the alternate release scenario.
