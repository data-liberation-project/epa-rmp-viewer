The facility functions as a storage location for the fertilizer used by local farmers to grow the crops which provide high-quality, low-cost food for families around the world.\n\nFacility snapshot\n\nAnnual volume of 30,000 tons of anhydrous ammonia is put through the KNC facility, which has been supplying farmers in southern Minnesota and northern counties in Iowa for about 26 years.  As a storage facility, the Vernon Center Terminal provides a vital link in the chain of KNC inputs.  Ammonia, produced at KNC?s nitrogen manufacturing facility in Enid, OK, is shipped to the Vernon Center Terminal by pipeline where it is stored until needed by local farmers for their fields. \n \nImpact on the community \n\nWith an annual budget of over $400,000, KNC provides a considerable economic benefit to the Vernon Center community.  KNC is committed to customer service and the facility is available to service farmers as needed throughout the year.\n\nEmployee snapshot \n\nKNC contracts the operation of this facility to Williams Ammonia Pipeline Inc.  The contractor?s 3 full time employees provide years of experienced service to the area cooperatives.  Major maintenance projects for this facility are performed by KNC maintenance personnel.  These KNC employees are trained in all aspects of terminal maintenance including electrical and mechanical troubleshooting.\n\nPollution Prevention Policy \n\nKNC is committed to protecting the environment and preserving our natural resources for future generations.  We pledge to eliminate or reduce our use of toxic substances and minimize our use of energy and the generation of all wastes to the extent technically and economically feasible.

The RMP Rule requires facilities handling threshold amounts of certain substances to develop a RMP and submit a Risk Management Plan.  The Program requirements include submission of a Risk Management Plan, including a hazard assessment defining possible off-site impacts of certain regulated substance release scenarios, a five-year accident history, a description of the process accidental release prevention program, and an emergency response program.\n\nThe following is the Executive Summary of the RMP for KNC Vernon Center Terminal at Vernon Center, MN.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances \n\nInitial construction and operation of the Vernon Center Terminal began in 1973.  Several changes, additions and improvements since that time have resulted in the current design of the facility.  The anhydrous ammonia distributed from this facility is used as agricultural fertilizer.\n\nThe Vernon Center Terminal is a storage facility for ammonia consisting of a 28,000-ton atmospheric storage tank with a secondary containment dike, a product heater, refrigeration compressors and assorted vessels and piping.\n\nAmmonia is the only chemical substance regulated by the EPA?s RMP rule that is used or stored at the KNC Vernon Center Terminal.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Program \n\nIt is KNC?s corporate policy to eliminate accidental releases of any substance, particularly hazardous and regulated materials.

A knowledgeable, motivated and highly trained contract employee group\n?    A well-designed facility that is maintained and operated in a superior manner\n?    Implementation of a comprehensive PSM and Prevention Program\n?    Continual review and improvements that enhance safety and accident prevention\n?    Excellence in safety programs and practices, and a superior safety and accident record\n?    Planning, preparation and training for emergency response.\n\n\nThe Vernon Center Terminal has had a written Emergency Response Plan in effect for many years as required by the RMP and other EPA and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) rules.  The response plan is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and emergency response agencies.  On behalf of KNC, the contract personnel have interacted with these agencies for many years regarding the plan and activities at the terminal.\n\nContract employees are trained in the implementation of the plan and appropriate response that could be required in the event of an emergency.\n\nPrevention Program   \n\nThe Vernon Center Terminal process is subject to the OSHA PSM Rule, 29 CFR 1910.119.  This rule has required this facility to establish an accident prevention program for this process which is equivalent to that required for Program 3 processes under the EPA?s RMP rule.\n\nThe OSHA PSM/EPA Prevention program consists of a set of facility management policies and procedures that promote and recognize process safety and the prevention of accidents in processes that handle, use, and store or process hazardous materials.

      "SummaryText": "\n\nSynopsis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios:\n\nThe hazard assessment element of the RMP rule requires the evaluation of potential off-site effects of ?worst-case? and ? alternative? release scenarios of regulated substances.\n\nThe EPA has defined a ?worst-case? scenario as the release of the largest quantity of a listed chemical from a vessel or process line failure, taking into account passive mitigation and administrative controls.  The impact of these potential releases must be quantified in accordance with release criteria dictated in the rule.  The projected impact distance is determined using EPA-defined atmospheric conditions and is intended to provide a conservative estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected.  According to the EPA, the ?worst-case? scenario is intended to ensure that no potential risks to public health are overlooked, but the distance to an endpoint estimated under ?worst-case? should not be considered a ?public danger zone?.  Possible causes or the extreme improbability that such releases may occur are not considered.\n\nThe alternative release scenario definition is a release that is more likely to occur than the ?worst-case? release; however, as with the ?worst-case?, the alternative release improbability is not taken into consideration.\n\nWorst-Case Toxic Release ? Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nAmmonia is a colorless gas with a strong pungent odor and is one of the most widely used industrial chemicals.  It is prepared industrially from natural gas, steam and air.  Some of this ammonia is used for direct injection into croplands as a fertilizer.  A large amount of industrial ammonia is reacted with carbon dioxide to make urea fertilizer, or reacted to make ammonium nitrate fertilizer.  Ammonia is also frequently used as a refrigerant for the storage of perishable foods.\n\nAmmonia vapors can be irritating to the nose, throat, eyes and skin.  Direct liquid contact to the skin can cause severe burns.\n\nKNC has considered pote"

As required by the rule, the ?worst-case? release assumes that this entire quantity is released as a result of a catastrophic failure of the tank and subsequently evaporates from the diked pool.  This unlikely event was modeled with a publicly available model (DEGADIS) and the resulting end point distance is expected to be conservative.  The impact of this release scenario is predicted to extend beyond the facility boundary and impact public receptors.  \n\nWe believe this scenario is a hypothetical ?worst-case? event dictated by the rule and extremely unlikely to occur for many reasons.  In addition to the stringent design controls for this type of storage vessel, facility maintenance and inspection programs address the integrity of process and storage vessels, including this one, and largely preclude such massive and unlikely failures.\n\nAlternative Toxic Release ? Ammonia\n\nMore likely release events than the hypothetical ?worst-case? tend to concentrate in areas where the ammonia product is handled, such as loading, refrigeration area and other transport activities. Generally, significantly lower quantities are involved due to numerous shutdown safeguards present throughout the terminal.  Operator intervention tends to mitigate and limit the consequences of failures.\n\nThe hypothetical ammonia alternative release scenario considered for this process is release of ammonia due to the failure of a liquid relief valve on the product heater.  The valve is assumed to fail and release ammonia for 1 minute before employee intervention stops the release.  The impact of such a release was modeled with a publicly available model (DEGADIS), which shows that the impact of the release would extend off-site under typical a"

As a result, changes relevant to safety occur continuously as needs are identified through these procedures and policies."
