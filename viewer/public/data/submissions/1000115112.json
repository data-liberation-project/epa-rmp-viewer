      "SummaryText": "Coastal Water Authority\nLynchburg Pump Station \n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM PLAN \nExecutive Summary \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at Coastal Water Authority\u0092s Lynchburg facility are engrained in the fundamentals of our prevention program. \nIt is Coastal Water Authority\u0092s policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations.  However, the safe handling of hazardous chemicals is paramount at CWA and standards and recommended practices governing the safe handling of hazardous chemicals are often exceeded to ensure that a reasonable level of risk reduction is obtained.\nThe CWA believes that accountability for safety reaches throughout all levels of management.  Senior management\u0092s commitment and dedication to continued safe-operating practices is clearly evident in our organization structure and employee empowerment. Refer to the March 1, 2004 EPA audit for confirmation of this.\n\nFacility Description and regulated substances handled\n\nThe Lynchburg pump station covers approximately 220 acres, including reservoirs.  It is located at 908 Independence Parkway North, Baytown, Texas in Harris County. The facility treats a maximum of 600 million gallons of water per day. There is a maximum of 27 full-time employees at the plant site at any one time. \nOnly one chemical is presently handled that is considered hazardous by the EPA. This substance is present in quantities greater than the threshold identified by the RMP regulation and therefore is included in the risk management program.\n?\tChlorine \u0096 Chlorine is used as a water treatment chemical at the plant. It is received into the plant in one-ton containers.  These containers are standard DOT and Chlorine Institute specified containers.  Chlorine deliveries are received at the plant three (3) to four (4) times per week.  The plant has a maximum chlorine inventory of 120,000 pounds on-site, however onl"

      "SummaryText": "y six containers (12,000 pounds) are being used at any one time. \nCWA has discontinued the use of 25 percent aqueous ammonia. Instead, a 19 percent aqueous ammonia solution is utilized. Since this is below the regulatory 20 percent threshold (Appendix A), chemical safety management for aqueous ammonia is no longer required at the Lynchburg Pump Station.\nOffsite Consequence Analysis (worst-case & alternate cases) \nThe RMP rule requirements for identification and selection of a worst-case hazard scenario are prescriptive.  These requirements negate most safety systems designed to mitigate an incidental release that would typically be used in the event that an incident occurred.  Based on EPA defined Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance, CWA has one worst-case hazard scenario for the toxic material handled onsite. This scenario is estimated to create the greatest distance in any direction to an EPA defined concentration (endpoint) resulting from an accidental release.\nOur worst-case toxic scenario involves chlorine. Chlorine is used as a water treatment chemical at the plant. It is stored under its own vapor pressure in standard one ton containers located under a protective open-sided shed. The scenario uses the EPA\u0092s theoretical assumption that a container may catastrophically fail and release chlorine to the atmosphere. It completely negates any mitigation attempts and assumes that all 2,000 pounds of chlorine can be dispersed within 10 minutes to form a toxic vapor cloud that drifts offsite into the surrounding community.\nUsing the EPA\u0092s computer model RMP*Comp Version 2.01 to determine the greatest downwind distance, it was determined that a chlorine vapor cloud may extend 3.0 miles from the facility.\nThe EPA rule also requires that alternate or more likely accident scenarios involving regulated chemicals be identified. Other more likely chlorine incidents were assessed at CWA, using parameters prescribed in the RMP regulation. The analysis of the alternate"

      "SummaryText": "scenarios could include mitigation affects from both passive and active safety systems.  \nCWA conducted an iterative assessment of several alternate or more likely scenarios.  From the various scenarios assessed, CWA selected the following as a representative example of an alternative scenario:\n?\tInadvertent mishandling of a chlorine shipping container during delivery or while working in the area results in complete shearing of the container\u0092s valve, leaving a 0.31-inch orifice.  This failure assumes that 253 pounds per minute of chlorine is released.  Dispersion of the chlorine gas could result in the formation of a vapor cloud extending 0.7 miles (3,696 feet) from the facility.\n\n\nAccidental release program & chemical-specific prevention steps\n\nCoastal Water Authority originally contracted with an outside engineering firm to assist in the development of a prevention program tailored exclusively to water treatment operations, and we have collaborated with our engineer throughout every update.  This prevention program has been designed around mechanical integrity and training aspects.  The primary objective is to ensure complete containment of chlorine through safe operation and maintenance of the chlorination system.\nThe prevention program has been designed with the following objectives:\n?\tEnhancement of the mechanical integrity of all chlorine equipment and piping,\n?\tCompilation of safety information to improve hazard awareness, and\n?\tTraining to increase hazard recognition\n\nFive-year accident history\nCWA has a very comprehensive Incident Reporting and Investigation procedural process.  This process is defined and explained by CWA-008.  Basically, an incident occurs when a deviation from expected performance is experienced.\nFormal investigations are required to be conducted by appointed teams knowledgeable in operations or equipment being investigated.

We have made a concise decision to not respond to catastrophic releases of chlorine at the Lynchburg pump station.  Our employees have been instructed to call 911, notify the North Channel LEPC, notify the National Response Center (NRC), and to evacuate in the event of such a catastrophic incident.\nIn accordance with the requirements of the Risk Management Program rule, CWA is included in the North Channel local emergency response plan under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA).\n\nPlanned improvements to reduce risk\n\nInvestigation of inherently safer technologies presented by the Chlorine Institute, chlorine inventory reduction studies, and fail safe design applications are a few of the continuous improvements occurring at CWA.  Safety depends upon our management commitment, the manner in which we handle chlorine, the safety devices inherent to our chlorination system, our operating procedures and philosophies, and the training of our employees."
