Subsequently, EPA promulgated regulations that apply to all stationary sources with processes that contain more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance.  This regulation \"Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions\" (part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)) is intended to prevent accidental releases of substance that can cause serious harm to the public and the environment from short-term exposure and to mitigate the severity of releases that may occur.\n\nIn general, part 68 requires that if a facility stores or handles the regulated toxic or flammable substances is excess of the threshold quantities listed in the regulation that:\n\u00bf\tCovered facilities must develop and implement a risk management program (RMP program) and maintain documentation of the program at the site.  The RMP program will include an analysis of the potential off-site consequences of an accidental release, a five-year accident history, a release prevention program, and an emergency response plan.\n\u00bf\tCovered facilities also must develop and submit their initial risk management plan (RMP plan), which includes registration information, to the EPA no later than June 21, 1999.  The RMP plan provides a summary of the RMP program.  The RMP plan will be available to federal, state, and local government agencies and the public.\n\u00bf\tCovered facilities also must continue to implement the RMP program and update the RMP plan periodically or when the processes change.\n\nThe phrase \"risk management program\" (RMP program) refers to all the requirements of the RMP regulations, which must be implemented on an ong"

The RMP regulations define the acronym RMP as the RMP plan.  However, to avoid confusion and for clarity, \"RMP plan\" will be used in this document.\nThe Greensboro Olympic Products location falls under a Program 2 category.  \nThe RMP regulations require that the RMP program for covered facilities include the following:\n\u00bf\tHazard Assessment\n\u00bf\tPrevention Program\n\u00bf\tEmergency Response Program\n\u00bf\tRMP plan submittal\n\nThe following sections briefly describe each of these requirements.  \n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\nAll facilities must assess the following:\n\u00bf\tOne worst-case release scenario representing all toxic substances held at the facility in excess of threshold quantities.\n\u00bf\tAnd one worst-case release scenario representing all regulated flammable substances held at the facility in excess of threshold quantities.  \n\u00bf\tProgram 2 facilities must also assess at least one alternative release scenario for each regulated toxic substance and one alternative scenario representing all flammable substances held at the facility in excess of the threshold quantities. \n \nThe assessment includes dispersion modeling, identification of the area where off-site impacts are in excess of specified toxic or fire/explosion \"end-point\" criteria and estimating the potentially affected public and environmental receptors.  The assessment also includes a 5-year accident history involving releases of regulated substances.\nEPA had defined a worst-case release as the release as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance that results in the greatest distance from the point of release to a specified endpoint.  Passive mitigation (e.g. berms, dikes, drains) can be included in determining the distance to the specified endpoint.\n\n \n\nThe RMP regulations specify many of the parameters to be used to estimate these distances, including meteorology, release height, liqui"

Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we conduct business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\nMANAGEMENT PROGRAM\nThe RMP regulation explicitly requires a documented Management Program with a clear delineation of overall management responsibility for the RMP program and lines of authority for all personnel assigned responsibility for individual RMP program elements. Roles and responsibilities are laid out in Table 4.1.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\nEPA's Program 2 prevention program was designed for relatively simple processes at facilities outside the petrochemical industry that are not subject to OSHA's PSM regulations.  Program 2 requirements include simplified version of six of the 12 Program 3 elements.  These include:  hazard review; operating procedures; training; maintenance; comp"

The RMP regulation continues to allow a facility to evacuate and not actively respond to accidental releases, provided that the facility is included in the community emergency response plan developed under United States Code (U.S.C.) 11003 and that appropriate mechanisms are in place to notify emergency responders.  While the RMP regulation allows the use of plans and programs developed under prior emergency response regulations, it stipulates that the plan include items required under the statute, notably procedures for informing the public and local responders about a release.\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates the various federal, state and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning. Our program provides essential planning and training for effective protecting workers, the public and the environment during emergency situations. \n\nWe have coordinated our program with local emergency planning committee and the fire department. The LEPC, SERC, and local fire department have copies of an SDS for TDI and have copies of facility maps which identifies TDI unloading, storage, and handling areas. A representative of the fire department routinely visits the plants to discuss emergency response procedures.\n\nThe core elements of the emergency response plan identify detailed procedures and protocols to be initiated in the event of a release.

To accomplish this task the maximum inventory of TDI onsite was compared to the threshold quantities listed in the RMP regulations.  Upon review of the facility operations, it was determined that the entire facility is considered one process.  It was also determined that the facility would be subject to Program 2 of the RMP regulations.  Table 2-1 illustrates the comparison of the maximum amount stored on-site to the threshold quantity.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED.\nThe Olympic Products facility's primary purpose is to produce polyurethane foam for the automotive and furniture industries. Polyurethane foam is manufactured by combining specific ratios of chemical streams in a mixing chamber where the reacting ingredients are dispensed onto a moving conveyor system. The reacting mixture cures into the form of a slabstock \"bun.\" The foam buns are fabricated into rolled and flat goods. Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI), which is regulated by EPA's risk management rule, is one of the reagents required to manufacture polyurethane foam. TDI is received at the plant by railcar and tanker truck; it is stored in four tanks located in the contained bulk storage tank room.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, management personnel, and contractors. The maximum amount of TDI that can stored at this facility is 680,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2-1\nComparison to Thre"

EPA has developed an RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance document (EPA 1999), which provides simple calculations and \"look-up\" tables that are based on conservative release estimates as well as simple dispersion modeling methods.  This guidance document or more refined publicly available techniques can be used to estimate the consequence distances (or distance to \"endpoint\") of the worst-case and alternative release scenarios.\n\nFor toxic substances the \"endpoint\" is based on:\n\u00bf\tThe Emergency Response Planning Guidance, Level 2 (ERPG), which protects individuals from health - threatening or escape-impairing injury; or if the ERPG does not exist.\n\u00bf\tThe Level of Concern (LOC) from SARA Title III Guidance, generally defined as the Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health (IDLH) level divided by a safety factor of 10.\n\nThe facility previously utilized the Area Location of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA) model to estimate the release rates and the distance to toxic endpoints for TDI.  The ALOHA model was originally developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (distributed by the National Safety Council) as an emergency response model.  Many LEPCs have traditionally used ALOHA for planning purposes.  However, for the most recent submittal and analysis, RMP*Comp&trade; was used to complete the Off-site Consequence Analyses.

Passive mitigation (e.g. berms, dikes, drains, etc.) can be included in determining the distance to the specified endpoint.   The RMP plan must contain one worst-case release scenario that results in the greatest distance to the endpoint to represent all flammable substances on-site.  Additional worst-case release scenarios may need to be evaluated if the release of a different toxic substance or flammable would have impacts on public receptors different from those defined above.  The RMP regulations specifically define how to determine the worst-case release scenarios.  The worst-case release scenario selected for evaluation for TDI handled at the facility is the release of a 20,000 gallon railcar.  The railcar is located outside.\n\nThe RMP regulations specify the meteorological and other modeling parameters that must be used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case release scenarios.  Table 5-1 summarizes these parameters.  The facility used the ALOHA model and guidance contained in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance document to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint for each worst-case release scenario.  For the worst-case scenario, the maximum temperature in the past three years at the Greensboro, NC meteorological station of 100 &#730;F was used (2004).\n\nThe results showed a distance of  0.07 miles (1.1 kilometers) to the toxic endpoint for TDI.  There would be approximately 1,200 people impacted from the modeled railcar. The impact would be to schools, residences and recreational areas. This was determined by the Offsite Consequence Analysis-Worst Case Scenario, modeled by Golder Associates (see Risk Management Plan Submittal for The TDI System Sept 2014-093-9676014).

Passive and active mitigation measures (e.g. shutoff valves, alarms, etc) can be included in the alternative release analysis.  The scenario chosen for inclusion in the RMP plan the five-year accident history and the process hazard analysis conducted under the Prevention Program of the RMP program was a break in a 2\" flexible hose used to transfer the 65/35 TDI from the delivery truck to the tank\n\nThis equipment is located outside of the tank building. However, the liquid would flow into a containment dike. The spill would, therefore, be contained - the effect of the containment dike was included in the analysis. The estimated flow is 500 lbs/min. Due to the requirements that the offloading be manned at all times, the duration of the spill would not exceed a period of five minutes. Using RMP Comp, the initial transfer rate and other process parameters, as well as the five-minute release period, the estimated spill amount would be 27,550 lbs of TDI.
