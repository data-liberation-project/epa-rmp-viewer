The MAWC Meramec Water Treatment Plant, located on the Meramec River near I-55, serves customers in South St. Louis County and portions of northern Jefferson County, and has the capacity to produce 48 million gallons of drinking water per day.  Chlorine, a disinfectant used in the water treatment process, is covered under OSHA??A?s Process Safety Management (PSM) and EPA??A?s Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations.  MAWC complies with these regulations, as well as others, to ensure that the risks involved in the handling, use and storage of chlorine are minimized.  It is MAWC??A?s policy to conduct our business in accordance with applicable environmental, safety and health laws and regulations.  Management fully supports efforts to safely manage process risks to prevent incidents and to protect the workplace, the community and the environment.  In conducting our business, we continue to seek and implement cost effective methods to reduce the environmental, health and safety impacts of our operations.  We promote continuous improvement through business planning, ongoing training, and constant oversight of operations.  We take safety seriously and have comprehensive accident prevention and emergency planning and response programs in place.  MAWC??A?s Environmental Policy emphasizes ??A?continuous improvement of our environmental performance??A? while providing our services in a manner that prevents pollution and promotes sustainability. \n\nCHLORINE SYSTEM\n\nChlorine is used to purify drinking water.  It is an important chemical that disinfects against disease producing organisms, and is used in the treatment of 98% of U.S. drinking water.  Missouri American Water Company (MAWC) has safely used chlorine as part of our water treatment process since the early 1900??A?s.  We continue to operate well within the guidelines set by EPA and other regul"

We have reduced our on-site inventory of chlorine to 4,000 lbs (2X1 ton cylinders).  The new system will be evaluated thru the summer and if it operates as expected, all chlorine will be removed from the facility in September of this year.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nMissouri American Water Company (MAWC) has a comprehensive prevention program in place, which ensures safe operation of the system and prevention of accidental releases.  The chlorine system at the plant is designed for safety.  We follow Chlorine Institute Standards and use only equipment and materials certified for chlorine service.  Excess flow, remote isolation, and safety relief valves, as well as a vacuum system, are utilized to prevent leaks.  A process hazard analysis is performed and reviewed regularly to identify, evaluate and control the risks associated with the chlorine system.  Procedures and systems are in place to operate safely.  Comprehensive operating procedures provide clear instructions for safe operation of the chlorine system.  Process safety information is available to all employees and includes information related to chlorine hazards, such as Material Safety Data Sheets, process technology, and process equipment.   Operators are formally trained to operate the chlorine process safely, and receive classroom as well as on-the-job instruction.  Procedures are followed to ensure proper management of changes to the system and a safety review is performed prior to startup of new or modified equipment.  The facility is staffed 24 hours per day and the process is continuously monitored using state-of-the-art computerized instrumentation and operator oversight.  Environmental and safety audits are conducted regularly, and corrective action follow-up is performed.  A preventive and corrective maintenance program ensur"

Employees receive specialized training to perform chlorine system maintenance.  A contractor safety program is in place to ensure contractors are qualified and trained to safely work on the chlorine process.  Employees and contractors must also adhere to established safe work practices and permit requirements whenever work is performed on or near the chlorine process.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Missouri American Water Company Meramec Water Treatment Plant has had no releases within the past five years that have caused onsite or offsite injuries, deaths, or property or environmental damage.  For over fifteen years we??A?ve had a process in place to document all releases, regardless of quantity, and have not experienced a chlorine release with offsite impact.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nOur emergency response program is designed to protect employee and public health and the environment.  Our emergency action plan consists of detailed emergency response procedures, and is updated on a yearly basis.  We have trained employees for emergency response according to OSHA??A?s HAZWOPER standard.  This specialized training ensures our employees are well prepared to respond to potential emergencies.  Missouri American Water Company works closely with the Local Emergency Planning Committee, local fire and police departments, St. Louis County Hazardous Materials Emergency Response Team and other first responder agencies.  We conduct regular drills with community emergency responders in order to practice and improve our emergency response plans.  In the event or a real emergency, local authorities have plans in place to communicate with the public regarding response and protection actions.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nAll chlorine inventories are expected to be removed from the facility by early this fall (2009).
