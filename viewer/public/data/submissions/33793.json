      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary for the Battle Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n     We at the Battle Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with Battle Creek Fire Department (HAZMAT) which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  The HAZMAT team also coordinates their response with the Calhoun County LEPC and state, local, and federal emergency response agencies.\n\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n     Our facility's primary activities encompass municipal wastewater (sewage) treatment.  We have 1 regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is Chlorine.  The regulated substance at our facility is involved in several uses.  Chlorine is used for disinfection and process control.  \n\n     Chlorine is used in one building within the facility, the Operations Building.  Chlorine is present within two rooms in the building.  All Chlorine equipment is interconnected by a piping system.  Together these two process areas and the connecting piping comprise our one and only Chlorination process. The maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 42000.00 lb. at one locations, in 2000 lb. containers.\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario (including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario)\n     To evaluate the worst case scenario, we have use"

For alternative release scenario analyses, we have employed the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\n     The worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances involves a catastrophic release from the Chlorination process.  The scenario involves the release of 2000 lb. of Chlorine in a liquid form over 10 minutes.  No mitigation is taken into account to calculate the scenario.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 1.3 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.\n\n     The alternative release scenario for Chlorine involves a release from the Chlorination process.  The scenario involves the release of 2000 lb. of Chlorine in a gaseous form over 133.3 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as enclosures are taken into account to calculate the scenario.  Under Class D atmospheric stability, with 3.0 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L of Chlorine is 0.10 miles, which results in no off-site release.\n\n4.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n     Our facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  The Chlorination process at our facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  We also have an air operating permit pending (Michigan ID - B6307) under Title V of the Clean Air Act.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n     The Wastewater Treatment Plant maintains a detailed"

The methodology most recently used to carry out these analyses is the \"what-if\" method.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of three (3) years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\n     For the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, the Wastewater Treatment Plant maintains written Standard Operating Pprocedures (SOPs), and Emergency Operating Procedures (EOPs).  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes, as well as emergency responders.\n\nTraining\n     Wastewater Treatment Plant has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Initial training is given every new employee, and refresher training is provided at least every three (3) years, and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n     The Wastewater Treatment Plant carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, pumps, leak detectors, and ventilation systems.

Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\n     Written procedures are in place at the Wastewater Treatment Plant to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n     Pre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as needed at the Wastewater Treatment Plant.  These reviews are conducted in conjunction with management of change procedures to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\n     The Wastewater Treatment Plant conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every three (3) years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\n     The Wastewater Treatment Plant promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\nEmployee Participation\n     The Wastewater Treatment Plant truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort."
