The regulated substances, as defined by 40 CFR Part 68, which are present at the facility in more than a threshold quantity are ammonia, chlorine, and hydrogen.\n\n\n\nIt is CF's policy to prevent accidental releases from the Woodward Plant by effective process safety management programs and procedures that include:  participation by all plant employees in every element of PSM; regular analysis of process hazards utilizing current and accurate process safety information; maintaining current and accurate written operating procedures; providing timely and comprehensive training for all employees involved in operating and maintaining process equipment; overseeing the activities of contractors and ensuring that they are trained to perform their job safely; following established pre-startup safety review and management of change procedures to ensure that modifications are adequately evaluated for safety; administering a comprehensive mechanical integrity program to ensure that process equipment is maintained in accordance with good engineering practices and accepted industry standards; investigation of incidents when they occur to promptly correct deficiencies and learn from the experience, and audit the entire PSM program on a regular basis to verify that all elements, procedures, and systems are in place and adequate.  In addition, it is the Woodward Plants policy to maintain a current and accurate written emergency response plan, a system to notify facility neighbors in the event of a release, and to coordinate emergency response planning with local authorities and exercise those plans annually.\n\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis:\n\nThe Woodward Plant's Toxic Worst Case Scenario involves ammonia and has off"

The distance to the toxic endpoint for ammonia (200 ppm) is estimated to be 0.57 miles.  The Alternative Release Scenario for chlorine is a 3/8\" pipe break resulting in a release of 1,704 pounds over a 60 minute period.  The distance to the toxic endpoint for chlorine (3 ppm) is estimated to be 0.20 miles.  The Woodward Plant Flammable Worst Case Scenario involves hydrogen and has offsite impact.  The Alternative Release Scenario for hydrogen is a 1\" pipe break resulting in a release of 540 pounds over a 10-minute period.  The distance to the flammable endpoint (3.3% volume-LFL) is estimated to be 0.06 miles.  The impact from the alternative release scenario for hydrogen is limited by emergency shutdown procedures.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program:\n\nThe Woodward Plant has a comprehensive Process Safety Management (PSM) Program and is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's standard for process safety management of highly hazardous chemicals found in 29 CFR Part 1910.119.  Key elements of the PSM program include:  1) stringent design standards of equipment which incorporate substantial safety factors and include state of the art monitoring and control instrumentation; 2) extensive process safety information that is accurate and up to date; 3) well trained operating, maintenance, and contract personnel; 4) written operating and maintenance procedures and safe work practices; 5) mechanical integrity procedures for process equipment inspections and quality control; 6) management of change and pre-startup safety review procedures; 7) periodic, detailed evaluations of each process area by a team utilizing HAZOP methodology; 8) regular PSM program audits; and 9) employee participation in every element of the PSM program.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History:  \n\nA release of 796 pounds of ammonia to the at"

      "SummaryText": "mosphere occurred at the Terra Woodward Plant on May 1, 2007 at 8:00 am.  The leak source was a tanker truck that was being loaded with ammonia solution (approximately 26%).  While being loaded, the tanker built up enough pressure to rupture a seal on the hatch on the top of the tanker.  The tanker subsequently depressured and released the ammonia vapors to the atmosphere.  No off-site impacts occurred.  As a precaution, approximately 160 plant employees and contractors were evacuated from the immediate area to the front gate of the facility until it was determined the ammonia plant was safe to re-enter.\n\n\n\nA release of 613 pounds of ammonia to the atmosphere occurred at the Woodward Facility on November 16, 2011 at 4:30 am.  The release was a result of an overpressure situation in the process (UAN #2 Plant) that casued a pressure relief valve to vent ammonia to the atmosphere.  The release resulted in off-site impact.  A neighbor approximately 1 mile from the plant was forced to shelter in place due to the strong odor of ammonia at his business location.    \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nThe Woodward Plant has a comprehensive Emergency Response Program which includes a written plan that is coordinated with local authorities, a 60-plus member emergency response team, and emergency notification system that utilizes both in-plant sirens and the Community Alert Network telephone system.  Woodward Plant personnel are active members of the Woodward County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  The plant exercises its emergency response plan annually and also participates in countywide drills that are staged by the LEPC and other local emergency response authorities.\n\n"
