Risk prevention and emergency response procedures are in place at Pride of San Juan. Management personnel are responsible for maintaining the ammonia refrigeration equipment to prevent accidents, and for responding to an emergency. \nPride of San Juan follows written procedures to inspect refrigeration equipment prior to startup and during operations. These procedures are in place to identify and prevent potential sources of release, and conform to a set of industry-approved guidelines for maintenance, inspection, and operation of the ammonia refrigeration equipment. Onsite personnel and certified refrigeration contractors inspect and perform preventative maintenance on the equipment, as outlined in the standard operating procedures (SOPs.)\nPride of San Juan personnel are limited to the following emergency response (1) monitoring, (2) limited initial response, which includes emergency equipment shutdown, (3) system isolation, and (4) basic record logging responsibilities. The refrigeration contractor will provide any controlled operation such as pump down to prevent or reduce an off-site release. The Emergency Response Plan lists the responsible personnel and the policies for responding to an accident involving the regulated substance.\nRefrigeration system controls are connected to a facility dialer system, which is monitored. In the event of an emergency, the refrigeration control system initiates the dialer. After performing the preliminary assessment, the plant manager informs the refrigeration contractor. \nNo emergency operations are performed that are beyond the capabilities of the operators or other onsite personnel. \nLocal fire and police departments with mutual aide response will provide emergency response for a major release event. The refrigeration contractor is also on-call to provide emergency response."

      "SummaryText": "Emergency response training is conducted yearly for current employees and as required for new employees. Records are kept for all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years. \n\nDescription of Source and Substance Handled\nThe Pride of San Juan facility is located at 1275 San Justo Road in San Juan Bautista, California. This facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in their precooling, storage cooling, and process water chilling operations. Fresh produce is brought from the fields and cooled to remove field heat. The produce is then stored in the cold storage warehouse, or processed as value-added. \nAmmonia refrigeration-system equipment at the facility consists of permanently installed and portable refrigeration equipment. The fixed refrigeration system configuration includes a low-pressure re-circulating unit with two ammonia pumps, four screw compressors, three evaporative cooling condensers, a high-pressure receiver, thirty-six fan coils, a thermosyphon receiver, and safety equipment, including a refrigerant discharge diffusion tank. The portable equipment includes six water chillers (flooded and falling film type) and a vacuum tube. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nPride of San Juan maintains an accidental release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases. The program includes equipment monitoring, regular inspections and maintenance, and log keeping of (1) operating conditions, (2) scheduled maintenance, (3) emergency response, and (4) operator training. \nThe ammonia refrigeration-operation system has specific safety measures in place to prevent accidental release. Operators and contractors are trained for safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system. They are also trained in emergency response procedures in the event of an ammonia release. An alarm and detection system monitors the facility for unsafe ammonia concentration levels and for operating conditions outside of safety set points Monitoring"

An emergency control box allows system pressures to be relieved without releasing to ambient. \nA thorough review of the system, including a What If hazard analysis, was performed in accordance with update requirements.  \nSafety and equipment operational training will be conducted at a minimum at least once a year. Training topics will include (1) equipment operational procedures, (2) emergency response procedures, (3) a review of the Risk Management Plan, (4) a review of the Business Response Plan, and (5) evacuation procedures. Training documentation is kept on site.\nRefrigeration equipment will be inspected and reviewed periodically and as new equipment becomes operational onsite. This RMP, which includes accident prevention procedures for the ammonia refrigeration system, is maintained onsite. \n\nFive-Year Accident History\nThere were no reportable accidents at this facility to date.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nPride of San Juan has a Business Response Plan in place that, in event of a release, designates certain personnel to determine the potential hazard and coordinate response procedures. It also contains hazardous materials release reporting procedures, and chemical inventory information. \nIn the event of an emergency, the safety director and processing manager are responsible for contacting emergency response agencies, schools, daycare centers, and acute care facilities that may be affected by the release. The director will also be responsible for evacuation of employees if necessary and for coordination with community emergency responders if offsite evacuations are required.\n\nPlanned Safety Improvements\nRegular maintenance, standard operating procedures, and process safety management are ongoing at this facility. In addition, the Process Hazard Analysis targets equipment and processes for potential improvement. Specific recommendations resulting from the PHA are listed in RMP/PSM."
