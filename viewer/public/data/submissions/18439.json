The emergency response policy at this facility is to immediately notify the Acadia Parish Office of Emergency Preparedness through 911.\n\nThe stationary source consists of two (2) one (1) ton cylinders of chlorine.\n\nThe worst case release scenario would consist of a rupture of the one ton cylinder allowing all of the chlorine inside to be released in ten minutes, which would create a cloud of chorine with a radius of 1.3 miles and an affected population of 8,700 people.  There are no passive mitigation measures in place to affect the severety of the release.\n\nThe alternative release scenario consists of a fusible plug blowing out of the chlorine cylinder.  It will take approximately an hour for offsite responders to respond to the release.  It will have a release rate of 2 lbs/min and will have a radius of effect of 0.1 miles and effect 90 people.  There is no active or passive mitigation in place at the facility.\n\nProper training of operators and maintenance personnel prevents aaccidental release and chemical specific hazards.\n\nThere has been one accident at the facility in the past five (5) years.  The accident took place on November 10, 1997 at approximately 2:00 pm in the afternoon.  The event involved improper opening of valve on the on ton cylinder and resulted in a very short release (<10 sec) before the leak was stopped.  The worker went to a doctor after his shift was over.\n\nThe emergency response response at this facility is handled by offsite personnel (fire department, police, etc..).  The Acadia Parish Office of Emergency Preparedness will be responsible for notification of the public and evacuation/sheltering in place of people within the radius of effect.  AMPOL will be responsible for repairing an"
