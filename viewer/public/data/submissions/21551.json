      "SummaryText": "Norway Spur Farmers Coop is a locally owned grain elevator cooperative located in Verona, ND.  We deal in agricultural commodities and agricultural inputs including anhydrous ammonia.  It is our company policy to handle this substance according to all local, state, and federal regulations.\n\nNorway Spur Farmers Coop has never had an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  In the unlikely event of an accidental release we have planned for and have coordinated with local emergency responders to adequetely respond to all accidental releases we forsee could happen at our facility, from a simple hose break to the release of the entire contents of our largest tank.\n\nAll of our anhydrous ammonia equipment meets or exceeds all state regulations.  It is our policy to update equipment whenever improvements become available.  We have extensive training, maintenance, and inspection programs in place that are reviewed regularly to insure they are up to date.\n\nNorway Spur Farmers Coop wants to insure the public that the use of anhydrous ammonia is safe.  We spend a great deal of time and money each year to insure that this substance is handled in the safest possible manner."
