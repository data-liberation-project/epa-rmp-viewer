At the time of the 2017 RMP submittal, all Dow Corning facilities were in the midst of a migration towards operation under and adherence to policies and standards of the Dow Chemical Company. The Dow Corning facilities at the Carrollton, Kentucky site are referred to as the Carrollton site.  \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nThe Carrollton site is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operation, maintenance and emergency response.  The program relies on the disciplined use of policies, procedures, employee training, preventive maintenance/inspection, safety reviews, management of change, investigations, and audits to reduce the frequency and consequence of accidental chemical releases. \n\n\n\nThe Dow Corning Corporation is a member of the American Chemistry Council as is the Dow Chemical Company.  As such, the Carrollton site utilizes the Responsible Care(R) management system to voluntarily improve its environmental, health, and safety performance\n\n\n\nThe facility is a Star site in the Kentucky Department of Labor's Voluntary Protection Partnership (VPP) and has conducted security and vulnerability assessments through its association with the American Chemistry Council, Federal Bureau of Investigation, local law enforcement agencies and the Coast Guard.\n\n\n\nIt is the site policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release should occur, highly trained emergency response personnel are available to immediately work to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  The facility uses the Incident Command System (ICS"

The facility coordinates its emergency response plan with the Carroll County, Kentucky Local Emergency Planning Committee and can respond to any foreseeable emergency.  The facility also conducts periodic drills, trains emergency response personnel, and participates in community-wide drills.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Carrollton site processes and stores threshold quantities of the following RMP-regulated substances:\n\n\n\nTOXIC\n\nDimethyldichlorosilane                Methyl Chloride\n\nMethyltrichlorosilane            Hydrochloric acid (conc. >37%)\n\nTrimethylchlorosilane            Hydrogen chloride (anhydrous)\n\n\n\nFLAMMABLE\n\nTrichlorosilane                i-pentane\n\nTetramethylsilane            n-pentane\n\n\n\nThe Carrollton site is a siloxane manufacturing facility that produces several RMP-listed chlorosilane monomers.  A majority (by mass) of these monomers are intermediates that are consumed on-site (via reaction with water) to produce siloxane materials that are the building-blocks for finished silicone products.  Other monomers are shipped via rail tank car or tank truck to other Dow Corning facilities or directly to external customers for use in a variety of products.  RMP-listed substances are required as raw materials to produce these chlorosilane monomers.  I-pentane and n-pentane are generated by side-reactions that occur during the production of chlorosilane monomers.    \n\n\n\nMultiple RMP-listed substances in the 2012 submittal have been eliminated from the 2017 submittal due to process reconfiguration that effectively reduced the respective quantities well below threshold values.  \n\n\n\nThe 2017 RMP submittal includes five (5) process units compared to 20 process units for the 2012 submittal.  This reduction is the result of consolidation of multiple process units that share common technologies and/or chemistries.  Consolidation was recommended during a Carrollton site RMP program review conducted by a Dow Chemical RMP subject-matte"

Two of the five process units include a combination of non-organic chemical production, storage and loading/unloading facilities while the remainder are transportation/rolling-stock related.  The impact on overall quantities of RMP listed substances as a result of consolidation is negligible and it did not impact the toxic worst-case release scenario.  \n\n\n\nSince the 2012 submittal, there have been no additional facilities that process and/or store RMP listed substances.  The 2017 RMP submittal reflects current Carrollton site operation.  It includes evaluation of the inventory of process equipment, interconnecting piping and intermediate and product storage - and the composition of those respective inventories.      \n\n\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe facility had two accidental releases of RMP substances in the past five years - neither of which impacted on-site personnel or the public.  In 2013 a manual valve was inadvertently left open following a maintenance operation on a methyl chloride compressor.  Upon restart, 845 lbs of methyl chloride was sent to the atmosphere.  In 2016, an instrumentation impulse line failed resulting in a release of 177.5 lbs of methyl chloride to the atmosphere.  \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Carrollton site general accident prevention program consists of compliance with the EPA RMP rule, OSHA's PSM standard, and implementation of Dow's Operating Discipline Management System.  Key elements include:\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nThe facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified, evaluated, and controlled.  The tools used to carry out these analyses include:  Process Hazard Analysis (using What If checklists), internal audits, reactive chemistry evaluations, and Layers of Protection Analyses (LOPA - transitioning to as a result of acquisition).  The studies are completed by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in process opera"

Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting operations within our covered processes, the Carrollton site maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is annual certified and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nThe facility has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided on a continuing basis.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nThe Carrollton site maintains a mechanical integrity program that includes a documented preventative maintenance (PM) and inspection program for a variety of process components including pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping, pressure relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown and control systems, pumps and compressors.  Mechanical integrity inspections may also occur as a result of any questionable findings found during routine work.   All PM activities and associated inspections are conducted by competent and qualified personnel with appropriate training and experience. \n\n\n\nDeficiencies identified during the inspections are resolved in a timely manner via a documented work flow - dependent on the respective issue.  \n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\n\n\nThe Carrollton site utilizes a formal management of change (MOC) process for all modifications to process equipment, procedures, raw materials, and processing conditions.

Several initiatives that have the goal of improving process safety have been implemented or expanded at the site since the 2012 RMP submittal including increased use of risk assessment, more extensive process hazard analysis, emphasis on operator training, use of balance of consequence program, and additional strengthening of the mechanical integrity program.  \n\n\n\nIntegration into the Dow Chemical Company will help to further reinforce the emphasis on strong process safety programs and management systems.  The following initiatives will be implemented to strengthen and improve process safety performance: \n\n\n\nImplementation of Dow's Layers of Protection Analysis (LOPA) tool.  This tool identifies events and scenarios that can lead to undesired consequences.  An inventory of available independent layers of protection is then taken.  If the available layers of protection are deemed sufficient to avoid the consequence from occurring, then no action is necessary.  However if a gap exists then actions are taken to add appropriate layers of protection.\n\n\n\nIncreased emphasis on reactive chemistry reviews to ensure that the hazards related to reactive chemistry are fully understood and properly mitigated. \n\n\n\nDevelopment of a list of most-effective-technology solutions for a variety of issues.  These solutions will represent the best available solutions (analogous to RAGAGEP) that are the results of leveraged learnings from other siloxane producing facilities (where applicable) as well as Dow and other external manufacturing facilities.  Implementation of the solutions will occur on a prioritized basis. \n\n\n\n"
