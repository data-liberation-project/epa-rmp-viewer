Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nWe at Daily's Premium Meats are committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as the design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance and employee training associated with the ammonia refrigeration system at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate control measures to prevent possible releases of anhydrous ammonia. If such a release were to occur,  our highly trained employees are on hand to to control and mitigate the release. We are also completely coordinated with the South Salt Lake City Fire Department, who provides our emergency response services. In addition, we have a contract with L.A. Roser Company to provide 24 hour service and emergency response on the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nWe have one regulated extremely hazardous substance present at our facility. This substance is Ammonia (anhydrous). The maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) that is expected to be present in this facility, based on process/operational requirements, is 16,108 pounds.\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nWe have taken the following steps as required by 40CFR, Part 68 of the EPA Clean Air Act regulation. Our ammonia process is subject to the OSHA PSM regulation, 29CFR1910.119. Our ammonia process is also subject to the EPCRA Section 302 reporting requirements. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention program that we have in place.\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our ammonia refrigeration process are identified and controlled efficiently and safely.

Roser Company and are revalidated at a regular interval of every three years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are corrected as soon as possible.\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\nDaily's Premium Meats maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation including initial start-up, normal operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and a start-up after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to all operators and contractors involved in the process.\n\nTraining:\n\nOur facility has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees and contractors who are operating the ammonia system are qualified to follow the required procedures. Our Maintenance Manager is RETA certified through Garden City Community College, and several other technicians have also received ammonia system training at that facility. We evaluate each operator independently to evaluate their readiness to operate our plant. All employees also receive interactive training through the Alchemy Training System at least annually.\n\nMechanical Integrity:\n\nWe conduct well documented maintenance and inspections for the ammonia refrigeration system to ensure that it is operating properly. Process equipment examined during the maintenance and inspections includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Only qualified personnel with specialized ammonia system training conduct maintenance operations. Any deficiences identified during maintenance or inspection are corrected as soon as possible.\n\nManagement of Change:\n\nWritten procedures are in place to manage changes to the ammonia refrigeration system process, chemicals, technology and equipment.

These reviews are conducted to confirm that the design, installation, maintenance and operation of the ammonia refrigeration plant is safe prior to any equipment operation.\n\nCompliance Audits:\n\nWe conduct audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions required by the Process Safety and Risk Management regulations are being consistently implemented. These audits are conducted at least every three years and any corrective actions noted during the audits are corrected as soon as possible.\n\nIncident Investigation:\n\nDaily's Premium Meats has not had to conduct an incident investigation. We are prepared to investigate any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release of ammonia.
