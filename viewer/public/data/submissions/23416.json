The Facility Policy\n\n     The owners, management, and employees of More's Ag Center, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n  2.  Facility Information.\n\n     - The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\n     - Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct injection into the soil as a nitrogen source for corn.\n\n  \n     - The maximum quantitiy stored would be 120,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  (anhydrous ammonia storage tank is 30,000 gallons) The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a truck transport, which would be 40,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n  3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario. \n\n   A.  For Anhydrous ammonia-\n\n     a.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 120,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint is 1.09 miles.\n\n    b.  The alternate release scenario would be a 2 minute release from a 2 inch pipe break releasing anhydrous ammonia.  The distance to the endpoint is .56 miles.\n\n   \n  4.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\n     More's Ag Center has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc.,  the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Adm"

The Five-year Accident History-\n\n    a.  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia , in the past five years that:\n\n    -  have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\n    -  to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n  6.  The emergency response program.\n\n    -  The facility has:\n\n    a.  A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n    b.
