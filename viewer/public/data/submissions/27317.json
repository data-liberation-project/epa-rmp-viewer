The area where this would occur has a passive mitigation system consisting of drainage to a gravel dike area where it is possible a vapor cloud fire may occur.  The scenario involved passive and active mitigation (including availability of equipment to stop the release and foam suppression), involved a release of approximately 12,120 pounds of n-pentane with an RMPComp estimated distance to end point of <0.1 miles.  This scenario does not involve any off site consequences.  A more likely scenario involving off site consequences could not be found.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Programs\n\nTo prevent the situations described above from occurring, these processes are covered under the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations (29 CFR 1910.119).  All 14 elements required under the PSM rule are in place at the site and have been integrated into the prevention plan requirements under the Risk Management Program.  Compliance with the PSM rule provides the foundation for compliance with the Risk Management Program.\n\nSome of the specific prevention measures in place include the following: \n\u00b7\tThe presence of pressure relief systems on the storage tanks. \n\u00b7\tDikes surrounding storage tanks. \n\u00b7\tOn-going equipment inspection programs to monitor mechanical integrity.\n\u00b7\tThe tanks are protected by firewater deluge systems. \n\u00b7\tArea classifications are required to guard against the introduction of ignition sources into the process areas.\n\u00b7\tThe presence of hydrocarbon sensors and alarms to detect pentane releases.  \n\u00b7\tSite operation technicians continuously monitor pentane-unloading operations and inspect the facility several times per shift as result of facility security requirements.\n\nThere have been no accidents at the Painesville site involving n-pentane in the last 5 years.

Pentane is potentially used during two parts of the process, initially during bead formation then possibly later during the drying stage as a paste applied to the beads to provide lubrication for customer processing.  Pentane is delivered to the site in rail cars.  Pentane vapors are collected during the process in a spherical gas ball and sent to one of two boilers for destruction. \n\nWorst-case release scenarios\n\nEPA has defined a worst case release as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance that results in the greatest distance from the point of release to a specified end point.  At the Painesville site, the only regulated substance used on-site is n-pentane, which is a flammable substance.  The Worst-Case release scenario requirement for flammables considers liquids at ambient temperatures and the amount that becomes vapor in the first 10 minutes of the release.  This is used to determine the endpoint during a vapor cloud explosion.\n\nApplying the worst-case scenario definitions at Painesville, the following information was derived:\n\nWorst -Case Scenario: \n\nWorst-case scenario involves a release of the maximum quantity of n-pentane contained in an unmitigated railcar on-site (170,500 lb).  The release of this amount of n-pentane, coupled with a vapor cloud explosion, would result in an estimated distance to 1 pound per square inch (psi) overpressure of 0.4 miles.  RMP Comp Version 1.07 was the technique/software used to determine the overpressure end point.  On the basis of this distance and considering the population density of Painesville Township, Ohio, it is estimated that there would be 533 residential receptors in this area (mostly north of the facility).  There are no environmental receptors in this area.\n\nAlternative Release Case Scenario\n\nThe processes involving n-pentane at the site were studied to develop the alternate case scenario. The facility utilized the knowledge of the process operators and engineers to develop an"
