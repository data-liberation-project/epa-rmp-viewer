Those situations identified include hazardous material releases, fire, explosion, floods, severe weather, and terrorism.  A plant specific incident command system had been installed.  This system is designed to be used for all types of emergencies, and is applicable to both small releases or minor fires and large-scale disasters.  A chain-of-command and assigned responsibilities have been established within this system in order to asses and respond to emergency situations.  Plant-wide alarms are activated in the event of an emergency.\n                                                                                                                                                                              In addition to in-plant emergency response events, a system has been established in order to notify outside personnel.  Depending on the severity and type of event, facilities/agencies notified include, but are not limited to, local police, fire and ambulance service, Local Emergency Planning Committee of Washington County, Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency (PEMA), and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (Pittsburgh).\n                                                                                                                                                                              PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nFLEXSYS has an ongoing program to evaluate and upgrade its safety systems."

Their limitations increase as the complexity of the topography surrounding the release site increases.  The EPA-recommended models used for the FLEXSYS worst-case and alternative release scenarios have likely over-estimated the impact distance, because of several complicating conditions:\n     - Surrounding the CS2 storage tanks, reactor vessel, and piping are large industrial buildings and structures.  These features disrupt and redirect airflow, but the models used assume winds are steady and moving in a straight line.\n     - Beyond plant property, buildings, structures, vegetation, and terrain features also serve to disrupt and redirect airflow.\n     - The chemical emitted is assumed to have no reaction with the ground, other chemicals, or other potential release conditions.  However, it is likely that a release of CS2 will deposit on the ground and other surfaces as it disperses from a ground-level source.  In addition, because of an auto ignition temperature, CS2 will likely ignite.  In each case, the resulting impact distance is likely to be less than the distance predicted by the models.  \n                                                                                                                                                                              Note that a synergistic effect can occur from two chemicals interacting during an accidental release.  Such synergism results when the effect of two substances acting together is greater than the sum of their individual effects.  No synergistic reaction is expected with respect to CS2."

The procedures assure that the technical basis for the proposed change, the impact of the change on the environment, safety, and health, the modifications to operating procedures, the necessary time period for the change, and authorization requirements for the proposed change are all addressed.  Appropriate employees and contractors are informed of, and trained in, the change prior to startup of the process of affected part of the process.  Updates to the RMP are made if required by the nature of the change.  \n     - Pre-startup review:  A pre-startup safety review is performed for new covered processes and for significantly modified covered processes at FLEXSYS.  Such review confirms that prior to introduction of regulated substances to the process that construction and equipment is in accordance with design specifications; safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and adequate; for new stationary sources, management of change requirements have been met; and training of each employee involved in operating a process has been completed.\n     - Compliance audits:  FLEXSYS evaluates compliance with the provisions of this section at least every three years to verify that the procedures and practices developed under the standard are adequate and are being followed.  FLEXSYS' compliance audit is conducted by a team consisting of outside auditors, the ESH Lead and representatives from each covered process.  A report of the compliance audit findings is developed.

A system has been established to promptly address and resolve the findings and recommendations of the incident report, with documentation of resolutions and corrective actions.  The report shall be reviewed with all affected personnel, including contract employees where applicable, whose job tasks are relevant to the incident findings.\n     - Employee participation:  FLEXSYS has developed a written plan of action regarding employee participation.

Employees and their representatives are also provided access to process hazard analyses and to all other information required to be developed under the rule.\n     - Hot-work permit:  FLEXSYS issues a hot-work permit for hot-work operations conducted on or near a covered process.

CS2 has been highly suitable for other industrial applications including the vulcanization and manufacture of rubber accessories; the production of resins, plywood adhesives, and flotation agents; petroleum-well cleaning; brightening of precious metals in electroplating; rust removal from metals; and removal and recovery of metals and other elements from wastewater and other media.
