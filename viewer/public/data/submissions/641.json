Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at the City of Florence Utilities Water / Wastewater Department as owners and operators of the Cypress Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant are committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our accidental prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with the City of Florence Fire Department, which provides emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substance Handled \n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass wastewater (sewer) treatment. We have one regulated substance present at our facility. This substance is Chlorine. The Chlorine used at this facility is used for the purpose of disinfecting treated wastewater from the City of Florence of Lauderdale County in Alabama.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at this facility is 8000.00 pounds.\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit distances for each reported scenario \n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance. The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from the wastewater chlorinating process. The scenario involves the release of 2000 pounds of chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes. Passive mitigation controls such as enclosures are also take"

At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/sec. wind speed, the maximum distance of 0.90 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario of Chlorine involves a release from the Chlorine Storage Room in the wastewater chlorinating process. The scenario involves the release of 1500 pounds of Chlorine in gaseous form over 10 minutes. Passive mitigation controls such as enclosures are taken into account to calculate the scenario. At Class D atmospheric stability and 3.0 m/sec. wind speed, the maximum distance of 0.20 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.\n\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under  40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Cypress Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant maintains safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with the chlorinating process.\n\nProcess Hazard Review\n\nOur facility conducts reviews to ensure that hazards associated with our process is identified and controlled efficiently. The reviews are undertaken by qualified personnel with the expertise in our process operation.\n\nTraining\n\nThe Cypress Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant has a training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating the process are competent in the operating procedures associated with this process. Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Cypress Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant maintenance personnel perform maintenance checks on the process equipment to ensure proper operations."

      "SummaryText": " Process equipment checked includes storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, and controls. Qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices carry out the maintenance operations. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nEmployee Participation  \n\nThe City of Florence Water / Wastewater Department truly believes that process safety and accident prevention is a team effort. Department employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention and to recommend improvements. \n\n5. Five-year Accident History\n\nThe City of Florence Water / Wastewater Department has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years. There has been no accidental release from the Cypress Creek Wastewater Treatment plant during this period.\n\n6. Emergency Response Plan\n\nThe Cypress Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant has a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of chlorine.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAs a result of the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program, there are some steps that we want to take to improve safety at our facility. These changes include a more frequent evaluation of our process equipment and more frequent refresher training of the treatment plant personnel. Plans are currently being made to address these issues."
