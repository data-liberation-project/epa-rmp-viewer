Facility Policy.   The owners, management and employees of  Farmers Coop Association (the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia and propane.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.  \n\n2. Facility Information.   The facility is a country grain elevator and which stores and blends fertilizers for sale to farmers.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored at the facility in one 18,000-gallon storage tank  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored would be 76,500-pounds.  \n\nPropane is used for grain drying and stored in one 30,000-gallon storage tank  The maximum quantity of propane stored would be 94,400 pounds. \n\n3.    Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\na.    The worst-case scenario for each chemical  would be the release of the total contents of a the largest storage tank released as gas over a period of 10 minutes.  \n\nAnhydrous Ammonia - The maximum quantity released would be 76,500 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion of the gas to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is 2.1 miles. \n\nPropane - The maximum quantity released would be 94,400 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the end point is 0.4 miles.  The endpoint represents the lateral extent of a pressure "

The alternate release scenarios, based on the most likely potential incident, or the five-year accident history, are:\n \nAnhydrous Ammonia -  A release from a break in a 3-inch transfer hose, lasting 2 minutes before automatic or manual shut-off intervenes to stop the flow.  The maximum quantity released would be 26,640 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.6 miles.\n\nPropane - A release from a hose rupture in a 4-inch hose 25-feet long caused by a pull-away.  The active mitigation devices are assumed to work as designed, limiting the release to the contents of the hose, a maximum of 69 pounds.  The distance to the end point (point of 1 psi overpressure) is 0.03 miles, or 175 feet.  \n\n\n4.    Accidental Release Prevention Program.  \n\nThe facility has been reviewed for general compliance with applicable standards for storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia and propane.  \n\nThe standards for anhydrous ammonia include the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI), and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".  The ANSI Standard has been adopted by reference by Iowa Administrative Code Part 21-Chapter 43-Rule 43.6(200) - Standard for the storage and  handling of anhydrous ammonia.  \n\nThe applicable standard for propane is National Fire Protection Association Standard 58 \"Standard for the Storage and Handling of Liquified Petroleum Gases\", 1992 Edition (NFPA-58).  The standard is referenced in the Registration Form Section 8.3.b.\n\n5.    Five-Year Accident History.        \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or propane in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to ou"

Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  \n\nThere are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia and propane for implementation at this time.  \n"
