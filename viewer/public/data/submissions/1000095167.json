      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe City of Eden Prairie Minnesota has prepared this Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the Water Treatment Plant (Facility) located at 14100 Technology Drive, Eden Prairie, Minnesota 55344-4485. The purpose of the RMP is to help prevent or minimize risk of exposure to chlorine gas for Facility employees and the surrounding community.\n\n1.    FACILITY DESCRIPTION\n\nThe City of Eden Prairie Water Treatment Plant is capable of treating a maximum daily water flow of 28 million gallons per day. The Facility uses approximately 400 pounds per day of chlorine for disinfection. During normal operations, the Facility may have up to 24,000 pounds of chlorine stored at the site. The chlorine is stored in 2,000 pound containers.\n\nThe Facility is required by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to create a Risk Management Plan for chlorine in compliance with Regulation 40 CFR 68. This RMP also provides compliance with the Process Safety Management (PSM) requirement in OSHA Regulation 29 CFR 1910.119. A facility operates under this regulation when it houses more than a threshold quantity of a regulated material for use in a water treatment process. The Facility maintains more than the threshold quantity (2,500 pounds) of chlorine on-site at any given time. An original RMP was created and submitted to the EPA in June 1999, with subsequent updates in October 2004, August 2011 and August 2016. This edition represents the required five-year update of the Plan since the August 2016 version.\n\n2.    RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN ELEMENTS\n\nThe Facility is classified as a RMP Program 3 Facility. The corresponding Risk Management Plan for this level consists of two primary components: \n\n2.1.    Process Safety Management (PSM) Elements\n\nThe Process Safety Management Plan (PSM) includes 14 elements that deal with plant operations and safety issues concerning chlorine. The PSM component of the Plan outlines the management system, operational procedures, training requirements, process informat"

      "SummaryText": "ion, and emergency procedures necessary to safely operate the Facility.\n\n2.2.    Hazard Analysis\n\nThe Hazard Analysis deals with potential impacts on the surrounding community in the event of a chlorine release. The RMP regulations require modeling potential effects caused by the anticipated \"worst case\" chlorine release scenario and also a minimum of one alternative release scenario. Alternative release scenarios more accurately reflect potential releases than the worst case scenario. Since alternative releases are more likely to occur, these scenarios are generally considered more useful to emergency planning. The influence radius of each type of release, and the estimated population within the circle of influence was determined in this analysis.\n\n \n\n3.    IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RMP/PSM PROGRAM\n\nThe Facility has implemented written procedures to help minimize the risk of a chlorine release. The revised RMP outlines training requirements, operating procedures, maintenance procedures, and defines responsible persons for implementing the aspects of the Plan. The RMP will continue to provide guidance for the Facility's day-to-day operation, thereby creating a safer and more effective work environment.\n\nThe Utility Manager (Rick Wahlen) shall be the Risk Management Program Manager with overall responsibility for implementation of the Risk Management Program. This Program Manager is responsible for delegating responsibility for specific elements to appropriate personnel, and ensuring that the RMP is being properly implemented. The Risk Management Program Manager is directly responsible for the following sections of this plan: \n\n     Section 1 - Management System\n\n     Section 2 - Employee Participation Plan\n\n     Section 7 - Contractor Safety\n\nThe Plant Operations Supervisor (Joe Dusek) shall assist the Program Manager in implementing this plan. The Plant Operations Supervisor is directly responsible for the following sections of this plan:\n\n    Section 3 - Process Safety Information\n\n    Se"
