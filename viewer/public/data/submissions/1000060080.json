JMPTI is committed to operating this facility and other associated systems in full compliance with all applicable Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulatory requirements. \r\nTo ensure that the RMP-covered system is operated in a safe manner and in compliance with applicable EPA regulations relevant to accidental release prevention, JMPTI has developed this RMP plan. \r\n\r\nFacility and Regulated substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe JMPTI Savannah plant manufactures Fluid Catalytic Cracking Additives that are used in the petroleum Refining Industries. The facility has a newly designed Tank Farm that would store Ethylene Diamine (EDA) in a 12,000 gallon tank which is a RMP regulated chemical.  Since the tank fill limit is 58.3% of the volume (7,000 gallons), the total inventory of EDA in the tank will be 52,500 lbs. The above ground EDA storage tank is surrounded by a concrete containment dike. The EDA will be used in the process directly within the C-plant of the facility. This process will be classified under NAICS code 32518. Based on 40 CFR 68 program level applicability analysis, this process will be classified under Prevention Program Level 2.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\t\r\n\r\nThe Prevention Program 2 contains the following elements:  a Process Hazard Review of the process, the collection and documentation of Process Safety Information, a Preventive Maintenance Program, written operating procedures, a Compliance Audits program, Safety Training for Operations and Maintenance personnel and prompt correction of any deficiencies. The Prevention program will receive full support of plant management and involvement of employees at all levels.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere is no accident history within the past five years for the process.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nJMPTI has an emer"
