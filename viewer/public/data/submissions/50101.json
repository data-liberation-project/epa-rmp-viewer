      "SummaryText": "the other two cooling towers have two (2) one-ton cylinders each.  Each cooling tower has single cylinder gas feed systems with no more than two cylinders connected at any time.\r\n\r\nWorst case scenario is the rupture of a single one-ton cylinder.  The alternate release scenario is the failure of a fusible pressure relief plug in a cylinder.\r\n\r\nAs was mentioned above, chlorine usage is being eliminated by the first quarter of 2008.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegulated Flammable Substances and Release Scenarios\r\n\r\nThe St. Charles Refinery has six flammable substances in amounts estimated to exceed the thresholds for covered substances.  They are Propane, Propylene/Propane mix, Butane, Isobutane, Butylene/Butane mix, and LPG.  There has been no change in the quantities of these regulated flammable substances in the facility from the previous RMP submittal.\r\nUsing the worst-case scenario specified for flammables by the EPA, a vapor cloud explosion of the largest vessel containing a regulated flammable substance, the Butylene/Butane sphere, would have the greatest impact.  Although numerous in-place controls prevent such an event from occurring, none of those controls are considered in modeling the worst-case scenario.\r\n\r\nThe alternate release scenario was identified based on a review of existing Process Hazard Analysis documentation, a flange leak at the Propylene/Propane vessel.  No residential areas are located in the area of impact; however, a neighboring chemical facility would be affected if this scenario occurred.  A strategically placed isolation valve, an in-place water curtain safety feature, on site presence of a fire brigade, operator intervention, and other Emergency Response Team actions will reduce the distance of impact.\r\n\r\nPrevention Policies and Programs\r\n\r\nThe St. Charles Refinery operates under the strict guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.

The PSM program is designed to:\r\n* Reduce the potential for serious accidents\r\n* Increase plant reliability, efficiency and product quality\r\n* Diminish the potential for releases with environmental impact\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Planning\r\n\r\nThe St. Charles Refinery has its own Emergency Response Team (ERT) to respond to all on site emergencies.  This team would coordinate with the St. Charles Parish Department of Emergency Preparedness (DEP) personnel during any incident with potential for off site impacts.  Copies of the Emergency Response Plan as well as ERT planning activities and exercises are coordinated with the DEP Director on an ongoing basis.\r\n\r\nAccident History\r\n\r\nOne reportable accident resulted in an on-site fire in the Coker Unit.  This accident occurred on January 29, 2003.  Coking is a severe method of thermal cracking used to upgrade heavy residuals into lighter products or distillates.  Coking produces straight-run gasoline (coker naphtha), diesel (light coker distillate), and a heavy distillate fraction used as catalytic cracking feedstock.  The fire in the coker unit was due to a pipeline failure resulting in release of hot heavy oil, with auto ignition of the product.  Damage on-site was significant.  Off-site impacts included temporarily closing two adjacent roads.  Environmental monitoring during this event indicated no hazardous air pollutants present offsite.  To limit the recurrence of coker unit fires, Valero Refinery has made improvements and upgrades to the affected equipment and revised the maintenance and inspection procedures.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nContinuing compliance with PSM/RMP guidelines and regulations forms the basis of the refinery's commitment to ensuring a safe working environment for employees as well as a safe community.

With the addition of a new hydrogen plant, threshold calculations were performed to determine coverage.  These calculations indicate that the new facility is not covered, however, in the review process it was found that a misinterpretation occurred concerning chlorine cylinder coverage.  This revision is to identify threshold exceedance and adds toxic coverage in the RMP.  We are currently in the process of eliminating chlorine usage, replacing it with sodium hypochlorite solution, for our cooling towers.  In fact, one of our four cooling towers has already been converted to bleach and the other three are scheduled for conversion in the first quarter of 2008.\r\n \r\nThe St. Charles Refinery is owned and operated by Valero Refining-New Orleans, LLC, formerly owned and operated by Orion Refining Corporation.  The St. Charles Refinery is currently operating its Crude Unit, Vacuum Unit, Delayed Coking Unit, Milli-Second Catalytic Cracker (MSCC), Gasoline Desulfurization Unit (GDU), Alkylation Unit, three Hydrodesulfurization Units, a Hydrogen Plant, a Hydrotreater / Hydrocracker Unit, Flare Gas Recovery Unit, three Sulfur Units and associated utilities facilities.  \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this plan is to provide information about regulated substances and release scenarios at the facility, policies and programs to prevent accidental releases, emergency response planning, accident history and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.  Each of these aspects are summarized below and fully detailed in the RMP. \r\n \r\n\r\nRegulated Toxic Substances and Release Scenarios\r\n\r\nThe St. Charles Refinery has four cooling towers \u00bf three of which are treated with chlorine gas.  One has eight (5) one-ton cylinders while"
