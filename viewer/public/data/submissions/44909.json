Copeland Farm is a facility whose primary activities are the storage, sale and distribution of fertilizers to the local farming community.  J. F. Copeland Farm stores and distributes one regulated substance, anhydrous ammonia (CAS 7664-41-7) as a land applied fertilizer for crop production.  The owner, management and staff of the J. F. Copeland Farm in Alachua, Florida are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, facility personnel are trained to respond to and stop the release and minimize the offsite consequences.  If the release is too large for personnel at the J. F. Copeland Farm to manage, the facility is prepared to work with the Alachua County Fire Department, or other authorities, to mitigate large releases and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n        \nThe anhydrous ammonia storage process consists of one storage tank, liquid and vapor piping and delivery hose systems.  The process is used to receive anhydrous ammonia from the delivery truck into the storage tank and distributed from the storage tank into smaller, mobile tanks for both direct application and for lbending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  The anhydrous ammonia process begins with the receipt of anhydrous ammonia via tanker.  The maximum amount of anhydrous received and stored at J. F. Copeland Farm in Alachua, at one time is two tanker-truck loads or 100,000 pounds (lbs.).\n\nAs required by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), both a worst-case and alternative release scenarious were performed for the anhydrous ammonia storage process.

With 100,000lbs being released the distance to the toxic endpoint would be 5.6 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario selected for the J. F. Copeland Farm in Alachua, Florida was a break in the pipe leading to the anhydrous ammonia storage tank.  In this scenario, a 2-inch diameter break in the pipe occurs in the pipe creating a leak in the system.  J. F. Copeland Farm employees are capable of responding to and stopping the leak within two minutes of detection.  The distance to the 200 parts per million endpoint is 1.18 miles.\n\nTo comply with the requirements of EPS's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule, J. F. Copeland Farm has developed an accidental release prevention program and emergency action plan for the Alachua farm.  The accidental release prevention program satisfies the requirements for the EPA RMP.  The prevention program ensures that our facility is operated under safe conditions and that any risk of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia is minimized.  The program has been written to reduce the potential of an accidental release due to human error, or equipment failure at our facility.  In order to prevent the release of anhydrous ammonia due to human error, our prevention program ensures that operation procedures are current and reviewed annually.  Training also plays a vital part in our program.  Employees and contractors working on or near the anhydrous ammonia area are trained in the hazards associated with anhydrous ammonia.\n\nTo prevent equipment failure that could result in an accidental release, our program ensures that equipment inspections, test, and preventive maintenance are performed in accordance with accepted engineering practices and manufacturer's recommendations.
