      "SummaryText": "\nIntroduction \n\nChemicals are widely used in industry, in the home, and in the environment and are an integral part of everyone's daily lives. They are transported on roads, water, and railways. The City of Sioux Falls Water Purification Plant uses chemicals, too. The plant uses chlorine to disinfect our drinking water. The natural world contains more that 1,500 chlorine-containing compounds. Human cells generate hypochlorite, a form of chlorine to fight infection. Chlorine purifies our drinking water, disinfects our swimming pools and is truly life saving. In fact the World Health Organization estimates that 25,000 children worldwide die every day from waterborne diseases resulting from the lack of a water disinfection agent such as chlorine. \n\nStoring chemicals can be a hazard. We take our safety obligations in storing and using chemicals as seriously as we take providing safe drinking water. The following document describes what could happen if there were to be an accident, the steps we take everyday to ensure that our plant operates safely, and what we do in the event of an emergency. \n\nRegulatory Background\n\nThe USEPA's Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 included provisions that require facilities that use certain substances to develop a formal plan to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release of the substances to the atmosphere and reduce the likelihood of serious harm to the public and the environment. Before these regulations were in place, the Sioux Falls Water Purification Plant had already established many of the components of the plan. The requirements of this plan, commonly referred to as a Risk Management Plan (RMP), are detailed and codified in 40 CFR Part 68. The USEPA RMP submittal is attached in Appendix A.\n\nAs required by regulations, the RMP was updated June 2004 to reflect changes made to the system and the RMP procedures and policies. The update includes revisions made to reflect  improvements the Water Purification Plant made to increase th"

The original executive summary submit in 1999 was revised to incorporate the changes made to the system and the plan as part of the 2004 update.\n\nChlorine Process Safety Systems\n\nThe Water Purification Plant stores chlorine in 1-ton containers. Chlorine is mixed with the treated water before being pumped to homes and businesses. Chlorine is non-explosive and non-flammable, however, like oxygen it is capable of combustion under some circumstances. In addition, it is an irritant to the respiratory system, eyes and skin. Exposure through inhalation at high concentrations is toxic. To prevent accidental releases from occurring that may cause these injuries, the Water Purification Plant has several safety systems. These systems along with the Prevention Program described below greatly reduce the possibility of a significant release of chlorine from occurring. One safety system is the chlorine \"leak detectors\" that continuously monitor for leaks in the chlorine storage area. Even the smallest of leaks activates alarms that immediately alert plant personnel and also activates a \"scrubber\" that would treat the air containing the leak by removing over 99 percent of the chlorine before discharging it to the atmosphere. In addition, sensors monitor the system pressures and temperatures to detect abnormal conditions that may indicate that a chlorine leak is about to occur. These monitors allow corrective actions to be taken before a leak may occur.\n\nTo date, the safety systems in place have allowed the Water Purification Plant to achieve an excellent record in preventing accidents. No chlorine release causing a safety or health hazard has occurred within the last 15 years. \n\nSafety systems help reduce or eliminate the consequences of an accident, much like seat belts reduce injuries in car accidents and anti-lock brakes help avoid car accidents. But, unfortunately accidents can occur. By being prepare"

      "SummaryText": "d for an accident, we can handle the situation in a way that protects those around us. At the Water Purification Plant we prepare for an accidental release by planning a course of action to address and handle the situation. The Emergency Response Program details appropriate courses of action to be taken in the event of a release and is designed to protect people inside as well as outside of the plant. The combination of safety systems and the Emergency Response Program greatly reduces the risk due to a potential accidental release for people inside and nearby the plant. \n\nComponents of the RMP\n\nThe RMP consists of three major parts. The first part is the Hazard Assessment. The Hazard Assessment is done to determine the effects that a release of a regulated substance could have on the public. The second part is a Prevention Program that consists of 7 elements designed to improve the system safety and decrease the likelihood of a release. The third part is the Emergency Response Program, which develops a plan for dealing with a release in the unlikely event that one would occur. \n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Prevention Program consists of 7 elements designed to improve the system safety and decrease the likelihood of a release.\n\nSafety Information\n\nThe RMP regulations require that information concerning process chemicals, technology, and equipment be compiled as part of a RMP program. Emergency response planners can use such information to develop training programs and procedures, or as a general resource. The information will be supplied to contractors who will work in the chlorine process area. All the required process safety information was compiled as required by the RMP regulations. The information meets and in many cases exceeds the minimum required by the regulations.\n\nHazard Review\n\nA hazard review was conducted systematically to evaluate potential causes and consequences of accidental releases.

The chlorine Hazard Review was conducted by CH2M HILL with the assistance of Water Purification Plant staff familiar with the process operation and maintenance and plant management. The review was done using a \"Checklist\" method. Based on the results of the review, changes in operating, maintenance, and other process safety management procedures that would improve the overall safety of the chlorine system were identified. The changes that most effectively help prevent an accidental release have been or will in the future be implemented. \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe existing operating procedures for the chlorination processes have been recently reviewed and revised. Written operating procedures assure continuous, efficient, and safe operation of the facility. The goal of the operating procedures is to provide clear instructions to safely operate the process. Operating procedures are also used to train new employees and to provide refresher training for existing staff.\n\nThe detailed operating procedures include startup, shutdown and emergency operating procedures. The procedures describe how the system should be operated in order to minimize the chances of an accidental release. The procedures also emphasize safety considerations during operation and address hazardous situations that can occur and how to correct them.\n\nTraining\n\nAn effective RMP training program can significantly reduce the number and severity of accidental release incidences. Employees involved in operating or maintaining the chlorination process receive training that includes applicable operating and maintenance procedures and an overview of the process. Training must emphasize safety and health hazards and safe work practices.\n\nSioux Falls Water Purification Plant staff received initial training as part of their annual training on the chlorine system operations and maintenance. Refresher process operation training is provided at least ever"

The maintenance program addresses equipment testing and inspection, preventative maintenance schedules, and personnel training. The intent is to ensure that equipment used to process, store, or handle chlorine is properly maintained and installed to minimize the risk of releases.\n\nThe Water Purification Plant staff use a computerized maintenance management system Database MP2 to store equipment information, generate and prioritize work orders, and schedule preventative maintenance (PM). In addition to preventative maintenance, the Water Purification Plant staff performs corrective maintenance in the event of equipment malfunction or breakdown. All maintenance staff are trained to properly and safely perform maintenance.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nEach incident that resulted in or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release of chlorine must be investigated. A process to identify the underlying causes of incidents and implement procedures for preventing similar events has been developed. To investigate an incident, an investigation team will be established. As part of the investigation, an incident report will be prepared to recommend system changes to prevent the incident from occurring in the future.\n\nThe investigation team should ask questions such as what equipment failed, which behavior failed, and which material leaked, reacted, or exploded? As part of the incident review, staff actions that may have contributed to the incident will also be reviewed. A determination will be made as to whether it is necessary to institute additional training for the employees to prevent the incident from occurring in the future. The incident investigation report and any changes resulting from the report will be reviewed with all staff members who operate and maintain the applicable system. \n\nCompliance Audit\n\nThe Water Purification Plant  completes a com"

An auditor knowledgeable in the covered processes, RMP requirements, and audit techniques will conduct the audits. Based on the results of the audit, the plant  promptly determines an appropriate corrective action for each deficiency identified during the audit.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe Emergency Response Program develops a plan for dealing with a release. EPA RMP regulation 40 CFR 68 Subpart E require that an Accidental Release Emergency Response Plan be prepared. The plan must be prepared in accordance with the provisions of another overlapping OSHA regulation-Employee Emergency Plans (29 CFR 1910.38(a)).
