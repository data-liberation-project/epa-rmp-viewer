As a result of the safety features and policies described in the accidental release prevention program, worst case ammonia plumes would not impact any public receptors.\r\n\r\nEthosEnergy prepared an Integrated Contingency Plan for the facility.  The Integrated Contingency Plan establishes the facility safety systems, procedures, and administrative controls necessary to prevent an accidental release of ammonia, respond to a release, and minimize the consequences of a release should one occur.\r\n\r\nEthosEnergy has developed a comprehensive safety training program for all employees, has established detailed material handling procedures, and has adopted safe operating procedures for aqueous ammonia off-loading, storage, and use.  Initial emergency response training of facility staff is complete.  \r\n\r\nThe ammonia process is monitored by the plant operator.  Ammonia detectors (4) with audible alarms are located adjacent to the ammonia storage tank.  The containment area is inspected daily by plant operators for evidence of spills, leaks, or other conditions that may lead to a release. An ammonia unloading check sheet is completed with each offload.\r\n\r\nA seismic analysis was conducted for CPP as part of the licensing process.  The CPP facility is designed and constructed to conform to the 2001 California Building Standards Code for Seismic Zone 3.  As part of the licensing process, the California Energy Commission (CEC) concluded that the CPP facility (including the aqueous ammonia system) will be adequately constructed to provide seismic safety in the event of an earthquake.\r\n\r\nThe power plant consists of two General Electric 7FA natural gas-fired combustion turbine generators (CTGs).  There are twenty-two full-time employees, and the facility is manned 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) number for the CPP is 2211"

      "SummaryText": "Sacramento Metropolitan Utility District Financing Authority (SMUDFA) constructed the Cosumnes Power Plant (CPP), a nominal 500 megawatt, natural gas-fired, combined cycle power plant approximately 25 miles south south-east of Sacramento, California.  The facility will is operated by EthosEnergy under contract to SMUDFA.\r\n\r\nThe facility is subject to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program because the amount of ammonia stored onsite (18,000 total tank , administratively controlled to 15,000 gallons of 29 percent ammonia, or approximately 32,625 pounds, as ammonia) exceeds the CalARP threshold quantity (TQ) of 500 pounds.  CPP is also subject to the federal Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements because aqueous ammonia is stored in concentrations of greater than 20 percent, and the total quantity of 32,625  pounds exceeds the federal TQ of 10,000 pounds.  EthosEnergy prepared this RMP to satisfy CalARP and federal RMP requirements for the aqueous ammonia process at the CPP facility.  \r\n\r\nThe major hazards represented by the CPP aqueous ammonia process are the accidental release of ammonia, a toxic substance, due to spill or rupture of the storage vessel, associated piping system, or during a tanker truck unloading accident.\r\n\r\nEthosEnergy is concerned with the safety of its workers and individuals living and working near CPP.  EthosEnergy has therefore implemented a number of measures to ensure that it maintains a safe working environment. CPP has not had an ammonia release or ammonia related accident exceeding threshold quantities in the previous five years.\r\n\r\nSafety is maintained by performing all manufacturer required maintenance.  Planned safety changes could be initiated via preventative maintenance notification generated from the plants computerized maintenance system or safety suggestion.  Changes could be evaluated through a process known as design change notification. The design change notification process requires approval by the sit"

      "SummaryText": "12, Fossil Fuel Electric Power Generation.  CPP is located at 14295 Clay East Road in Herald, California.  The facility is located on approximately 30 acres in Section 29, Township 6N, Range 8E Mount Diablo base and meridian, adjacent to the Rancho Seco Power Plant.  CPP is located on the southeastern quarter of APN 140-0050-010 and on the southwestern quarter of APN 140-0050-008.  The site is zoned AG-80, which is compatible with the land use designation for a power generation facility. \r\n\r\nCPP uses aqueous ammonia (29 percent concentration by weight) as the reducing agent in the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) pollution control system to minimize emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) from the CTGs.  Aqueous ammonia is a hazardous substance regulated under the CalARP and federal RMP programs."
