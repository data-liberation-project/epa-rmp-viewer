Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies - Huntsman Conroe Plant is committed to providing a safe, healthy and environmentally responsible work place for its employees and neighbors.  This is exemplified by the Conroe Site Plant having earned and maintained its ranking as an Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) Star site for excellence in safety performance.  The Huntsman Conroe Site maintains a working Process Safety Management(PSM) program that implements a series of steps to control potential hazards associated with the process and assures a well-trained work force.   The PSM program further implements its policies with on-site procedures and manuals.  Huntsman Conroe Plant participates with community agencies to develop emergency response plans and participates in cooperative training with these agencies.  Since its certification in September 1992, the Conroe Site Plant has been an active participant in the International Standards Organization (ISO) 9002 quality management program.\n \n2.  Regulated Substances - Huntsman's Conroe Site Plant is located approximately five miles east of Conroe, Texas.  The Site Plant is 476 acres, of which 100 acres have been developed.  The Conroe Site takes raw materials and uses batch or continuous operations to produce useful chemicals which other companies then process into cosmetics, epoxy coatings and other consumer products.  Huntsman's Conroe Site Plant has 9 regulated substances at the facility.    \n\nThree flammable substances are:\n? Dimethylamine (DMA) - Used in hair products, gasoline additives, as antistatic agents, fabric softeners and dyes.\n? Hydrogen - Used to produce fuel additives and epoxy curing agents.\n? Monomethylamine (MMA) - Used in gas treating of refinery and natural gas streams and as a textile softener.\nSix toxic substances are:\n? Acrylonitrile - Used in making floor waxes, water treating chemicals and agricultural chemicals.\n? Amm"

These analyses are detailed in the registration section of this submission.\n\n4. General accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps. \nFollowing is a brief summary of the elements that Huntsman's Conroe Site has implemented to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements outlined by EPA as well as with the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard.  \n\n? Process Safety Information\n Huntsman's Conroe Site maintains a compilation of current and accurate written safety information to identify and understand the hazards of the process.  This includes information pertaining to:\n? Hazards of regulated substances:  For each regulated substance, there is a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) which discusses the physical properties of the chemicals, exposure hazards, the required personal protective equipment and the appropriate first aid and emergency treatment for exposure.\n? The technology of the process:  Includes a discussion of process chemistry, safe upper and lower limits of temperature and pressure and analysis of consequences of deviation.\n? Equipment in the process:  Includes such information as materials of construction, diagrams of the piping and instrumentation, safety systems and design codes.\n \n?

The PHAs also addressed consequences of failure of engineering and administrative controls, facility or stationary source siting, human factors and a qualitative evaluation of a range of possible safety and health effects of failure of controls. and the ways to minimize those hazards.  The Conroe Site utilizes the HAZOP methodology, a recognized and generally accepted method, for identifying and evaluating hazards in the process.  The Conroe Site assigns employees to the HAZOP team who are knowledgeable in the HAZOP methodology and the specific process.  The HAZOP team develops recommendations to reduce the potential hazards which, if approved, are implemented within a reasonable period of time. The Huntsman Conroe Plant completes a PHA Revalidation for each covered process every 5-years meeting the requirements of the PSM and RMP Standards. \n \n? Operating Procedures\n Huntsman Conroe Plant maintains written operating procedures that were developed in consultation with operators to provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities associated with a covered process.  The procedures address steps for all operating phases, safety systems, control measures and precautions to prevent exposures to process hazards.  The procedures are reviewed and/or revised annually to ensure their accuracy and completeness.\n \n? Training\n Huntsman Conroe Plant provides initial training as well as refresher training to employees to assure that the required level of skills and knowledge are maintained.  The training emphasizes safety and health hazards, emergency operations, and safe work practices.  All operators receive periodic refresher train"

Mechanical Integrity\n Huntsman Conroe Plant has developed written procedures for maintaining the operating components of the process (including pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps) through the mechanical integrity program.  The program is comprised of well-trained personnel who follow maintenance, testing and inspection procedures that ensure proper function of process equipment.\n \n? Management of Change (MOC)\n Huntsman Conroe Plant has established and implemented a written procedure to manage changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures, and any changes to the facility that affect a covered process.  The procedure assures that, prior to any change, the following issues are considered: the technical basis for the proposed change, its impact on safety and health, any modifications to operating procedures, the necessary time period for the change, and any authorization requirements.  Employees involved in operating a process, as well as maintenance and contract employees whose job will be affected, are informed of and trained in the change.  If necessary, the process safety information and operating procedures are updated.  \n \n \n? Pre-Startup Review (PSSR)\n Huntsman Conroe Plant performs Pre-Startup Safety Reviews when the addition of or a modification to the facility is made that is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.  The Pre-Startup Safety Review confirms, prior to the introduction of highly hazardous chemicals, that construction and equipment is in accordance with design specifications; safety, operating, maintenance and emergency procedures are in place; Management-of-Change requirements are met; and training of employees affected by modifications is complete.\n \n?
