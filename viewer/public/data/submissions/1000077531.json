The following details the prevention program elements at the Dallas Water Utilities Bachman Water Treatment Plant that apply to this process.\r\n\r\n4.1\tSafety Information\r\n\r\nThe Dallas Water Utilities Bachman Water Treatment Plant maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of the Dallas Water Utilities Bachman Water Treatment Plant processes.  Safety data sheets (SDSs) document the physical and chemical properties of hazardous substances handled at the Dallas Water Utilities Bachman Water Treatment Plant, including the chlorine and ammonia processes.  The engineering design documents include the operating parameters, the design basis and configuration of the equipment in each covered process, and references to applicable codes and standards.\r\n\r\n4.2\tHazard Review\r\n\r\nThe Dallas Water Utilities Bachman Water Treatment Plant performs and periodically updates hazard reviews of the covered processes to help identify and control process hazards.
