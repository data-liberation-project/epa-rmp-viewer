The facility receives sweet natural gas and reservoir fluids from the Walton 23H #1 and the Walton 23 #1 well sites.  The natural gas is separated from reservoir fluids, dehydrated, cooled by the Joules-Thompson effect (JT), compressed and sent to sales.  The natural gas liquids produced from the JT plant are stored in pressurized tanks and eventually hauled by truck to sales.\n\nACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\nIndigo Minerals, LLC has a commitment to worker safety and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases.  However, if a release does occur, the Emergency Response Plan will be initiated and trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release as well as notify local emergency response agencies for assistance.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the facility.  The processes at the Walton CDP Facility are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation.  This summary addresses the elements of the Walton CDP Facility's accident prevention program and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\nThe Walton CDP Facility keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.

For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, pressure, level) on the Pipe and Instrumentation Diagram (P&IDs).  The facility personnel ensure that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated and manual shutdowns).\n\nIndigo Minerals, LLC also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction and design pressures.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\nThe Walton CDP Facility has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Walton CDP Facility primarily uses the \"What if\" analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted by trained and knowledgeable personnel who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  The PHA personnel identify and evaluate hazards as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and make suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures as necessary.\n\nThe PHA findings are forwarded to management f"

This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.   To help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the PHA findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\nThe Walton CDP Facility maintains written procedures that address various modes of operation such as 1) Unit Startup, 2) Normal Operations, 3) Emergency Shut Down, 4) Normal Shutdown.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed at least annually to verify completeness and accuracy.\n\n In addition, the facility maintains a procedure that provides guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit deviations for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTRAINING\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Walton CDP Facility has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating"

After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All of this training\nis documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nCONTRACTORS\n\nThe Walton CDP Facility uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, Indigo Minerals, LLC evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Gas plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEWS (PSSRs)\n\nThe Walton CDP Facility conducts a PSSR for any n"

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly\nimplemented.\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\nThe Walton CDP Facility has established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner. Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to gas plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs. \n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Walton CDP Facility periodically conducts an internal audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. Both on-site and corporate personnel participate as audit team members. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to gas plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.
