Box 337 \nHayward, MN 56043 \n\nFor further information, contact Gary Gulbrandson, Agronomy Manager (507)-373-0250 \n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY- Ammonia \n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at our facility\nThis facility complies with the 1989 ANSI K 61.1 Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia. In addition, it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws. \n \nThis location is required to conduct it\u00c2\u00bfs own internal audit utilizing checklist survey forms that are reviewed regularly and updated as necessary to ensure all applicable federal state and local regulations are covered. The safety director conducts comprehensive annual audits at this location to measure regulatory compliance including those governing the safe handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia. The safety director requires a timely response of all recommendations resulting from the audit. \n\nA description of our facility and the regulated substances handled\n\n This facility is a wholesale farm supply distribution center as such we store and distribute a wide variety of pesticides and fertilizers including Anhydrous Ammonia. Anhydrous Ammonia is received by truck, is handled and stored on-site and is a regulated substance by the EPA requiring us to comply with the Risk Management Program. We sell anhydrous ammonia to grower customers in 1,000 and 1,450 gallon nurse tanks. The customer applies the ammonia into the soil as a source of nitrogen fertilizer for growing agricultural crops.\n\n Anhydrous ammonia is stored in 2 stationary storage tank(s) [1 @ 18,000 gallon; 1 @ 30,000 gallon] and nurse tanks on site. Therefore, the total facility anhydrous ammonia storage capacity for our facility is 470,000 pounds. The largest single storage vessel at our facility contains 130,000 pounds. \n\nThe worst case scenario\n\nHayward Cooperative has developed a worst case scenario; ho"

This facility complies with the ANSI K 61.1 standards (1989), OSHA (29 CFR 1910.111), EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule as well as all applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations. \n\nOur ammonia system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, and manual shutoffs. The load-out risers used for the purpose of filling the nurse tanks are protected by excess flow valves and fill line breakaways to immediately stop the flow of ammonia if a line or a hose fails. All of the main storage tank valves and the riser load valves are locked when not in use. \n\nOur ammonia system is inspected on a regular basis with maintenance and preventive maintenance scheduled and documented. Liquid and vapor valves, hoses, excess flow valves, gauges, and relief valves are replaced when necessary and/or according to the guidelines in the ANSI standards. \n \nTraining is provided to all employees involved with storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia at least annually, whenever there is a change in the process or whenever competency with the regulations is questioned. The training consists of classroom lecture, current videos, testing and certification and on the job training. \n\nFive-year accident history\n\n There has been no accidents involving anhydrous ammonia that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage including evacuations on or off-site. \n\nThe emergency response program\n\n In the event of an emergency involving our ammonia system, it i"

In preparation for this, we have coordinated with all of the local response agencies by providing information and facility tours to ensure that they are familiar with and properly prepared for an incident at our facility. This will help to ensure that our community has the strategy for responding to and mitigating the threat posed by an ammonia release. This complies with the requirement for our facility to be included in the community emergency response plan prepared under EPCRA and coordinated with our LEPC. \n\nIn addition, Hayward Cooperative has an Emergency Response and Contingency Plan for this facility that complies with the requirements of OSHA (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.1200). The plan includes public notification, provisions for initial medical care, evacuations and LEPC coordination. \n\nPlanned changes to improve safety\n\nWe will continue to provide our employees with ongoing annual training to ensure that they are current with all of the safe ammonia transfer and handling procedures, and provide regular inspection and maintenance on all of the ammonia equipment."
