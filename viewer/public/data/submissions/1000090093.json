Assets for the ammonia plant are owned and operated by Tampa Port Services (TPS), which is wholly owned by Mosaic.   \n\n \n\nThe Mosaic Faustina Facility has a long-standing commitment to our workers, community, and the environment. This commitment is demonstrated by our establishment of management systems and resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training, emergency equipment, participation in St. James Parish emergency drills, meetings with other companies and the St. James Parish emergency operations center, and meetings with Ascension Parish emergency response organizations. This commitment is also consistent with the company's environmental, health and safety policy which provides that:\n\n\n\n1. All facilities will be designed, safely operated, and managed to protect the health and safety of employees, the community and the environment;\n\n\n\n2. All employees are educated on the applicable environmental, health and safety standards, and procedures to manage the hazards associated with the regulated substance; and\n\n\n\n3. Audits will be conducted regularly to verify compliance with management systems as described in the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR Part 68.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, corporate policies include compliance with OSHA's regulation 29 CFR 119.1910 Process Safety Management standard to ensure that multiple levels of safeguards are established against the catastrophic release of highly hazardous chemicals from potential fire, explosion and /or accidental release of toxic hazards.\n\n\n\n2.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe Mosaic  Faustina Facility implements reasonable controls to prevent accidental releases of regulated and hazardous substances by considering less hazardous al"

When using a regulated substance, equipment is designed, built, maintained and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release consistent with industry and government standards. If an accidental release does occur, Mosaic's emergency response policy includes trained personnel to recognize an accidental release, quickly assess the severity of the release and involve personnel who are trained to control and contain the release in a safe manner. As mentioned above, Mosaic also participates with organizations within St. James and Ascension Parishes.\n\n\n\n2.2 Stationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Mosaic Faustina Facility produces granular monoammonium phosphate (GMAP) and diammonium phosphate (DAP) products. The raw materials used in this process include molten sulfur, phosphate rock, anhydrous ammonia, air and steam. Natural gas mixtures are used as a fuel source for some equipment within the granulation facilities. Additionally, the Faustina Facility manufactures anhydrous ammonia in the ammonia plant through a catalytic reaction involving natural gas, steam and air; the ammonia is used within the granulation facilities, stored and shipped off site. The manufacturing process for anhydrous ammonia also includes carbon dioxide as a byproduct. \n\nThe regulated substances involved in these processes at the Faustina Facility that exceed the threshold quantities as described by the Risk Management Program (\"RMP\") rule include anhydrous ammonia and a flammable gas mixture generated in the ammonia plant. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in a large refrigerated storage tank surrounded by a dike. In addition to the anhydrous ammonia manufactured in the facility's ammonia plant, the Faustina Facility also receives anhydrous ammonia via an underground commercial pipeline, as well as by ship and barge at the facility's river dock on occasion. Ammonia is loaded into tanker trucks for transport at the ammonia truck loading facility.   Natural gas is rece"

Based on the quantities of these substances present at the Faustina Facility, it is subject to OSHA's PSM requirements, and therefore, the Faustina Facility satisfies the eligibility requirements for a Program 3 Prevention Program under EPA's RMP. The Faustina Facility has fully implemented OSHA's PSM standard requirements and is using this program as its RMP Prevention Program. A summary of the facility's PSM program is as follows:\n\n\n\nThe Mosaic Faustina Facility encourages all employees to participate in all facets of process safety and accident prevention and has an employee participation plan that documents the many ways employees are involved in these processes.\n\nThe Mosaic Faustina Facility has technical documents which describe the process safety information associated with the regulated substances. These documents, which are available to all our employees, describe:\n\n \n\n(1) Physical properties of the hazardous substances,\n\n \n\n(2) Operating parameters for our equipment, and \n\n\n\n(3) Design basis and configuration of our equipment. These documents are available for reference and updated if there are changes within the facility through our management of change process.\n\n\n\nThe Mosaic Faustina Facility also has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards using process hazard analysis techniques. \n\n\n\nThe Mosaic Faustina Facility periodically re-validates its process hazard analyses to incorporate regulatory"

Typically, the vessel operates significantly below maximum capacity. \n\nIn the event of a long-term compressor outage, the anhydrous ammonia could be flared, sent to another ammonia producer in nearby Ascension Parish, or consumed in the granulation plants. In the event of a vessel rupture, there is a dike surrounding the vessel sufficiently high to contain its entire contents with a margin of safety. There is also an internal dike within the main dike that would keep smaller spills from spreading out to the maximum area of the dike thus reducing spill evaporation. A series of relief valves also protect the tank from over-pressure . \n\nMajority of ammonia relief valves are placed such that a discharge is elevated and would be significantly diluted before reaching areas affecting people.  There are also automated shutdown systems for the anhydrous ammonia manufacturing plant at the site. The ammonia truck loading facility is equipped with a manual emergency shutdown and deluge system in the event of an emergency. Measures to prevent the accidental release of the flammable gases in the ammonia plant and to minimize the effects of any accidental releases include: redundant instruments, backup systems, and water deluge systems.\n\n\n\n2.4 Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe five-year accident history includes a review of all accidental releases of regulated substances held above threshold quantities in covered processes that resulted in on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage.

When an emergency arises requiring outside assistance, the Faustina Facility's overall emergency response program is coordinated with the St. James Parish Emergency Operations Center (St. James EOC). Via this organization, the facility works closely with other emergency response organizations including the sheriffs of both parishes, St. James Parish and Ascension Parish emergency response personnel, Louisiana State Police and Prevost Memorial Hospital in Donaldsonville. The Mosaic Faustina Facility has 24-hour capability to communicate with these organizations. The facility uses an Incident Command System for emergency response.\n\n\n\nThe Mosaic Faustina Facility is an active member of the St. James Parish CAER Committee/Mutual Aid Organization. This group includes parish government and major area industries. \n\n\n\nThe Mosaic Faustina Facility has an emergency equipment maintenance, inspection, and testing program. In addition, facility employees receive training (First Responder Operations Level) for the use of emergency response equipment, emergency response, medical assistance, and the Incident Command System. There is a significant number of appropriately trained personnel on each shift, "

Appropriate changes are made in response to audit recommendations and operating experience. \n\n\n\nThe Mosaic Faustina Facility periodically tests its emergency response program. The testing consists of onsite testing of emergency response equipment, in plant drills, and periodic mock emergency response scenarios coordinated by the St. James EOC. The facility also includes TV and radio station telephone numbers in its emergency response plan.\n\n\n\n2.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThe Mosaic Faustina Facility has action items assigned and scheduled to be completed because of soliciting safety suggestions from our employees, internal audits, equipment inspections and process hazard analyses. In 2019, a series of safety improvement upgrades were made in the ammonia plant, including installation of double block and bleed valves on the process and fuel gas, and additional relief valves and interlocks.  Furthermore, the Mosaic Faustina Facility built a new ammonia control room in 2019 which was installed outside of the 2-psi blast zone in the plant.  In 2021, facility has started engineering work for the flare installation project and targeting execution by the end of 2025.\n\n\n\n2.7 RMP Update and Resubmittal\n\n\n\nThe October 2020 update and resubmittal incorporated changes due to the following projects at the facility, as well as providing updated prevention program and general facility information as required for a 5-year resubmittal. The Mosaic Faustina Facility installed an ammonia scrubber unit in 2017 for the reduction of NOx emissions. The system was designed to remove fuel bound nitrogen in the form of ammonia from the low-pressure purge gas going into the reformer fuel system. Additionally, new ammonia storage compressors were installed in 2017 to manage the pressure within the ammonia storage tank. In October 2018, a new ammonia loading pump was added to "

In 2019 a series of safety improvement upgrades were made in the ammonia plant, including installation of double block and bleed valves on the process and fuel gas, and additional relief valves and interlocks. In 2020, Mosaic Faustina Facility implemented dock modifications to be able to receive larger barges to assist with inventory control of ammonia. Process Hazards Analyses (PHA) were performed as part of these capital projects.\n\n"
