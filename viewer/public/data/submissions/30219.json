Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n    We at the Rock Island wastewater Treatment Plant are committed to a safe working environment for employees, community, and the environment. Procedures and equipment have been reviewed to ensure that the chlorine process is as safe as possible. If, for some inforeseeable reason there were a chlorine gas release, we are coordinated with the Rock Island Fire department.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled.\n   We have 1 regulated substance, which is CHLORINE. The maximum inventory of chlorine stored at our facility is 6000 lbs.\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n   To perform the OCA we used the look-up tables and equations provide by the EPA.\n\nToxic Worst Case analysis:\n   The worst Case scenario involves a catastrophic release of chlorine gas from a ruptured tank. The release rate would be 200 lbs/min for a total of 2000 lbs of chlorine gas. The distance to end point is 5.4 miles and the affected population is 159,814.\nToxic Alternative analysis:\n   The Alternative scenario involves a release of chlorine gas from a broken valve at a rate of 0.33 lbs/min for a total of 200 lbs. The distance to end point is 0.08 miles and the affected population is 0.\n\nFlammable Worst Case analysis:\n   None applicable\n\nFlammable Alternative analysis:\n   None applicable\n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention steps.\n    Our facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements of 40 CFR part 68. Our process is suject to the OSHA PSM standard.\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n   The Rock Island wastewater plant maintains records of safety imformation, chemical hazards, operating procedures, and equipment design info. \nProcess Hazard Analysis:\n    Our facility conducts a PHA with a team of employees using the \"What-if\" methodology at 5 year intervals. Any findings are addre"
