If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Virginia Fire Dept., Cass Co. ESDA Services or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.\tStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers, farm chemicals and related agricultural products, for sale to the farmer.\n\nThe maximum quantity of Anhydrous Ammonia stored would be 30000 gallons (or 140196 lbs.) in our storage tank(s), consisting of 30,000 Gal. The maximum quantity handled in the largest tank (1-30,000 Gal Ammonia Storage Tank ) would be 140196 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\n3.\tThe Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario.\n\nWorse-Case:  The worse-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank (or rail tank car) released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 140196 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.6 miles, which would encompass an area of 8.04 sq. miles, with the potential of impacting approximately 2000 souls in the surrounding area.\n\nAlternative Case:  The alternative release scenario is based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a 3 inch Diameter transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.6 miles, which would encompass an area of 1.13 sq. miles, with the potential of impacting approximately 500 souls in the surroundin"

ESDA Services.  We train our staff on the elements found in our response program (in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120) and have invited the fire department to visit our facility in order to provide them with a working knowledge of our plant's layout and our storage facility. This facility has provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
