We are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and transfering of anhydous ammonia to our customers in a manner so they may use anhydrous ammonia in an effective manneer. The maximum quantity stored at our facility is 128,520 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in our storage tank.\n\nThe worst case release scenario would be the release of the largest storage tank over a 10 minute period. The maximum quantity released would be 128,520 pounds which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at the 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint is 2.5 miles, which would include no more than two residences and eight occupants at the most. The closest residence is 1.75 miles for the location. The alternate release scenerio based on industry records and is the most likely potential incident, is a release from a rupture of a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint is 0.83 miles, which does not include any occupied recepticles.\n\nOur company has an outstanding safety record. Over the past five years we have had no off-sight or on-sight reportable accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. This is due to the pro-active approach our firm has taken in handling this product. We have trained and tested not only our employee group but management has also taken advanced training in handling and mantenance of anhydrous ammonia equipment.\n\nWe are heavily regulated by DOT, OSHA, EPA and the Kansas Department of Agriculture in the proper handling of anhydrous ammonia. In addition we coordinate our safety efforts with our community emerge"
