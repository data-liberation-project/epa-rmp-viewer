As a requirement of the Clean Air Act Amendments 112(r) Accidental Release of Hazardous Air Substances program, Red Trail Energy, LLC. completed a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for any chemical stored on-site that will be above the reporting threshold of 10,000 pounds.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nRed Trail Energy, LLC. is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process, specifically aqueous ammonia and pentane, as a constituent of the natural gasoline used as the ethanol denaturant.  The ammonia is used for pH control directly in the process feed mixture to fermentation.  The denaturant is added to the ethanol to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption.  It is the policy of Red Trail Energy, LLC. to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws.

Anhydrous ammonia is stored on-site and used in the ethanol production process for pH control.  The maximum anhydrous ammonia stored will be 168,000 pounds.  The fuel ethanol production process requires use of a denaturant (natural gasoline) which may contain approximately 40 percent pentane, an RMP regulated substance.  The maximum amount of denaturant on-site is estimated to be 1,046,100 pounds (total pentane approximately 418,440 pounds).  The natural gasoline is stored in an above ground tank as a liquid a"
