      "SummaryText": "Tri-City Water Pollution Control Plant\nClackamas, Oregon\n\nEach day wastewater and surface water flow to the Tri-City Water Pollution Control Plant in Clackamas County, Oregon.  The plant serves the cities of West Linn, Oregon City, and Gladstone.  The plant, which was built in 1986, is owned and operated by the Clackamas County Water Environment Services Department. Wastewater flows vary from 6 million gallons per day (mgd) in the dry season to 25 mgd in the wet season.  The plant is operated in compliance with a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System  (NPDES) permit issued by the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nThe Tri-City plant uses the following process to treat wastewater: \n\n\u00c2\u00b7 First screens are used to separate the water from large debris, such as limbs and rags. \n\n\u00c2\u00b7 In grit chambers, air is added to the water to make it lighter so dirt and other heavier particles settle to the bottom.\n\n\u00c2\u00b7 Next, in the primary clarifiers, additional solids are allowed to settle out of the raw wastewater.\n\n\u00c2\u00b7 The main part of wastewater treatment occurs in aeration basins where oxygen is added to the water, creating an environment where beneficial bacteria can grow and reproduce. These bacteria digest unwanted bacteria and organic matter in the raw wastewater. \n\n\u00c2\u00b7 In the secondary clarifiers, the last of the solids are separated from the water as they settle to the bottom. Now, the water and solids go in different directions. \n\n\u00c2\u00b7 The water flows into the chlorine contact chamber where chlorine is added to kill any remaining bacteria. Chlorine is the primary wastewater disinfectant used around the world to reduce pathogens in wastewater and the related risks to public health. It is inexpensive, effective, readily available, and its chemistry is well understood. Chlorine is used because it is a very effective disinfectant that is highly toxic to organisms in the wastewater.  It is this toxicity that creates a r"

Chlorine is one of the regulated chemicals discussed in the following risk management plan. To reduce the risk of such a release, the Tri-City Plant uses a number of safety precautions, which are discussed below.\n\n\u00c2\u00b7 The water is then dechlorinated and tested to make sure it meets wastewater discharge standards before it is discharged to the Willamette River.\n\n\u00c2\u00b7 The solid materials separated from the water during treatment are called biosolids, or sludge. These are allowed to decompose in anaerobic sludge digesters.  This process produces digester gas, composed primarily of methane, which is used as a fuel to heat the digesters and to generate electricity to offset the plant's power needs.  Digester gas is the second regulated chemical discussed in our risk management plan. Once the solids have decomposed they are land applied.\n\nTRI-CITY'S ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION \nAND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nPublic health and safety issues are the greatest concern for the Tri-City Water Pollution Control Plant because we are responsible for treating wastewater and protecting the quality of the Willamette River.   Plant staff and management are also committed to minimizing the related possible risks presented by those processes used to treat the Tri-City area's wastewater.  \n\nOne chemical regulated by EPA's risk management program, chlorine, is stored onsite.  The plant also complies with OSHA's process safety management (PSM) rules, which also regulate these chemicals.\n\nThe plant has an integrated risk management program, which consists of staff training, a plant safety program, regular maintenance checks and upgrades, daily plant inspection, and an accidental release prevention program.  The plant's process safety program is audited at least every 5 years. \n\nStaff Training\n\nOperators are trained in formal certification classes, on-the-job de"

Each employee receives training in plant  processes and chlorine handling and operating procedures upon hire, and appropriate training before being involved in any newly assigned process. Each employee also receives refresher training at least every 3 years, and the plant manager maintains a training record and schedule for all employees.\n\nChlorine \n\nThe chlorine system consists of the following components:\n\n\u00c2\u00b7 1-ton chlorine cylinders (approximately 6.5 feet long and 30 inches in diameter)\n\u00c2\u00b7 Piping systems and components (e.g., valves)\n\u00c2\u00b7 Relief and vent systems\n\u00c2\u00b7 Emergency shutdown systems\n\u00c2\u00b7 Scrubber system\n\u00c2\u00b7 Controls, including monitoring devices, and sensors, alarms, and interlocks\n\u00c2\u00b7 Omni-directional Siren Model 2\n\nAll of these components are inspected regularly and maintained following the manufacturer's recommendations.  \n\nChlorine is delivered to the Tri-City Water Pollution Control Plant by truck. Plant Staff trained in chlorine handling procedures use a specially designed crane system to transfer the 1-ton chlorine tanks from the truck to the chlorine building. Each tank is about 6.5 feet long and 30 inches in diameter, about the size of a large water heater.  The chlorine is stored in a leak tight, concrete chlorine building.  \n\nThis building is equipped with a chlorine detection alarm system.  If a release occurs and the chlorine concentration inside the building is less than 10 parts per million (ppm), red lamps over the building doors flash on and off, a \"warning\" light on the control panel turns on,  an alarm horn begins to sound intermittently, and all staff evacuate the building. Trained staff in appropriate safety gear may then reenter the building to find and repair the leak. The alarm system automatically resets itself once chlorine gas is not detected in the building.\n\nIf a release occurs and concentrations inside the building are greater than 10 ppm, the red lamps over the building doors remain on"

      "SummaryText": ", an \"alarm\" light on the control panel turns on, the alarm horn sounds constantly, the omni-directional fire siren sounds constantly  and a \"chlorine leak alarm\" is automatically sent to offsite emergency response personnel. The building is also equipped with a ventilation system and chlorine gas scrubber that is activated automatically if concentrations are greater than 10 ppm. In the event of an accidental release inside the building, a fan pulls the chlorine-laden air through the scrubber, where it comes in contact with a caustic solution that absorbs chlorine vapor.  A high-efficiency mist eliminator then removes residual caustic solution, which is collected in a storage tank.  The scrubber is designed to provide a minimum overall performance of 99.99 percent chlorine removal.  To ensure that the scrubber continues to operate throughout any release, it can only be shut down manually by turning off the system at the control panel. \n\nAnother area where the risk of an accidental release can be reduced is in the chlorine distribution system.  The Tri-City plant uses a vacuum chlorine gas feed system.  In this system, flowing wastewater creates a vacuum that pulls the chlorine out of the storage cylinder and through the delivery piping. The unit will not allow chlorine to flow unless a vacuum is present. If a problem occurs, such as the vacuum line breaking or the ejector failing, the flow of chlorine is automatically halted. \n  \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Tri-City Water Pollution Control Plant has developed an emergency response plan to meet OSHA requirements (1910.38).  This plan applies to both chlorine and digester gas incidents.  The plant also has an additional emergency action plan to address small chlorine releases.   \n\nFor minor leaks (10 ppm or less, usually encountered during the cylinder change procedure), employees, who wear respirators during this procedure, close the main cylinder valve and follow a checklist procedure to reseat or tighten the y"

Operators immediately evacuate the chlorine room and implement the Emergency Action Plan.  If the scrubber system is able to maintain chlorine levels below 10 ppm, trained plant operators may re-enter to control the leak.  If levels remain above 10 ppm, offsite, emergency response departments (HAZMAT) respond to the emergency and police or fire personnel conduct a house-to-house notification in the surrounding area, if needed. \n\nPlant personnel respond to small fires using fire extinguishers.  Should a larger incident occur, operators would call the offsite emergency response personnel (Fire Department).\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Tri-City plant has never had a reportable accident or any incident with offsite consequences.  \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Tri-City plant regularly reviews its safety programs to ensure safe operation of the plant and to reduce risks to plant staff and public safety.  We have integrated safety and training programs in place.  No changes to those programs are planned at this time."
