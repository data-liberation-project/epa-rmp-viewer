Nor have there been any accidental releases that resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. \n\nSargento is committed to continuous improvement regarding our ammonia refrigeration system in Kiel. Future plans include piping upgrades to reduce the likelihood of corrosion and improve the mechanical integrity of the ammonia system.  Sargento also benchmarks to ensure the highest standards of risk and liability mitigation.  Per the recently released IIAR9-2020 standard, Sargento has audited our ammonia refrigeration system and is actively incorporating recommendations to improve the system safeties of our refrigeration system. In 2022, Sargento created a corporate compliance department to help interpret regulations and provide guidance regarding keeping our facilities and local communities safe. We continue to maintain good relationships with local emergency response agencies and are planning joint exercises with them in the near future."

The RMP rule, found in 40CFR68, uses a tiered approach for its risk management requirements. \n\nSargento is committed to protecting the health and well-being of their employees, the environment, and the community. Employee training programs are in place, including ammonia awareness training for all employees. Sargento maintenance employees are trained on operation of the ammonia system and perform system walk-throughs and operating checks during each working day. The facility has a chemical labeling program and a spill prevention plan.  The program requirements under the RMP and PSM programs are similar, and include safety information, hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-startup review, compliance audits, incident investigation, employee participation, hot work permits and contractor management. Both programs require a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA). The most recent PHA was conducted in May 2023. In addition, the RMP program includes an offsite consequence analysis, a management system, and emergency response planning.\n\nIf an emergency were to occur, the local fire and hazardous response team would be notified, and the emergency response procedures would be followed. Sargento has retained Bassett Mechanical (Kaukauna, Wisconsin) to respond to a release or an emergency. The facility has an Emergency Action Plan, and employees regularly train on use of the plan. Emergency drills covering various emergency types are conducted several times each year. Sargento strives to have at least one drill each year that involves an ammonia-related emergency. Sargento works closely with the Manitowoc County LEPC which would coordinates emergency response for the local community.\n\nIn the past five years, Sargento has had no accidental releases that resulted in deaths"

Processes conducted at the Kiel facility include high speed slicing with zip closure packaging, horizontal form/fill/seal shred packaging with zip closures, dices and cubed cheese in bulk packaging and high-speed portion- control packaging of cheese.  In addition, Kiel also produces process cheese snacks and frozen cheese products both with and without partial oil frying. This plant occupies about 373,000 ft2 and is situated on a 40-acre parcel of land near the northern limits of the City of Kiel. Adjacent properties to the northwest, north, northeast, east, and southeast are farmland or undeveloped land. Commercial-type properties are located to the south, southwest, and west. Residential properties are located to the southwest beyond the commercial properties. A few residences are located to the north.\n\nThe facility has a basic two-stage mechanical refrigeration system utilizing ammonia as the refrigerant. The amount of ammonia in the system is ~27,000 lbs. The ammonia refrigeration system was designed and installed in accordance with Wisconsin Administrative Code Department of Safety and Professional Services Chapter 345, IIAR standards, and ASHRAE. The facility is equipped with alarm and ammonia detection systems, which continually monitor the refrigeration system. \n\nSargento\u0092s ammonia system \u0096at its Kiel facility is covered by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Plan (PSM) per OSHA standard 1910.119 which requires the facility to manage system operations and develop emergency response and accident prevention programs. The PSM will be audited every three years. Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) will be conducted every five years, or when a major change is made to the ammonia system. Sargento trains key plant management personnel including plant engineers, plant mana"
