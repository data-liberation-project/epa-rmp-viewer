Employee Participation : This program ensures that the employees are involved in establishing and implelmenting the prevention program.Employees are also involved when a process hazard analysis is conducted. This program also ensures that the employees have complete access to the program on company property. Regularly scheduled meetings are held to discuss any concerns.\n\n2. Process Safety Information: Written information has been collected which enables the employees or members of the general public to identify and understand the potential hazards in the refrigeration system. The written information includes the MSDS program as well as a description of the design of the refrigeration system. The written information also includes the MSDS on the ammonia in the refrigeration, standards, guidelines, and basic information about the chemistry of the refrigeration system, and the thermodynamic properties of the refrigeration system.\n\n3. Process Hazards Analysis: A formal analysis using the whwt-if Checklist Technique was conducted prior to the start-up of the system to identify potential hazards. For each Management of change and at regularly scheduled intervals, a process Hazard Analysis will be conducted and the corporate review team will review its recommendations.\n\n4. Operating Procedures: Written operating procedures have been developed that describe the steps to be followed tp operate the refrigeration system safely. Every Management of Change and any operation involved and implemented for the actions required.\n\n5. Training: Atraining schedule has been established and implemented which ensures that all employees understand their responsibilities during and after an ammonia release. Additional training schedules have been established and implemented for the operators of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n6.Contractors: All contractors will be screened"

Pre-Start-up Safety Review: a pre start-up sfety review will be completed for all new ammonia projects prior to its start-up to verify that all safety programs are established, all the training has been completed by all individuals involved, and construction has been completed according to design standards and guidelines.\n\n8. Mechanical Integrity: A mechanical integrity program is established to ensure that the ammonia refrigeration system is built to the established codes and is maintained to manufacturer's recommendations.Preventive maintenance procedures are also established to ensure the refrigeration system is maintained properly to minimize unexpected breakdown and failure.\n\n9: Hot Work Permit: A hot work program has been established and implemented so that any cutting, welding, or burning operation on the ammonia refrigeration system must be authorized by the maintenance manager or the safety manager.\n\n10. Management of Change: These procedures ensure that the Plant Engineer and the Refrigeration Manager properly review all changes made to the systems.\n\n11. Incident Investigation: These procedures ensure that any incident ( and near missed ) are investigated, reviewed, and documented using an investigation team.\n\n12. Compliance Audit: An audit of the Process Safety Management Program and Risk Management Plan will be performed on a regular schedule to ensure that the program  is being continually implemented and working properly.\n\n13.
