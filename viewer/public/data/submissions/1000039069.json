The Williams Companies Inc. is committed to the safety and health of its employees, contractors and visitors. This commitment is demonstrated in the design, installation, operation and maintenance programs developed and implemented specifically for this facility. Operation and maintenance personnel are trained in the appropriate emergency response procedures to follow in the event of an accidental release. However, accident prevention is the ultimate goal and as such a site specific mechanical integrity program is being implemented and maintained.\r\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\nThe Oak Grove Plant is located approximately 2 miles Southwest of Moundsville, West Virginia; Marshall County. It is a cryogenic expander plant that is designed to extract liquid petroleum products (ethane, propane, butane, pentane, and heavier hydrocarbons) from raw natural gas and at the same time produce pipeline quality (primarily methane and ethane) gas. The plant contains an above threshold quantity of regulated flammable substances, including methane, ethane, propane, butane, and pentane (liquid petroleum products). There are no above threshold quantity toxic substances present at the Oak Grove Plant.\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nThe Oak Grove Plant has developed and implemented a site-specific accidental release prevention program that consists of a detailed facility mechanical integrity program and employee training program. The mechanical integrity program was developed under the guidelines of manufacturer written recommendations, recognized/generally accepted good engineering practices, industry/regulatory standards and past operation history. Employee training was designed to ensure/document employee understanding"

The ERP includes the names and phone numbers not only of company personnel but also the names and phone numbers of support services (contractor, police departments, fire departments, medical services/hospitals, regulatory agencies, LEPC, etc.) that may be called upon for assistance. Liaison with these agencies is maintained to ensure timely and proper responses. Employee understanding of their responsibilities during an emergency situation is high priority.\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nThe Williams Companies Inc. believes safety is an issue that can always be improved upon. Williams continues to look for, develop, and implement programs that will improve an employee's ability to identify and correct potential workplace hazards. Williams also endeavors to ensure policies, programs and procedures are developed and implemented to meet applicable laws, rules and regulations. Employee understanding of these policies, programs and procedures is high priority."
