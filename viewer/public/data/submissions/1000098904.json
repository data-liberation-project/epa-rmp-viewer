This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\nTo save lives.\n\nTo minimize and avoid injuries.\n\nTo protect the environment.\n\nTo minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nAmericold, Ontario CA (Plant #75141) maintains an emergency response (safety)  whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes. \n\n\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Americold, Ontario CA (Plant #75141) facility chills and stores a variety of food products in their cold storage warehouse.  The refrigeration process, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold storage rooms.  Changes in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature.  For example, lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature.  Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat.  Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize.  Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid.  Typical operating conditions range from vacuum (approximately 6\" Hg) on the low pressure side of the system to 150-160 psig on the high side.\n\n\n\nA"

Maintain current and complete refrigeration system technical information. (Addressed under the Process Safety Information Element)\n\n2. Provide thorough team evaluation of the refrigeration system. The evaluation considers a number of potential problems including mechanical problems, human errors, and external events (e.g., earthquakes, impact, terrorism, theft, etc.). All safety recommendations developed by the team are reviewed and addressed by Americold (Addressed under Process Hazard Analysis and Mechanical Integrity Elements).\n\n3. Written procedures and policies that establish how the refrigeration system should be operated and maintained and how to investigate accidental releases. (Addressed under Operating Procedures, Mechanical Integrity, and Incident Investigation Elements.)\n\n4. Certification of refrigeration operators to safely operate the refrigeration system. Americold certifies operators following completion of operator training and confirmation of the operator's ability to apply what they have learned. (Addressed under Training Element.)\n\n5.

      "SummaryText": "am. This is addressed on two levels. First, refrigeration equipment operators participate in the planning and evaluation of the Prevention Programs (e.g., Process Hazard Analysis study team, writing and/or reviewing operating procedures, Incident Investigation team, etc.). This involvement encourages ownership of the Prevention Program and positively affects the operators' day-to-day activities. Second, all Americold's,\n\nemployees (direct hires, contract) receive ammonia awareness training. Additionally, they have access to the RMP/PSM information. These activities improve the\n\noverall safety of the employees. (Both levels are addressed under the Employee Participation Element)\n\n6. Implementation of additional measures when changes are planned (procedural or mechanical). These measures begin before any changes are made and may include a Process Hazard Analysis, operator training, and Process Safety Information updates plus other measures required by the Management of Change Procedure. If a mechanical change is required and for maintenance contracts, Americold has a procedure for selecting a contractor based on the company's experience\n\nand safety history. Additionally, if welding, grinding, or other Hot Work occurs close to the refrigeration system, a Americold's Hot Work permit is required. The purpose of the permit and the associated Hot Work procedure is to minimize the possibility of a fire. Following completion of a mechanical change, a pre-startup safety review is required before the system can be started. (These areas are addressed under Management of Change, Contractor Qualifications, Hot Work\n\nPermit, and Pre-Start-up Safety Review Elements.) \n\n7. Verification of Americold Logistics compliance with the RMP/PSM program. This self-audit process is an important tool to confirm whether each of the elements in the Prevention Program (and the Risk Management Program) has been implemented and properly documented by Americold's personnel.
