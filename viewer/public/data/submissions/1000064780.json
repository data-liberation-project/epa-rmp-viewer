This filtration plant is owned by Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (PRASA) which is a Government Agency.  PRASA has developed the RMP following the Program #3 for the Management and Prevention of Risks associated with the storage and handling of the toxic substance used as for water disinfection: Chlorine.  The RMP was prepared in compliance with EPA 40 CFR Part 68.  The Prevention Program was prepared in accordance with OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation, as established in 29 CFR Part 1910.119.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release:\r\nIt is PRASA policy to comply with EPA and OSHA Federal and State applicable requirements. Chlorine is a toxic substance regulated by EPA, for that reason Coto Laurel Filtration Plant has undergone some engineering controls.  Changes have been put in place to improve safety and as a part of the Prevention Plan implanted to protect the wellness of workers, contractors, visitors and immediately surrounding areas and inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substance handled.\r\nCoto Laurel Filtration Plant is located close to the area where the plants supply the potable water.  The chlorine is used as a disinfectant to destroy the microorganism that could cause illness in humans.\r\n\r\nThe chlorine is delivered from the San Juan Chlorine Warehouse and Distribution Center to the facility in one (1) ton containers.  Coto Laurel Filtration Plant could have a maximum storage capacity of 10,000 pounds distributed in five (5) containers.  The containers are connected to Vacuum Regulator from which the chlorine flows to the ejectors and then the chlorinated water is sent to one (1) injections points along the process of the plant. \r\n\r\nWorst Case Scenario:\r\nThe Worst Case Scenario was determined as indicated in the EPA Wastewater Treatment Plant, as per Appendix F Supplemental Risk Management Program Guidance for"

NRC Report Number: 1248856\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\r\nPRASA has already implemented in Coto Laurel Filtration Plant, a vacuum operated system to improve the control of the process and the safety of the chlorine handling and storage."

This guidance considers the release of the entire content inside the 2,000 pound  chlorine container, during 10 minutes and other specifications related to the weather conditions and a radio of 1.3 miles, for a chlorine concentration equal or higher than 3 ppm, which is the American Industrial Hygiene Association exposure limit above which it is determined human health will be affected.  Using MARPLOT and the US Census 2010, it was identified that 8,839 public receptors are inside the 1.3 miles radio. Environmental receptors (state parks, wetland or rivers) are located within this radio area.  The ALOHA Modeling Dispersion Program was used to simulate the gas dispersion.\r\n\r\nAlternative Case Scenario:\r\nThe more realistic scenario was also simulated as per EPA Wastewater Treatment Plants parameters, as a release of a 880 pounds, but throughout a valve seal rupture.  In this case the end point distance is calculated at 0.2 miles an average of 106 public receptors were identified over the most recent map. Environmental receptors are located within this radio area.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program \r\nPRASA is actually in a very aggressive operation to implement a Prevention Plan to ensure the maintenance and mechanical integrity of the facility which will improve significantly the safety scope of the current prevention plans.  Standard Operational Procedures (SOP's) are already in place to comply the OSHA and PROSHO requirements in order to keep all the involved parties aware of the hazardous and risk related to the chlorine.  List of all SOP's are indicated in the PSM document and are located in the facility.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program:\r\nPRASA has various SOP's to manage emergency programs associated to a release of the chemical and also related to the emergency actions to be taken before and after hurricanes and other atmospherics events.\r\n\r\nFive years Accident History:\r\nA release of chlorine in excess of ten (10) pounds w"
