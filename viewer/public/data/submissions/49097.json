Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Coca-Cola North America Auburndale, Florida facility is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated ammonia refrigeration.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of ammonia.  If such a release does occur, we coordinate the response with the Polk County Fire Services and the Polk County LEPC for emergency response support.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThis facility primarily produces juice and fruit drink products.  The only Risk Management Program (RMP) regulated substance present is ammonia, utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-loop refrigeration system.  The ammonia refrigeration system has been operational since late 2000.  Its purpose is to provide cold storage capabilities for perishable products.  Due to the size and characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration system, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, this facility is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68.  Our facility is also subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119, as well as the EPCRA Section 302 and 311/312 notification/reporting requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention program that are in place at our facility.\n\nProcess Safety Management\n\nThe Coca-Cola North America facility maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, opera"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses are What If Scenarios.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in refrigeration engineering and process operations, and are re-evaluated at a minimum of every five (5) years.  Any findings related to the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purpose of safely conducting activities related to our ammonia refrigeration system, Coca-Cola North America maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation including startup, normal operations, emergency operations, normal shutdown, emergency shutdown, and pump out.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to all operators who work with the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nTraining\n\nCoca-Cola North America has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that authorized employees, who are working with the ammonia refrigeration system, are competent in all relevant operating procedures.  Refresher training is provided at least every three (3) years.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nCoca-Cola North America carries out highly documented maintenance checks on ammonia refrigeration system equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, piping systems, pressure relief valves, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in applicable maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are cor"

Authorized employees whose job tasks are affected by an ammonia refrigeration system modification are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-Startup Reviews\n\nPre-startup safety reviews are conducted any time the ammonia refrigeration system, or any of its components, are opened for repairs, tie-ins, or modifications.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating procedures, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nThe audits of the full PSM/RMP programs will be carried out at least every three (3) years.  Any corrective actions required as a result of these audits will be undertaken in a safe and timely manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nCoca-Cola North America promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could have reasonably resulted in, an unintentional release of ammonia.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident, as well as to define any corrective actions implemented to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nCoca-Cola North America truly believes that PSM and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to information related to PSM and RMP implementation, including Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) information.\n\nContractors\n\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and/or construction activities related to the ammonia refrigeration system.

Coca-Cola North America has a policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work with the ammonia refrigeration system.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of ammonia occur.\n\n4. Five-year Accident History\n\nCoca-Cola North America has a good record of preventing accidental releases.  However there was one accidental release on June 11, 2004 of approximately 2,370 pounds.  No one onsite or offsite was injured, but the facility was evacuated and the surrounding streets closed off as a precautionary measure during the release event.\n\n5. Emergency Response Plan\n\nCoca-Cola North America's Emergency Response Policy focuses on evacuation of the facility in the event of an emergency, with local emergency response agencies performing all rescue, firefighting, first-aid, medical treatment, and other response functions.  The facility maintains a written Emergency Response Plan to document specific procedures to be implemented in the event of various emergencies, including an ammonia release.  The Emergency Response Plan includes procedures for facility evacuation, as well as for notification of the local emergency response agencies and the public. As needed and in a timely manner, the plan is updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within the facility that would require modified procedures.\n\nThe Polk County LEPC is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our Emergency Response Plan has been coordinated and verified.  The Polk County Fire Services is the primary emergency response agency for all facility emergencies. In addition, in case of an ammonia release, American Compliance Technologies may be called for additional assistance. \n\n6.
