In 1997, Lloyd's Register Quality Assurance reviewed OIMS and evaluated it against the international standard for Environmental Management Systems (ISO 14001) to determine if OIMS meets the requirements of ISO 14001.  After an extensive review which included a number of facility audits, they concluded that the \"environmental components of OIMS are consistent with the intent and meet the requirements of the ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems Standard.\"  They went on to say, \"We further believe heritage Exxon to be among the industry leaders in the extent to which environmental management considerations have been integrated into its ongoing business processes.\"\n\n\n\nThe ExxonMobil Mont Belvieu Plastics Plant (MBPP) has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety and protecting the environment.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  MBPP has participated in the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) since 1996 when MBPP was awarded \"STAR\" certification.  MBPP has re-certified as a \"STAR\" site in 1999, 2004, 2008, and 2012.  Our objective is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control, contain, and mitigate the release.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe ExxonMobil Mont Belvieu Plastics Plant, located in Mont Belvieu, Texas, U.S.A., operates a Low Density and a High Density "

MBPP has several regulated flammables, such as ethylene, butene-1, and isopentane.  MBPP does not have any Risk Management Program (RMP) regulated toxics on site.  MBPP has two covered processes within the Low Density train for the purposes of this plan.  The HDPE Polyethylene train does not meet the minimum inventories for RMP covered flammables and is not part of this submission.\n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\n\n\nThe hazard assessments were conducted using the EPA supplied \"look up tables\" which have been incorporated into the computer program RMPComp, supplied by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).  This program uses all the parameters required by the RMP rule for both worst case (WCS) and alternate case (ACS) scenarios.\n\n\n\nEXTERNAL EVENTS ANALYSIS (Texas Gulf Coast) \n\n\n\nMBPP is subject to external events, which may cause the release of hazardous materials.  MBPP is designed and operated to minimize the probability and the impact of such events.  External events considered in the design and operation of the plant include, but are not limited to: security; temperature extremes; hurricanes; tornadoes; winds; precipitation & flooding; utility disruption.  \n\n\n\nOf particular interest is the hurricane susceptibility.  MBPP was built in early 1980's and designed to the best wind technology available at the time.  MBPP uses an Emergency Preparedness Plan with the latest weather tracking services to identify potential weather threats and take action to secure the plant days in advance of approaching storms.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at MBPP.  EPA's Program 3 prevention requirements were implemented because processes at MBPP meet Program 3 criteria and are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.

As previously mentioned, OIMS has been deemed equivalent to ISO 14001 as a valid management system to oversee the implementation of the risk management activities.\n\n\n\nAdditional details are included in the Data Element section of this RMP plan.  Due to the ongoing nature of our safety programs, the dates associated with the various activities in our accident prevention program are constantly changing.  We selected May 1, 2014 as the cutoff date for this information.  Consequently, any of the reviews/updates conducted after that date is not reflected in the Data Element information.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nMBPP encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling operating and maintenance procedures to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to information created as part of the MBPP accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at MBPP and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, MBPP has a number of initiatives under way addressing process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nMBPP keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, MBPP has identified Operating Envelopes; i.e. documented limits for specific process parameters such as temperature, level, and compositions.  MBPP ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using computerized process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems, alarm systems).\n\n\n\nMBPP also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure, and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nMBPP has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.

ExxonMobil has enhanced these techniques periodically, for example, expanding the scenarios for which hazards are assessed.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating experience and engineering expertise on the process to be evaluated.  This PHA team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team learnings are forwarded to local management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk evaluation done by the PHA team.  These evaluations helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned greater risk receive attention first.  Approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not deviate significantly from the original design safety features, MBPP periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.
