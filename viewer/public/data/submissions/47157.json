As part of this commitment, Ineos has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's Regulation 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a summary of the risk management plan (RMP Plan) describing the risk management program at BP.  This plan summary is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP Rule (40 CFR 68.150 though 40 CFR 68.185).\n\n2.0   Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nIneos is committed to the welfare of their employees, the public, and to the preservation of the environment.  Ineos implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  In the event of an accidental release, Innovene will conduct emergency response actions to help prevent or minimize injury to the public and the environment.\n\n3.0   Facility Process and Regulated Substances\nIneos manufactures polyethylene for a wide variety of industrial and consumer applications.\n  \nThe manufacturing process uses ethylene as the basic building block for producing polyethylene.  Titanium tetrachloride is used as a catalyst for the polypropylene reaction.  Isobutane is inherent to the processes.  \n\n4.0   Offsite Consequence Analysis\nAn offsite consequence analysis was conducted on the polyethylene facility.  The subject analysis consisted of worst-case scenario(s) and alternative release scenario(s)..\n\nOneworst-case scenario were was completed for flammable RMP compounds.  This scenario is a release of isobutane (propane, 2-methyl), resulting in a vapor cloud followed by ignition.  Th"

The scenarios are based on stable conditions and low wind speed.  In addition, the worst-case scenarios did not consider any existing safety systems or mitigation activities.\n\nTwo alternate release scenarios (ARS) were completed for flammable RMP compounds.  The first scenario is a leak of ethylene  resulting in a vapor cloud followed by ignition .  The second scenario is a bleve.  The pressure / thermal effects from these scenarios not expected to reach the offsite industrial endpoints or to reach residential populations.\n\nThe alternative release scenarios are based on the most common weather conditions.  It should be noted that these scenarios did not consider any existing safety systems or mitigation activities other than emergency response.\n\n5.0   Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe polyethylene process is currently covered by the PSM standard.  As such, a Program Level 3 prevention program is in place.  The following paragraphs describe those prevention program elements.\n\n5.1   Safety Information \nIneos maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operations of the polyethylene processes.  Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) document the physical properties of all hazardous substances handled.  The engineering design documents include the operating parameters, the design basis and configuration of the equipment of the covered process, and references to applicable codes and standards.\n\n5.2   Hazard Review \nIneos performs and periodically updates hazard reviews of the processes to help identify and control process hazards.  Checklists include items to help ensure that Ineos operates and maintains the equipment in a manner consistent with the applicable design specifications, codes, standards, an"

As such we are required to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operation should be performed.  The operating procedures are used to (1) train employees and contractors and (2) serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.\n\n5.4   Training \nIneos trains personnel in the operating procedures to help ensure safe and effective performance of their assigned tasks.  A training documentation file is maintained to help ensure that refresher training is provided, as necessary.\n\n5.5   Maintenance \nIneos properly maintains the process equipment.  The maintenance program includes (1) procedures to safely guide workers in their maintenance tasks, (2) worker training in the maintenance procedures, and (3) an inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before the equipment fails.\n\n5.6   Management of Change \nIneos has a program in place to document changes to the process.  A significant change in process chemicals, technology, equipment, practices or procedures prompt implementation of this program.  The program is designed to (1) evaluate the impact of the change on the process, (2) update records on the process and (3) ensure that workers are informed and trained on any significant changes.\n\n5.7   Pre-startup Review \nIneos performs audits on a new process or an existing process that has undergone a modification affecting the safety information.  This review is done prior to operating.  The review (1) confirms proper equipment was used, (2) safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are updated, (3) a hazard evaluation has been conducted, and (4) training has been updated.\n\n5.8   Compliance Audits\nIneos performs periodic compliance audits of the covered process to verify that the process is operating in complianc"

Compliance audit reports are prepared after each audit, with documented deficiencies and corrections.\n\n5.9   Incident Investigations\nIneos investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment.  The procedures require an investigation team to be assembled, and the investigation to be initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.\n\n5.10   Employee Participation\nIneos requires participation by the affected employees in development (1) of the process hazard evaluation, (2) process safety management, (3) operating procedures, and (4) content and frequency of refresher training of all covered processes.  The employees that work with or maintain the processes are given access to all information required under the rule.\n\n5.11   Hot Work Permits\nIneos has written safety practices in place for fire protection and process operation.  A permitting system is used to prevent any unsafe acts on or around the covered process.\n\n5.12   Contractors\nIneos reviews all contractors prior to working on or near a covered process.  The contractor must submit information that indicates the work can be performed competently and safely.  The company will provide information on the hazards of the process and the safety practices in place.  Documents are kept to confirm that the information was received and understood.  In addition, procedures are in place that require the entrance, presence, and exit of contractors to be controlled.\n\n5.13   Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\nIn addition to engineering review and hazard analyses previously mentioned, workers who perform operations involving RMP listed compounds receive training emphasizing safe handling procedures developed by Ineos.

This history indicates a good record of accidental release prevention.  No releases of regulated substances have occurred from Innovene during the subject five year period that resulted in consequences of interest (i.e., deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site; or known deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage off site).\n\n7.0 Emergency Response Program\nIneos has established a written emergency response plan that complies with the RMP rule and with other federal contingency plan regulations.  This plan has been communicated to local emergency response officials through the local fire department.  Regular dialogue is maintained between the facility and the local response personnel, and the company provides appropriate information to the fire chief.  Innovene periodically conducts emergency response drills, including annual drills coordinated with the local response authorities.\n \n8.0 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nPlanned changes to improve safety are described in Ineos Process Hazard Analyses, plant alterations, projects, and the Site Safety, Health & Security Plan."
