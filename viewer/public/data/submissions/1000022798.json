The regulated substance under RMP ruling is Anhydrous Ammonia, which is used in the refrigeration system. This is a closed loop system to maintain temperature in the facility production and storage areas.\n\nPreventing Releases:\nOberlin Farms is implementing a Process Safety Management program at this facility to operate and maintain the ammonia system in accordance with best practices. In doing so, we have established written operating procedures to inspect and maintain the system. Additionally, Oberlin Farms has an on-going program of training for affected employees and contractor employees. Contractors must pass a qualification process in order to work in the plant, and are evaluated periodically. Select maintenance employees and managers are trained in defensive level emergency response to ammonia releases. We are working with the Cleveland Fire Department and the Cuyahoga County LEPC to continuously improve our processes, reduce risk, and protect our employees and neighbors."
