If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitagate any release and minimize the impact of the\nrelease to people and the environment.\n\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.  \n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 140,000 pounds.\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released  as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 140,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank as limited by design standards.\n\nThe distance to the endpoint of .14 mg/L for the worst-case scenario is 2.7 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  \n\nThe distance to the endpoint of .14 mg/L for the alternative scenario is .3 miles.  This release has the possibility of extending beyond the facility boundary.  \n\n\nThis facility complies with EPA'S Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility has implemented the provisions of \" Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American national Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U. S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration,\n29 CFR 1910.11, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that"
