LBT has identified the following commodities that may be present at the facility:\n\n\n\nCAS #               Product                                \n\n106-89-8       Epichlorohydrin (subject to TCPA and EPA 112R)                       \n\n107-15-3       Ethylenediamine (subject to TCPA and EPA 112R)    \n\n91-08-7               Toluene 2,6-Diisocyanate  (subject to TCPA and EPA 112R)                        \n\n108-05-4           Vinyl Acetate Monomer  (subject to TCPA and EPA 112R)                    \n\n75-37-6               1.1-Difluoroethane  (subject to TCPA and EPA 112R)                    \n\n78-79-5               Isoprene  (subject to TCPA and EPA 112R)                   \n\n107-31-3       Methyl Formate  (subject to TCPA and EPA 112R)                \n\n75-77-4            Trimethylchlorosilane (subject to TCPA and EPA 112R)\n\n107-18-6           Allyl Alcohol (subject to TCPA and EPA 112R)\n\n302-01-2           Hydrazine (subject to TCPA and EPA 112R)\n\n7719-12-2.         Phosphorous Trichloride (subject to TCPA, EPA 112R and OSHA PSM)\n\n\n\n\n\n?    Stationary Source Identification\n\n\n\nLBT has identified the storage of the referenced materials as the only stationary source at the facility.  The IBC design is in accordance with the International Organization for Standardization, as appropriate for each container type, and meets all applicable US Department of Transportation and International Maritime Dangerous Goods (IMDG) requirements for safe transportation by truck, train and/or shipping passage.\n\n\n\nThe design of the IBCs has been studied by the European Union's Health and Safety Executive, who has established Item Failure Rates for ISO"

Emergency Response\n\n\n\nIn the event of a discharge, LBT will follow onsite emergency response protocols.  The emergency response plan will be coordinated with the Union County Office of Emergency Management (OEM).\n\n\n\n?    Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no releases of hazardous materials from the facility in the last five years.  The facility experienced severe weather in October of 2012, when Hurricane Sandy made landfall in Southern New Jersey.  While the storm surge associated with that storm resulted in severe disruption to the operation of LBT including facility flooding and empty IBC displacement, no release of any hazardous substance occurred.\n\n\n\n?    Accidental Release Prevention and Chemical Specific Prevention Procedures\n\n\n\nLBT has developed and implemented Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and a Risk Management Plan in accordance with NJAC 7:31 and 40 CFR 68.  In addition, LBT utilizes frequent visual inspections to determine the presence of a leak.\n\n\n\n?    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nLBT has identified the hazards of working with extraordinarily hazardous substances on site, and has developed programs and systems to safeguard against those hazards.  These procedures are subject to a management of change procedure, which allow the facility management to review and upgrade procedures and programs when necessary.  LBT will continue to review the procedures and implement protective solutions to health and safety concerns.  There are no additional planned changes to improve safety associated with the handling of extraordinarily hazardous substances at this time. LBT continues to work with customers to have IBCs delivered directly to the customer's consignee rather than have them delivered to the depot.  The September 2017 RMP update demonstrates LBT's commitment to this policy as it removed three chemicals from the RMP"
