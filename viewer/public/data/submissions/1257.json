The Facility Policy.\n\n          The owners, managment, and employees of Central Farmers Cooperative are committed to the prevention of any accidental relases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information.\n\n     -The primary activity at this facility is the storage and blending of fertilizer for sale to farmers.\n\n    -Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for the direct application of fertilizer for crop production nutrients.\n\n     -The maximum quantity that would be temporarily stored at the 209 P Street location would be approximately 45,000 pounds in ten 1,000 gallon nurse tanks.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\n     a. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a 1000 gallon nurse tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 4,500 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest nurse tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design srandards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispertion to 200 ppm) is 0.22 miles.\n\n     b. The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.22 miles.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\n     The facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Adiministration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111,  storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n5.

There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
