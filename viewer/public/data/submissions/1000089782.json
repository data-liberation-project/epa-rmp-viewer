The facility produces flame retardant fabrics on two lines (Lines 54-1 and 54-2). These lines use anhydrous ammonia as part of the fabric treatment process. The anhydrous ammonia is stored in a\r\npressurized vessel located to the west side of the facility. The vessel has a 12,000-gallon (51,100 pounds) capacity for storing the anhydrous ammonia in a liquid state at a pressure of 250 psi. The\r\nammonia is vaporized by a heating element and transferred to the process.\r\n\r\nThe facility is subject to the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA) Risk Management Program (RMP), which is designed to prevent accidental releases into the environment and\r\nreduce chemical risk at a local level. The facility is also subject to 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, which is designed to prevent the release of highly hazardous chemicals\r\nthat could lead to a catastrophe in the workplace or the surrounding community. Specific operating procedures for the FR Ranges (54-1 and 54-2) have been developed. The procedures include start-up, shut-down and emergency shutdown procedures. Longleaf has not had any accidents within the past 5 years. The local emergency responders and fire department will be notified of the quantity and location of the anhydrous ammonia onsite via the annual EPCRA reporting.\r\n\r\nThe Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) was been modeled using RMP*Comp software provided by the USEPA. The worst-case release scenario was found to have a toxic endpoint of 4.0 miles. The\r\nalternative release scenario was found to have a toxic endpoint of 0.9 miles. The endpoint concentrations are based on the Emergency Response Planning Guidance provided by the USEPA. The endpoint\r\nERPG-2 is 0.14 mg/L. ERPG-2 is defined as the maximum airborne con"

Based on the radius of the worst-case scenario (4.0 miles), rough estimates indicate a general population of approximately 560 individuals. No other observed public receptors were within the radius for either the alternate or worst case scenarios other than this small allotment of residential dwellings."
