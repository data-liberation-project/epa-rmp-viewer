Accidental Release Prevention & Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThis facility is primarily an agronomy retail operation.  The facility stores and distributes dry fertilizer, liquid fertilizer, pesticides, propane, and anhydrous ammonia.  We are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of these products at our facility.  It is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling anhydrous ammonia to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle anhydrous ammonia, combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\n\n\nOur emergency response program for anhydrous ammonia is based on the 29?1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  The facility has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with 29?1910.38; has provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA); has coordinated response actions with the Marietta Volunteer Fire Department, including pre-emergency planning and emergency training, and has attempted to verify that the Shelby County Emergency Plan at the Emergency Management Agency includes the facility in the event of a release of a regulated substance; and has instructed employees on procedures for notification of the local fire department and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n\n\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia storage and handling facility was updated to comply with the Office of the Indiana State Chemist Ammonia Rules.

Access to this site is restricted to authorized facility personnel, authorized management personnel, customers, and authorized contractors.\n\n\n\n3. Worst Case Scenario\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario evaluates the release of the total contents of the largest tank over 10 minutes.  According to RMP Comp modeling, the release (distance from point of dispersion to 200 ppm) would have off-site impacts.\n\n\n\n4.  Alternate Case Scenario\n\n\n\nThe alternate case scenario evaluates the likely scenario at the facility, which can be controlled by human intervention in 3 minutes or less.  According to RMP Comp modeling, the release evaluated (distance from point of dispersion to 200 ppm) would have off-site consequences.\n\n\n\n5.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThis distribution facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  The facility's anhydrous ammonia plant has implemented the OSHA 29?1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\"; periodic inspections by the Office of the Indiana State Chemist are also conducted.  Employees involved in anhydrous ammonia activities are trained thoroughly by location management, qualified trainers, or through our insurance provider.  The major hazards identified with anhydrous ammonia include toxic release, over-pressurization, overfilling, equipment failure, earthquake, and tornado.  Process controls, such as relief valves, check valves, manual shutoff's, emergency shutoff valves, procedures, and excess flow devices are utilized to minimize the potential for release.\n\n\n\nMitigation systems available include deluge or water curtains provided by responding fire departments in the event of a release which would \"knock down\" the vapor cloud and neutralize the ammon"

      "SummaryText": "ia.  In addition, passive mitigation systems limiting the filling of tanks to 85% capacity (through tank gauges and on-site personnel) are utilized.\n\n\n\nEmployees are trained on an initial and ongoing basis.  Employee training is provided as well as periodic refresher training available from the location manager, qualified trainers, industry seminars, and vendor programs.  Competency is measured through written testing, demonstration (hands-on), and observation.\n\n\n\nMaintenance programs are in place.  Items are replaced if they fail, present a risk to the user, are required by standard or law, are out-of-date, or if a system or process is changed or upgraded.  29?1910.111 and Office of the Indiana State Chemist Ammonia Rules are used to identify those needs.  The Office of the Indiana State Chemist also makes periodic unannounced visits to our facility to inspect equipment, tanks, and safety training (they do not always leave documentation).  In addition, employees utilizing equipment on a near daily basis in season, informally inspect the equipment for leaks, cracks, soundness, etc.\n\n\n\n6. Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nWe have had no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia from this facility in the last 5 years.\n\n\n\n7.  Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThis facility has an emergency action plan, in accordance with 29?1910.38.  We have coordinated response actions with the Marietta Volunteer Fire Department, including pre-emergency planning and emergency response training.\n\n\n\nWe have attempted to discuss this program with the Shelby County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and our facility is included in the Shelby County Emergency Plan.\n\n\n\nIn the event of a release of regulated substances, our employees have been instructed on the procedures for notification of the local fire department, emergency personnel, and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n\n\n\n8.  Panned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nAt this facility, safety improvement is an ongoing process"
