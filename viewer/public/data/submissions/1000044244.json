This Risk Management Program as implemented will assist to prevent the occurrence of, or minimize the consequences of chemical releases.\r\n\r\nThis Executive Summary includes information required under 40 CFR Part 68.155.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nDWU implements preventive maintenance, inspection, and testing programs to minimize the potential for accidental releases. Standard operating procedures have been reviewed and revised to enable the employees to perform their work safely and provide immediate corrective response to any accident.\r\n\r\nThe Southside WWTP personnel are trained to respond in the event of a chemical release incident. Emergency response to accidental releases is also coordinated with the City of Dallas Police and Fire Department, the State and County Emergency Response Centers, and Local Emergency Planning Committees.\r\n\r\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Southside WWTP utilizes chlorine and sulfur dioxide (regulated substances) as a disinfectant and dechlorination agent in the wastewater treatment process. \r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nA Hazard Analysis as well as written safety information has been developed to enable personnel to identify and understand the hazards posed by processes involving highly hazardous chemicals including chlorine and sulfur dioxide. The City of Dallas verifies that all equipment used in the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes comply with applicable codes, standards, and industry accepted good engineering practices.\r\n\r\nThe Hazard Review (Process Hazard Analysis) completed for this Risk Management Plan (RMP) documents the process and the fi"

The objective of this self-evaluation program is to ensure that a successful RMP program is maintained, implemented, and followed by appropriate personnel. \r\nPersonnel have developed a formal documented system to manage incident investigations and follow up. Each incident that results in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide in the workplace will be investigated and a copy of the incident investigation report filed in the RMP. \r\n\r\nThe Southside WWTP chlorine and sulfur dioxide system technologies are not confidential and any information regarding the process or process chemistry is available for review in the RMP.\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nIn the last 5 years, the Southside WWTP has had no (zero) accidental releases.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe RMP Emergency Response Plan for the Southside WWTP includes the following elements:\r\n\u00bf\tProcedures for informing the public and local emergency response agencies about accidental releases\r\n\u00bf\tDocumentation of proper first-aid and emergency medical treatment necessary to treat accidental human exposures \r\n\u00bf\tProcedures and measures for emergency response after an accidental release of a regulated substance\r\n\u00bf\tProcedures for t"
