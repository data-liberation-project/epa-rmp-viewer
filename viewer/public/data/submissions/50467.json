The only units that do not have containment systems are container storage areas and container accumulation areas that are limited to storage of solid wastes containing no free liquids.  However, all permitted units are located within the flood protection levee and controlled stormwater discharge system. Rainwater that collects inside the secondary containment areas at several locations on the site (i.e., the incinerator tank farms, the stabilization building) is pumped from collection sumps for appropriate disposition.  If waste analysis indicate that the rainwater is uncontaminated, it may be discharged in accordance with the discharge permits (TCEQ and TPDES) for the site. Contaminated rainwater is managed as hazardous waste in the same manner as other contaminated waters.  Surface drainage from active areas of the site is routed by drainage ditches and curb and gutter systems to natural drainage channels which catch drainage and provide incidental settling to control sediment releases.  This surface drainage does not contact hazardous materials.\n\nIn the event of any spill or release, the spilled waste is contained and isolated, to the extent possible, from other wastes or materials, which may be incompatible.  All transportable incompatible materials are removed from the vicinity of the spill to isolated temporary storage areas.  Potentially incompatible wastes, which cannot be removed, are segregated using any appropriate means (e.g., earthen berms, overpacks, etc.) until the area is cleaned up.  In most areas of the site, containment devices and normal operations serve to separate incompatible materials thereby reducing the possibility that incompatib"

The facility is authorized to conduct these activities by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and the US Environmental Protection Agency.  Note that the facility is sited in a rural area with no immediate neighbors for several miles in any direction.\n\n\n2.0 Description of Combustion and Air Pollution Control Systems  \n\nThe incinerator at the Port Arthur facility consists of waste receiving and waste feeding equipment, a rotary kiln, an ash/slag removal system, a secondary combustion chamber (SCC), a quench tower, two acid gas absorbers, four cooling towers, a four stage ionizing wet scrubber, a wet electrostatic precipitator, an induced draft fan, an exhaust stack, and a scrubber water treatment/recycle system.\n\n2.1 Rotary Kiln\n\nThe rotary kiln measures 60 feet in length and is supported by two steel trunnion assemblies.  The shell of the kiln is rolled welded carbon steel. The slope of the kiln from inlet to ash discharge is approximately one degree.  The drive for the kiln is a girth gear and gear reducer powered by a variable speed, 100-hp motor.  The nominal rotation speed is one-half to one rpm with an average solids residence time of approximately one to two hours.  In the event of mechanical failure of the main drive motor or a general power failure, a 10-hp motor powered by an auxiliary diesel generator rotates the kiln slowly to prevent kiln and refractory damage.\n\nTh"

The inside diameter of the kiln with the insulation in place is approximately 14 feet. \nThe kiln is normally operated under negative pressure maintained between zero and one inch water column vacuum to prevent fugitive emissions from the kiln ends.  The pressure is controlled by feedback from a pressure sensor at the kiln feed end to an actuator that controls the variable speed drive of the induced draft fan.  As an additional fugitive emissions control measure, shrouds have been installed around the kiln seals.  The shrouds are continually evacuated by fan and routed to the transition duct between the rotary kiln and SCC.\n\nThe kiln temperature is measured with three thermocouples inserted through the roof of the ash dropout chamber, approximately 4 feet past the end of the kiln.  The first thermocouple is on the centerline of the kiln. The other two thermocouples are 3 feet 6 inches off the centerline. The DCS (Distributed Control System) averages the three temperatures.  \n\n2.2 Kiln Solids Feed Systems\n\nThe incinerator train receives bulk solids, such as contaminated soils and sludges, and containerized solids through the faceplate of the kiln.  The new Bulk Materials Handling Building, commissioned in 2004, was constructed to modernize bulk solids and container feed handling systems.  Containerized waste is also fed into the kiln through the kiln container ram feeder.  The new Bulk Material Handling Building consists of five miscellaneous units (two mixing pits, a blender, and two shredders) and two container storage areas (the north and south drum staging areas). \n\nAll suitable wastes authorized for receipt at the Port Arthur facility may be processed within the Bulk Material Handling Building.

(closed cup flash point greater than or equal to 140 ?F).  \nIn the non-ignitable waste feed train, bulk solids are off-loaded into the Regular Waste Pit, which has a nominal capacity of 840 cubic yards.  Non-ignitable, containerized waste to be bulked will typically be staged in the South Drum Staging Area on pallets.  Pallets of containers are moved by forklift onto a conveyor, transferred from the conveyor to a drum lift, and hoisted via the drum lift to the shredder conveyor.

For example, the internal slide gates in each of the air-lock chambers interlock with the external slide gates so that the external gates must be in the closed position before the internal slide gates can open.  In addition, permissives for the internal slide gates only allow operation when the shredder is operational and the conditions within the shredder feed chute (oxygen and pressure) are within acceptable ranges.  Similarly, automatic control logic allows operation of the shredder only when shredder feed chamber, shredder discharge chamber, and blender conditions are within acceptable ranges.\nFurther, the ram feeder is interlocked with the kiln automatic waste cutoff operating parameter limits to stop operation of the ram feeder at any time an automatic waste feed cutoff is initiated for the kiln.

A Wet Electrostatic Precipitator.\n\nThese systems are discussed in detail in the following sections.\n\n2.6.1 Acid Gas Absorbers\n\nA fiberglass reinforced plastic (FRP) duct conveys the cooled flue gas from the quench tower to two absorbers arranged in parallel.  The 11-foot outside diameter, corrosion-resistant FRP vessels are 25 feet tall and contain 10 feet of polypropylene Tellerette?, or equivalent, packing.  \n\nThe plastic packing material provide"

      "SummaryText": "s increased surface area for greater contact between the gas and scrubbing solution and thus increases the gas to liquid mass transfer capacity.  Four packed bed, forced draft cooling towers are used to cool the recirculating absorber water.\n\nThe pH control system feeds caustic to the inlet of the absorber pumps and a second (trim) caustic feed is injected in front of the cooling tower pumps, which discharge to the absorbers.  The pH is measured in the discharge line of the absorber pumps and adequate caustic is added in the suction of the absorber pumps to raise the pH to a minimum of 6.0.  The pH is monitored in the absorber inlet and a trim stream of caustic is injected into the suction of the cooling tower pumps to maintain the pH at the absorber inlet at approximately 7.0.  \n\n2.6.2 Ionizing Wet Scrubber\n\nFollowing the absorbers are two parallel four-stage ionizing wet scrubbers (IWS).  The IWS utilizes high voltage ionization to electrostatically charge the particulate in the gas stream before the particles enter a packed section in each of the four stages arranged in series.  The packing in each of the packed sections is similar to the packing that is used in the absorbers.  The charged particles leaving the ionization section impinge on and/or are attracted to the surfaces of the packing.  A circulating water stream continuously flushes the particles off the packing.  The gas stream moves horizontally through the IWS while the scrubber liquid flows vertically downward.  Process water is added to the IWS circulating water recycle loop and a blowdown from this loop is directed to the absorber-cooling tower loop and the quench.  \n\nHigh-voltage DC power for the ionizing section is provided by a high-voltage transformer/rectifier for each stage.  The shell and most internal parts of the IWS are constructed of FRP and corrosion resistant metals. \n\nPeriodically (approximately every two hours) the IWS goes through a cleaning cycle to rinse particulate matter from the"

The power to a stage is turned off as that stage is being cleaned.\n\n2.6.3 Wet Electrostatic Precipitator\n\nThe wet electrostatic precipitator (WESP) is installed following the IWS.  Process gas enters the WESP at the top of the unit and may be saturated with water sprays to create additional water droplets in the gas stream, as necessary.  The gas stream then passes through a distribution system to evenly distribute the gas in the ionization and collection tubes of the vessel.  Each tube has a wire electrode suspended through the center of the tube.  The electrode wire generates a high voltage DC corona field that ionizes the particulate and water droplets in the gas stream with a negative charge as the gas passes through the tubes.  The negatively charged particulate and water droplets are attracted to the positively grounded walls of the tubes.  The condensed water droplets serve to clean the particulate from the tube walls and maintain clean tube walls to maximize the particulate collection efficiency.  The condensed water flows down the tubes into a sump in the bottom of the vessel.  Process water is used to spray into the inlet process gas stream to saturate the stream.  Approximately 7.0 gpm (on average) of the condensed water will be blown down to the existing scrubber water treatment system and replaced with make-up water.  \nFor seven (7) minutes every 24 hours, the distributors and tubes of the WESP are washed to remove particulate matter.  The water in the sump is used for this periodic washing.  During the cleaning cycle, power to the WESP is turned off.\n\n\n2.6.4 Induced Draft Fan and Stack\n\nFrom the WESP, the flue gases pass into the FRP induced draft fan.  The fan moves the approximately 110?F flue gas at an average rate of approximately 39,000 DSCFM, and can achieve a flow above 50,000 DSCFM.  The fan is direct driven by a 250 hp variable speed motor that is "

The fan is sized to maintain a negative pressure in the rotary kiln and SCC, as well as to move combustion gases through the emission control train and out the stack.  The pressure measurement at the feed end of the rotary kiln is used to determine the fan speed during operation.  The fan speed (rpm) is determined by the variable frequency drive controller and used as an indication of stack flow.  \nFlue gas is forced through an FRP stack that is 5.5 feet in inside diameter.  The stack is supported by a steel frame tower.  The discharge of the stack is 130 feet above ground level.  Ladders and platforms provide access for stack testing.  \n\n2.7Automatic Waste Feed Cutoff\n\nThe automated distributed control system (DCS) facilitates operation of the multi-feed incinerator and associated emission control equipment.  The process control system includes automatic waste feed cutoff capabilities in the event of specified abnormal operating conditions.\n\nShutdown of the incineration system may occur automatically or be initiated by the operator.  Automatic shutdown takes place if the unit experiences:  (1) an overall power failure, (2) failure of the induced draft fan, or (3) a high temperature in the quench tower exit gas.  \n\nIn the event of a power failure, a generator automatically starts to supply power to the auxiliary kiln drive, the SCC combustion air fan, emergency lighting, critical instrumentation, and the emergency quench water system.  All waste feed to the incinerator will cease, the induced draft fan will stop if necessary, and the thermal relief vent will open.  The kiln is rotated to prevent structural damage and to process the residues left in it at the time of the failure.\n\nIn the event of an uncontrolled high temperature in the exit gas from the quench tower, a similar emergency shutdown will occur.  A backup water supply for the quench section spray nozzles is provided to minimize the chance of this occur"

Again, one SCC burner will remain firing on auxiliary fuel or be immediately restarted to maintain the ability to destroy organic constituents in the kiln exit gas.  Operation will continue in this manner until the system can be restarted or a decision to shut down becomes final. \n\nThe operator may also initiate a total system shutdown.  A manual key switch will cause an automatic waste feed cutoff and a cessation of operation of the induced draft fan.  One SCC burner will remain firing on auxiliary fuel or be immediately restarted to maintain the ability to destroy organic constituents in the kiln exit gas.  Operation will continue in this manner until the system can be restarted or a decision to shut down becomes final. \n\nA number of interlocks have been installed to shut off all waste feed as required to insure that the incinerator operates at all times within permit conditions.  In general, an upset condition in the SCC will warrant shutdown of waste feed to the entire incineration system while an upset condition in the rotary kiln will affect only the operation of that unit.  Instrumentation is installed that will trigger an alarm at a value less than the permit value in order to warn the operator and provide an opportunity to avoid the automatic waste feed cutoff.  \n\nAfter an automatic waste feed cutoff has shut down the feeding of waste, the system is typically maintained at temperature with auxiliary fuel.  If the situation can be corrected, waste feed is resumed as soon as permissives are established.  If the correction cannot be accomplished with the incinerator at temperature, the operator will maintain temperature for approximately one hour to allow burnout of waste in the kiln.  The normal shutdown sequence will then be initiated. \n\n3.0 Incinerator Tank Farm\n\nVeolia operates 18 tanks adjacent t"

It has many similarities (properties and hazards) to other pentanes. Used as a solvent; blowing agent for polystyrene and other polymers; in the synthesis of organic chemicals (eg. Chlorinated hydrocarbons); constituent of motor vehicle and aviation fuel. \n\n5.0 Isopentane Treatment\n\nThe isopentane is shipped to the Veolia Port Arthur facility in tanker trucks. The quantity of isopentane in each tanker is below the RMP threshold for isopentane.  The tank trucks are then unloaded at the tank farm into the energetic feed tanks, which feed waste to the Secondary Combustion Chamber or Kiln.  Once the tanker trucks are unloaded to the tank farm the quantity of isopentane in the tanks may exceed the threshold limit prior to incineration. \n\n6.0 Conclusion\n\nVeolia has the necessary equipment and expertise to safely manage Isopentane waste.  The entire process beginning with receipt through unloading to storage and ultimate treatment in the incinerator will be conducted in a controlled manner so there is no exposure of the ispoentane to personnel or the environment.\n\n( c) The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps \n\nAs mentioned in section b above, we are permitted for nearly every type of waste, as a result, procedures listed in section a are the general procedures for the site\n\n(d) The five-year accident history \n\nThere has been no accident from a covered process in the past five years.\n\n(e) The emergency response program \n\nVeolia has made contact with the local and regional entities and authorities that may be involved in an emergency situation.
