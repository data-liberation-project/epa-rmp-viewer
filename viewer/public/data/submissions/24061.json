      "SummaryText": "Introduction\n\nA Risk Management Program has been implemented at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS) for the reduction of accidental releases of hazardous materials.  This Risk Mangement Plan summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to the community of hazardous chemical releases.  The Plan summary is organized to correspond with specific EPA RMP definitions and requirements, including:\n\n-Introduction;\n-CCAFS policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\n-Facility identification and regulated substances covered processes;\n-Hazard Assessment;\n-Prevention Program;\n-Five-Year Accident History;\n-Emergency Response Plan; and\n-Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nCCAFS Health, Environment, and Safety Policies\n\nCape Canaveral Air Force Station has several response plans that address health, safety, and environmental policies.  Furthermore, the Risk Management Program will help CCAFS to prevent and/or reduce the risk of accidents.  These plans detail the specific responsibilities, actions, and procedures that must be undertaken by various organizations during daily work activities  to protect the health and safety of personnel, the public, and the environment.  Examples of such documents include, but are not limited to:\n\n-Facility Response Plan/Spill Prevention Plans;\n-Disaster Preparedness Plans; and\n-U.S. Air Force Technical Orders for proper equipment operation.\n\nFacility Identification and Regulated Substances Covered Processes\n\nCape Canaveral Air Force Station is located in Brevard County, Florida.  Hydrazine and 1,1-Dimethylhydrazine (within a mixture called Aerozine-50) are stored at Complex 40 above their RMP threshold limits of 10,000 lbs (89,250 and 85,750 lbs, respectively).  Hydrogen is also stored above its threshold limits at various locations within the facility, however, CCAFS is exempt from RMP requirements for hydrogen due to the Fuels Relief Act.\n\nHazard Assessment\n"

      "SummaryText": "\nEPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations were used to analyze the worst and alternative case scenarios and to calculate the distances to the endpoints. \n\nToxic Worst Case Scenario: \nComplex 40: Hydrazine and 1,1 Dimethylhydrazine are present at Complex 40 in a mixture called Aerozine-50.  Worst case analyses determined that 1,1 Dimethylhydrazine had much greater offsite impacts than hydrazine.  Thus, 1,1 Dimethylhydrazine was chosen as the chemical for the toxic worst case scenario at CCAFS.  The entire quantity of 1,1 Dimethylhydrazine stored at Complex 40, 35,750, was released.  A release of this amount of 1,1 Dimethylhydrazine would produce impacts up to a radius of 25 miles and potentially affect 51,327 people.  Schools, hospitals, residences, prisons, recreational areas, industrial/commercial areas, national forests, wildlife refuge, and wilderness areas would be affected.\n\nToxic Alternative Release Scenario:  \nComplex 40: 306 lbs of hydrazine is released affecting a radius of 0.81 miles, and no residental population is affected.  There is a wildlife refuge and federal wilderness area within the zone of impact.  \n\nComplex 40: 294 lbs of 1,1-Dimethylhydrazine is released affecting a radius of 0.81 miles, and no residental population is affected.  There is a wildlife refuge and federal wilderness area within the zone of impact.  \n\nPrevention Program\n\nOne process at CCAFS is required to have a prevention program.  Specifically, the Complex 40 Aerozine-50 (mixture of hydrazine and 1,1 Dimethylhydrazine) storage process must comply with prevention program 3 of the RMP. The program 3 prevention program includes a process hazard analysis, training, maintenance, management of change, a pre-startup review, compliance audits, incident investigation, employee participation, hot work permits, and contractor safety procedures.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nOn 12 August 1998, a Titan rocket exploded 42 seconds into liftoff.  Since the rocket exploded well after lifto"

      "SummaryText": "ff, there were no injuries, evacuations/sheltered-in-place, or property damage.  However, there was ocean water contamination from the 145,500 lbs of Aerozine-50 released (74,210 lbs of hydrazine and 71290 lbs of 1,1-dimethylhydrazine). \n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nThe RMP regulations require that \"response actions have been coordinated with local emergency planning and response agencies\" (40 CFR 68.12 (b)(3)).\n\nThe Disaster Control Group (DCG) is the primary overseer for any mishaps.  Upon notification, the initial response element (Fire Protection, Medical and Security Police) responds directly to the site.  Training is performed as required.\n\nCCAS has a response plan that addresses the handling of emergencies: Disaster Preparedness Operations Plan 32-1, Vol. II (1 December 1995).  CCAFS coordinates emergency response activities as the situation dictates with the office of emergency management (the local LEPC), and the local port and county authorities.  \n\nDepending on the quanity and chemical involved in a \"reportable spill,\" CCAFS also notifies certain local, state, and federal emergency planning and response agencies.  \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety and Emergency Preparedness is an integral part of the CCAFS daily operations and activities.  Exposure risks to employees and the public have been minimized through ongoing inspections and documented compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.  At this time, no further improvements have been identified."
