We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.  EDCC maintains an open dialogue with local emergency responders and has provided them with a copy of its Emergency Response Plan, detailing important facility-specific information.  This document, or Risk Management Plan (RMP), provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including the following:\n\n\u00bf\ta description of our facility and use of substances exceeding threshold quantities, in a single process, which are regulated by EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Program Rule (RMP Rule),\n\u00bf\ta summary of results from our assessment of the potential off-site consequences from possible accidental chemical releases,\n\u00bf\tan overview of our accidental release prevention programs,\n\u00bf\ta five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by the RMP Rule,\n\u00bf\tan overview of the Emergency Response Program, and\n\u00bf\tan overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment.\n\n\n2.0  El Dorado Chemical Company and Regulated Substances\n\n\tOur facility\u00bfs primary activity involves the production of ammonium nitrate, nitric acid, and sulfuric acid.  These products are used extensively in the agricultural, mining, specialty chemical manufacturing, and forestry products industries.  From a consumer\u00bfs viewpoint, these products are used in the manufacture of paper, water treatment chemicals, computer chips, and even blue jean dye to name a few of our product"

Also, EDCC parallels the RMP Rule by complying with Process Safety Management (PSM) as required by OSHA in 29 CFR 1910 119.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program in place at our stationary sources.\n\n3.1  Process Safety Information\n\nEDCC maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n3.2  Process Hazard Analysis\n\n\tOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the \u00bfHAZOP\u00bf and/or the \u00bfwhat if\u00bf checklist.  These analyses are conducted by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are validated at regular intervals.  Findings related to the process hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n3.3  Operating Procedures\n\n\tFor the purpose o"

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and start-up after a turn-around.  Operating procedures are regularly reviewed and are readily accessible to operators involved in the process.  In addition, Daily/Shift Safe Work Permits (Procedure No. S-82) are required for any maintenance work completed at EDCC.\n\n3.4  Training\n\n\tEDCC has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided continuously for operator certification.\n\n3.5  Mechanical Integrity\n\n\tEDCC carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes:\n\n\u00bf\tpressure vessels, \n\u00bf\tstorage tanks, \n\u00bf\tpiping systems, \n\u00bf\trelief and vent systems,\n\u00bf\temergency shutdown systems,\n\u00bf\tcontrols, and \n\u00bf\tpumps.  \n\nTrained maintenance personnel and our mechanical integrity engineer conduct the process maintenance activities.

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe start-up prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n3.8  Compliance Audit\n\nEDCC conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP Rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every three years by at least one person knowledgeable in the process.  Corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and timely manner.\n\n3.9  Incident Investigation\n\nEDCC promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the root cause of the incident, as well as any corrective actions needed to prevent the release from recurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of five years.\n\n3.10  Employee Participation\n\nEDCC believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility\u00bfs implementation of the RMP Rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.  \n\n3.11  Hot Work Permits\n\n\tEDCC has in place a standard procedure (Fire Permit, No. S-003), which establishes a system to ensure adequate controls are maintained to detect and eliminate hazardous conditions associated with \u00bfhot work\u00bf.

We have a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to their work and the processes.  A Daily/Shift Safe Work Permit is issued prior to beginning work.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response, should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n4.0  Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n4.1  Nitric Acid and Ammonia\n\nSeveral process controls are in place to prevent and/or mitigate accidental releases of nitric acid or ammonia.  These controls include vents, relief valves, check valves, manual and automatic shut-offs, interlocks, alarms, keyed bypass system, emergency back-up power, back-up pumps, rupture disks, excess flow devices, and quench systems.  Passive mitigation includes earthen dikes that route spills to neutralization and the wastewater treatment system, a deluge system, water curtains, and enclosures.  Process area detectors and perimeter monitors are in place to promptly alert staff to accidental releases. \n\n4.2  Chlorine\n\n\tSeveral process controls are in place to prevent and/or mitigate accidental release of chlorine.  These controls include vents, relief and check valves, manual shut-offs, and quench systems.  A water curtain is available to mitigate releases.
