Executive Summary\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-CalARP program.\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, BWC Tank Farm Mixer has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-CalARP related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1 BWC Tank Farm Mixer, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that BWC Tank Farm Mixer has developed their unified RMP-CalARP Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\n\n\nProcess Name           | Process Chemical          | Process Quantity(lbs.)\n\n20% Aqueous Ammonia      Aqueous Ammonia             53,000\n\n\n\nOur RMP-CalARP program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses, and physical property damage.\n\n\n\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have: \n\n1. Prepared a unified program based on the RMP regulation and designed to satisfy all CalARP obligations as well\n\n2. Organized the program so that it meshes closely with general business practices\n\n3. Utilized PSMWriter s"

A 20% aqueous ammonia solution is utilized at the facility as required for producing ammoniated zinc. The 20% aqueous ammonia solution is stored in a 6,500 gallon poly tank or a portable poly tank and pumped to the 2,500 gallon mixer where it is mixed with zinc powder and water to form ammoniated zinc. During the mixing process, the 20% aqueous ammonia solution is consumed by the chemical reactions which occur. \n\n\n\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\n1.3.1 General \n\n\n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of aqueous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nBWC Tank Farm Mixer has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the 20% aqueous ammonia process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n\n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nBWC Tank Farm Mixer has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\n\n\n\nBWC Tank Farm Mixer's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n\n- Cal/OSHA's Emergency Action Plan - Title 8 CCR ?3220\n\n- U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Emergency Action Plans - Title 29 CFR ?1910.38\n\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) "

Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \n\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\n\n\n\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nBWC Tank Farm Mixer has implemented many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, BWC Tank Farm Mixer continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\n\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-CalARP program. This has improved BWC Tank Farm Mixer's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-CalARP related events so that BWC Tank Farm Mixer's management team can ensure that the RMP-CalARP program is being implemented.\n\n\n\nBWC Tank Farm Mixer has implemented all aspects of the RMP-CalARP program. When a RMP-CalARP program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create,"

It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for BWC Tank Farm Mixer employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-CalARP program BWC Tank Farm Mixer will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety."
