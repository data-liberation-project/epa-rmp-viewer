We shall, as a minimum: (1) consult with employees and their representatives on the conduct and development of the process hazard review and other elements of the risk management plan, and (2) provide to our employees and their representatives access to the process hazard review and all other information required to be developed under that standard.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe City of Galveston believes that preventative maintenance is the key to minimizing the potential for accidental releases.  Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) have been reviewed and revised to enable the employees to perform their work in a safe and efficient manner.\n\nThe EPA has adopted a policy for non-responding facilities (another entity has agreed in advance to respond to the release).  This facility is a non-responding facility.  The City of Galveston Fire Department is the first responder.\n\nThis emergency response program does not include responses to incidental releases of hazardous substances, including chlorine, where the substances can be ?adsorbed, neutralized, or otherwise controlled at the time of the release by employees in the immediate release area, or by maintenance personnel?.\n\nThe City of Galveston has taken steps to train the operators, supervisors, and maintenance crews to be knowledgeable in the emergency response program.

TYPES OF EVACUATION\n\n\n\n              In  the  event  of  a  release,  employees  will  either\n\n        be   required  to  evacuate  the  plant  or  be  sheltered  in\n\n        place.    This   will  be  dependent  upon   wind   direction,\n\n        severity   of   the  release,  and  in  what   part   of   the\n\n        plant the release has occurred.\n\n\n\n     C. EMERGENCY EVACUATION AND SHELTERING\n\n\n\n              In   the   event   of  an  emergency,   the   Operations\n\n        Manager   or   his  designee  will  determine   if   employees\n\n        will   need   to  evacuate  the  plant  or  be  sheltered   in\n\n        place.    If  evacuation  is  necessary,  employees  will   be\n\n        directed   to   report   to   one  of   the   four   following\n\n        fencelines:\n\n\n\n          ?    North,\n\n          ?
