We shall, as a minimum: (1) consult with employees and their representatives on the conduct and development of the process hazard review and other elements of the risk management plan, and (2) provide to our employees and their representatives access to the process hazard review and all other information required to be developed under that standard.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe City of Galveston believes that preventative maintenance is the key to minimizing the potential for accidental releases.  Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) have been reviewed and revised to enable the employees to perform their work in a safe and efficient manner.\n\nThe EPA has adopted a policy for non-responding facilities (another entity has agreed in advance to respond to the release).  This facility is a non-responding facility.  The City of Galveston Fire Department is the first responder.\n\nThis emergency response program does not include responses to incidental releases of hazardous substances, including chlorine, where the substances can be \u00bfadsorbed, neutralized, or otherwise controlled at the time of the release by employees in the immediate release area, or by maintenance personnel\u00bf.\n\nThe City of Galveston has taken steps to train the operators, supervisors, and maintenance crews to be knowledgeable in the emergency response program.

Above all, all employees know where the phone numbers of the first responders are located should a release occur.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe 59th Street Water Pump Station utilizes chlorine for disinfection.  The maximum inventory and threshold quantity for Chlorine is shown below.  Ammonia inventory is always below the RMP threshold of 20,000 pounds.  Process Safety Information is presented for ammonia for employee awareness.

A dense-gas dispersion model (SLAB) was used to determine endpoint distances for both scenarios.  A dense-gas model is required since chlorine is heavier than air.

EMERGENCY ALARM SYSTEM\r\n\r\n             If   a   release   of  chlorine  occurs,   the   chlorine\r\n        sensors   will  sound  an  audible  alarm  and  activate   the\r\n        strobe   light  on  top  of  the  building.    A   signal   is\r\n        also   sent  to  the  operations  building.   THERE   ARE   NO\r\n        OTHER  AUDIBLE  OR  VISUAL  ALARMS  AT  THE  PLANT  THAT  WILL\r\n        SIGNAL THAT A CHLORINE RELEASE HAS OCCURRED.\r\n\r\n              A   wind  sock,  located  on  top  of  the  chlorination\r\n        building,    indicates   wind   direction.    All    employees\r\n        should   note   the  wind  direction  and  move   up-wind   or\r\n        cross-wind to a release of chlorine.\r\n\r\n\r\n     B. TYPES OF EVACUATION\r\n\r\n              In  the  event  of  a  release,  employees  will  either\r\n        be   required  to  evacuate  the  plant  or  be  sheltered  in\r\n        place.    This   will  be  dependent  upon   wind   direction,\r\n        severity   of   the  release,  and  in  what   part   of   the\r\n        plant the release has occurred.\r\n\r\n     C. EMERGENCY EVACUATION AND SHELTERING\r\n\r\n              In   the   event   of  an  emergency,   the   Operations\r\n        Manager   or   his  designee  will  determine   if   employees\r\n        will   need   to  evacuate  the  plant  or  be  sheltered   in\r\n        place.    If  evacuation  is  necessary,  employees  will   be\r\n        directed   to   report   to   one  of   the   four   following\r\n        fencelines:\r\n\r\n          \u00b7    North,\r\n          \u00b7    East,\r\n          \u00b7    West, or\r\n          \u00b7    South\r\n\r\n              Evacuation   to  these  locations  will   be   dependent\r\n        upon   wind  direction  and  where  a  release  has  occurred.\r\n        Evacuation   routes  to  these  locations  have  been   posted\r\n        at   locations   throughou"
