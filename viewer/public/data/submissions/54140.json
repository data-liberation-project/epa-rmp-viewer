Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nMulti-Chem is committed to being a responsible member of the community in which it operates by giving top priority to operating in a safe and environmentally sound manner.  Multi-Chem personnel work continuously to identify methods to reduce the use of hazardous materials and to reduce the risk to the community and environment through implementation of new technology and procedures.  This commitment to safe and environmentally sound operations is one of Multi-Chem's core values as documented in policy and compliance manuals, and in its mission statement, which are available to all employees.\n\n2. Stationary Sources and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nAcrolein, also known as 2-propenal, is an aldehyde.  It is present between 92-96% pure in the product received in the Acrolein tanks.  It is inhibited by hydroquinone (0.35%) and covered with a nitrogen blanket to prevent hazardous polymerization.  Acrolein is acutely toxic, as well as an inhalation and fire hazard.  Some of the typical physical and chemical properties listed below.\n\u00bf CAS # 107002-8\n\u00bf Clear, colorless liquid\n\u00bf Acrid and pungent odor, extremely irritating\n\u00bf pH 7\n\u00bf flashpoint of \u00bf 13 F (TCC)\n\u00bf heavier than air\n\u00bf can produce exothermic hazardous polymerization reaction\n\u00bf can be neutralized with soda ash or sodium bisulfite (increasing the pH results\nin decreased half-life)\n\u00bf OSHA permissible exposure limit (PEL), 0.1 ppm\n\u00bf OSHA short term excursion limit (STEL), 0.3 ppm\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nMulti-Chem, New Iberia has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68. \n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of Multi-Chem\u00bfs release prevention program that are in place at the New Iberia facility.\n\nProcess Information:\nAcrolein is stored"

The training will include emphasis on the health and safety hazards, emergency operations including shutdown and safe work practices.  Forklift training and certification is conducted as required by OSHA requirements.  Hazard awareness and container storage and handling training will be given to Materials Handlers who may have occasion to on or off load the containers.  Awareness training will be given to all employees to be aware of the hazards of the product, to recognize the containers and to avoid any possible exposure to the material.\n\nRefresher training will be provided at least every three years or more often if necessary.  The training will assure that the employee understands and adheres to the current operating procedures.  The Facility Manager or designated supervisor will discuss and determine with the employees the frequency of the refresher training.  Forklift drivers receive refresher training and recertification every three years as required by OSHA.\n\nMechanical Integrity:\nIn accordance with 29 CFR 1910.119, a maintenance equipment program involving documented inspections and testing of equipment will be implemented.  The following equipment will be included in the maintenance program:\n\u00bf Acrolein Tanks (including all valves attached to tank)\n\u00bf Forklifts\nStringent Federal Department of Transportation (DOT) design, inspection and testing specifications govern the fabrication, charging and transportation of acrolein containers.  Upon request by regulatory agencies, documentation will be provided by Multi-Chem personnel on the various tests and inspections performed on these containers.  These DOT tests and inspections performed by an independent inspection agency include the following:\n\u00bf Verify chemical analysis of material(s) of construction\n\u00bf Inspect welds and fabrication\n\u00bf"

Routine checks, which will be performed on these containers, are as follows:\n\n\u00bf Upon receipt of acrolein containers: Visually check containers for bulging, corrosion or significant cuts or gouges. Also check the container shut-off and safety valves for any visual defects.  Any containers showing any significant defect will be rejected and returned to the supplier.  The serial number of any rejected container will be documented.  Also check the container to insure that the weight is indicated.\n\u00bf Upon handling of acrolein containers: Visually check containers for defects.\n\u00bf Multi-Chem employees will also perform non-documented visual checks of the container and document abnormalities of a given container taking down the serial number of the container and describing the abnormality.

Where appropriate, other departments may be called upon to review the changes.  This would not include replacements-in-kind.\nThe review will consider the following:\n\u00bf Technical basis for the proposed change\n\u00bf Impact of change on safety and health\n\u00bf Modifications to operating procedures\n\u00bf Necessary time period for the change, and\n\u00bf Authorization requireme"

Five-year Accident History\nMulti-Chem, New Iberia has no history of accidents.\n\n5. Emergency Response Plan\nMulti-Chem, New Iberia carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public.\nTo ensure proper functioning, all emergency response equipment are regularly inspected and serviced. In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within Multi-Chem\u00bfs processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n\n6.
