      "SummaryText": "Kentucky Hydrocarbon Maytown Plant is a natural gas liquids extractions facility located in a rural section of Floyd County near Langley, Kentucky.  At this location, we extract approximately 150,000 gallons of y-grade natural gas liquid product per day that is continuously pumped to a four-inch pipeline system destined to the Marathon-Ashland Refinery in Catlettsburg, Kentucky.  This product primarily consists of liquid propane with smaller quantities of liquid butane, pentane, iso-butane, iso-pentane, hexane-plus, ethane and methane.  This mixture of NGL product is flammable and is considered to be hazardous by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.  The storage facility for this product consists of two 10,000 gallon and one 12,000 gallon horizontal tanks.  Also on site, we have a storage facility for 5,000 gallons of liquid propane, which is used in the refrigeration of natural gas liquids.  The liquid propane is delivered to the plant by transport truck as needed.  These four storage tanks are located in the same proximity and are considered the same process.  It is our policy to take proactive approach to the safe handling of these products to prevent unnecessary human exposure, reducing the threat to our own personal health and to nearby members of the community.  We comply with all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations, including OSHA Process Safety Management.  These regulations require specific actions to identify potential hazards in the process, to train operators in procedures to reduce potential releases of highly hazardous chemicals, and to take appropriate measures all designed to reduce the likelihood of uncontrolled process releases.  Due to diligence in our safety and prevention program, there have been no accidental releases of highly hazardous chemicals at this plant for the last five years.  In the event of an accidental release of chemicals, we are trained to respond to the circumstances involved in potential occurrences by mean"
