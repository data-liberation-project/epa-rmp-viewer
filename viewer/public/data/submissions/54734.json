TBCC is owned and operated by Texas Petrochemicals, LLC (Texas Petrochemicals).  The operation of the TBCC facility falls under the management systems of TPC Group, Port Neches, Texas Facility (PNO) as of May of 2007.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.  The TBCC facility is committed to providing a safe, healthy and environmentally conscious work place for its employees and neighbors.  The PNO Facility, which includes TBCC,  maintains a working OSHA Process Safety Management  (PSM) program, which implements a series of steps to prevent potential hazards associated with the process and assures a well-trained work force.   The PSM program further implements its policies with onsite procedures and manuals.  The EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) has been built upon this existing PSM program.   TBCC participates with the Calcasieu Parish Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Carlyss Fire Department in assisting local officials in the development of emergency response plans and participates in cooperative training with them.   TBCC is also an associate member of the Mutual Aid Organization in the Westlake area.  The facility complies with all applicable codes and standards regarding operating and equipment safety.  The PNO Plant Manager is responsible for implementation of the Risk Management Program (RMP) at the TBCC Facility.\r\n\r\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled. The TBCC Facility is located on the south side of Bayou D\u00bfInde immediately east of Louisiana Highway 108.  The facility consists of two spheres, two compressors, five pumps, two fire pumps, a small flare, and dock facilities.

The following is a brief summary of the elements that have been implemented to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements outlined by the EPA in the RMP Rule, as well as, with the OSHA PSM standard.  \r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nThe PNO Facility maintains a compilation of written safety information for the TBCC facility.  This includes information pertaining to hazards of regulated substances, the technology of the covered process and the equipment in the covered process.\r\n \r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\nThe PNO Facility has performed the revalidation of the PHA for the TBCC Facility to comply with 29 CFR 1910.119(e) and these hazard analysis apply to processes covered by RMP.  The HAZOP methodology was utilized, a recognized and generally accepted method, for identifying, evaluating, and addressing hazards in the process.  Employees from the TBCC site participated in the revalidation study. The team developed recommendations to reduce the potential hazards which are further evaluated and implemented where beneficial.  Recommendations are tracked until they are completed.  The hazards imposed by hurricanes and inclement weather are minimally discussed during PHA's since this issue is well-covered by our Hurricane Preparedness Plan and Corporate Standards require designing equipment/structures to withstand high winds.\r\n \r\nOperating Procedures\r\nThe TBCC Facility maintains written operating procedures, that were developed by operations, and provide clear instructions for safely operating the facility.  These operating procedures are available to all employees who work in the processes.  The procedures are reviewed at least annually and modified whenever needed to accommodate operational and process changes.\r\n \r\nTraining\r\nThe TBCC Facility provides initial training as well as refresher training to employe"

Training documentation provides records of when training was received and whether or not the training was understood. All operators receive annual refresher training.\r\n\r\n \r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nThe PNO and TBCC Facilities have developed written procedures for maintaining the mechanical integrity of equipment in the covered process, including pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown system controls, and pumps.  The program is comprised of well-trained personnel who follow maintenance, testing and inspection procedures that ensure proper function of process equipment.   This program includes the periodic inspection and testing of process equipment, as well as, the documentation of the results of these activities. \r\n \r\nManagement of Change\r\nTexas Petrochemicals has established and implemented written procedures to manage changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures, and any changes to the facility that affect a covered process.  The procedures assure that, prior to any change, the following issues are considered: the technical basis for the proposed change, its impact on safety and health, any modifications to operating procedures, the necessary time period for the change, and any authorization requirements.  Employees involved in operating a process, as well as maintenance and contract employees whose job will be affected, are informed of and trained in the change.  If necessary, the process safety information and operating procedures are updated.\r\n \r\nPre-Startup Review\r\nThe TBCC Facility performs pre-startup reviews for major changes in a process that require modification to process safety information.\r\n \r\nCompliance Audit\r\nTexas Petrochemicals performs audits of its compliance with the provisions of 29CFR1910.119 (PSM) and 40 CFR part 68 (RMP).

Appropriate corrective actions are implemented.\r\n \r\nIncident Investigation\r\nThe PNO Facility, including TBCC, conducts an incident investigation for every incident that resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release of a covered chemical. The investigation is promptly conducted. It is performed by a team consisting of persons with the appropriate knowledge and experience to thoroughly investigate and analyze the incident. A report is prepared at the conclusion of the incident investigation that addresses the incident, the factors that contributed to it, and recommendations resulting from the incident investigation.  The recommendations are then tracked to completion.\r\n \r\nEmployee Participation\r\nThe PNO Facility, including TBCC, has a written employee participation plan that allows input from employees on the development and analysis of process safety management.  PHA's and all other RMP information are available to all employees.\r\n \r\nHot Work Permit\r\nThe PNO Facility, including TBCC, has a procedure for the issuance of hot work permits for hot work conducted on or near a covered process (hot work generally involves electric or gas welding, cutting, brazing or similar spark-producing operations).  If any hot work is performed near a covered process, a permit is issued that documents the fire prevention and protection requirements for the operation, the date authorized for hot work, and the object on which the work is performed.    \r\n \r\nContractors\r\nTBCC has processes for selecting and ensuring that contractors are competent and knowledgeable and can safely perform their work.

The Lake Charles TBCC Emergency Response Program is based on mutual aid and is strictly classified as a \"defensive\" program until mutual aid is summoned and arrives on site.  In case of an emergency, Security personnel will be notified to contact the LEPC personnel.\r\n\r\nAll Operations personnel are trained and qualified in exterior fire fighting within one year of when they start working at the site.
