      "SummaryText": "Pioneer Chlor Alkali Company Inc. - Henderson, Henderson, NV 89009\r\n\r\nIntroduction \r\n\r\nPioneer Americas LLC in Henderson, Nevada, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Pioneer Companies of Houston Texas. Pioneer Companies is a major producer of Chlor-alkali products in the United States. The Henderson Plant is a medium sized manufacturing facility that presently produces sodium hydroxide (caustic soda), chlorine, muriatic acid (HCL) and sodium hypochlorite (bleach). The raw materials and resources consumed manufacturing in the operation are salt (sodium chloride), water, and electricity. The technology employed to convert these materials into finished products is the Diamond Shamrock's modified diaphragm cell for making caustic soda and chlorine. The second is Union Carbide's graphite equipment train for making muriatic acid, and the third is Swenson's Quadruple Effect Evaporation unit for evaporating the caustic soda to a 50 percent solution.\r\n\r\nFacility History \r\n\r\nPioneer purchased the Henderson Facility in October 1988 from a subsidiary of ICI Americas, Inc. (ICI). ICI acquired the facility in connection with the purchase of Stauffer Chemical Company (Stauffer), which bought the facility from the State of Nevada in 1952, after having leased and operated the facility since 1945. \r\n\r\nDemographic Profile \r\n\r\nThe Pioneer facility is located in the southeastern corner of the Las Vegas Valley within the city of Henderson. A 10-mile radius circle surrounding the facility includes all of Henderson, a portion of southern and eastern Las Vegas, and the western portion of Boulder City. The area encompassed by the circle contains most types of urban land use, as well as large areas of undeveloped and mountainous terrain.\r\n\r\nThe following land use categories and approximate percentages are represented within the 314 square mile circle centered on the Pioneer facility:\r\n\r\n* Undeveloped land in the Lake Mead National Recreation Area (NRA), about 7% of the total, is located along th"

The prevailing winds average 7-11 miles per hour. In the absence of storms and regional atmospheric circulation patterns, there is a diurnal wind flow. The typical diurnal flow system occurs when cool, dense air in the mountains moves downslope into the valleys during the night, and then reverses to flow upslope during the day as the valley heats up relative to the mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegulated Substances At The Henderson Plant\r\n\r\nChlorine is the only chemical at the Henderson Plant that which falls under the RMP regulations although Pioneer has practiced risk management and prevention for many years throughout all areas of the facility.

Additional, Pioneer strives to improve the safety and environmental stewardship by continuously improving our performance based on the Responsible Care principles and codes.\r\n\r\nEach of the PSM elements is fully implemented and integrated into the standard operating practices of the Plant. A brief description of each element is discussed below, however you can request more detailed information or make inquiries at our web site at http://www.piona.com . \r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nCritical information on chlorine properties, chlorine production techniques, and chlorine handling is made readily available to facility personnel through Material Safety Data Sheets, current drawings, and comprehensive operations manuals. Additionally, the Chlorine Institute provides information and guidelines in the form of regularly updated technical pamphlets.

The program also provides ongoing training and refresher courses to continually enhance the capabilities of all plant employees. All training is documented to ensure completion.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nThe Mechanical Integrity program in place at the plant is specifically designed to keep our equipment in viable condition.

The findings are documented and communicated to facility personnel.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nEmployee participation is the cornerstone of our safety philosophy .

All personnel are required to be properly equipped and qualified before they are allowed to perform critical response procedures.\r\n\r\nAs part of the ongoing training program for responders, we regularly perform readiness exercises. These include both tabletop planning sessions as well as full field responses to simulated incidents in the plant. Additionally, we conduct joint exercises with the County and City Emergency Response Agencies and work closely to coordinate emergency response actions with them. Pioneer is also an active member Clark County Local Emergency Planning Committee that provides resources for emergency response to other area facilities.\r\n\r\nThe plant is equipped with a facility-wide alarm system. As soon as the alarm system is triggered, response teams assemble immediately; including those assigned the task of making critical notifications. Current emergency phone numbers are maintained in the control room of the facility and also in the Emergency Action Plan, which is immediately available in several critical areas of the plant, so that timely notifications can be made.\r\n\r\nAnother key safety feature at the plant is the facility-wide chlorine-monitoring network that can detect chlorine at very low concentrations. Operations personnel monitor the real-time readings from the chlorine sensors and will respond immediately to any detection. Additionally, the facility utilizes a computer modeling system that can help to plan potential scenarios and develop appropriate responses.\r\n\r\n\r\nHypothetical Models\r\n\r\nThe Environmental Protection Agency has defined the Worst Case Scenario as the hypothetical rupture and full release of all contents of the facility's largest storage tank, assuming all safeguards have failed, during extremely stable weather conditions.

The computer generated model for our largest chlorine tank results in a planning zone of up to 18 miles.\r\n\r\nThe EPA has specified in the RMP rule that each facility must define a specific Alternate Scenario that could have an off site impact, based on plant operations. This scenario is to be modeled using the actual safeguards that are in place, during typical weather conditions. After a thorough review of our facility, we have selected the hypothetical rupture of a loading line while actively loading a chlorine rail car. It should be noted at this point that this facility has never experienced chlorine loading hose rupture.\r\n\r\nOur loading system includes two sets of automatic valves that are specifically designed for this application, which would close immediately if a loading hose were to rupture. The computer generated model for this hypothetical scenario results in a possible impact of up to 0.6 miles from the loading station.\r\n\r\nFive Year Release History\r\n\r\nWith no incidents to report on its Five-Year Accident History the Henderson facility is proud of it's record. EPA has set a strict criteria for reporting accidents as follows any incidents resulted in offsite impact such as evacuation, sheltering in place, or an injury are required to be reported in five year history. The fact that the Henderson Plant has not had any such incidents is confirmation of our commitment to safety. \r\n\r\nSafety Improvements\r\nOur philosophy is simple, we believe that the key to continuous improvement in safety is put safety and environmental protection into every decision we make. This is especially true in the safety, health and environmental areas where we to continuously look for opportunities to improve our abilities in protecting our people and our community. We actively solicit and implement safety and process improvement suggestions through our safety committee or our employee suggestion program\r\n\r\nA few recent"
