Martin, MN  56376\n\nFor Further information contact Thomas Wendlandt, Plant Manager\n\nRisk Management Plan- Executive Summary\n\n  1. The Facility Policy\n\n       The owners, management, and employees of St. Martin Co-op are \ncommitted to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.\nIf an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with\nthe local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and\nminimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n   2. Facility Information\n\n       - The Primary Activity at the facility is the storage of ferilizers for sale to farmers\n      \n       - Anhydrous ammonia ie received, stored, and distributed for crop production.\n\n       - The maximum quantity stored would be 190,000 pounds in one 18,000 gallon\nstorage tank, and 25,  1,000 gallon nurse tanks\n\n    3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative scenario.\n\n      a. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a \nstorage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would\nbe 80,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity\nas limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint is .94 miles.\n\n      b. The alternative release scenario is based on a 2 minute release from the break of a \n3 inch pipe. The distance to the endpoint is .78 miles.\n\n     4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\n           The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety requirements for the storage \nand handling of anhydrous, K-61.1\", Published by the American National Standards Institute,\ninc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)\n29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of anhydrous ammonia\". In addition, MN Dept. of Ag. Ammonia rules.\n\n       5. The Five-year Accident History\n\n          a. There have been no accidental releases of a"
