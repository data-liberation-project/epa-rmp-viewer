It includes required actions by Plant employees as well as required notification and coordination with local responders and agencies. All employees are trained in the execution of the Emergency Response Plan and drills are conducted annually.\r\n\r\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated substances:\r\n\r\nThe Willow Creek Processing Plant processes raw natural gas into residue gas and natural gas liquids. The residue gas consists of methane and some fractions of ethane, carbon dioxide and nitrogen suitable for commercial natural gas as defined by the local interstate pipelines.  The natural gas liquids consist of ethane, propane, butane, pentane, natural gasoline (C6+) and small amounts of carbon dioxide.  The raw material is received by pipeline. The processed products are delivered to both pipelines and to a truck loading rack.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\r\n\r\nThe Willow Creek Processing Plant has implemented all the elements of a Program 3 Risk Management Plan (RMP) and all the elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program.

The program consists of procedures for responding to releases of regulated substances, including the possibility of associated fires or explosions. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in these procedures annually to perform emergency response duties.  The program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the gas plant processes.
