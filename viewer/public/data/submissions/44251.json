The Hays/Caldwell Water Teatment Plant is located near the City of San Marcos, Texas.  The water treatment plant is located along the banks of the San Marcos River, and uses chlorine gas as the primary water disinfectant.\n\nThe entire supply on hand consists of a maximum of two (2), one-ton containers  There is room to add two (2) more one ton containers if ever needed.  Vacuum feed/injection system is used to prevent leaks in the system.  A chlorine leak detector is in place with an audible alarm system to alert personnel of chlorine leaks.  There are SCBA units on-site for chlorine emergiencies.  The chlorine system is monitored during the week several times per day by an on-site operator and monitored daily on the weekends.  Preventive maintenance is performed regularly.\n\nA Hazard Assesment has been conducted and documented in accordance with 40 CFR 68.20 - 68.42 and a prevention program has been implemented to satisfy the requiremnensts of 40 CFR 68.48 - 68.60.  There have been no accidental chlorine gas releases within the past five years.\n\nCanyon Regional Water Authority has developed an emergency response plan for the Hays/Caldwell Water Treatment Plant.  This plan identifies procedures and response actions to be taken in the event of an accidental release of chlorine.  The emergency response plan has been coordinated with the Hays County EMC and Caldwell EMC."
