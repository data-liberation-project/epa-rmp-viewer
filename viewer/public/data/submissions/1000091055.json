Therefore, at the PLANT the worst-case release quantity, as defined by the EPA, is considered to be one (1) - 2,000-pound cylinder of chlorine (Cl2) or sulfur dioxide (SO2).  Worst case scenario and off-site consequences analysis are included in the plan.\r\n\r\nToxic Endpoint\r\nA toxic endpoint is defined as the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals can be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action. According to EPA guidelines, the toxic endpoint for chlorine is 0.0087 mg/L (3 ppm) and is 0.0078 mg/L (3ppm) for sulfur dioxide.\r\n\r\nChlorine Release\r\nThe distance to the toxic endpoint for chlorine is determined using the EPA guidelines presented in the Risk Management Guide for Offsite Consequences Analysis. The worst-case scenario assumes that the entire quantity of a single vessel would be released over a period of 10 minutes. For a 2,000-pound vessel, this calculates to a release rate of 200-lb/min. Other factors are taken into consideration in the determination of a toxic endpoint, including the terrain of the surrounding area (rural or urban), typical weather conditions and chemical density. The following factors were used in \u00b7the calculation of the toxic endpoint for this facility: Wind speed 1.5 m/s; Atmospheric Stability Class F; Temperature 25\u00b0; Humidity 50%; Urban Surface Roughness; Height of release 0-feet (ground level). For wastewater treatment plants, chlorine and sulfur dioxide are always assumed to be dense gases which travel close to the ground surface. An urban surface roughness was chosen because there are many obstacles in the path of potential release, including trees and structures.\r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario for the plant was developed using the EPA's screening tool RMP*CO"
