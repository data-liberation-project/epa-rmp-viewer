The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant to maintain the proper temperature of fluid milk within the facility.  Anhydrous ammonia is an effective refrigerant that has been used for many years by most food processing facilities.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:   T.G. Lee Foods, Inc. is committed to promoting safety for the plant, its employees and the surrounding area.  The facility is complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard, Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations 1910.110 and EPA's Risk Management Program Title 40 CFR Part 68.  The purpose of these programs is to ensure that the refrigeration system is operated safely in order to prevent releases of ammonia from the system.  In addition, the programs serve to develop procedures to minimize releases in the event that they do occur and to outline appropriate emergency response steps to take in the event of a release.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario:  EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration and the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration's Risk Management Guidelines were the primary documents used to develop the worst case release scenario.  The worst case release is one that is unlikely to occur.  The purpose of the worst case release analysis is to support a dialogue with the community on release prevention.  It is a conservative analysis and is not to serve as a rational basis for the actual emergency response planning.\n\n\nAlternative Case Release Scenario:  The alternative release scenario selected is one in which a relief valves lifts due to a pressure build up in the system.  EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration and the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration's Risk Management Guidelines were the primary documents used to develop the alternative release scenario.  The alternative release scenario is one that is more li"

This endpoint is a concentration below which nearly all individuals could be exposed to for one hour without serious health effects.  Bases on Exhibit 4-4 in EPA's guidance, a release from the vessel would result in a situation where public receptors would be within the distance to the toxic endpoint.  Landview 6 software was used to update population radius within these endpoint.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program:  As a part of the PSM program, T.G. Lee Foods, Inc. has established numerous programs that serve to prevent accidental releases of ammonia.  The programs include:\nProcess Safety Information\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOperating Procedures\nTraining\nMechanical Integrity\nManagement of Change\nPre Startup Safety Review\nCompliance Audits\nIncident Investigation\nEmployee Participation\nHot Work Permits\nContractor Safety\n\nEmergency Response Information:  As a part of the PSM Program, T.G. Lee Foods, Inc. maintains an Emergency Response Plan that was prepared in order to improve responsiveness to an emergency incident, and to increase the reliability of actions taken during an incident.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, and notification of local emergency response agencies.  Training is conducted with each new employee and annually thereafter plant-wide.  Evacuation / response drills are conducted at least annually as well.\n\nFive-Year Accident History:  T.G. Lee Foods, Inc. has had an excellent operating record over the last five years and have had no reportable releases.  Due to the stringent release prevention policies, all accidental releases have been minimized.  Incidents have been documented and analyzed to prevent future occurrences.            \n\nIn addition, T.G. Lee Foods, Inc. will continue to operate and"
