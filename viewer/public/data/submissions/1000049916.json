The chemical accident prevention provisions require an executive summary in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) submission to EPA. Per 40 CFR 68.155, the owner or operator shall provide in the RMP an executive summary that includes a brief description of the following elements:\n\n(a) The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source;\n\n(b) The stationary source and regulated substances handled;\n\n(c) The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps;\n\n(d) The five-year accident history;\n\n(e) The emergency response program; and\n\n(f) Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe Facility complies with OSHA's 29 CFR 1910.111 requirements for anhydrous ammonia storage, and it is the facility's policy to adhere to applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is KF's policy to notify the Ouachita Parish Emergency Operations Center or the Louisiana State Police.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\n\n\nThe Sterlington Terminal stores anhydrous ammonia in one 200 ton bullet tank. The total storage capacity of anhydrous ammonia at the facility is 400,000 pounds.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only toxic substance regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that is present at the Sterlington Terminal in amounts above threshold quantity.  The terminal is subject to the Prevention Program/Program 3 requirements. \n\n\n\nPotential Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nThe facility evaluated both worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  KF's evaluation took into account process knowledge, hazard review, mitigation"

      "SummaryText": " measures and safe-guards (i.e. dike, emergency shut-downs, etc.) in place.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention\n\n\n\nThe facility complies with EPA's chemical accident prevention rule (40 CFR 68) and applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.111 and relevant American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) standards.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nOn August 21, 2013, an equipment failure at the Sterlington Terminal resulted in a release of anhydrous ammonia.  Based on engineering estimates, approximately 365 pounds of ammonia were released.  There were no onsite or offsite deaths, injuries or property damage.  However, traffic on Solvent Avenue, south of the Terminal, was briefly diverted as a precautionary measure.  The cause of the release was an unpredictable mechanical failure of a pump seal.  The seal has since been upgraded to a tandem (double) pump seal, which will decrease the likelihood of such an event recurring.  This event was reported to regulatory agencies.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the anhydrous ammonia system, it is the facility's policy to notify the Ouachita Parish Emergency Operations Center and request response to the emergency.  The facility has discussed this policy with the EOC.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nCompliance audits will ensure that the level of safety protection at the terminal is periodically evaluated for improvements.\n\nAn ongoing dialogue with the Ouachita Parish LEPC will ensure a constant state of readiness to respond to any potential emergencies, as well as a means to implement improvements as the need develops.\n\n"
