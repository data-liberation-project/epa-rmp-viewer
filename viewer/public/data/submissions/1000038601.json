Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR ?5189\n\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR ?1910.119\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Stanislaus Farm Supply has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities.\n\n\n\n1.1 Stanislaus Farm Supply, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Stanislaus Farm Supply has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks\n\ninvolved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities:\n\n\n\n1.1.1 Program Level & Applicability\n\n\n\nThe aqua ammonia is not subject to either the Cal-OSHA or federal OSHA PSM Standards since the concentration of ammonia is not greater than 44% by weight1. The chemical is, however, subject to the\n\nfederal ARP (20,000 lb. threshold) and CalARP (500 lb. threshold). \n\n\n\nThere are public receptors within the distance to toxic endpoint (0.14 mg/l) and the anhydrous ammonia is subject to the Cal-OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard2. Therefore, process 1 is subject to the CalARP Program Level 3 requirements. Stanislaus Farm Products is not subject to federal PSM Standard since federal OSHA maintains the r"

The worst case criteria for Program Level 1 also do not include provisions for mitigating the worst case scenario such as consideration of the berm around the tanks. Therefore, Process 1 does not qualify for Program Level 1 status. Since the aqueous ammonia tanks are not subject to the PSM Standards, are not included in the listed NAICS codes (Program Level 3 applicability) and the anhydrous ammonia is not subject to the federal PSM Standard, Process 1 is subject to federal (FedARP) Program Level 2 requirements.\n\n\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia is not exempt from the federal EPA Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program requirements under 40 CFR Part 68. The Federal Register (Vol. 61, No. 120, June 20, 1996) includes a statement that non-farmers who store anhydrous ammonia are subject to the federal ARP Program.

The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses and physical property damage.\n\n\n\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have:\n\n1. Prepared a unified program based on the PSM plan to meet CalARP and RMP obligations as well\n\n2. Organized the program so that it meshes closely with general business practices\n\n3. Utilized PSMWriter software to ensure that all necessary employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\n\n\n\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees and neighbors protect themselves.\n\n\n\n1.2 Process Descriptions\n\n \n\nProcess 1 includes all vessels and interconnecting piping for the anhydrous and aqua ammonia storage and aqua ammonia conversion systems. This is a process of connected vessels with different regulated substances, each above threshold quantity.\n\n\n\nThe process includes two interconnected fixed pressure tanks with a total volume capacity of 28,057 gallons anhydrous ammonia. The requirement for maintaining a 15% vapor headspace results in the maximum intended inventory of 115,000 lbs. (both tanks).\n\n\n\nThis process also includes two (2) fixed tanks of aqueous ammonia solution, 20% by weight. The process includes one (1) 20,000 gallon tank and one (1) 10,000 gallon tank.

Aqueous ammonia is produced on-site in this process by mixing anhydrous ammonia with water in the converter.\n\n\n\nProcess 2 includes multiple co-located field tanks with an aggregate quantity of approximately 300,000 lbs. anhydrous ammonia. The definition of \"process\" includes \"any group of vessels that are interconnected, or separate vessels that are located such that a regulated substance could be involved in a potential release\" per CalARP Section 2735.3 (kk). The field tanks include 1,000 gallon (~4,000 lb. @ 80% capacity) and 500 gallon (~2,000 lb. @ 80% capacity) trailer-mounted units. The fixed tanks in Process 1 are used to fill the field tanks with anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\nIn general, Stanislaus Farm Supply regulated processes operate as follows: Anhydrous ammonia and aqueous ammonia are received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and blending into mixed grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients. Anhydrous ammonia is received by tanker truck and stored in two (2) above ground storage tanks. Aqueous ammonia is produced in the on-site converter by mixing anhydrous ammonia and water. Anhydrous ammonia and aqueous ammonia are transferred to nurse tanks for delivery to farmers. Both the ammonia storage process and nurse tank process at this facility consists of vessels which are co-located such that a release of ammonia could impact the ability to operate vessels that are not directly connected. Therefore, the ammonia storage process and nurse tank process are each treated as a single process.\n\n\n\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\n1.3.1 General\n\n\n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release. \n\n\n\nStanislaus Farm Supply has also conducted an off-s"

It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees aremade aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur operations personnel monitor the process and keep track of all transactions that pertain to ammonia.

Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team.\n\n\n\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\n\n\n\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nStanislaus Farm Supply has implemented many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker and public safety."

In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Stanislaus Farm Supply's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\nStanislaus Farm Supply has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program.

Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Stanislaus Farm Supply has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\n\n\nFor the future, Stanislaus Farm Supply now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\".
