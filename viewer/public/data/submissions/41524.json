To assist with ongoing compliance, a \"Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance Manual: along with a Operations and Maintenance Manual have been prepared and implemented.  Concerning the emergency response policy at the facility, the owner has made the decision that employees will not respond to accidental releases of regulated substances and will instead evacuate.  This facility is a waste water treatment plant.  Treatment includes chlorination of the waste water with two chlorine cylinders located at the facility (2,000 lbs each).  The process basically involves continuous mixing of chlorine with the waste water whereby the final mixture contains less than 1% chlorine by weight.  The treated waste water is then released.  The storage cylinders and mixing equipment are subject to the RMP requirements since it contains threshold quantities of a regulated substances greater than 2,500 pounds.  Total on site capacity is 4,000 pounds.  This facility has one worst case release scenario which involves the release of all substances contained in the single largest chlorine cylinder when full (2,000 lbs total).  This scenario yeilds a distance to the endpoint of 1.3 miles.  This facility has an alternative release scenario.  The scenario involves a puncture of the largest diameter chlorine cylinder when full.  The scenario yeilds a distance to the endpoint of 0.1 miles.  Since this facility is a Program 2, a documented prevention program is required.  This program is discussed in a \"Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance Manual\" along with a Operations and Maintenance Manual prepared for the facility.  The prevention program does discuss chlorine which is the specific chemical contianed in an amount above the threshold quantity.  The facility has not experienced a release as defined in the reg"

This program is contained in Section 5.0 of the \"Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance Manual\" prepared for the facility.  Further, emergency response procedures have been developed and are contained at the front of this RMP and these procedures will be implemented in the event of an accidental release or the threat of such a release.
