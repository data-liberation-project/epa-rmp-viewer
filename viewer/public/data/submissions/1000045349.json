      "SummaryText": "Don Miguel Mexican Foods of Dallas, Texas prepares foods which are cooked and frozen for storage and shipment to retail vendors.   One of the refrigerants used is anhydrous ammonia.  The ammonia refrigeration system includes two machinery rooms for flash freezers and storage areas.  The facility has been in operation since 1998 and in 2006 the plant expansion resulted in having more that 10,000 lbs ammonia in the processes.     \n\n\n\nThe persons working at the plant consist of employees and a significant number of contract employees.   A sanitation firm provides approximately 200 contract employees.  Furthermore, typically 100 to 200 contract employees are used in food processing areas.    \n\n\n\nAmmonia is contained in equipment in the facility and is compressed, condensed and evaporated to remove heat from within the facility to maintain safe storage areas and remove heat from the products being handled.\n\n\n\nAmmonia is classified by EPA as a toxic chemical and it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling it to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the health threat to our own workers, and reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ammonia, safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, safe handling procedures that we use, and the training of our personnel.\n\n\n\nAn accidental release prevention program has been in place since the facility increased the ammonia on site above the 10,000 lb threshold. The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines, and is in compliance with State codes.  This food processing facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable State codes and regulations.\n\n\n\nAll of our ammonia refrigeration operators are trained using a formal training program.

      "SummaryText": "rogram consists of having an effective preventive maintenance program and  comprehensive employee training to insure equipment integrity. \n\n\n\nThe process has numerous safeguards including:  \n\n\n\n?    Ammonia is not corrosive in this service.    \n\n\n\n?    The Plant has an overall safety program that includes employee awareness and training to minimize the potential for an accident or incident involving the ammonia refrigeration equipment.  \n\n\n\n?    A process hazard analysis (PHA) re-validation was conducted in 2011 and is scheduled to be revalidated again in 2016.  A team with expertise in engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety evaluated the existing refrigeration system in depth and developed recommendations to improve the safety and operability of the system.  The PHA addressed:  (1) process hazards; (2) previous incidents; (3) engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards; (4) the consequence of control failure; (5) facility siting; (6) human factors; and (7) a qualitative evaluation of possible safety and health effects of control system failures.  \n\n\n\n?    Written Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) were prepared to provide the basis for proper and safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  The SOPs include procedures for normal operations, startup, shutdown, emergency operations, and emergency shutdown.  \n\n\n\n?    For projects, a management of change procedure and a pre-startup safety review are in place to ensure that system changes or expansions are safe and that the changes are consistent with the engineering design and in condition to be operated prior to startup.  \n\n\n\n?    Contractors that are used to work on, or adjacent to, the refrigeration system are \"pre-qualified\" based upon their knowledge of ammonia refrigeration, understanding of applicable codes and standards, and their demonstrated ability to work safely.  Each of these contractors is evaluated from a safety perspective.  \n\n\n\n?    The Plant has a program for replacement of all S"
