The City of Roanoke accidental release prevention policy for the Water Pollution Control  Plant (WPCP) involves a comprehensive approach that incorporates technologies, work procedures, and administrative practices.  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Virginia Occupational Safety and Health (VOSH) procedures have served as guidelines and standards in the development of this program and are adhered to.  The WPCP emergency response policy involves the creation of an emergency response plan which will incorporate response capabilities available both internally and from the community.\n\nb. The WPCP was established in 1946 to disinfect and treat the sewage discharge  for Roanoke City as well as serving the majority of localities in the region.  The Plant is located at 1402 Bennington Street in Roanoke City, Virginia.  Treated water is discharged into the Roanoke River located adjacent to the plant.  The chlorination system includes a chlorination supply room which contains gas chlorine cylinders, the initial components of the gaseous chlorine distribution system, and various safety equipment and an instrument room which contains a flow recorder , various electrical panels, and additional safety equipment.  The amount of chlorine actually utilized is two one ton cylinders of chlorine.   There are approximately 6 other ton cylinders in storage.  The de-chlorination system includes a sulfur dioxide supply room which contains gas sulfur dioxide cylinders, the initial components of the gaseous sulfur dioxide distribution system, and various safety equipment and an instrument room which contains a flow recorder , various electrical panels, and additional safety equipment.  The amount of sulfur dioxide actually utilized is two one ton cylinders.   There are approximately 6 other ton"

      "SummaryText": " cylinders in storage.The facility is manned twenty-four hours per day by water treatment operators, with approximately 30 employees on a daylight shift and 5 employees on the night shift.  The chlorination and sulfur dioxide rooms are continuously monitored through hourly walk throughs by employees.\n\nc. The offsite consequence analysis includes the consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified as \"worst case release\" and \"alternative release scenario\", an \"alternative release scenario\" for sulfur dioxide, and a \"worst case\" for the digester gas (methane) .  The \"worst case scenario\" is defined by the Risk Management standards as \"the owner or operator shall assume that the...maximum quantity in the largest vessel... is released over ten minutes,\" due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative release submitted has been deemed by the City as a scenario  which is more likely to occur than the worst case scenario.\n\nEPA guidelines and tables were utilized in determining the distance traveled by the \nhypothetical chlorine released before its concentration decreases to the \"toxic endpoint\".    The residential population affected was determined through overlaying a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance over a map and utilizing U.S. Census Bureau data to develop accurate estimates of the potentially affected population.  The atmospheric data used for both scenarios was that found in the EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis literature.\n\nWhen the worst case scenario was performed using the EPA assumptions, a toxic endpoint of .92 miles and an estimate of residential population potentially affected of 5,200 was obtained.  The EPA defined reduction for the presence of an enclosure of .55 was utilized in deriving this distance.  The alternative release scenario involves the assumed rupture of the flexible connections connected to two ton cylinders through an accidental action of an employee or degradation of the line.

      "SummaryText": "chlorine calculated to be released was 4,000 lbs. at an average rate over one hour of  240 lbs./min.  The typical meteorological data used were Stability E, wind speed of 3.0 m/s, average air temperature of 62 F, and 63% average humidity.  The presence of the enclosure was also considered to derive this distance.  The estimated population potentially affected by the alternative release was 200.  The \"worst case\" scenario for the digester gas involves an explosion of 4,810 lbs. of released digester gas.  The distance to a 1 psi endpoint was .10 mile.  This endpoint did not generate any public receptors or affected population.    \n\nd. The general WPCP accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n High level of operator training\n Preventative maintenance program\n Use of state of the art processes and safety equipment\n Performance of hazard analysis of equipment and procedures\n Implementation of inspection programs.\n \ne. No accidental release of chlorine, sulfur dioxide, or digester gas have occurred at this facility in the past five years.\n\nf. The facility has an emergency action plan which has been coordinated with and reviewed by the Roanoke City Fire Department, which is a member of the Local Emergency Response Planning Committee.  Emergency response drills and drill evaluations are conducted annually as well as the review of the emergency plans and procedures.\n\ng. Fifty-four changes to improve safety (recommended actions) were identified in May 1997 and have been evaluated and implemented as required."
