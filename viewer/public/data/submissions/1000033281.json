The Facility Policy\n\n\n\nLoida Ag Service,LLC is committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia through the use of proper equipment, regular inspections, maintenance and training of all persons that work with anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to a release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application to the soil as a crop production nutrient.\n\n\n\nThe maximum quantity of ammonia stored would be 237,854 pounds in two 18,000 and one 15,000 gallon storage tanks. \n\n\n\n3. The worst case scenario and the alternative case scenario\n\nThis facility has developed a worst case and alternative case scenario, but has been withheld from this Executive Summary as security-sensitive information as requested by EPA. \n\n\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\n\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of EPA 40 CFR part 68 \"Accidental Release Prevention,\" ANSI K61.1 A?Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia,\" OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111, A?Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia,A? and Missouri State Fertilizer laws. Training is provided on safe anhydrous ammonia operations for employees.\n\n\n\n5. The Five-year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process at this facility in the past five years.\n\n\n\n6. Emergency Response Program:\n\n\n\nThis facility has a written emergency plan in accordance with OSHA Standards 29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.120.  The Emergency Plan for this"
