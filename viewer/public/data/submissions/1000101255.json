This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  SKW Quab has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, Evonik conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and the plant provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the plant.\r\n\r\n\r\nf. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nSKW Quab resolves all findings from process hazard analysis, some of which result in modifications to the process.  The following types of changes are planned: increase process controls & modify procedures.  Each event and depending on the cause and nature of a release facility wide changes to the handling, storage and equipment or review operational procedures including operators training and implementation can be  involved or may be changed to address the event and reduce the potential for re-occurrence."

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. The policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\nSKW Quab through Evonik has a nine-point policy guiding the accidental release prevention program. These are:\r\n\r\n1) Use applicable design safety codes and standards as the basis for design, construction, operation, and maintenance in our facilities.\r\n2) Evaluate facilities, equipment and processes for safety and health concerns.\r\n3) Use multiple safeguards to provide layers of protection in the design, construction and operation of facilities, in order to prevent a single failure from escalating into a catastrophic event.\r\n4) Document the safety and health evaluation.\r\n5) Inspect and evaluate process equipment against the design specifications.\r\n6) Maintain current and complete documentation of the process and equipment throughout the lifetime of the process.\r\n7) A Management of Change (MOC) procedure to control minor changes to process technology, operation and maintenance that may affect the safety of the process.\r\n8) Review all changes to process equipment, procedures and practices to ensure the continued safety of employees and facilities.\r\n9) Develop inspection and maintenance programs that ensure the continued integrity of facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe accidental release prevention programs and contingency planning efforts help effectively manage the hazards that are posed to employees, the public, and the environment by use of these chemicals.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nSKW Qaub Mobile Plant is located"
