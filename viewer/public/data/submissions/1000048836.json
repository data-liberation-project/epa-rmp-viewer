      "SummaryText": "Town & Country Co-op is a farmer owned co-op providing services and products essential for use in production agriculture.  One of these products is anhydrous ammonia which provides a low cost, easy to handle source of nitrogen for the production of corn and wheat crops.  Our facility has an 18,000 gallon storage tank from which we transfer ammonia to smaller portable tanks for sale to our customers  Town & Country co-op has not had any injuries or accidental release of product on record for the past 5 years.  With our on going safety and maintenance programs and safe handling practices our plan is to keep this number at 0.  Local fire departments along with other local emergency response people receive periodic updates on our facility along with the proper response and first aid procedures for an ammonia release.  Using Degadis guidelines, a mojor release of product would occur with a rupture in a rail car resulting in a complete dispersal of product in 10 minutes or less.  This could affect an area, using Digadis computations of up to a 1.28 mile radius around the release site.  Wind direction and speed has the largest effect on any evacuation scenario.  Upon notification the Branch Mgr. Is responsible to contact the proper emergency response people per our company emergency action plan.  Employees have also been instructed to seek safe haven.  A more likely scenario would be that a pipe could rupture during the transfer of product.  There are some safety features in place tokeep any release to a minimum.  There are check valves and exess flow valves that are designed to automaticly close upon the sudden release of product minimizing any accidental release of product.  Manual shutoff valves an then be shut to initiate repairs.  A possible evacuation area for this scenario would be a radius of .56 miles or less, again wind direction and speed will have a large affect on this.  With our current measures in place we anticipate no immedant changes inour current trainin"
