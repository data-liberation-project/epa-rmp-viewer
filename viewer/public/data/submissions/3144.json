Headworks uses gaseous chlorine liquefied under pressure to disinfect the drinking water supply.  Headworks qualifies for a Level 1 RMP since there are no offsite receptors within the area of a worst case release, the facility has not had an accidental release resulting in offsite consequences, and facility emergency response has been coordinated with local responders.  More information on these safety aspects is given below.\n\n\n                   Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIt is the policy of the Bureau of Water Works to handle and use chlorine and other chemicals in the safest means practicable.  The Bureau has a comprehensive safety program that includes a proactive prevention program, comprehensive training for workers, state of the art release containment and treatment systems, and an Emergency Action Plan for notification of emergency responders and the community in the unlikely event of a chlorine release.  Additionally, Headworks is located in a remote area away from public receptors.  In light of these safety considerations, the benefits of drinking water disinfection (a safe secure supply of clean drinking water) greatly outweigh the minor risk of using chlorine at Headworks.\n\n\n                        Headworks Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Headworks chlorination system is located 5 miles behind a locked gate, within the Bull Run watershed, which is closed to all public access.  The chlorination system consists of two separate rooms: the Primary Storage Room and the Standby Storage Room.  A total of up to 36 one-ton chlorine cylin"

      "SummaryText": "ders are stored within these rooms.  Both rooms are served by an emergency air scrubber system, which when activated by automatic chlorine sensors, has the capacity to neutralize up to 2,000 pounds of chlorine.  The emergency scrubber system has a back-up generator allowing it to operate even if electrical power to Headworks is interrupted. \n\n\n                                            Worst-Case Release Scenario\n\nThe most extreme release scenario, although unlikely, would be the release from a full one-ton cylinder inside the containment building followed by a failure of the emergency air scrubber system.  In this event, an estimated 110 pounds of chlorine would escape from the building each minute over a period of about 18.2 minutes.  According to air dispersion modeling for such a release, the chlorine, which is heavier than air, would be confined to the narrow gorge of the Bull Run River, which is closed to the public.  The chlorine would disperse to a safe concentration (about 3 parts per million) after traveling approximately 0.7 mile.  This distance is within the area of the Bull Run watershed that is closed to the public.  Hence, there are no residential receptors or other sensitive receptors (e.g. schools hospitals, or other businesses) within the watershed.  Because this is a Level 1 RMP, alternate releases were not evaluated.\n\n\n                                         Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe Headworks has voluntarily implemented the substantial requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management rule, which includes systematic evaluation of critical systems to prevent accidental releases.  Additionally, the Bureau had an independent review of process systems, management, training, and emergency response procedures to ensure maximum safety.  The Bureau conducts safety reviews any time a process change is proposed.\n\n\n                                             Five-Year Accident History\n\nNo release of chlorine or other chemicals that res"

The Bureau has a full time emergency response coordinator who works closely with the City of Portland Bureau of Fire, Rescue, & Emergency Services (Fire Bureau) to prepare for and respond to emergency situations.  The Fire Bureau has agreed to provide emergency services to Headworks since it is most qualified to respond to chemical emergencies.\n\nHeadworks has remote release sensors that are monitored at the offsite Water Control Center.  The Water Control Center can activate emergency response to Headworks.  Emergency equipment that allows workers to respond to small incidents is maintained onsite.  All employees are trained in emergency response procedures upon hire and annually thereafter. \n\n                                       Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Bureau plans to continuously evaluate and improve safety procedures at Headworks as opportunities arise.  Training exercises will continue on a regular basis.  No major safety modifications to Headworks are currently planned."
