Lineage Logistics' safety and environmental policies as they relate to the ammonia refrigeration system are administered by the Director of Engineering, who conducts inspections of the facility to ensure compliance.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nThe Lineage Logistics facility is located at 2063 W. Miguel Bustamante Parkway in Colton, California, which is approximately 1.9 miles northwest of Highway 215 and 2 miles south of Interstate 10. The area immediately surrounding the facility is rural with a mixture of light industrial and residential areas.  The facility was constructed and began operations in 2014.  \r\n\r\nThe primary business of Lineage Logistics is to provide cooling and cold storage of various food products. In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains a refrigeration system containing a maximum intended inventory of 30,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance.  The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for the cold storage of food products.  Typical operating conditions range from 1 psig on the low pressure side of the system to 166 psig on the high side.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELE"

Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the Lineage Logistics facility operates in accordance with the Process Safety Management (PSM), Risk Management Program (RMP), and California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  It is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.\r\n\r\nEngineering Measures:\r\nOther safety features of the ammonia refrigeration system include: emergency shutdown switches that kill power to the engine room equipment (located outside each exter"

The facility has also installed ammonia sensors at strategic locations throughout the facility.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe refrigeration system at Lineage Logistics is of new construction at the time the RMPeSubmit documentation was submitted (March 1, 2014).  System start up is scheduled for May 2014.  Therefore, there have been no significant releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds or the state requirement mandating immediate reporting of any release or threatened release of a hazardous material in the past five years.  In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release, nor any releases or near misses that warranted an internal incident investigation.\r\n \r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Lineage Logistics facility has an emergency action plan in effect.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP/CalARP document. This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\r\n  \r\n  1.)  To save lives.\r\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\r\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\r\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\r\n\r\nThe facility maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP and CalARP regulations."

In the event that an ammonia leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will alert any personnel in the immediate area who are unaware of the danger, and the Lead Refrigeration Technician.  The Lead Refrigeration Technician will contact the General Manager, the Safety Director, the Director of Engineering, and the Senior Vice President of Engineering to evaluate and ascertain the significance of the leak.  If the ammonia leak is considered minor and/or minimal, the repair will be conducted by the Lineage Logistics refrigeration mechanical staff.  An outside refrigeration contractor may be contracted to further assist in the potential repairs to the equipment pertaining to the ammonia system.  For major ammonia leaks, emergency agencies will also be notified as necessary as outlined in the Emergency Action Plan.  Action is promptly taken to mitigate the leak so normal operations can resume.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe Process Hazards Analysis, conducted on February 12-13, 2014, including a Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study and a Facility Inspection, provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the Lineage Logistics facility.  The Lineage Logistics safety committee is planning to complete several items over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\r\n\r\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\r\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\r\n3. Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\r\n4. Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed.\r\n\r\nDATA ELEMENTS NOTES\r\n\r\nItem numbers 7.8a, 7.8b, 7.9a, 7.9b, 7.10, and 7.15 have been intentionally left blank.
