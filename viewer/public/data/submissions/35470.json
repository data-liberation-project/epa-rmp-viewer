The plant was originally built in 1942.  In 1999, BAE SYSTEMS Ordnance Systems Inc. (then Royal Ordnance North America) became the operating contractor.  Holston has had an excellent safety record over the past 62 years and intends to maintain this outstanding record in the years to come.  Holston has long standing agreements and coordination with local emergency planning units including Hawkins County and the City of Kingsport.\n\nHolston is subject to EPA's Risk Management Program rule for two listed substances:  concentrated nitric acid and anhydrous ammonia - both used in the manufacture of explosives.  Holston has one nitric acid tank farm where concentrated nitric acid is stored in aluminum tanks.  Holston stores anhydrous ammonia at two registered pressure vessel tank farms.\n\nThe nitric acid tank farm is diked to contain spills thus reducing potential atmospheric release rates and facilitating spill recovery.  Two of the nitric acid storage tanks are being replaced new in 2004.   \n\nTwo tank farms comprise Holston's storage facilities for anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored as a liquid under pressure in registered pressure vessel tanks.  \n\nHolston is subject to OSHA PSM.  PSM (Process Safety Management) fulfills the remainder of the RMP requirements.  Holston's PSM program is both intensive and effective because safe reliable production of explosives depends on it.   Elements of Holston's PSM include:  process safety information management, process hazard analyses, standard operating procedures, proper training, mechanical integrity checks, Change Management, Pre Start-up reviews, compliance audits, incident investigations, employee participation, hot work permitting, and contractor oversig"

      "SummaryText": "ht.\n\nRMP is a cooperative function at Holston.  Primary responsibility lies with Environmental Affairs, but many other departments are an integral part of Holston's RMP.  Holston has a fully manned and trained onsite fire department with HAZMAT capabilities that responds to all types of emergencies.  The safety department in conjunction with operations management takes responsibility for implementing and maintaining PSM.  Contractor management is responsible for seeking Army review and approval of RMP and Army staff retain notification and submission duties.\n\nHolston's lack of an accident history demonstrates Holston's commitment to good risk management planning."
