We realize that our workforce is our most important asset and that the environment around us is what provides much of the quality to our lives.  In maintaining both of these assets we will thrive both in our industry and in our community\r\n\r\nTwin Rivers is a manufacturer of vegetable and tallow fatty acids and crude glycerin.  These products meet kosher, food-grade and non-food grade standards for secondary manufacturing users such as detergent, soap and lubrication companies.  Three processes shape the Twin Rivers manufacturing organization, hydrolyzation, distillation and hydrogenation for the manufacture of whole cut and blended products and fractionation for well-defined fractionated fatty acids. Twin Rivers receives raw materials via semi-tanker, railcar and ocean tankers at its on-site rail, truck and deep-water terminals.  Finished products are primarily shipped to customers over Twin Rivers rail loading and delivery system, although semi-truck tankers make some deliveries.  To support these operations, Twin Rivers has a workforce of highly trained technicians and managers that conduct manufacturing operations as well as support groups of environmental, laboratory, utilities and logistics technicians continuously on duty.  The Twin Rivers workforce conducts operations at the facility twenty-four hour, seven-day, year round (with the exception of maintenance shutdowns).  Additional support comes from Twin Rivers security services that control site access and monitor the facility on a continuous basis.\r\n\r\nAs natural oil refinery environmental and s"

A system of berms, relief valves, rupture disks, interlocks, manual and automatic shutoffs, alarms, isolation walls, deluge systems as well as other safety apparatus are all used to keep any situation from becoming critical and keep technicians aware of the condition of manufacturing systems at all times.\r\n\r\nSecond, Twin Rivers provides complete and appropriate training and education to its workforce to minimize human failure.  This includes an (approximately) three-month apprenticeship and internal process qualification for all perspective employees prior to being released to conduct manufacturing operations.  Third, Twin Rivers has a staff of environmental health and safety professionals that train, inspect and correct any conditions that could become hazardous to the workforce or the surrounding environment.  This group includes the Regulatory Affairs Manager; the Health and Safety Manager, Process Safety Engineers and Inspectors and a staff of licensed and certified environmental technicians.  The Director of ESS is responsible for regulatory compliance and reporting, administrative management of the environmental technicians (qualifications, licensing etc.), safety training, and implementing new programs to mitigate unsafe conditions or actions.  The Health and Safety Manager is responsible for conducting job safety analysis, on-site inspections, hazard mitigation, safety training and safety procedure development.  The Senior Director of Engineering manages the Process Safety Program that includes pressure vessel inspections, process changes and material change review.  The environmental technicians are responsible for the operations of the wastewater treatment and air scrubbing systems as well as hazardous materials handling, hazardous waste handling and spill response.

Ten-pound, 150 pound and 800 pound steam are all used for process and heating purposes.  No injuries have been attributed to 800-pound steam releases at Twin Rivers.  Hazardous chemicals, such as sodium hydroxide are stored on site are stored in relatively small quantities (under RMP reportable thresholds) in bermed or protected areas with controlled access.  Other chemicals include fuel oils (#6 & #2) used for boilerhouse operations for steam generation.\r\n\r\nThe use of liquid and gaseous hydrogen at Twin Rivers considered the most potentially serious hazard.  To provide more stable and less hazardous storage media, Twin Rivers completed construction of a liquid hydrogen storage area in 1998 to replace the existing gaseous storage system.  This system is located at the furthest point from the Fore River Bridge and has been inspected by the local fire department and complies with all safety and environmental standards.  The new storage area is protected by system monitoring, by fire suppression systems, procedureally through process safety procedures and physically.  For instance, fire walls, traffic ballards, and relief valves are all used but additional protection has been added and includes a sprinkler curtains, low pressure stops, magnetic and thermal trips, fusible links, automatic shutoffs and tank pressure and level indicators and alarms will all be utilized.  This area is also located at the point of use and will minimize the risk of a transmission line leak or failure that the current system is now subject.   The liquid hydrogen system contains a maximum of 9,750 pounds of liquid hydrogen.  Using the RMP Comp program the worse-case scenario for a hydrogen fire or vapor cloud explosion delineates an evacuation area of .1 miles of the storage area.  No residential or other sensitive h"

These waterbodies are impacted by significant recreational and commercial traffic.  Recreational traffic is limited to seasonal activities in the summer months.  The rivers surfaces lie 5-10 feet below grade (depending on tide) and would not likely be impacted due to hydrogen gaseous nature in ambient air.\r\n\r\nChemical Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies For Twin Rivers Technologies\r\n\r\nThe Twin Rivers chemical storage policy requires that only qualified individuals handle hazardous chemicals and that those chemicals be stored in bermed or protected areas with controlled and limited access.  \r\n\r\nTwin Rivers presently stores all its raw materials, process materials and finished products in one of two tank farms.  These tank farms are bermed systems are designed to hold up to 300% of the capacity of the largest storage tank.  Twin Rivers also receives raw material via its deep-water ocean terminal.  All other chemicals stored on site (mostly for wastewater treatment, maintenance and utilities) also are stored in either bermed or protected areas.  \r\n\r\nEmergency Response policies are outlined in Twin Rivers three response plans.  These plans are the Spill Prevention & Control Countermeasures Plan (\"SPCC\"), a Facility Response Plan (\"FRP\") and a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (\"SWP3\").  The SPCC/FRP outlines the actions to be taken in the event of a chemical spill from the plant, and the necessary emergency response and regulatory agencies to notify.  The SPPP defines the necessary procedures and actions to take to insure that no discharge is released through the NPDES outfall that are active during rainfall events.  The OPA 90 Facility Reponse Plan addresses oil spill prevention and response for all spills that can negatively impact groundwater aquifers, navigable waterways, estuaries or any other receiving waterbody.

Twin Rivers also contracts Clean Harbors as an OSRO for spill response funcitons.\r\n\r\nUnder the Twin Rivers PSM Program all new chemicals are subject to environmental health and safety review prior to being accepted into the facility. This process provides a review for the impacts that any chemical may have on the environmental controls systems, personnel health, and defines proper storage, personal protective equipment and chemical compatibility prior to receipt.\r\n\r\nRegulated Substance Handling\r\n\r\nNo chemical will exceed the reportable threshold for the Risk Management Plan, Twin Rivers has several substances that are regulated under various environmental health and safety regulations.  Under the 10,000 lb. threshold, liquid hydrogen is presently stored in a secured location that is remote to our process operations and has various control features that insure safe handling and operations.   All hydrogen deliveries are handled by the supply-company (Air Products) that uses only specially trained workers to insure safe operations.\r\n\r\nOther regulated substances stored on site include sodium hydroxide, sulfuric and hydrochloric acids, and etc.  Uses of these chemicals vary from wastewater treatment additives to laboratory reagents.

The remaining bordering area is made up of two waterways, the Fore and Town Rivers that limits access and isolates the area.\r\n\r\nWeather and Atmospheric Conditions\r\n\r\nSince the area is within the 100-year floodplain, the production area could be affected by flooding conditions and secondary effects of wind during those events.  It is TRT operational practice to shutdown operations, including those in the hydrogen system if severe weather threatens to breach the outer containment bulkhead of the facility.   In these cases, the Hydrogen System would be shutdown until the severe weather subsided.  Although unlikely, under severe flooding conditions the facility could be subject to scouring if a barge, vessel or other large floating object were to strike the hydrogen storage tank. Injury or impact to surrounding areas would be expected to be miminal since the severity of flooding to allow for the draft of a vessel with enough mass to break through perimeter barriers and impact the storage area would be significant and employees and or residential areas would be evacuated due to uninhabitable conditions. \r\n \r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nTwin Rivers has had no releases related to the liquid hydrogen system since its installation other than pressure relief events.  The system is designed to vent hydrogen gas created when the liqiud hydrogen is not being drawn into the hydrogenation process (usually due to shutdown) and the tank heats to a point that the liquid hydrogen becomes gaseous.  Events of this type are vent through one of two vent stacks located on the tank and are rare and involve very little product.\r\n\r\nAll reportable, lost time and worker related injuries are reported to OSHA and the appropriate state and local agencies as required.\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nSee: Chemical Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies For Twin Rivers Technologies (above)\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes To Improve Safety\r\n\r\nTwin Rivers continually looks at itsel"
