      "SummaryText": "The Silfab Solar facility, located in Fort Mill, SC, manufactures high quality photovoltaic (PV) Cells, commonly called Solar Cells, in their South Carolina facility. This is a process by which silicon wafer substrates are taken and coated with other raw material in the form of wet chemicals and gases, in precise amounts and sequences, to form specific layers to produce cells that convert sunlight directly into electricity. The exact recipes to make the products are considered proprietary and therefore, are not included in this description. However, the Solar Cells will be used to assemble high-quality Solar Panels that will be sold for residential and commercial use. \n\nBulk chemicals are delivered to the site via tanker trailers and are transferred to holding tanks via hoses and pumps located at an offloading pad specifically designed to hold the contents of one tanker tailer in case of accidental release.  The holding tanks are stored in a building that is designed to act as secondary containment in case of an accidental release from the holding tanks or lines contained within the building. The building is also equipped with sumps, that can pump material back to the onsite wastewater pretreatment system to be neutralized, before being discharged to the sanitary sewer or, it can hold the material until a third-party hazmat organization can collect it, and remove it, for off-site treatment and disposal. This information applies to hydrochloric acid (HCl) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4) that the facility will have on site which are designated as EHCs by the EPA and therefore, fall under the requirements, of the    Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) at 40 CFR 68.130.\n\nSpecialty gases are delivered to the site in isotainers or tube trailers, which are specifically designed to exceed DOT, CGA and NFPA requirements. The material is transported by specially trained, dedicated drivers, who are responsible for the staging and connection of the trailers and isotainers, to the deliv"

      "SummaryText": "ery system connection point. The pads where the specialty gases will be staged are equipped with toxic gas monitoring (TGMS) detection devices that will send a signal to the control panel to set off an alarm and stop the system if a leak is detected. These gas detectors are backed up by UVIRs detection devices that will also send a signal to the control panel to trigger an alarm. The specialty gases are delivered to the production tools via double contained. orbitally welding tubing, which have pressure detection system installed on the secondary side so that if a positive pressure is detected, the gas supply will automatically shut down. Once inside the building the specialty gas lines separate via a valve manifold box to the various tools. The valve manifold boxes are also equipped with leak detection devices that will shut off the supply, if a leak is detected. If any of the detection devices fail to operate properly, there are emergency shutoff devices at the sources to shut the supply of gas down.   This information applies to silane (SiH4) and anhydrous ammonia (NH3) that the facility will have on site, which are designated as EHCs by the EPA and therefore, fall under the requirements, of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) at 40 CFR 68.130.\n\nThe facility will be equipped with on-site spill prevention equipment and there will be trained on-site emergency response teams as well. The team members will be trained under OSHA, 29 CFR 1910.120, 40 hr. HAZWOPER requirements. SOPs will be written to address the type of spills that may occur, the proper way to address them and who to contact, if the spill is beyond the emergency responders' capabilities.  The emergency responders' primary duties are to stay safe, identify the spill, and mitigate it, if safe to do so, then develop a cleanup action plan. The facility also falls under the PSM program requirements as outlined under 29 CFR 1910.119. Therefore, storage tanks, lines, pumps, valves etc., are inspected daily,"

      "SummaryText": "to ensure the integrity of the equipment and to identify issues before they become major problems.   \n\nBecause the Silfab Solar SC site is a new facility, it has no record of any accidents occurring in the last 5 years. \n\nDue to the potential quantities of HCl, H2SO4, SiH4 and NH3 on site, the Silfab Solar SC facility has developed a Facility Emergency Action Plan (FEAP) in accordance with EPCRA Section 302(c) requirements.  The FEAP will be reviewed with the York County Department of Emergency Managment, LEPC and the County and local fire departments for comments and when finalized, the FEAP will be distributed to those agencies as well as the SERC and the Fort Mill Schools Superintendent. The Silfab Solar SC FEAP is based on the principles and concepts established under the National Incident Management System (NIMS) and establishes the guidelines and overall policies and procedures related to emergency situations, while incorporating the Incident Command System (ICS), to identify departments or individuals responsible for emergency planning, preparedness, response and recovery as well as, business continuity and business recovery planning. This same system has been adopted by the York County Department of Emergency Managment and is incorporated into the County's Emergency Operation Plan. This was done intentionally, to make it easier for the County to provide emergency services to the Silfab Solar SC facility, if ever needed, in an emergency situation. The Silfab FEAP identifies the steps to take if a major chemical leak were to occur and who to contact in that event, including the neighboring businesses (Motion and Ross) as well as the Fort Mill Schools Superintendent and the York County Department of Emergency Management. The Silfab facility will have on-site emergency response teams, including a HAZMAT response team that will receive 40 hrs of training on Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER)   Hazardous Waste Management Training, and ad"

These same representatives are welcome to participate in the annual drills and assist with the critiquing and review of the drill and suggestions for improvement. The suggestions will be reviewed by the group and if viable will be taken as an action item to incorporated into the FEAP. The action items will be reviewed at the quarterly meeting to track progress and completion."
