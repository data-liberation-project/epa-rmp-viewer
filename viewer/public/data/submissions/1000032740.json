Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nFlexitank, Inc. is a privately held, logistics company located in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes related to bulk chemical transportation and storage in a safe and responsible manner. Flexitank complies with applicable federal, state and local regulations. All Flexitank employees are informed of hazards in the workplace and are trained accordingly. Flexitank has procedures in place in the facility, in the unlikely event that hazardous substance releases were to occur, which activates emergency notification and response procedures to ensure the safety of our employees, the community, the environment and property.\n\n\n\n2. Facility and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nFlexitank is an NVOCC (OTI) that specializes in logistics management. We occasionally store ISO-tanks containing chemical products for our customers as an \"added value\" service in our Depot Facilities located on the Zona Portuaria in San Juan.  \n\nFlexitank Depot receives the bulk liquid cargo by the following modes of transportation: tank trucks, ISO tank containers and flexi-bags (no hazardous products only). The received cargo is stored on-site according to customer-specified requirements, and it is subsequently dispatch on the same transportation modes as originally received.
