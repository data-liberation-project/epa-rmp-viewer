All processes that occur have to do with changes of state between liquid and vapor phases and their impact on heat transfer.\n\n\n\nThis refrigeration plant has a three temperature system for greater operating efficiency, the 1st temperature being +15?F, also referred to as high temperature, for general refrigeration, the 2nd temperature being 28?F, called low temperature, for the storage freezers and the 3rd temperature being -45?F, also called low temperature, for the low temperature Belt Freezer.  The High Temperature System, +15 system includes all equipment fed from the High Temperature Accumulator (V-15) which includes the ten Cooler Evaporators, along with the plate and frame heat exchanger.  The 28?F Low Temperature Systems is fed from the Low Temperature Accumulator (V-14).  This vessel provides for the eight Freezer Evaporators.  The 45?F Low Temperature Systems is fed from the Low temperature Accumulator (V-21).  This vessel provides for the two Belt Freezer Evaporators.  \n\n\n\nTo continue this description we will start at the screw compressors, there are seven total, three compressors are Low Stage or Boosters and four are High Stage.  \n\n\n\nThe three Low Stage Compressors (LS-1 - LS-3) draw low pressure gas (LSS) Low Stage Suction from either V-14 or V-21 Low Temperature Accumulators into the compressor where it is compressed by rotating screws.  This produces a medium pressure; medium temperature vapor designated Booster Discharge (BD), which flows to V-15, the High Temperature Accumulator for cooling.  \n\n\n\nThe"

This hot pressure gas which is also referred to High Stage Discharge or Hot Gas (HSD, HG) travels to the three Evaporative Condensers.  \n\n\n\nThe Evaporative Condensers, (EC-1 thru EC-3) are where all the heat picked up by the ammonia in the system is removed by the evaporation of water.  Once the heat is removed the ammonia vapor condensed inside the condenser coils becoming a high pressure liquid called Condensate Drain (CD), later referred to as HPL.  This liquid then flows by gravity to the Thermosyphon Vessel (V-17). \n\n\n\nThe Thermosyphon Vessel (V-17) serves two purposes; first it serves as a storage vessel for the high pressure liquid ammonia, at +95?F/181 psig of pressure.  But its' primary function is to provide liquid ammonia for the cooling of the compressors.  The compressors are cooled by circulating liquid ammonia Thermosyphon Supply (TSS) down to the compressor oil coolers/heat exchangers, where it flashes/boils off, cooling the oil that has absorbed the heat of compressing the ammonia gas.  This HP ammonia vapor, designated Thermosyphon Return (TSR), from the oil coolers then circulates by natural convection back up to the Vessel and the process is repeated.  CD/ammonia stored in the Thermosyphon Vessel also flows through one line to the Vertical Receiver (V-16), which is discussed shortly.  V-17 is connected by an equalization line to the evaporative condensers to balance, allowing liquid to freely flow down from them to the vessel.\n\n\n\nV-16, the Vertical Receiver stores CD from the Thermosyphon Vessel.  The Vertical Receiver I the main storage site for liquid ammonia used in the plant.  Liquid ammonia is stored at +95?F/181 psig of pressure and is designated as High pressure Liquid (HPL).  From this vessel the ammonia is transferred to the High Temperature Accumulator (V-15) for distribution throughout the system."

This prevents damage to the High Stage Compressors.  The vessel is also used as storage for the liquid ammonia at the temperature and pressure above for circulation out to the cooler evaporators.  This circulation is accomplished by two Recirculator Pumps, RP-3 and RP-4.  An additional pump RP-5 is used to transfer liquid out to the compressors and the HSS travels back to the High Stage Compressors for recompression.

PSM/RMP\n\nFremont Factory-Ammonia Emergency Response Plan\n\n\n\nProcedure:\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonnel Roles\n\nIn the event of a chemical release the Muskegon County Hazmat Team will be dispatched to assess, mitigate and clean up the release.  Their incident command system will be put into place.  Should additional resources be needed Site Security will call 911 for assistance from local fire departments and/or medical services.    \n\n\n\nRecognition and Prevention\n\nEmployees are trained to recognize a chemical emergency during their job orientation and hazard communication training.  Employees and supervisors are instructed to call Site Security if a release cannot be contained without potential exposure.  Between Gerber employees and Site Security, chemical process systems and chemical storage are monitored around the clock, seven days a week (24/7).  Preventative maintenance is performed on the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.  The site has a Risk Management Plan and Process Safety Management Plan for the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.  \n\n\n\nSafe distances and places of refuge\n\nIn the event of a chemical release inside a building, which has the potential to create an unsafe atmosphere, the refrigeration building will be evacuated.  In the event that the chemical release would not pose an inhalation hazard, the area of the spill and an appropriate buffer zone will be evacuated until the spill can be cleaned up.  Should a site wide chemical emergency occur, the maintenance departments will shut down air handling systems, as needed.  In the event of an exterior exposure the employees will be directed to the unexposed side of the building for sheltering in place, or a full evacuation if the exposure is interior.  \n\nAir monitoring, wind direction and release rates shall determine safe distances and locations.\n\n\n\nSite security and control\n\nThe Fremont Campus is monitored 24/7 by a contracted security firm.
