At the\n\nfacility, railcars are stored on the property until marketing can find a suitable market for the liquids.\n\nPropane (odorized) is the only substance regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP)\n\nthat is present at the Bennington Branch facility in amounts above threshold quantity.

However, they do operate under the requirements of\n\nProgram Level 2 in the RMP regulations. Analysis of the potential hazards of the process, training of\n\nemployees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents since\n\noperations began. Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid\n\npotential accidental chemical releases.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nNo incident resulting in onsite injuries, death or property damage or offsite impacts from a propane\n\nrelease has occurred at the Bennington Branch Facility within the last five years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe facility has developed an emergency response plan, which will be coordinated with local\n\nemergency response groups such as the Bennington Fire Department. Also involved in emergency\n\nresponse for the facility would be the County Regional Planning Commission. The facility operator is\n\nresponsible for coordinating the notifications required to initiate an emergency response.
