We promote health, safety, and the environment through programs of awareness, compliance, prevention and protection.  These programs include a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\nA. Description of our facility and the use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n\nB. Overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n\nC. Five-year accident history for accidental releases\n\nD. Overview of our emergency response program\n\nE. Overview of planned changes to improve safety\n\nF. Supplemental information regarding our RMP data elements\n\n\n\nThis RMP is being submitted to 1) establish an RMP for the Race Fuels Blend unit alone - it was previously included in the Marcus Hook refinery RMP, and 2) to add the inventory represented by a new isopentane storage tank which is being installed in the unit and which needs to be included in the unit RMP program.\n\n\n\nA. STATIONARY SOURCEAND REGULATEDSUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Sunoco Race Fuels Blend unit is located on a portion of the Sunoco's Marcus Hook refinery which has been closed.  The unit is located in Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania.  The Race Fuels Blend unit blends various hydrocarbons to produce motor fuels with the necessary octane levels and other properties specified by various racing car associations.  In our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a major accidental release:\n\n\n\nToxics\n\n\n\nThe Race Fuels Blend unit does not use, store, or handle any toxic materials covered by the RMP regulation.\n\n"

      "SummaryText": "\n\nFlammables\n\n\n\nThe Race Fuels Blend unit has a several flammable materials which exceed the threshold quantities in the RMP regulation, including isopentane and butane.  Additionally, a number of racing fuels are stored onsite and there are small containers (i.e., 55 gallon drums) of flammable materials stored onsite.  Based on the PSM coverage of the Race Fuels Blend unit, the unit has a Program 3 RMP.  \n\n\n\nB. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe centerpiece of the accidental release prevention program is the unit Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  The fourteen   (14) elements of PSM constitute the framework by which process safety and accident prevention are managed in the unit.  These fourteen (14) individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases. Our company and our employees are committed to the standards required by these management systems.  In addition to the above prevention program elements, we also have specific prevention measures that are employed as part of our operating procedures and engineering and administrative controls to help contain/control a release, quickly detect a release, and reduce the consequences of a release.  These measures are briefly summarized as follows:\n\n\n\nGeneral Risk Reduction and Safety Measures:\n\n\n\n?    Engineering and construction in accordance with recognized Industry and company standards.\n\n?    Equipment properly designed with protection from overpressure (pressure safety relief valves, etc.).\n\n?    Updated technical drawings, piping & instrument diagrams and process flow diagrams.\n\n?    Operating systems monitored and controlled 24 hrs a day by trained operators.\n\n?    Computerized monitoring and control of process operation.\n\n?    Automatic and manual shutdown devices for critical systems.\n\n?    Scheduled inspection and testing of process equipment.\n\n?    Limited facility access and 24 hr security force.\n\n?    Radio communication system.\n\n?    Closed circuit television survei"

FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no qualifying accidents at the Race Fuels Blend unit in the past five years. \n\n\n\nD. EMERGENCY RESPONSE ROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Facility maintains compliance with local, state and federal regulations including OSHA CFR 1910.120, Oil Pollution Act of 1990, and SARA Title III.  Our emergency response program is reviewed and updated on an annual basis, or more often if required.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for protecting employees, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  The program includes written procedures that outline the act"

Guidance on proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures.\n\n?    Procedures for post incident cleanup and decontamination.\n\n\n\nAn important part of the plant emergency organization is the Emergency Response Team (ERT). The ERT is made up of full-time emergency response employees, as well as employee volunteers.  The ERT provides the personnel resources for a rapid and effective emergency response.  ERT members train and drill on a monthly basis.  Training and drill sessions include instruction and hands-on practice in the use of fire extinguishers, advanced interior and exterior firefighting techniques, hazardous  material response, confined  space and high angle rescue, NS emergency medical response.  The Emergency Response Plan and its implementation follow the NIMS Incident Command System.\n\n\n\nThe facility also maintains its own dedicated emergency response equipment.  This equipment includes portable fire extinguishers, breathing apparatus, encapsulated chemical protective suits, rescue and medical equipment, spill response boats and firefighting apparatus capable of delivering high volumes of water and firefighting foam.  An inspection, testing and preventive maintenance program is in place for emergency response equipment"
