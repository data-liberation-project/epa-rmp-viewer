We promote health, safety, and the environment through programs of awareness, compliance, prevention and protection.  These programs include a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\r\n\r\nA. Description of our facility and the use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP rule\r\nB. Overview of our accidental release prevention programs\r\nC. Five-year accident history for accidental releases\r\nD. Overview of our emergency response program\r\nE. Overview of planned changes to improve safety\r\nF. Supplemental information regarding our RMP data elements\r\n\r\nThis RMP is being submitted to 1) establish an RMP for the Race Fuels Blend unit alone - it was previously included in the Marcus Hook refinery RMP, and 2) to add the inventory represented by a new isopentane storage tank which is being installed in the unit and which needs to be included in the unit RMP program.\r\n\r\nA. STATIONARY SOURCEAND REGULATEDSUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Sunoco Race Fuels Blend unit is located on a portion of the Sunoco's Marcus Hook refinery which has been closed.  The unit is located in Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania.  The Race Fuels Blend unit blends various hydrocarbons to produce motor fuels with the necessary octane levels and other properties specified by various racing car associations.  In our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a major accidental release:\r\n\r\nToxics\r\n\r\nThe Race Fuels Blend unit does not use, store, or handle any toxic materials covered by the RMP regulation."

PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nWe are continually striving to make the Marcus Hook Race Fuels Blend unit a safe workplace for our employees, our neighbors and our community.  Our focus is safe, reliable, and environmentally sound operations, and proactive management of these issues.  A PHA has been performed for the unit, including the new isopentane storage tank and the recommendations for that PHA are being resolved.  \r\n\r\nF.

Additionally, a number of racing fuels are stored onsite and there are small containers (i.e., 55 gallon drums) of flammable materials stored onsite.  Based on the PSM coverage of the Race Fuels Blend unit, the unit has a Program 3 RMP.  \r\n\r\nB. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe centerpiece of the accidental release prevention program is the unit Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  The fourteen   (14) elements of PSM constitute the framework by which process safety and accident prevention are managed in the unit.  These fourteen (14) individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases. Our company and our employees are committed to the standards required by these management systems.  In addition to the above prevention program elements, we also have specific prevention measures that are employed as part of our operating procedures and engineering and administrative controls to help contain/control a release, quickly detect a release, and reduce the consequences of a release.  These measures are briefly summarized as follows:\r\n\r\nGeneral Risk Reduction and Safety Measures:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tEngineering and construction in accordance with recognized Industry and company standards.\r\n\u00bf\tEquipment properly designed with protection from overpressure (pressure safety relief valves, etc.).\r\n\u00bf\tUpdated technical drawings, piping & instrument diagrams and process flow diagrams.\r\n\u00bf\tOperating systems monitored and controlled 24 hrs a day by trained operators.\r\n\u00bf\tComputerized monitoring and control of process operation.\r\n\u00bf\tAutomatic and manual shutdown devices for critical systems.\r\n\u00bf\tScheduled inspection and testing of process equipment.\r\n\u00bf\tLimited facility access and 24 hr security force.\r\n\u00bf\tRadio communication system.\r\n\u00bf\tClosed circuit television survei"

The ERT is made up of full-time emergency response employees, as well as employee volunteers.  The ERT provides the personnel resources for a rapid and effective emergency response.  ERT members train and drill on a monthly basis.  Training and drill sessions include instruction and hands-on practice in the use of fire extinguishers, advanced interior and exterior firefighting techniques, hazardous  material response, confined  space and high angle rescue, NS emergency medical response.  The Emergency Response Plan and its implementation follow the NIMS Incident Command System.\r\n\r\nThe facility also maintains its own dedicated emergency response equipment.  This equipment includes portable fire extinguishers, breathing apparatus, encapsulated chemical protective suits, rescue and medical equipment, spill response boats and firefighting apparatus capable of delivering high volumes of water and firefighting foam.  An inspection, testing and preventive maintenance program is in place for emergency response equipment"
