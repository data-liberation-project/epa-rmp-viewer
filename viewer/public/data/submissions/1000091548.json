      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nEagleclaw Midstream Ventures, LLC ( Eagleclaw) owns and operates a natural gas processing facility, the Pecos Bend Gas Processing Plant in Pecos County, Texas. The plant is designed to process natural gas and recover liquid product from natural gas by physical separation and cryogenic means. Petroleum condensates are recovered from the inlet pipeline gas in this process for off-site sales.\n\n\n\nEagleclaw has commitment to workers and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel, quality assurance, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Pecos Bend Gas Processing Plant is located near Pecos, Texas and operates a variety of processes to produce the following petroleum products: \n\n\n\n1. Residue Gas\n\n2. Natural Gas Liquids\n\n3. Natural Gas Condensate\n\n\n\nThese substances can contain the following components:\n\n\n\na. Methane\n\nb. Ethane\n\nc. Propane\n\nd. Butane\n\ne. Isobutane\n\nf. Pentane\n\ng. Isopentane\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \n\n\n\nA. WORST CASE SCENARIOS\n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario associated with a release of flammable substance in Program Level 1 processes at the Pecos Bend Gas Processing Plant is a Vapor Cloud Explosion involving the inventory of the largest surge tank containing 90,000 gallons (455,800 lbs). The maximum distance to the 1-psi overpressure endpoint for this worst case scenario is 0.45 mile. No receptors have been identified within the endpoint radius.\n\n\n\nB. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nPecos Bend Gas Processing Plant "

      "SummaryText": "has not had a RMP defined accident during the past five years.\n\n\n\nC. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe plant maintains a written emergency action plan, which is in place to help protect employees and public safety as well as the environment. The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including: proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs.\n\n\n\nEmployees receive training in the procedures to be followed by employees who remain to operate critical plant operations before they evacuate. Eagleclaw has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate emergency response organizations (Fire Department, Police, Sheriff's Office, or similar). This interface provides the means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition, Caprock conducts periodic emergency drills and annual refresher training for plant personnel.\n\n"
