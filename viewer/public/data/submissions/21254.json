      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nJim Hronis & Sons utilizes anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant in their cold \nstorage facility near Delano, California.  As it is Jim Hronis & Sons' policy to \ncomply with all applicable governmental regulations, the cold storage facility was \ndesigned and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Building and Uniform \nMechanical Codes.  \n\nPersonnel from Jim Hronis & Sons monitor the daily operation of the refrigeration \nsystem.  All service, maintenance, and repairs to the ammonia refrigeration \nsystem are contracted to a qualified licensed refrigeration contractor specializing \nin ammonia refrigeration.  Utilizing an experienced qualified contractor to perform \nroutine service, maintenance, and repairs ensures that the equipment is in \nexcellent operating condition. \n\nWhile it is Jim Hronis & Sons' objective to be a responsible citizen of the \ncommunity in all of its business activities, the limited staff at the cold storage \nfacility precludes emergency response operations.  As such, an emergency \naction plan has been prepared for Jim Hronis & Sons and a chain of command to \nrespond to emergencies has been established.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \n\nJim Hronis & Sons owns and operates a cold storage facility located at 32555 \nCecil Avenue.  Delano is the closest city to the Jim Hronis & Sons cold storage \nfacility.  The rural plant was originally constructed during 1980 utilizing all new \nequipment at the time of construction.  Several expansions to the refrigeration \nsystem have been completed with the latest expansion scheduled for completion \nin late April of 2000.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as the refrigerant that provides process cooling for \nthe Jim Hronis & Sons cold storage facility.  After the April 2000 expansion is \ncompleted, the refrigeration system will consist of a suction accumulator with a \nliquid transfer system, five compress"

Each of the pre-cooling rooms and cold storage \nrooms has at least one accumulator and several flooded evaporators.  \n\nDuring normal operation, the anhydrous ammonia is distributed throughout the \nrefrigeration system.  However, during major maintenance activities, the entire \nrefrigeration system can be \"pumped down\" to evacuate the ammonia from the \nsystem and store it in the high pressure receiver.  The maximum quantity of \nammonia that can be stored in the outdoor high pressure receiver is 19,428 \npounds. \n\nFor purposes of the offsite consequence analyses, the RMP regulations define \nthe toxic endpoint for anhydrous ammonia as 0.14 mg/l (200 ppm).  This \nconcentration has been established by the American Industrial Hygiene \nAssociation as the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  \n\nERPG-2 is the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that \nnearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or \ndeveloping irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could \nimpair an individual's ability to take protective action.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\nOffsite consequence analyses are used as tools to assist in emergency response \nplanning.  The RMP regulations require the owner or operator of a stationary \nsource to analyze the offsite impacts due to an accidental release of a regulated \nsubstance.  The offsite consequence analysis for a Program 3 process must \nanalyze the worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario.  \nSince Jim Hronis & Sons' ammonia-based refrigeration system is considered a \nProgram 3 process, both release scenarios were evaluated in the offsite \nconsequence analysis.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis must include an estimate of the residential \npopulation within an area"

The \ncircle also defines the area in which potential environmental receptors must be \nidentified.\n\nThe worst case release is defined by the U.S. EPA as the total release of the \ncontents of the single largest vessel or pipe within 10 minutes.  For liquefied \ngases stored under pressure, the entire contents of the vessel or pipe are \nassumed to be released as a vapor.  A total vapor release is highly unlikely.  \nHowever, this standardized worst case scenario was developed for emergency \nresponse agencies to use for planning purposes.\n\nAn alternative release scenario is a release that is more likely to occur than the \nworst-case release scenario.  For Jim Hronis & Sons, the alternative release \nscenario was selected based on the results of the Process Hazard Analysis \n(PHA) for the ammonia-based refrigeration system.  A credible release event with \na high discharge rate would potentially have the greatest offsite impact.  A leak \nfrom a valve packing was identified in the PHAs as having a medium probability \nof occurrence with a discharge rate high enough to cause an offsite impact, and \ntherefore, was chosen as the alternative release scenario.\n\nJim Hronis & Sons has analyzed the offsite consequences of the worst-case and \nalternative release scenarios.  For the worst-case release scenario, the release \nof 19,428 lbs. of ammonia over a 10 minute period outside of the engine room, \nthe plume would travel 1.7 miles at concentrations at or above the endpoint.  \nUsing 1990 Census data, the population potentially affected within the worst-\ncase release scenario circle is 81 persons.  Due to the rural location of this \nfacility, the population potentially affected by this worst case release is \nsubstantially overstated by the 1990 Census data.  The public receptor"

The PSM program includes the following chemical-\nspecific prevention steps:\n\n?
