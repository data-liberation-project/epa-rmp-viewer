THE FACILITY POLICY\n\n          THE OWNERS,MANAGEMENT,AND EMPLOYEES OF NUWAY COOPERATIVE ARE\n      COMMITED TO THE PREVENTION  OF ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS\n       AMMONIA. IF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED\n       TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE COMPANY,OR OTHER AUTHORITIES,TO MITIGATE\n       ANY RELEASE,AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE TO PEOPLE AND THE\n       ENVIRONMENT.\n\n       2. FACILITY INFORMATION\n\n           THE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THE FACILITY IS THE STORAGE AND BLENDING OF\n        FERTILIZERS FOR SALE TO FARMERS.\n\n            ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECEIVED,STORED AND DISTRIBUTED FOR DIRECT\n        APPLICATION. ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS USED FOR CROP PRODUCTION NUTRIENTS.\n\n            THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY OF AMMONIA STORED WOULD BE 204,000 POUNDS.\n        IN OUR 18,000 GALLON STORAGE TANK. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY HANDLED WOULD\n        BE THE UNLOADING OF A TRUCK HOLDING 40,000 POUNDS.\n\n        3. THE WORST CASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\n\n             A: THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA WOULD BE \n         THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF A STORAGE TANKRELEASED AS A GAS\n          OVER TEN MINUTES. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 80,000 POUNDS\n          WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE STORAGE TANK AT 85 PERCENT CAPACITY\n          AS LIMITED BY DESIGNS STANDARDS. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION\n          TO 200 PPM) IS .94 MILES.\n\n          B. THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA BASED ON THE\n          DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT IS .78 MILES.\n\n        4. THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM.\n\n             THE FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF \"SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR \n        THE STORAGE AND HANDLING"
