The scenario consists of a vapor cloud explosion involving 78,494 pounds of a flammable mixture contained in a full 18,000-gallon NGL Tank. The WCS results in the largest impacted area with a 0.3-mile radius.\r\n\r\nThe site is located near residences, Windsor Guardian Self Storage (commercial), and the recreational area Diamond Valley Community Park. The WCS has an offsite endpoint and would affect several offsite nearby public receptors.  Pioneer has controls to prevent such a release and to manage consequences. Mitigation measures include relief valves, check valves, grounding equipment, and rupture disks.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for the flammable substances at the Vaporcatchers at the Stromberger 22-E Pad is assumed to be a vapor cloud explosion resulting from the release of 10,602 pounds of NGLs from a pipe between a Vaporcatcher skid and the NGL tank. The release would occur from a break in the 1-inch pipeline that would involve 189 pounds per minute being released for 60 minutes before the leak was stopped. The ARS would impact a radius of 0.2 miles, which includes an offsite endpoint and a nearby public receptor. \r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Vaporcatchers at the Stromberger 22-E Pad are not covered by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Program since it can be operated remotely and Pioneer does not keep employees at its location. This results in the process being Program Level 2. The following sections detail how Pioneer complies with the Program 2 requirements for accident prevention. \r\n\r\nA. Process Safety Information/Process Controls\r\n\r\nPioneer keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.

Sufficient information to assure good engineering practices\r\n\r\nChemical specific information, including hazard and emergency response/exposure considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDS).  For specific areas within the process, Pioneer has documented safety-related limits for specific parameters such as temperatures, level and composition in the operator's procedures manual.  The company maintains the overall process within these limits by using remote controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel and protective instrument systems such as automated shutdown systems. \r\n\r\nThe facility also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of the equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressures, temperature and electrical ratings.  This information, in combination with procedures and equipment operating history, provides a basis for inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed changes to safety features to ensure these are not compromised. \r\n\r\n B. Hazard Review\r\n\r\nThe Vaporcatchers at the Stromberger 22-E Pad identify and control hazards associated with the RMP covered scenario.  This program systematically examines and explores for potential hazards, then establishes controls to put in place to manage the potential hazards.  The hazard review is conducted using checklists by Pioneer's employees and/or consultants who have operation, maintenance, engineering, and safety experience.  This review evaluates and makes recommendations to management of the potential hazards identified.  The findings are forwarded to Pioneer for review.  The approved mitigation opti"

The Vaporcatcher is designed to process tank vapors and recover liquid products from vapors by physical separation and cryogenic means.  The Vaporcatcher is considered a small natural gas processing plant for regulatory purposes. NGLs recovered from this process are marketed for off-site sales.\r\n\r\nPioneer has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the company's efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel, quality assurance, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the process. Pioneer's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within their capabilities, and notify the necessary outside agencies. \r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nThe Vaporcatchers at the Stromberger 22-E Pad are located approximately 1.6 miles west of Windsor, Colorado. From the intersection of County Road 68 (aka Highway 392) and County Road 23, drive 0.5 miles south on County Road 23 and then drive 0.75 miles west to reach the site.

There have been no accidental releases from a covered process that resulted in death, injury or significant property damage on site, or known off-site death, injury, evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage. \r\n \r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\n\r\nThe Vaporcatchers at the Stromberger 22-E Pad site is a Non-Responding Facility as per 48 CFR 68.90(b). The company maintains written emergency procedures, which are in place to help protect employees and public safety as well as the environment.  These procedures identify steps to be taken in case of an accidental release. However, the facility is an unmanned location and company personnel are not trained to be first responders to large fires and should a release occur from one of the vessels the facility would rely on the local fire department to respond.  \r\n\r\nEmployees receive training in the procedures to be followed when certain employees must remain to operate critical plant operations before they evacuate.  The Vaporcatchers at the Stromberger 22-E Pad site has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate emergency response organizations (Fire Department, Police and Sheriff's Office).  This interface provides the means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\r\n\r\nRMP MANAGEMENT\r\n\r\nPioneer has assigned responsibility for the risk management program to the Vice President of Business Development and maintains a management system to oversee program elements.\r\n \r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY \r\n\r\nThere are currently no planned changes to improve safety.

Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented and investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years. \r\n\r\nH. Compliance Audits\r\n\r\nAt least every three years a Compliance Audit addressing OSHA, EPA, RMP and Good Engineering Practices are conducted by employees and management of the Stromberger 22-E Pad.  This audit team will develop findings that are forwarded to management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are completed.  Final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.  \r\n\r\nI. Release Containment/Controls/Mitigation\r\n\r\nThe following controls and equipment are in place to help prevent and mitigate a release.\r\n\r\n1. Process relief valves and check valves \r\n2. Automated and manual shutoffs to permit isolation of the process\r\n3. Automated process shutdown system to remotely shut down equipment to their fail-safe position\r\n4. Curbing or diking to contain liquids releases\r\n5. Grounding equipment\r\n6. Rupture Disks"

The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nPioneer will periodically update and revalidate the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews will be conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the regulated process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates will be documented and retained.\r\n\r\nC. Operating Procedures\r\n\r\nPioneer maintains written Operating Procedures of the covered process that address primary operations mandated by OSHA, EPA, Good Engineering Practice and manufacturers.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  Procedures will be periodically reviewed and annually certified as current accurate by management.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate revising them as necessary by employee suggestion, compliance audit, hazard review, and Good Engineering practice.\r\n\r\nCovered process Operating Procedures are readily available to operators for the process unit and to other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job task and ensure the covered process is operating within its safe limits.\r\n\r\nD.  Training\r\n\r\nThe Vaporcatchers at the Stromberger 22-E Pad have implemented a comprehensive training program for employees involved in operating the covered process.  New employees receive basic training in process operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn specific duties and tasks.  A performance review and written test or hands on observation specific to the plant operations is administered and must be successfully completed during this training period.  After the operator demonstrates adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner"
