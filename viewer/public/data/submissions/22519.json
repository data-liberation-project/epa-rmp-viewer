This Risk Management Plan summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to the community of hazardous chemical releases. The Plan summary is organized to correspond with specific EPA RMP definitions and requirements, including:\n\n     Introduction;\n\n     ATOFINA policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\n\n     Facility identification and regulated substances in covered processes;\n\n     Hazard Assessment;\n\n     Prevention Program;\n\n     Five-Year Accident History;\n\n     Emergency Response Plan; and\n\n     Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nATOFINA Policies for Health, Environment, and Safety\n\nRisk management and safety have been important concerns at ATOFINA for many years; this RMP formalizes and documents these activities. ATOFINA is committed to conducting its operations in a safe, responsible manner and to reducing risks to health and the environment.\n\nThis commitment to health, environment, and safety (HES) starts with the CEO. Senior management routinely dedicates time to a review of HES matters, including safety. This emphasis on safety is carried through to the facility level, where the Plant Manager and the Safety Committee regularly review safety performance, take corrective actions, and strive for continuous improvement. The success of ATOFINA Chemical's HES programs is also reflected by a strong commitment to safety by employees and contractors.\n\nATOFINA Chemical's HES programs include policies, procedures, standards, and guidance materials designed to fulfill ATOFINA's commitment to health, environment, and safety.

HF is received as a liquid in pressurized rail cars and unloaded into storage tanks. Administrative controls limit the HF quantity in this vessel and this quantity was assumed to be released over 10 minutes in the worst-case scenario. Engineering controls to enforce the administrative control include a high-level alarm (which sounds at 80% level).\n\nIt should be noted that regulatory agencies and ATOFINA consider the worst-case scenario to be an extremely unlikely event.

In addition, in the unlikely event that a release occurs, ATOFINA has an array of mitigation measures to reduce any potential impacts. Passive mitigation systems include diking to limit the spread of HF and, consequently, the release impact. The diking area is filled with limestone to partially neutralize spilled HF.\n\nActive mitigation systems cannot be considered in modeling worst-case scenario impacts, but the significant investment that ATOFINA has made in active mitigation measures should effectively reduce the risk associated with an RMP incident. These include:\n\n \n  An HF vapor suppression system (deluge system), which can be supplemented by stationary and portable fire monitors, to knock down HF vapor with water sprays.\n\n  HF could be pumped from a damaged tank into another storage tank to reduce the amount potentially released.\n\n  Diking system is provided with a drain to a trench with a pumping system that can be manually activated to contain and collect any spilled HF.  The dike is filled with limestone which serves to neutralize the spilled HF.\n\n  HF tanks are under continuous observation to detect any problems, including operator visual inspections (4 to 6 times a day), video camera surveillance, and both local and control room indicators for pressure and tank level/alarm.\n\n  HF field sensors are located at the HF feed pumps and the HF rundown tank to provide early warning of any release.\n\n  All operators are trained to respond to emergencies through the facility HAZWOPER Training Program.\n\nHazard Assessment - Alternative Release Scenario\n\nOne alternative scenario for each regulated toxic substance was also modeled in the hazard assessment. A description of each of these scenarios follows. The Alternative Release Scenario for HF is failure of an unloading line from a rail car. The Alte"

This Risk Management Plan includes information on mitigation and prevention measures implemented by ATOFINA to reduce the risk of these types of events.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios: Mitigation Measures\n\nWhile the Alternative Release Scenarios are, by definition, more likely than the Worst-Case Scenario, they are still very unlikely given the facility's prevention program.

Examples of mitigation measures that would lessen the impacts of the Alternative Release Scenarios are listed below.\n\nHF\n\n     HF unloading is conducted intermittenly, during daylight hours only, and under strict supervision. In the event of a leak, the nitrogen system and HF unloading pumps can be quickly shut down.\n\n     If a release should occur, the loading rack has an HF vapor suppression system, which can be supplemented by stationary and portable fire monitors.\n\n     The loading rack is equipped with both video cameras and an HF field sensor to provide early warning of any release.\n\nChloroform\n\n     The Chloroform Storage Area is diked to contain any accidental release of liquid chloroform.\n\n     Redundant tanks and pumps exist so that the material from one tank may be transferred to the other if necessary.\n\nHCl >37% solution\n\n     There are redundant storage tanks and pumps so that if one tank reaches a high level the other tank can be utilized.  If one pump fails, the tank can be emptied with the spare pump.\n\n     If the tank should overfill, the area is contained.  Any spill would flow to the wastewater system where the acid would be neutralized and disposed.\n\nChemi"

These measures include:\n\n     HF storage tanks are pressure vessels which are designed and constructed in accordance with American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) pressure vessel standards using industry-standard materials of construction.\n\n     As part of the Mechanical Integrity program, pressure vessels and atmospheric storage tanks are inspected and tested according to the American Petroleum Institute Standard 510 and Standard 653, respectively.\n\n     The risk of over-filling is addressed by the high-level alarms.\n\n     The risk of over-pressure is addressed by a system of rupture disks and pressure relief valves, and the unloading pump is designed so that it cannot create a pressure higher than the relief valve setting.\n\n     All systems are tested on a routine basis to ensure reliability.\n\n     Tanks are vented to a common line which helps prevent unequal pressures and over-pressure.\n\n     Tanks are located in areas with no overhead construction or equipment that could fall and impact a tank.\n\n     Access to the facility is restricted through security barriers and trained security personnel, thereby minimizing the risk to the tanks of vehicular damage or sabotage.\n\n     No flammable materials are allowed near the HF tanks, construction throughout the facility is non-combustible, and fire hazards are strictly controlled.\n\nHF\n\nThe alternative release scenario selected for HF is the full failure of the rail car flexible liquid line connection during unloading. HF rail cars are unloaded using nitrogen pressure applied to the rail car's vapor space while the material is pumped to the storage vessels. This is an unlikely scenario, and the most likely cause of such a failure would be for the rail car to be pulled away while the loading line is still connected. Prevention steps for this scenario include:\n\n     Rail sto"

ATOFINA realizes that the community may also be interested in smaller releases or regulated chemicals that do not meet EPA criteria for the Five-Year Accident History. We have been diligent in reporting releases of hazardous materials and internally investigate and correct the causes of such releases.\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nA written emergency response plan is maintained at the facility. The plan was developed in cooperation with civil authorities and was coordinated with the community emergency response plan.\n\nThe emergency response plan includes procedures for notifying civil authorities and the public in the event of an incident. The plan also includes documentation of proper first-aid and medical treatment necessary to treat accidental human exposures; procedures for the use of emergency response equipment and for its inspection and testing; a description of the training program for all employees in relevant emergency response procedures; and procedures for review and update, as appropriate, of the emergency response plan to reflect changes at the facility, and to ensure that employees are informed of these changes.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nMost of ATOFINA Chemical's Wichita facility processes are covered by the OSHA PSM rule and therefore stringent safety programs have been in place for years.  Prevention measures such as Management of Change (MOC) and Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) are utilized at this facility even for processes not covered under PSM or RMP.  \n\nATOFINA Chemicals continually searches for potential safety improvements.  One such improvement that has been identified, by adding all chloroform systems to the mechanical integrity inspection program, is to replace old chloroform receiving piping and more safely route such piping by utilizing a pipe rack."
