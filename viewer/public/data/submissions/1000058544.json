              "Description": "Albertsons implementation of the PSM/RMP program includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce exposure to accidental ammonia releases. The revised plan includes a regular preventative maintenance program for ammonia system components, as well as programs for both pre-startup safety reviews and management of changes (MOC) to the ammonia refrigeration system. The program includes operating procedures for the safe operation of the refrigeration system, specific requirements for safe work practices (such as safe approaches to welding and similar hot work), and safety requirements for contractorswho may be hired to work on the refrigeration system. Albertsons has a procedure in place for investigating incidents to ensure root causes are identified and corrective actions are taken to minimize the potential for recurrence of incidents. The program also has a procedure fro conducting compliance audits to ensure the PSM program is being implemented aat the ivine facility. Lastly, the PSM written program incorporates the Irvine facility's emergency response plan and places special emphasis on handling accidental releases of ammonia and coordination of emergency response with local fire departments and other emergency response organizations.",

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n?    Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\n?    Hazard Assessment Summary\n\n?    Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n?    Five Year Accident History\n\n?    Emergency Response Program\n\n?    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n?    External Events/Seismic Summary\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nAlbertsons - Irvine is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is reflected in a comprehensive accidental release prevention program. This program addresses the design, installation, operation, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process solution equipment at the facility. \n\n\n\nAlbertsons - Irvine senior management is not only committed to offering superior service, but also to maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities. The facility maintains a Safety Committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  Albertsons has an Emergency Response Plan (Plan) in effect, which is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM document maintained at the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well "

      "SummaryText": "as to incorporate any facility changes.\n\n\n\nAlbertsons - Irvine was designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations in place at the time of construction.  The facility is located at 9300 Toledo Way in Irvine, California.  The facility is approximately 1.5 miles northeast of the Interstate 5 and approximately 3 miles Southeast of State Route 133.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is urban with a mixture of commercial, industrial, and residential areas.  The facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. \n\n\n\nThe Albertsons - Irvine facility uses anhydrous ammonia to provide refrigeration for cold storage and dock areas.  The facility uses 17,800 pounds of ammonia as a refrigerant within a closed system, which operates continuously.  Compressors and condenser cycle on and off to comply with system demand during operation.  Cold storage and dock areas use evaporators to maintain room temperatures.  The systems, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycle ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold storage and dock areas.\n\n\n\nChanges in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature: lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature.  Low-pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat.  Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize.  Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid.  Typical operating conditions for the ammonia system range from 28 psig on the low-pressure side of the system to 160 psig on the high side. \n\n\n\nThe majority of the ammonia refrigeration equipment is located inside the engine room. The condensers are mounted on the engine room roof and the evaporators are placed in their respective dock or storage a"
