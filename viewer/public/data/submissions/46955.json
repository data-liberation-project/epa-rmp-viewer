Stanton Unit A, a 633 MW combined cycle operating unit located to the north of the coal fired units is jointly owned by Southern Company- Florida, the Orlando Utilities Commission, the Kissimmee Utility Authority, and the Florida Municipal Power Agency.  The unit is operated by Southern Company- Florida.  Employee safety and health is a fundamental value of Southern Company-Florida.  It is the policy of the facility to provide and maintain safe working conditions and to operate and manage facilities in a manner that protects the environment and meets or surpasses all federal, state, and local enviromental regulations.  Stanton Unit A has a safety program designed to ensure that employees and contractors are working in a safe environment.  The program includes training, operating and maintenance procedures, as well as auditing and incident investigation procedures.  Stanton Unit A has two processes that are covered under the Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations, 40 CFR Part 68, as Program level 3 processes.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored on site in one 18,000 gallon tank for use as part of the Selective Catalytic Reduction system used to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions.  The facility also has a chlorine process for use as a biocide treatment for the cooling water.  Chlorine is stored on site in up to 6 one ton (2,000 pound) cylinders.  Stanton Unit A has developed an emergency response plan that complies with 29 CFR Part 1910.38 to protect the public health and the environment.  This plan includes procedures for notifying the public in the event of an accidential release, procedures for the use and maintenance of response equipment, employee training, and procedures to review and update the plan.  The Orange County Fire Department has visited the site and has been made aware of the facility's emergency response procedure.  E"
