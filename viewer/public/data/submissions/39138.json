      "SummaryText": "The City of Charleston Wastewater Treatment Facility is a municipally owned and operated sewage treatment plant permitted to treat up to 14 MGD of waste under permit number WV0023205.  Dry weather flows average 11 MGD.  The facility uses chlorine to disinfect the treated wastewater before it is discharged into Kanawha River at Charleston, WV.  The Charleston WWTP has a good record of chlorine handling and has never had a major accidental release in its history, and has had no minor accidental releases in the past ten years.  The most chlorine kept on site at any one time is four (4) one ton containers.  These containers are leased from a local chlorine supplier who reports that they are inspected prior to delivery.\n\nThe Charleston Sanitary Board participates in a Risk Management program sponsored by the City of Charleston.  Commercial Insurance Services assists the Sanitary Board in assessing safety and risk at the WWTP.  The CSB has a Risk Management Coordinator and two Risk Management Safety Committee Members.  The General Manager and the Operations Managers also attend monthly Risk Management Board meetings with Department Heads of the City of Charleston.  Safety meetings are held monthly, or more often if necessary.\n\nThe worst case scenario for this facility was calculated using EPA's RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants.  The scenario was a gas release of a full one ton container at 200 lbs/min for 10 minutes.  Wind speed was 1.5 m/s and the atmospheric stability class was \"F\".  This resulted in a toxix endpoint of 1.3 miles and an estimated effected population of 2000 people.  The alternate release scenario was was a 1/4 inch hole in the chlorine piping.  This resulted in a release rate of 640 lbs/min but atmospheric conditions were assumed to be Class D and the wind speed increased to 3.0 m/s.  This reduced the toxic endpoint to 0.4 miles and the effected population was reduced to 500.\n\nThe CSB RMP calls for plant operators to be the first responders"

      "SummaryText": "to any chlorine leak.  One operator will attempt to repair the leak using an SCBA unit for breathing, and a Chlorine Institute Repair Kit.  Other operators will notify emergency responders and other personnel so that the area can be evacuated as needed.  Wind socks and chlorine alarm systems assist with notification and evacuation.  The Charleston Fire Department is responsible for notifying offsite receptors of any leak and the need to evacuate or shelter in-place.\n\nEPA conducted an audit of our Response Management Plan on April 2, 2002.  Areas of deficiency in this inspection were:  an updated process and instrumentation diagram for the chlorine system was needed, better documentation of maintenance was needed; a better chlorine monitoring system was needed; an updated testing and maintenance schedule was needed.  All of these deficincies were corrected.  In addition, the Charleston Sanitary Board the following additional improvements:  protective clothing (Tyvek suits) was purchased for employees to use in hazardous responses; a written procedure for leak repair was revised to include improvements in responding to leaks; all of the RMP information such as procedures, audits, reviews and updates were placed in a single notebook for easy reference rather than kept in separate files; and a laminated procedure card was mounted at the chlorine cylinders to provide information for emergency responders.\n\nThe CSB is currently (June 2004) in the process of upgrading the WWTP and will eliminate the chlorine disinfection system and install an ultra-violet light system in its place by June 2006.  Once installed, chlorine will no longer be kept on site and the CSB WWTP will no longer need to maintain the RMP."
