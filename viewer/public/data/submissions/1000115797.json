      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n(Revised in accordance with EPA's requirements for the five year update.)\n\n1. Facility Policy: The management and employees of this facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of aqua ammonia through the use of proper equipment, regular inspections, maintenance and training of all persons that work with aqua ammonia. Should an accidental release occur, this facility has worked with the local fire department and local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to a release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. \n\n2. Facility Information: The primary activity at this facility is the storage and handling of aqua ammonia for sale to farmers. Aqua ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application to the soil as a crop production nutrient. \n\n3. Five-year Accident History: There have been no accidental releases of aqua ammonia for the covered process at this facility in the past five years.\n\n4. Emergency Response Program: This facility has a written emergency plan in accordance with OSHA Standards 29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.120. The Emergency Plan for this facility includes specific instructions for employees regarding the response procedures to an emergency. Response procedures may differ by product depending on the qualifications of the personnel and equipment available onsite. Emergency planning and community right-to-know information is provided to the state emergency response commission, local emergency planning committee and local fire department as required by SARA Title III of EPCRA. \n\n5. Planned Changes to Improve Safety: Safety improvement is an on-going process at this facility. Periodic inspections and evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations. There are no additional specific ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
