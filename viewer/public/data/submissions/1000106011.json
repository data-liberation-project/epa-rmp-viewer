      "SummaryText": "Brightmark operates a Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) processing facility that generates RNG from recovered biogas emitted by Dairy farm digesters.  The digesters are fed with cow manure which in turn create biogas.  Once in the digester, the manure is heated and decomposed, creating biogas. The biogas is then upgraded to RNG by increasing the methane content by removing water vapor, carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide and other impurities.  After upgrading, the RNG is compressed and loaded into transportation trucks for delivery to an injection point where it enters a commercial supply pipeline.  The RNG transportation trucks are referred to as a \u201cvirtual pipeline\u201d.  The RNG is also known as biomethane.  RNG is pipeline quality natural gas nearly identical to traditional natural gas and can be used for heating, cooking and other processes.  \n\nThe primary process safety hazards identified by the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) study include toxic gas exposure from H2S and overall flammable / explosive hazards from the methane within the system.  The facility exceeds the PSM / RMP threshold quantity of methane due to the use of RNG transportation trucks also referred to as a \u201cvirtual pipeline\u201d.\n\nIn order to ensure safe operation of the process facility equipment, Brightmark has a Process Safety and Risk Management program.  This program helps identify, and control process safety related hazards to personnel and the environment.  The process safety program includes the following main elements:\n\n\u2022\tEmployee Participation\n\u2022\tProcess Safety Information\n\u2022\tProcess Hazard Analysis\n\u2022\tOperating Procedures\n\u2022\tTraining\n\u2022\tContractor Safety\n\u2022\tPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\u2022\tMechanical Integrity\n\u2022\tHot Work Permit\n\u2022\tManagement of Change (MOC)\n\u2022\tIncident Investigation\n\u2022\tEmergency Response & Planning\n\u2022\tCompliance Audits\n\nThe process safety management program is supplemented by an occupational safety program to help manage other safety and environmental hazards based on applicable regulations"
