(dba Southwest Ice Cream Specialties) facility located at 1220 N.Tennesse St. in McKinney, Texas.  Southwest Ice Cream Specialties produces ice cream and novely products and is equipped with a refrigeration system containing a regulated refrigerant.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION\n\n\n\nReleases are prevented by a combination of engineering and administrative controls.  Engineering controls include automated system shutdown when safe parameters are exceeded.  Administrative controls involve manual isolation and shutdown procedures to be performed by trained personnel.  The system is also equipped with pressure relief valves that operate to prevent damage to system components should pressures reach unsafe levels.  Operation of pressure relief valves will result in a controlled release of refrigerant.\n\n\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThis facility has developed a prevention program which complies with the requirements of OSHA CFR 29, 1910.119, Process Safety Management.  This program includes procedures, training, and proactive maintenance measures to keep the system operating without catastrophic release.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility calls for the immediate evacuation or shelter in place as determined necessary for the particular event.  A third party response contractor is notified of an uncontrolled release event.  The local fire department has been included in the notification and response plan.\n\n\n\nSouthwest Ice Cream Specialties personnel are trained to assist the responders with information only, and would not participate in the actual response.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidents at this facility within the last five years.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThere are no planned changes to the system at this time.  However, any changes will include the latest technology for safety when i"
