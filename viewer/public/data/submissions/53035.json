All employees are informed of hazards in the workplace. Employees who work with potentially hazardous substances receive proper training in the handling of those substances. This facility has procedures in place to safely evacuate employees from areas in the unlikely event that a hazardous substance release was to occur, and to put in place emergency notification and response procedures.\n\n2. Facility and Regulated Substances\n\nFreeze Pack Inc., based in Pasco, WA freezes and stores vegetables. The regulated substance at this facility, anhydrous ammonia, is used in a closed-loop refrigeration system for product cooling.  In order to protect its employees, the public and the environment, the facility has an integrated safety management program to prevent ammonia releases and mitigate the consequences of a release, should one occur. \n\n3. Worst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios\n\nOff Site Consequence (OCA) data is available for review onsite at the Freeze Pack facility.\n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Ammonia Specific Prevention\n\nThe Pasco facility has an emergency plan that addresses the response necessary for a release of ammonia from the refrigeration system. Because of the pungent odor of ammonia, any leak is easily detected. The refrigeration system is designed so that major components can be isolated by closing selected valves. Further, refrigeration system operators have been trained and are knowledgeable in the safe operation of the refrigeration system.    In case of a release that could travel off the plant property, calls would be made to the Fire Department and other Disaster Services Coordinators to assist in the response. Other state and federal notifications would be made as required.\n\n5. Five Year Accident History\n\nDuring the last five years, there have been n"

Employees are trained to evacuate their respective areas in accordance with OSHA 1910.38(a). Coordination with the local fire department is initiated during an emergency situation.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nFreeze Pack expects to improve safety performance by emphasizing all elements of a PSM/RMP program.  All recommendations during the Process Hazard Analysis were designed to improve the safety performance of the ammonia refrigeration process.  Freeze Pack expects to evaluate each recommendation in a timely manner and implement, as soon as possible, those recommendations that will reduce the possibility of a release and/or mitigate the consequences of an unintentional release."
