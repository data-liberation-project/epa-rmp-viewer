These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\t\n\tManagement of Change (MOC)\n\t\nThe Wheeler Gas Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\t\n\tIncident Investigation\n\t\nThe Wheeler Gas Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.

The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner. Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment. \n\t\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, Energy Transfer evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Gas plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\t\n\tPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\t\nThe Wheeler Gas Plant conducts a Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems is operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a qualit"

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process. \n\t\nIn addition, the Wheeler Gas Plant maintains Operating Procedures and/or process safety information that provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\t\n\tTraining\n\t\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Wheeler Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable leve"

The analyses are conducted using a team of Enable Midstream Partners personnel and/or Contractors who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This PHA Team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\t\nThe PHA Team's recommendations are reviewed with corporate management to approve or revise recommended mitigation actions. Once approved, mitigation actions are assigned a relative risk ranking based upon the magnitude/immediacy of necessary actions to reduce hazard risks-as deemed necessary by the PHA Team, PHA Team Leader, and/or Corporate Management.  This risk reduction ranking helps to ensure that potential accident scenarios, especially those assigned to the highest hazard risk, receive immediate attention.  All management-approved PHA Team recommendations are tracked until assigned action items/tasks are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, dated and retained.\n\t\nPeriodically, Wheeler plant employees and Energy Transfer corporate personnel update and revalidate the initial process hazard analysis (PHA) to ensure that process controls remain technologically adequate, and that process hazards are minimized and are within acceptable company risk tolerances.  The PHA Revalidation verifies that the process does not deviate significantly from its original engineering design and safety features.  These periodic revalidation/reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and continue to be conducted at this frequency until the process is decommissioned.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  As with the initial analysis, the PHA Team findin"

A written procedure is in place to limit the storage inventory of this tank to 80% of the maximum tank capacity.  Additionally, the tank level is limited by an electronic level device which is intended to shut down the processing plant when the tank level reaches above 80%. However, for the Worst Case Scenario calculation, the full inventory capacity (86,000 gallons) of the tank is assumed to release and ignite, as in a VCE.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.56 miles or ~2,957 feet.  Additionally, although we have other controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for active or passive mitigation measures was taken into account in calculating the WCS for the Wheeler Gas Plant.  One resident, northwest of the Wheeler plant, has been identified to be within the WCS radius for this scenario.     \n\t\nThe Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the Wheeler Gas Plant is a VCE resulting from a 15,000 lbs. 60-minute release of C2+ mixture, resulting from a seal failure at the V-405 Product Surge Tank Product Pumps.  The release is expected to be isolated by an Operator or emergency responders within sixty minutes.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi overpressure endpoint for this event is 0.20 miles or 1,056 feet.  No public receptors are identified within the .20 mile 1-psi endpoint for this alternative case scenario.
