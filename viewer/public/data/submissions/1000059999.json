      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary for the Newcastle Gas Processing Facility \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe Newcastle Gas Plant has a longstanding commitment to worker and public safety.  Our commitment is supported by the resources invested in accident prevention, personnel training and the consideration of safety issues in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of our facilities.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to provide a safe operation and prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained gas plant personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Newcastle Gas Plant is located about 25 miles southwest of Newcastle, Wyoming.  The facility includes natural gas liquid recovery using a refrigeration system, compression, dehydration, and fractionation.    The plant produces a lean, dry residue gas stream, liquid propane, and a liquid product containing butane, pentane and heavier liquids.  The plant handles regulated flammables such as ethane, propane, mixed butanes and mixed pentanes.  In 2011, two Sulfa-Treat vessels were added the facility to remove trace amounts of H2S gas that enters the plant with the raw gas from the field. The actual amount of H2s entering the plant is well below any threshold quantities for that substance.  Since the plant does not handle threshold quantities of any materials classified as toxic, there are no toxic release scenarios to consider at the Newcastle Gas Plant.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\n \n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant.  The processes at the plant are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard.  The following summary addresses each o"

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees are involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the gas plant and addresses each accident prevention program element. \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Newcastle Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The Operations group has been assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  The location of these documents is readily available to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment consideration, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.   For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety related limits for specific process parameters in operating manuals.  The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated sh"

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information in combination with written procedures and trained personnel provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n \n\nThe Newcastle Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe Newcastle Gas Plant uses the HAZOPS method of conducting process hazards analysis (PHA) to evaluate the processes.  These PHAs are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures.  The team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nIf necessary the PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews "

The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe Newcastle Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as unit startup, normal operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown as well as consequences of deviation from the design basis.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed to ensure they are current and accurate.  The procedures are also kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written process operating procedures, the Newcastle Gas Plant has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate the knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify the operators understanding of the training.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n \n\nThe Newcastle Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

This is accomplished by providing contractors with 1) process overview, 2) information about safety and health hazards, 3) emergency response plan requirements, 4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work, 5) safe and hot work permits as required.  In addition the company evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Contractors not meeting the minimum requirements of our contractor assessment program are not allowed to perform work at the plant.\n\n\n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\n\n\nThe Newcastle Gas Plant conducts a PSSR for any new equipment or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance mechanism by verifying that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nThe Newcastle Gas Plant has well established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps, heat exchangers, compressors and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: 1)"

In combination these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.  All of these activities are tracked and documented using SAP-PM, an asset manager database.\n\n\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on 1) an overview of the process, 2) safety and health hazards, 3) applicable maintenance procedures, 4) emergency response plans, and 5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to verify that equipment parameters are within acceptable limits.  For a vessel, the parameter being monitored would typically be wall thickness. If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible) or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.  \n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\n \n\nThe Newcastle Gas Plant has long standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include 1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, 2) a lockout/tagged procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, 3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, 4) a permit and procedure to control spark producing activities (i.e. hot work), and 5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures along with training of affected personnel form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are p"

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology, procedures and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to 1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, 2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change, and 3) ensure that changes do not introduce an unknown hazard to the process.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided necessary training on the change.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nThe Newcastle Gas Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence and forwards these results to gas plant management for resolution.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented and the investigation results reviewed with all employees who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits \n\n\n\nTo guarantee that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Newcastle Gas Plant audits to determine that the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  The audit team develops findings that a"
