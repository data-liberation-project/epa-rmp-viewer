(Prism) NGPL Facility is committed to protecting the health and safety of company personnel, contractors working in the facility, our neighbors in the surrounding community and the environment.  This commitment is strongly supported by senior management and is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as employee training and in considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our facility.  This location implements both administrative and engineering controls to reasonable minimize the risk of an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance.  However, if an uncontrolled release does occur, the personnel at the facility in cooperation with local response agencies are trained to respond, minimize and/or eliminate any exposure that could occur to protect employees and surrounding area. \n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Prism NGPL Facility is a Program Level 1 facility located approximately 4.5 miles north of the City of Marshall, Harrison County, Texas.  This is a remote and unmanned facility exempt from OSHA PSM requirements.  However, Prism operators perform periodic system checks and maintenance at the plant.  Under normal conditions, Prism operators will be present at the facility for approximately 2 hours per day.  The facility receives raw natural gas from well production.  The raw gas is dehydrated and contaminants removed.  The extracted natural gas liquids include methane, ethane, propane, n-pentane isobutane, n-hexane, n-heptane, n-octane, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and water.  The final product meets the specifications required for sale into a larger pipeline owned by Kinder-Morgan, Inc. (NGPL).  Prism utilizes a 30,000 gallon pressurized, aboveground, storage tank to retain the m"

The tank capacity is administratively restricted by Prism to 75% of total capacity.  The regulated substances expected to be in the 30,000 gallon tank in excess of threshold quantities (10,000 lbs) are: butane and isopentane. \n\n\n\nAccidental release Prevention Program\n\nPrism Gas Systems I, L.P. is regulated by 29CFR 1910.119 (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals) 1910.38 (Employee emergency Plans), 1910.120 (Hazardous Waste and Emergency Response), 40CFR 112 (Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure), RCRA, State and Federal EPCRA Rules/Laws, as well as other federal, state, and local regulations which are all developed to reduce the potential for the release of Highly Hazardous Chemicals. \n\n\n\nPrism has implemented the Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals along with additional requirements of the Risk Management Program as the Accident Release Prevention Program.  There are other practices and measures, which are contained in numerous plans and procedures that all assist to prevent the release of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.  Facility accident prevention programs promote the proactive identification, evaluation, and mitigation or prevention of releases of highly hazardous substances that could occur as a result of failures in processes, procedures or equipment.  The implementation of the Employee Participation Program requires the development of the necessary expertise, experiences, judgment, and proactive initiative within the workforce.  \n\n\n\nAn established comprehensive training program has been developed and implemented for facility personnel.  All employees are trained in an overview of the process as well as in appropriate safe work practices per the corporate safety guidelines.  In addition to the training required of all employees, personnel having responsibilities under the operating and maintenance proced"

Safe work practices include site control, lockout/tagout, line breaking, confined space entry and hot work to ensure the safety and well being of employees and the surrounding area.  \n\n\n\nPrism has a policy of investigating every incident, which may have possibly resulted in a release to prevent a similar accident from recurring.  \n\n\n\nThe Company has established an audit procedure to assure the continued integrity of the prevention program and ensure the safety and well being of employees and the surrounding area.  \n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThe NGPL Facility is a new facility therefore, within the five-year period prior to the submittal of this RMP, there were no accidental releases of regulated flammable materials meeting the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nPrism maintains a written emergency response plan to protect workers, ensure public safety and to protect the environment.  The plan details the procedures for responding to an emergency, including the release or potential release of a hazardous substance.  The procedures include instruction for response, communication, first aid, evacuation, accounting for personnel, company and agency notification procedures, and post incident cleanup and decontamination.  All emergency equipment is maintained following established procedures.  Employees are trained in the procedures and use of equipment appropriate to their role in the response effort.  The emergency response plan is coordinated with the local emergency responders such as local law enforcement, local and state government officials, and the local emergency planning committee. \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe facility personnel are continually developing new ways to improve the safety of the facility.  This is done through responsibilit"
