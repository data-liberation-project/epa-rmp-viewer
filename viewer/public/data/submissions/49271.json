Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n    At the Ferro South Plainfield site, we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of release prevention programs and emergency response programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as the protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the risk management activities that we have designed into and implemented including:\n    A description of our facility and the use of substances regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program rule;\n    A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from an accidental chemical release;\n    An overview of our accidental release prevention programs;\n    A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program rule;\n    An overview of our emergency response program;\n    An overview of planned activities to improve the prevention program at the facility;\n    The certification that the Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program rule requires us to provide; and\n    The detailed information about our risk management program.\n\nB.    The South Plainfield facility is a producer of precious metal products such as silver solder, pastes, and powders used in the electronics industry.  Formaldehyde solution is used at the facility in the precipitation of metallic silver from precious metal solutions.  These operations are conducted in small batch reactors.\n\n    Formaldehyde solution, 37%, is stored at the facility in a nominal 6000-gallon storage tank and distributed to the user equipment in the plant through a piping network.  Formaldehyde solution is delivered by tank truck by several different firms.  Deliveries are scheduled when the storage tank level drops below a predetermined level.\n\nc.

Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n    The prevention program used at the facility is the Occupational Safety and Health Administrations Process Safety Management standard.  The standard covers management system elements involving safety information, hazard evaluations, operating procedures, employee training, contractor controls mechanical integrity, pre-startup reviews, incident investigations, safe work practices, and emergency response.\n\n    There are a number of specific measures in place to reduce the likelihood of a release of formaldehyde solution or it's impact.  Two level gauges monitor the tank liquid level.  The two gauges must read within 100 gallons of each other.  Additional material is not ordered until the tank level is below 1500 gallons.  This will allow the total contents of the delivery tank trailer to be safely unloaded into the storage tank.  The storage tank is equipped with high level monitor and alarm that alerts the driver if the tank level is too high.\n\n    The driver and Ferro personnel are on hand throughout the unloading operation and are able to shut down the operation in the event of a leak before a large release has occurs.  A formaldehyde leak detector sensor is also located inside the tank containment\n\n    The pipe line and storage tank is constructed of welded stainless steel.  This material is compatible with and resistant to corrosion from formaldehyde solution.\n\n\nE.    Five-year Accident History\n\n    There have not been any releases of formaldehyde solution at this facility.\n\n\nF.    Emergency Response Program\n\n    Emergencies at the facility are handled according to the sites \"Emergency Preparedness Plan\" which details the actions required to respond to plant emergencies such as chemical spills, medical emergencies, fire, gas leaks, bomb threats, explosions and natur"

If the emergency plan is activated during the off-hours or weekend, the Shift Supervisor with assistance from security personnel will initiate the plan.\n\n    The Hazardous Entry and Abatement Team will respond to chemical spills.  Team members have been trained in response and mitigation techniques.  The Team conducts annual drills.  Their first response is to stop the release and contain the spread of material.  The formaldehyde storage tank is contained inside a diked area.  The tank is further sheltered on three sides by the production building.  The diked area is designed to hold the entire contents of the storage tank plus a minimum of six inches of rainwater.\n\n    During unloading the tank trailer is parked inside the \"well\" of the nearby loading dock.
