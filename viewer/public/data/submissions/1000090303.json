Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR ?5189\n\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR ?1910.119\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Eastside Packing has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1 Eastside Packing, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Eastside Packing has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\n\n\nProcess Name           | Process Chemical          | Process Quantity(lbs.)\n\nAmmonia Refrigeration    Anhydrous Ammonia           26,000\n\n\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses, and physical property damage.\n\n\n\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.

Utilized PSMWriter software to ensure that all necessary employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\n\n\n\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures, and practices that will help our employees and neighbors protect themselves.\n\n\n\n1.2 Process Description\n\n\n\n1.2.1 Facility Overview\n\n\n\nEastside Packing operates a commercial cold storage for citrus in Reedley, CA. The facility has an ammonia refrigeration system that provides refrigeration capacity to the following:\n\n(5) Storage rooms\n\n(6) Degreening rooms\n\n(1) Conditioning room\n\n(1) Palletize room\n\n(1) Hallway\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Facility Location\n\n\n\nEastside Packing is located at 1750 S. Buttonwillow, Reedley, CA 93654. The latitude and longitude of the largest high pressure receiver is 36.581515, -119.429667. The facility is located approximately 8 miles east of state highway 99 in a rural area surrounded primarily by agricultural land.\n\n\n\nAccording to FEMA Flood Map Service, the facility is located in \"an area of minimal flood hazard\".\n\n\n\nEastside Packing is not located in an Alquist-Priolo Fault Zone as defined by the California Department of Conservation. In addition, a review of United States Geological Survey (USGS) fault maps revealed that there are no faults in close proximity to the site. The USGS 2018 One-Year Model revealed that Eastside Packing has a 1-2% chance of experiencing \"potentially minor-damage\" due to ground shaking in 2018.\n\n\n\n1.2.4 Description of Covered Process\n\n\n\nThe refrigerated areas are equipped with air-cooling evaporators and accumulators as required for flooded operation.\n\nMost control valve groups are located on the roof while some are located in the hallway in the mezzanine to provide easy access. The refrigeration machinery is contained within or directly above the machinery room. A partial list of system components includes: \n\n\n\nElectrical Room\n\n(1) Air-cool"

The high pressure receivers receive high pressure liquid from the condensers and supply high pressure liquid to each zone of refrigeration. The high pressure receivers are also used to provide storage for ammonia not being used in the process at any given moment.

Under normal conditions, the high pressure receivers contain high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nFlooded Accumulator\n\nThe purpose of each flooded accumulator is to provide a supply of low pressure liquid ammonia to the evaporators. Each accumulator is equipped with an expansion valve which expands the high pressure liquid into a low temperature and pressure liquid as it enters the vessel. The flooded accumulators supply, by gravity, low pressure liquid to the associated evaporators.

The air-cooling evaporators receive liquid from the high pressure receivers. Each evaporator is equipped with an expansion valve which reduces the pressure and temperature of the liquid as it enters the evaporator.

The main suction accumulators receive vapor from the flooded accumulators and separate any residual liquid from the vapor to allow only the vapor to be piped to the suction of each compressor. Liquid in the main suction accumulators drains by gravity into the liquid transfer vessels. The main suction accumulators are each equipped with a high level float switch that is wired to shut down the compressors in the event of a high level situation. This prevents liquid ammonia from entering the compressors.

Under normal conditions the liquid transfer vessels can contain either high or low pressure liquid and vapor.\n\n\n\nCompressors\n\nThe purpose of the compressors is to raise the temperature and pressure of the low pressure gas in order to reject the heat absorbed in the evaporators to the atmosphere. The compressors receive low pressure vapor from the main suction accumulators and discharge high pressure vapor to the evaporative condensers. The compressors are equipped with high discharge pressure cutouts to shut the equipment off if the pressure exceeds the setpoint. Under normal conditions, the compressors contain both high and low pressure vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nEvaporative Condensers\n\nThe purpose of the evaporative condensers is to reject the heat absorbed in the evaporators to the atmosphere. The evaporative condensers receive high pressure, superheated vapor from the compressors and supply high pressure liquid to the high pressure receivers. The condensers use air and water to cool the warm ammonia as it passes through a series of tubes within the condenser. As the cooling medium of air and water draws the heat from the vapor, the refrigerant condenses into a liquid and flows to the high pressure receivers. Under normal conditions, the evaporative condensers contain high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nSafety Systems\n\n\n\nAmmonia Detection System\n\nMachinery Room (Low Level)\n\nThe machinery room includes one (1) low level ammonia sensor which will activate audible and visual alarms at 25 PPM outside the machinery room, along with an alarm that reports to a monitored location so that corrective action can be taken.\n\nFurthermore, the low le"

This has improved Eastside Packing's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Eastside Packing's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\n\n\nEastside Packing has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Eastside Packing has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\n\n\nFor the future, Eastside Packing now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\".
