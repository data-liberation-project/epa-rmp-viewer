Once the liquid level in the liquid transfer vessel reaches the float switch, the three way solenoid valve is energized for a period of time causing the liquid transfer vessel to become subject to high pressure and allowing the liquid to drain by gravity into the high pressure receiver. Under normal conditions the liquid transfer vessels can contain either high or low pressure liquid and vapor.\r\n\r\nCompressors\r\nThe purpose of the compressors is to raise the temperature and pressure of the low pressure gas in order to reject the heat absorbed in the evaporators to the atmosphere. The compressors receive low pressure vapor from the main suction accumulators and discharge high pressure vapor to the evaporative condensers. The compressors are equipped with high discharge pressure cutouts to shut the equipment off if the pressure exceeds the setpoint. Under normal conditions, the compressors contain both high and low pressure vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nEvaporative Condensers\r\nThe purpose of the evaporative condensers is to reject the heat absorbed in the evaporators to the atmosphere. The evaporative condensers receive high pressure, superheated vapor from the compressors and supply high pressure liquid to the high pressure receivers. The condensers use air and water to cool the warm ammonia as it passes through a series of tubes within the condenser. As the cooling medium of air and water draws the heat from the vapor, the refrigerant condenses into a liquid and flows to the high pressure receivers. Under normal conditions, the evaporative condensers contain high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nSafety Systems\r\n\r\nAmmonia Detection System\r\nMachinery Room (Low Level)\r\nThe machinery room includes one (1) low level ammonia sensor which will activate audible and visual alarms at 25 PPM outside the machinery room, along with an alarm that reports to a monitored location so that corrective action can be taken.\r\nFurthermore, the low le"

As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Eastside Packing has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \r\n\r\n1.1 Eastside Packing, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\r\n\r\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Eastside Packing has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \r\n\r\nProcess Name           | Process Chemical          | Process Quantity(lbs.)\r\nAmmonia Refrigeration    Anhydrous Ammonia           26,000\r\n\r\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses, and physical property damage.\r\n\r\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.

Buttonwillow, Reedley, CA 93654. The latitude and longitude of the largest high pressure receiver is 36.581515, -119.429667. The facility is located approximately 8 miles east of state highway 99 in a rural area surrounded primarily by agricultural land.\r\n\r\nAccording to FEMA Flood Map Service, the facility is located in \"an area of minimal flood hazard\".\r\n\r\nEastside Packing is not located in an Alquist-Priolo Fault Zone as defined by the California Department of Conservation. In addition, a review of United States Geological Survey (USGS) fault maps revealed that there are no faults in close proximity to the site. The USGS 2018 One-Year Model revealed that Eastside Packing has a 1-2% chance of experiencing \"potentially minor-damage\" due to ground shaking in 2018.\r\n\r\n1.2.4 Description of Covered Process\r\n\r\nThe refrigerated areas are equipped with air-cooling evaporators and accumulators as required for flooded operation.\r\nMost control valve groups are located on the roof while some are located in the hallway in the mezzanine to provide easy access. The refrigeration machinery is contained within or directly above the machinery room. A partial list of system components includes: \r\n\r\nElectrical Room\r\n(1) Air-cool"

Due to the low pressures and temperatures maintained in the evaporators, the liquid refrigerant absorbs a great deal of heat from the surrounding area and evaporates. To increase the rate of heat removed, the evaporators use an electric fan to move warm air over the coils of cold liquid ammonia. Once the liquid has evaporated to form low temperature and pressure vapor, it exits the evaporator and is returned to the main suction accumulators.\r\n\r\nMain Suction Accumulators\r\nThe purpose of the main suction accumulators is to prevent liquid from entering the compressors. The main suction accumulators receive vapor from the flooded accumulators and separate any residual liquid from the vapor to allow only the vapor to be piped to the suction of each compressor. Liquid in the main suction accumulators drains by gravity into the liquid transfer vessels. The main suction accumulators are each equipped with a high level float switch that is wired to shut down the compressors in the event of a high level situation. This prevents liquid ammonia from entering the compressors. Under normal conditions, the main suction accumulators contain low pressure vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nLiquid Transfer Vessels\r\nThe purpose of the liquid transfer vessels is to transfer liquid from the low side of the refrigeration system back to the high pressure receivers. Each liquid transfer vessel receives liqui"

As such, the refrigeration system at Eastside Packing is treated as a single process.\r\n\r\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\n1.3.1 General \r\n\r\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\r\nEastside Packing has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \r\n\r\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Eastside Packing facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\r\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep active records of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment."
