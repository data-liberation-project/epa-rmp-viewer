It complies with all applicable State and Federal regulations and provides training and equipment required to operate in a safe and efficient manner.\r\n \r\nThe facility manufactures resins and other related products that are used primarily in building construction and commercial adhesives.  Several batch processes are carried out at the facility. Three processes, each using either formaldehyde or vinyl acetate monomer, are used in quantities that trigger the regulation (40 CFR 68) requiring the Risk Management Plan (RMP and OSHA's process Safety Management Program (PSM). \r\n \r\nAn implementing manual incorporating the requirements of both RMP and PSM has been prepared and is used as the working document for compliance with both regulations.\r\n \r\nThe facility has an emergency response plan and works closely with the local volunteer fire department (Fair Grove Fire Department) and the Davidson county sheriff's office to insure coordination of local emergency responders and public notification in the event of a chemical release.  Updates to the emergency response plans, employee training and coordination with the local fire department and LEPC were completed after the additional regulated processes were installed. \r\n \r\nThe first regulated process is a batch process carried out in two stainless steel reactor vessels.  The primary raw materials are formaldehyde and urea.  The raw materials are pumped into the reactor vessels under controlled conditions where they react to form the corresponding resinous products.  Formaldehyde is purchased as a 50% aqueous solution in tank truck quantities.  The solution is stored in a 12,500 gallon stainless steel, agitated, storage tank that is temperature controlled.  The tank is located in a concrete diked area along with other raw material tanks. \r\nOne accidental release of formaldehyde occurred in January 2000, involving a pump seal failure.  Th"

Both agencies provided assistance and suggestions for improvement and were satisfied once their suggestions for improvement were completed.  \r\n\r\nThe second regulated process is a vinyl acetate monomer process.  The process is isolated from the other regulated process via dikes and a distance of greater than 15 feet.  The vinyl acetate monomer process consists of storage of approximately 442,000 pounds of vinyl acetate monomer inside three interconnected atmospheric tanks.  Multiple passive and active mitigation systems are included in the process, as described herein.  The worst case scenario used to assess off-site consequences assumes the release of three atmospheric tanks, which would result in 442,100 pounds of vinyl acetate monomer being released. \r\n \r\nThe alternate scenario used to assess off-site consequences assumes the release of a tanker during unloading, which could result in 47,000 pounds of vinyl acetate monomer being released. \r\nVinyl acetate monomer is shipped to the facility by tanker truck or railcar and unleaded to one of three interconnected atmospheric storage tanks.  The storage tanks are located in a diked storage area. Vinyl acetate monomer is transferred as needed from the atmospheric tanks to one of two vessel trains.  The trains are not interconnected.  The production processes are batch processes, and include mixing/blending tanks, reactors and cooling vessels in two separate trains.  Upon completion of the reactor and cooling stage, the vinyl acetate monomer is no longer present. \r\n\r\nThe third regulated process is a formaldehyde process utilizing approximately 39,000 pounds of formaldehyde unloaded directly from a tanker truck into a reactor. Primary raw materials are formaldehyde and acetone. Acetone is transferred as needed into the reactor as a batch process, including mixing/blending tanks and the reactor in a single pr"
