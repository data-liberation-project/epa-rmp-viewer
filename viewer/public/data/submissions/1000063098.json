One substance, chlorine dioxide, is utilized at the site to bleach pulp.  This substance is regulated under 40CFR Part 68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (referred to the Risk Management Program or RMP).  \n\n\n\nPolicy on Safety, Accident Prevention and Emergency Response:  The International Paper Mill at Franklin, Virginia is committed to operating in a manner that provides for the safety of its employees and neighbors and for the protection of the environment.  A key element of this commitment is the safe and proper handling of chemicals.  The mill implements controls to prevent accidents or releases of hazardous substances.  In the event of an accidental release, mitigation steps are taken to contain, control and stop the release.  International Paper is committed to continuously improve the safety of its processes.  One example of this commitment is the elimination of the use of elemental chlorine for bleaching, which was implemented in April 2001.  Additionally, ongoing activities, including training, process hazard analysis and auditing, are used to identify was to continually improve the operation of these processes.\n\n\n\n\n\nManagement System:   The Mill has developed a management system to implement and maintain compliance with the RMP and related Process Safety Management (PSM) and emergency response programs.  This management system identifies lines of responsibility for the entire program and each of its key elements.  The following table identifies the key staff positions that are responsible for the RMP elements.\n\n\n\nResponsible Parties\n\nRisk Management and Process Safety Management Programs:    Mill Manager    Paula Wood\n\nRisk Management Pro"

The worst case scenario is prescribed by the regulation.  For this site, it is an instantaneous spill of the entire contents of the largest chlorine dioxide storage tank, which can contain up to 138,760 gallons of a 1.2  percent by weight chlorine dioxide aqueous solution.  The solution is assumed to spill into a puddle with a uniform depth of 1 cm and all of the chlorine dioxide (13890 lb) is assumed to be released to the air as vapor within 10 minutes because of its high volatility. The selected alternative release scenario for this site is a flange leak on delivery pipe containing the aqueous solution of chlorine d"

Mitigation measures considered in the alternative release scenario included emergency shutdown systems.  Each of these release scenarios has potential off-site consequences.  For the worst-case release scenario, which is highly unrealistic, off-site receptors include residences, schools, churches, commercial areas, a hospital and an airport.  For the alternative release scenario off-site receptors include residences, churches and commercial areas.\n\n\n\nAccident Prevention Program:  The following release prevention elements for the chlorine dioxide systems are employed at the mill: \n\n \n\n1) Design standards:  Design standards are utilized to ensure that process safety information is incorporated into the construction and maintenance of these systems.  \n\n\n\n2) Operating Procedures:  Written operating procedures have been developed and are maintained.  These procedures define how tasks related to the process operation should be performed.  They are used to train operators and serve as guides for appropriate steps to be taken both during normal operations and process upsets.  \n\n\n\n3) Maintenance (Mechanical Integrity):  The chlorine dioxide systems are properly maintained.  Presentative maintenance is routinely performed on these systems.  Maintenance on these systems is limited to employees and contract personnel who have received specific training on the maintenance of the systems. \n\n\n\n4)  Training:  Personnel are trained in the operation procedures to help ensure safe and effective performance of assigned tasks.  \n\n\n\n5)  Process Hazards Analysis (PHA):  PHA's were conducted on the chlorine dioxide system.  PHAs are structured ways to identify and reduce the hazards of a system.  Routine review if these PHAs are performed as well.  \n\n\n\n6) Contractor management:  The mill has a program which establishes criteria regarding safe work practices for contactors in ord"

This includes Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) that document the physical and safety-related properties of chlorine dioxide. \n\n\n\n12)  Incident Investigation:  All incidents that have or could reasonable result in a serious injury to employees, the public or the environment are investigated and all employees are required to report such an incident. \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Plan:  The mill has a written emergency response plan to mitigate and minimize the effects of any accidental release.  Trained response personnel and equipment are on-site 24 hours a day.  Training and drills of the response plan are routine conducted.  The response plan has been communicated to local emergency response officials who have participated in the drills at the mill.  \n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History:  No accidental release of chlorine dioxide has occurred in the past five years, as defined by the RMP regulation.
