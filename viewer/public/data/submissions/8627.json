Accidental Release Prevention And Emergency Response.\n\nAt this manufacturing facility we use an isobutane/propane mixture (Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG)) as a raw material in our products.  The LPG storage at this facility is in excess of 10,000 pounds  which is considered hazardous by EPA.  \n\nTo prevent unnecessary exposure  to our employees and nearby members of the community, certain safety precautions are needed during the receiving, storage and transfer of the LPG.  Preventing releases of the LPG is dependant upon several factors, which include but are not limited to:\n\n7 The proper material handling procedures.\n7 Safety devices for leak detection and emergency shutdowns.\n7 Employee training.  \n\nIt is our policy to comply with all applicable Federal, state, and local regulations regarding this and all other chemicals used at this location.\n\nIn the event that an incident should occur at our facility involving the LPG or other chemicals we have prepared an Emergency Response Plan. \n\n2. The Stationary Source And Regulated Substances Handled.\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is the packaging of urethane foam, adhesives, and sealant producing chemical components into containers suitable for use by retail and commercial  customers.  LPG is one chemical component needed to produce a foam. \n\nLPG is delivered to our facility by truck transports and is stored in two large storage tanks.  The  LPG is then transferred from storage to our production line filling stations where it is dispensed into 12 - 24oz aerosol cans.  The cans are labeled, packaged, stored and finally shipped to consumer retail outlets.\n\nAccess to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nThe maximum amount of LPG that can be stored at this facility is 117,300 pounds. \n\n3. The Worst-Case Release Scenario(S) And The Alternative Release Scenario(S), Including Administrative Controls And Mitigation Measure"

      "SummaryText": "s To Limit The Distances For Each Reported Scenario.\n\n Worst-Case Scenario. - Failure of  both storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed would release 117,300 pounds of LPG. Company policy limits the maximum filling capacity to  85% at 60 F. It is assumed that the entire contents are released as vapor which finds an ignition source, 10% of the released quantity is assumed to participate in the resulting explosion. \n\nThe distance to the endpoint of 1 psi for the worst-case scenario is 0.40 miles. \n\nAlternative Scenario. - A 2'' liquid line failure at the  truck loading rack occurs.  This type of failure could result in the release of 80,460 pounds of LPG in 10 minutes.  The resulting unconfined vapor travels to the lower flammability limit.  The distance to the endpoint for the lower flammability limit for the alternative scenario is approximately .2 miles.  This release has the possibility of extending beyond the facility boundary. \n\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program And The Specific Prevention Steps. \n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. The LPG storage tanks and associated equipment at this facility were designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58.  Employees involved with the receiving, storage and transfer of  the LPG have all been thoroughly trained in standard operating procedures, emergency shutdowns and emergency response.\n\n5. Five-Year Accident History. \n \nThis site has had no accidental releases of this chemical in the last 5 years.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program.\n\nThis facility has developed an emergency response program and has discussed this program with the Will County Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Lockport Fire Department. \n\n7. Changes To Improve Safety.\n\nThe LPG storage tanks were installed at this facility in 1994.  As the company becomes aware of changes in the regulations related to the safe storage and ha"
