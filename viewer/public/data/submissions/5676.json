(Facility) is a citrus juice manufacturing facility (NAICS Code 311411)\nusing one regulated substance, anhydrous ammonia (CAS Number 7664-41-7), as a refrigerant. \nThree processes at the facility use anhydrous ammonia in excess of the threshold quantity defined\nby the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) chemical accident prevention standard.  The\nthree processes are listed below.\n\n  The Main Facility\n  The Ready to Serve (RTS) Facility\n  Freezers 5 and 6\n\nA hazard assessment was performed using the USEPA RMP*CompTM Model.  The worst-case\nrelease scenarios were assumed to be the total release of anhydrous ammonia from the high pressure\nreceivers of each of the three processes over a 10 minute period.   The alternative release scenarios\nthe Facility selected were failure scenarios developed during  process hazard reviews and analyses. \nFor the three processes,  the alternative release scenarios occurred as a result of a 1/4-inch orifice\ndeveloping in the bottom of the high- pressure receivers because of corrosion.\n\nPotential zones of impact were constructed for the selected release scenarios.  These zones were\nanalyzed to provide estimates of the total population and public and environmental receptors that\ncould potentially be exposed should the hypothetical releases occur.  Although off-site areas would\nbe impacted by the releases, the Facility believes that safety procedures and mitigation measures will\nreduce the potential for off-site consequences and subsequent risks to the surrounding community. \nThe Facility's safety devices include leak detectors, alarms, and automatic system shut-off features.\n\nIn order to fulfill the requirements of the Risk Management Program (RMP), the Facility has\ndeveloped an accidental release prevention program and emergency action plan. The accidental\nrelease prevention program satisfies the requirements for the USEPA RMP and the Occupat"

      "SummaryText": "ional\nSafety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  The\nprevention program ensures that the Facility is operated under safe conditions and that any risk of\nan accidental release of anhydrous ammonia is minimized.  The program has been written to reduce\nthe potential of an accidental release due to human error or equipment failure.  In order to prevent\nthe release of anhydrous  ammonia due to human error, the Facility's prevention program ensures\nthat operating procedures are current and reviewed annually.  Training also plays a vital part in the\nprogram.  Employees and contractors working near or on the three processes are required to be\ntrained in the processes and the hazards of anhydrous ammonia.   \n\nTo prevent equipment failure that could result in a release, the Facility's program ensures that\nequipment inspections, tests, and preventive maintenance are performed in accordance with accepted\nengineering practices, manufacturer's recommendations, and planned maintenance schedules.  \n\nAll existing and proposed future equipment has been designed according to applicable standards and\ncodes.  The Facility maintains records and documentation on equipment inspections and tests. \nPrecautions are taken to ensure that new equipment and processes are inspected and tested, that all\nchanges on the processes are authorized, and employees are informed of changes.\n\nThe Facility performed Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) to address the facility hazards and to\nevaluate and control where the potential for a release exists.  Employees were involved in\ndetermining hazards of the processes and subsequent consequences.  \n  \nActive employee participation will ensure the success of the RMP at the Facility.  Employees have\nbeen assigned various tasks to ensure that all elements of the RMP are implemented.  The Facility\nhas developed specific programs and forms to assist employees in performing, recording, and\ndocumenting the various elements of the RMP."

      "SummaryText": "In the event of a release, the Facility has implemented an Emergency Action Plan in compliance with\n29 CFR 1910.38.  The Facility is also included in the community emergency response plan. \nEmployees at the Facility do not respond to accidental releases, but coordinate with outside\nresponders.  Therefore, an Emergency Response Program is not required for the Facility.  In the\nevent that an anhydrous ammonia release occurs, all employees are required to evacuate the area and\nreport the incident.  The Emergency Action Plan consists of evacuation procedures, facility\nemergency numbers, and coordination with the Umatilla and Lake County Fire Departments.  The\nplan also addresses notification procedures to the public and the local emergency response agency."
