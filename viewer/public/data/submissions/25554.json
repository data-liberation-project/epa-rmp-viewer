If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Albany Fire Department, or other authorities, to minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  \n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for crop nutrients.  The maximum quantity stored would be 131,325 pounds in one 30,000 gallon storage tank.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a transport truck vessel containing 53,000 pounds.  The worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank over ten minutes.  The maximum quantity would be 131,325 pounds representing 85 percent of the capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 3.10 miles.  The alternate release scenario based on the two minute release from a break in a three inch transfer hose.  The distance to the end point would be >81 miles.\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety National Standards Institute, Inc. and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.  \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of Anhydrous Ammonia in the past five years at this site.  The Upsala Coop Assn. has a written plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38; provided state and local authorities with emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA III (EPCRA).  Upsala Coop Assn. will coordinate this plan with the local emergency responders.  Safety improvements are an on going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to access the maintenance of safety conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safe"
