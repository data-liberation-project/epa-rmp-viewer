This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention (e.g., training of personnel, considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility, etc.).  Our approach is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances as well as other substances.  If a release does occur, our trained personnel will take steps to control and contain it.  Additional details are included in other sections of this RMPlan.  \n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \nThis facility, located about 33 miles Northeast of Kemmerer, Wyoming, consists of one Program Level 3 process which utilizes several operations (e.g., separation, dehydration, compression, cryogenic) to produce methane, carbon dioxide, helium from a naturally occurring hydrocarbon gas mixture.  This facility could contain regulated refrigerant propane and a regulated toxic, hydrogen sulfide, in excess of the threshold quantities established in the regulation.  Transportation of regulated flammables and toxics is handled into the facility via pipeline and trucks and out of the facility via trucks and pipelines.  This facility is surrounded by unoccupied high plains desert.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\nSpecifics concerning Offsite Consequence Analyses are contained in the RMPlan Data Element Sections 2, 3, 4 and 5.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at this facility.  Because processes at the facility regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation are also subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes t"

Examples of employee participation range from updating/compiling technical information and drawings to participating on process hazard analysis (PHA) and incident investigation teams.  Employees have access to all information related to the accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are detailed in an Employee Participation Plan that is maintained at the facility and addresses each program element.  In addition, this facility has other initiatives that address process and employee safety issues (e.g., hazard reporting/resolution process and numerous safety meetings [daily, monthly, pre-job], etc.).\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\nThis facility keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the facility.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, safe operating limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The Engineering group on-site is responsible for coordinating the PSI updates.\n\nChemical-specific information (including exposure hazards, emergency response, and exposure treatment considerations) is provided in material safety data sheets.  For specific process areas, this facility has documented safety-related operating limits for process parameters (e.g., temperature, pressure, level).  This facility ensures processes are maintained within these limits using process controls/monitoring equipment, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems, pressure relief valves).\n\nThis facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and constructio"

This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for inspection/maintenance activities and the evaluation of proposed process or facility changes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\nThis facility has a comprehensive program to help ensure hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nIn the most recent PHA cycle, the facility utilized a knowledge-based Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) analysis technique that is recognized by industry as an acceptable hazard evaluation technique for PSM-covered processes.  The analyses are conducted using a team of plant operating/maintenance personnel and facility engineers, and technical consultants (as necessary).  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the processes as well as the accident prevention and mitigation measures.  \n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to management to coordinate further evaluation and resolution.  This process involves field level business teams, which include engineering personnel, operations personnel, and management.  Operating personnel are also involved in the evaluation of resolution options.  Implementation of the resolutions is prioritized for accomplishment based on a relative risk.  All resolution plans are tracked until completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure the process controls and/or hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design, this facility updates and revalidates the process hazard analysis at least every 5 years.  The results of these updates are also documented and retained.  Similarly, the team's findings are forwarded"

Procedures are readily available to operators and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.  These procedures provide a consistent basis for training new operators and are annually reviewed and validated.  Procedures are maintained current/accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nTraining\nTo complement the written operating procedures, this facility has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating process equipment.  New employees receive basic training in facility operations (e.g., process overview, applicable procedure reviews, etc.).  New operators are then paired with experienced operators (i.e., subject matter experts) to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After the new operators demonstrate (e.g., hands-on skills demonstration) that they have adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they are certified and allowed to work independently.  In addition, all personnel who operate process equipment receive refresher training at least every 3 years on the applicable procedures to help ensure their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This training and the means used to verify that the employee understood the training is documented for each employee.\n\nContractors\nThis facility uses contractors to supplement its workforce for routine maintenance and construction.

This is accomplished by providing contractors an orientation prior to their working in the facility which includes (1) process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) applicable emergency action plan provisions, and (4) information on safe work practices.  Also, a job safety analysis is reviewed/updated or developed by the contractors (with facility personnel assistance as needed) prior to maintenance/construction tasks.\n\nFacility personnel routinely monitor contractor job performance to help ensure they are fulfilling their safety obligations.  Contractor safety programs/performance are evaluated during the initial selection process, and the facility supervisor conducts periodic evaluations of safety performance.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSR)\nThis facility conducts a PSSR for any modification that requires a significant change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure that construction is in accordance with the design specifications and all supporting systems are operationally ready.
