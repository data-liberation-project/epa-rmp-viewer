The facility uses ammonia in the refrigeration system.  Use of \nammonia is regulated under the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA), Section 112(r), and the United States \nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) Accidental Release Prevention Risk Management (RM) Planning \nregulations (40 CFR, Part 68) herein referred to as the RM regulations.  Under the CAAA and the RM \nregulations, the facility is considered to be a stationary source.  The regulated toxic chemical at the \nstationary source is ammonia.\n\nThis document addresses the five EPA regulatory requirements for a RM Plan which form the basis of the \nRM program for the Memphis facility.  EPA?s five key regulatory requirements for a RM program are:\n\n1) Management Plan\n2) Hazard Assessment\n3) Accidental Release Prevention Program\n4) Emergency Response\n5) Risk Management (RM) Plan and Data Elements\n\nThis RM plan is based on the requirements listed above and is organized to reflect them in five sections.  \nRequirement 1.  Management Plan\nThe EH&S Manager is responsible for the accidental release prevention program for the ammonia refrigeration process at the Memphis facility and is assisted by the PSM Coordinator as well as by the Corporate Sr. EHS Manager responsible for the RM program at the corporate level.  Utility supervisors, maintenance supervisors, operators, engineers, and staff level personnel also execute component activities to maintain compliance with RM regulations.  At Memphis, individuals have been assigned responsibility for all five requirements of the RM program, including management, hazard assessment, prevention, emergency planning, and RM plan updates.  THE EH&S Manager reports to the Director, Quality Control and EH&S, who in turn reports to the Vice President, Plant Manager, Memphis Brewery.  \n\nIn the past five years, none of the processes su"

Prevention Program\nThe Memphis facility has a chemical release prevention program for ammonia.  The prevention programs \nfor the ammonia process were developed to comply with Occupational Safety and Health Administration \n(OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations (29CFR 1910.119).  Key provisions of the release \nprevention program are as follows.\n\nFor the ammonia refrigeration process (which is subject to the PSM standard), EPA requires a Program 3 \nprevention program with 12 specific elements as listed below and described in Section 3.0:\n\n- Employee Participation\n- Process Safety Information\n- Process Hazard Analysis\n- Operating Procedures\n- Contractors\n- Pre-Startup Safety Review\n- Training\n- Mechanical Integrity\n- Hot Work Permit\n- Management of Change\n- Incident Investigation\n- Compliance Audits\n\nRequirement 4.  Emergency Response \nThe emergency response program at the facility is initiated by CBC personnel who are all trained to \nrecognize ammonia releases and immediately inform the Safety Department.  Additionally, ammonia gas sensors/alarms \nare present at five locations that automatically trigger audible alarms and alert the Security Department and Powerhouse if \nammonia is detected.  Employees contact Security using phone or in-plant radio.  CBC personnel not carrying radios who notice a release are to clear the area immediately and contact Security.\n\nThe Security Department has trained individuals  who are sent to the scene to assess the situation and engage the proper internal and external emergency response personnel and equipment.  When external emergency responders arrive, a joint command is then established which is led by the authority having jurisdiction (AHJ), and supported by the Safety Department, and CBC personnel who know the affected process "
