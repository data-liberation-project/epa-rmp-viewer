This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Hobbs Fractionation Complex located in Gaines County, Texas, operates a variety of processes to fractionate petroleum products (e.g., ethane, propane) from a NGL mix.  The Hobbs Fractionation Complex has several regulated flammables. In August 2002, processing equipment was added at the facility for extracting inert gases and moisture from the process gas stream so pipeline product specifictions could be met. \n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant.  Because processes at the plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Hobbs Fractionation Complex encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard anyalsis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created"

Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the plant and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiates include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from operations, maintenance, and plant management.  \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Hobbs Fractionation Complex keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.  \n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in key process parameter documents.  The plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.

This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Hobbs Fractionation Complex has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Wiithin this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \n\nThe Hobbs Fractionation Complex primarily uses the What If, Checklists, and What If/Checklist combined analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The What If, Checklists, and What If/Checklists combined analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process "

The results and findings from these updates are documneted and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.  \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Hobbs Fractionation Complex maintains written procedures that address various modes of operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nIn addition, the Hobbs Fractionation Complex maintains key process parameter documents that provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Hobbs Fractionation Complex has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees received basic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operato"

After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conduced at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Hobbs Fractionation Complex uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Hobbs Fractionation Complex evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfillilng their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe Hobbs Fractionation Complex conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.

Examples of these include, (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (I.e., hot work) and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe Hobbs Fractionation Complex has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed  to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.  \n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Hobbs Fractionation Complex promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably co"

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts, and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Hobbs Fractionation Complex periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until lthey are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.  \n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at the Hobbs Fractionation Complex have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The following is a description of existing safely features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.  \n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied "

Collectively, these prevention program activities help potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe Hobbs Fractionation Complex has the following safety features to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\nRelease Detection\n\n1.  Hydorcarbon detectors with alarms\n2.  Perimeter Monitoring \n\n Release Containment  / Control :\n1.  Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases.\n\n2.  Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual and automated).\n\n3.  Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature)\n\n4.  Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases.\n\n5.  Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system).\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n1. Trained emergency response personnel.\n\n2. Personal protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing).\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Hobbs Fractionation Complex has no accidents within the past 5 years.    \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe Hobbs Fractionation Complex maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and postincident cleanup and decontamination "

In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to plant processes.  The emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Hobbs Fractionation Complex is coordinated with the Gaines County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Hobbs Fractionation Complex has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Hobbs Fractionation Complex conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and the plant provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the plant.  \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Hobbs Fractionation Complex resolves findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.  The following types of changes are planned in response to PHA, safety audit, and incident investigation findings:\n\n\n* Revisions to personnel training programs.\n\n* Revised written operating procedures in the Depropanizer and Deethanizer area.\n\n* Review and revise Emergency Action Plan\n\n* Resolve and closeout PSM"
