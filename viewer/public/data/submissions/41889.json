We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\n* A description of our facility and use of substances required by EPA's RMP regulation and the processes involved\n\n* A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n\n* Emergency Response Programs\n\n* General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n* A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals at the Mankato Terminal that are regulated by EPA?s RMP rule.  \n\n\n\nFacility Description\n\n\n\nThe Mankato Terminal is a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) pipeline and propane storage/loading facility.  The process is regulated by Federal OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.  We have entered the facility as an RMP Program Level 3 facility.\n\n\n\nThe Mankato Terminal has three pipelines that are routed through the facility and are regulated by the Department of Transportation.  These three pipelines are in part, a mix product line (natural gasoline, naphtha, normal butane, iso-butane and propane), a dedicated propane line and a dedicated anhydrous ammonia line which is owned by Magellan Midstream Partners L.P. (Magellan) and operated by Enterprise Products Operating L.P.  In addition, the facility receives propane from the pipeline to four 90,000 gallon capacity storage tanks.  These tanks are used for distribution"

Since Magellan owns this portion of the process, a separate RMP will be filed for these assets.  In addition to the same ammonia system, a portion of the ammonia product can be routed to a cold storage tank which is owned and operated by Koch Nitrogen Company (Koch) with limited operations by Enterprise.  Koch is accountable to file their own RMP for their assets and therefore is only mentioned for the purpose of the facility description.\n\n\n\nAll of the previously mention tanks are administratively controlled to hold and not exceed a maximum capacity of 80%.\n\n\n\nIn our process we use the following chemicals that the EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequence in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\n\n\nToxics\n\n\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is transported and stored at the facility but is owned by Magellan and will be reported in detail on their RMP report.\n\n\n\nFlammables\n\n\n\nPropane is a finished product which can be delivered into four storage tanks via the dedicated propane pipeline, or the mixed product pipeline.  This material is routed from these tanks to the truck transport loading docks for whole sale to propane retailers.\n\n\n\nA small quantity of Ethyl Mercaptan is used to stench the propane at the truck transport docks.\n\n\n\nKey Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\n\n\nThe EPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case scenarios(s) and alternative release scenario(s) for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario.\n\n\n\nWorst Case Release Scena"

Regulated Toxic Chemical\n\n\n\nAt the present time there are no regulated toxic chemicals to report for the Mankato Terminal.\n\n\n\nWorse Case Scenario ? Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\n\n\nThis simulation involves the rupture or failure of the propane storage tanks resulting in a simulated vapor cloud explosion.  Inventory from all four tanks are simulated due to the proximity of the tanks relative to mitigation to the simulation.  This scenario would not be mitigated due to the type of scenario modeled.  All emergency response and early warning to the employees and the community would be exercised immediately if this were to occur.  The quantity and endpoint of the simulation and the specifics of the simulation are available in the specified reporting of the Risk Management Plan\n\n\n\nAlternate Case Scenario ? Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\n\n\nThe alternate release scenario is a simulated rupture of the supply pipe to the loading docks resulting in a ten minute release and simulated vapor cloud explosion.  This scenario assumed the pump continued to operate at a rate of approximately 500 gallons per minutes (gpm) for 10 minutes after the line break.  The simulation calculated that 30,500 pounds of material were released in the assumed time frame.  Mitigation measures were taken into account when selecting the alternative release scenario.  This consisted of reviewing the use of relief valves, check valves, manual shutoff valves, automatic shutoffs, startup and operating procedures, grounding equipment, and excess flow devices.  This scenario would be mitigated due to the type of scenario modeled.  Activation of the Emergency Shutdown Devices would isolate the source of the material and secure the facility.

The program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting the workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, the plan is coordinated with the Blue Earth County Emergency Management Director, which includes the local Police department, Sheriff?s Department, Fire Department, and Emergency Medical Service.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the local Enterprise personnel are trained to sound the alarm, shut off the source from a safe location or activate the emergency shutdown system, contact 9-1-1 and secure the area.  The 9-1-1 system is used to notify the Blue Earth County Sheriff?s Department and local Fire Departments.  Remote activation can also be accomplished from Houston Control which has area video cameras with dial up access.  In addition, there are local gas detection systems that alarm locally and in Houston Control.  If these detectors annunciate, the facility can be shutdown remotely from Houston Control or locally by Operation.  A third party contractor, 3E is under contract to effectively contact the necessary agencies if required.  \n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nEnterprise Products takes a systematic, protective approach to preventing accidental release of hazardous chemicals.
