      "SummaryText": "3387 LDEQ Facility ID Number\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Ferro Corporation, Baton Rouge Site has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the  resources invested in accident prevention, such as the training of personnel and consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.   If, in spite of all precautions, a  release does occur, Ferro's trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDescription of the Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nFerro Baton Rouge manufactures, processes and stores specialty chemicals in Zachary, East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana and evaluated the facility to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded threshold quantities.  Based on process knowledge, Ferro identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site.  The facility uses six regulated substances in five separate processes.  The chemicals and largest quantity on site (either as largest quantity in a single process or total quantity of mixtures) are: acetaldehyde (37,000 lbs); ethyl chloride (74,000 lbs); formaldehyde (60,000 lbs); methyl chloride (220,000 lbs); phosphorus tricloride (88,000 lbs); and 2-methylpropene (50,000 lbs.).\n\nIn addition, Ferro Baton Rouge is subject to Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) and is classified under a listed SIC Code (2869).  Therefore, the five Ferro Baton Rouge processes are classified as Program 3 processes under the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program.\n\nWorst-Case Scenarios\n\nFlammable Substances:      The endpoint for the worst-case release of flammable substances is 1 pound per square inch (psi) over pressure (i.e., 15.7 psia) for vapor cloud explosions.  The ARP Program requirement for flammables as"

The distances to the endpoint of 1 psi over pressure for the worst-case release of 2-methylpropene using the EPA lookup table is 0.27 miles.\n\nToxic Substances:      Toxic endpoints are listed in Appendix A to 40 CFR Part 68 (Table of Toxic Endpoints).  Each of the three regulated toxic substances at Ferro Baton Rouge was reviewed to determine the substance with the greatest distance to endpoint.  Based on the EPA lookup tables, a worst-case release of methyl chloride results in a distance to the toxic endpoint of approximately 3 miles.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios\n\nAlternative release scenarios are those that are more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.  Alternative release scenarios for toxic substances should be those that lead to concentrations above the endpoint beyond the facility's fence line.  Conditions considered for alternative release scenarios are: a release rate dependent upon scenario; use of typical meteorological conditions at the stationary source; the actual release height; and consideration of active and passive mitigation systems.\n\nFlammable Substances:     A single alternative release scenario for all flammable substances is required under the ARP Program.  A hypothetical release scenario has been identified for ethyl chloride as follows.  A 2-inch nozzle on the ethyl chloride tank breaks off, allowing release of the contents into the tank dike.  The ethyl chloride will vaporize and may ignite in a vapor cloud explosion.   The distance to the 1 psi over pressure endpoint for the alternative-case release of ethyl chloride using the EPA lookup table is 0.20 miles.\n\nToxic Substances:    One alternative release scenario for each toxic substance is required under the ARP program.  A hypothetical release scenario has been identified for the regulated toxic substances at Ferro to determine the distance to an endpoint for each.   Based on the EPA lookup tables, the substanc"

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as members of process hazard analysis (PHA) teams.  In addition, Ferro Baton Rouge has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\nThe Baton Rouge site has also implemented a Behavior Based Safety Program. This program enabled employees to observe work being performed and determine if any unsafe behaviors occur. This is done by reference of a checklist with the aid of Ferro Baton Rouge Site's Critical Behaior Inventory.\n\nProcess Safety Information:    Ferro Baton Rouge keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  Specific departments within the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. \n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  \n\nThe plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information ab"

This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA):    Ferro Baton Rouge has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure the adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nFerro Baton Rouge primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.   To help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, Ferro periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  \n\nOperating Procedures:     Ferro Baton Rouge maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operati"

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nTraining:     To complement the written procedures for process operations, Ferro Baton Rouge has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.   In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  \n\nContractors:    Ferro Baton Rouge uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, Ferro Baton Rouge evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs):    Ferro Baton Rouge conducts a PSS"

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity:    Ferro Baton Rouge has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include:  (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.   Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).

A hot work permit system is used to control potential ignition sources.    Other procedures include: confined space entry; lockout/tagout  to ensure isolation of energy sources; work permits to assure safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened; and personal protective equipment to provide employee protection.    Training of  personnel in safety procedures helps ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change:     Ferro Baton Rouge has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.  This system addresses changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  \n\nIncident Investigation:     Ferro Baton Rouge promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  \n\nCompliance Audits:     To help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Ferro Baton Rouge periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures "

Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members. \n\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe processes at Ferro Baton Rouge have hazards specific to the individual chemicals that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  These are addressed through operating procedures for the BzPA, DXA, DXL, Glymes and the Multi-Purpose Units.   In addition to other measures, flammable materials (2-Methylpropene and others) are stored and used under nitrogen blanket to prevent mixing with air which could form flammable mixtures.    Toxic substances are stored under pressure (methyl chloride) or under nitrogen blanket  (acetaldehyde) at lower pressures to prevent atmospheric venting or introduction of air or moisture (phosphorus trichloride). \nFerro Baton Rouge has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. \n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nFerro Baton Rouge has not had any accidental releases during the past five years which meet the criteria for an accidental release per 40 CFR 68.42.\n \nEmergency Response Program Information\n\nFerro Baton Rouge maintains a written emergency response plan to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment during an emergency.  The plan consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including first aid and medical treatment, evacuation and accounting for personnel, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, incident mitigation and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.
