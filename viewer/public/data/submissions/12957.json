The city Of Tuscaloosa has a population of 96,000 people and has water services for 130,000 people in the metropolitan area.\n     Tuscaloosa is the home of the University of Alabama, Stillman College, Mercedes Benz ATV plant, JVC Tape and Disc plant, and B.F. Goodrich Tire Manufacturing. There are a number of other large industries in Tuscaloosa that contribute to a pleasant life style.\n      The Ed Love Water Filtration Plant is a 45.6 million-gallon per day treatment facility. The treatment consist of Aluminum Sulfate (ALUM) and lime for settling solids from the raw water. Fluoride is added for the prevention of tooth decay and chlorine is added for disinfecting for bacteria.\n     The source of water is from Lake Tuscaloosa, which is a 40 billion-gallon impoundment and a very clean water source. Raw water turbidity averages about 6.0 NTU. The back up source for Lake Tuscaloosa is Lake Nicol at 4 billion gallons and Lake Harris, which is one billion gallons. \n     The water filtration plant is in an urban setting with the University of Alabama approximately one-mile from the facility. DCH Hospital, Tuscaloosa Middle School, Hampton Inn, apartment complexes, business offices, malls, and a maximum-security facility for the Mentally Ill are all within a mile to 1.5 miles of the facility.\n     The treatment plant utilizes chlorine in their disinfecting to prevent protozoa and virus that are present in water as well as Coliforms and bacteria. The plant has two one ton cylinders that are on line connected to a common header and consume approximately 1200 lbs.per day. The chlorine is in liquid form and is vaporized and fed into the post chemical mixer and into the finished water.\n     Maintenance operators and plant operators work daily on changing chlorine cylinders and follow the procedures for "

As cylinders are being changed out, the exhaust vent is energized to remove any fumes from the chlorine room. All operators and maintenance personnel check self-contained air supply and protective clothing in case there is a discharge. The scrubber is filled with a 12 % solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in order to neutralize the chlorine. The concentration of the sodium hydroxide is checked monthly to maintain the 12% solution.\n     All personnel are trained in chlorine safety and can repair minor problems such as leaking gasket, ruptured lines and small spills. An outside chlorine manufacture presents a training seminar at the Ed Love water facility yearly. Training tapes are reviewed monthly on chlorine safety and all new employees go through chlorine training.\n     In case of a worst-case scenario, and the plant experienced a major discharge, the LEPC, fire stations 2 and 4 and the police department are immediately notified. All personnel that are non-essential for chlorine spills are evacuated to prevent injuries. At the discretion of the LEPC, HAZMAT team and the police department and prevailing win conditions; a decision is made as to what areas are to be evacuated and to a predetermined safe distance. The release if gas will be contained to the best of everyone' ability as a HAZMAT team works to neutralize the discharge. After the discharge is neutralized, an assessment will be made as to the extent of damage and injuries or loss of life if applicable. The Ed Love water treatment facility has no releases in the last five- (5) years and has never had a major release.\n     There are 30 full time employees at the Ed Love plant and the plant is owned and subsidized by the city of Tuscaloosa's city government. The city of Tuscaloosa consists of a city council and mayor form of government with six (6) city council members and the mayor.\n   "

      "SummaryText": "  The city government approves budgets for the water treatment plant and all cost that are incurred by the water plant as far as meeting regulatory compliance are approved by the city. It is important that the city stay abreast of all compliance regulations and any laws that are enacted that impact the city as far as water quality and changes in said quality.\n     The city is performing a feasibility study to bring the plant up to a 67 million-gallon per day plant to meet future demands for the growth of Tuscaloosa. All revelant laws and regs. wll be implemented to keep the city of Tuscaloosa's water in excellent condition and also keep the public informed as to all changes.\n     We will continue to work with EPA, ADEM, and the local LEPC to make sure that we comply"
