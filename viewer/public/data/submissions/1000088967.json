Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Brenntag Mid-South, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement\n\nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are coordinated with REIDSVILLE FIRE DEPARTMENT which provides trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  \n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled Our facility's primary activities encompass Storage and Distribution of chemical products. We have 3 regulated substances present at our facility. These substances include Chlorine, Aqua Ammonia (Ammonium Hydroxide Solution) and Sulfur Dioxide. All three (3) products are received prepackaged in containers, warehoused and resold to our customers. The maximum intended inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 118,000 lbs., Aqua Ammonia - 110,235 lbs. and Sulfur Dioxide - 60,000 lbs.\n\n\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps Our facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. The following sections briefly describe the elements of our release prevention program that are in place at our stationary source. \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nBrenntag Mid-South, Inc. maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.
