This commitment is demonstrated by the significant use of resources expended in process control equipment, employee training, and management oversight.  Hanover Foods uses a written safety policy that outlines our concern and commitment to safety.\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nHanover Foods is a diverse processor of fresh, frozen, and canned food product.  The Clayton, Delaware facility, the subject of this RMP, processes frozen foods only.  The plant uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant due to it's unique properties.  The ammonia refrigeration system consists of a main receiver, three additional receivers, seven freezers, three cold storage units, two chiller rooms, and associated piping and process control equipment.  The maximum amount of ammonia in the system at any time is 91,385 pounds.  Ammonia is the only EPA RMP regulated substance exceeding the threshold quantity at the site.  The ammonia refrigeration system falls under Prevention Program 3 of the RMP.\n\nWorst Case and Alternate Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case scenario is the catastrophic release of 18,000 pounds of ammonia from the main receiver, which is the largest vessel in the system.  In accordance with the RMP regulation, the release was modeled over a 10 minute period with no mitigating factors.  The distance to the toxic endpoint would reach off-site receptors.  EPA's model, RMP*Comp, was used in calculating the extent of the release.\n\nBecause of the probability of the worst-case scenario is minute, EPA allows calculation of an alternative release scenario.  Hanover Foods alternate release scenario has a greater chance of occuring than the worst-case scenario.  Hanover Foods's alternative release scenario is a relief valve lifting on the Frigo-pak pump package receiver.  Ammonia would be released at an estimated 42.8 pounds per minute for 60"

RMP*Comp was used in calculating the distance to the toxic endpoint.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nHanover Foods understands the risks of using ammonia, and has several active programs in place to mitigate any potential problems.  We are subject to OSHA Process Safety Management, and utilize the 12 elements, including process hazard analysis, standard operating procedures, and employee training, to manage our system.  All changes are reviewd by our management of change system, and process hazard reviews are conducted before being place into operation.  We also have in place a computerized preventive maintenance program.  This facility is staffed by qualified refrigeration personnel 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.\n\nHanover Foods has in place an ammonia detection / ventilation control system in the main engine room.  We also have ammonia detectors in each of the three cold storage freezers, one in the Wet Pack production room, and one in the Frigo-pak compressor room.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nHanover Foods has had one release in the last five years that was deemed reportable by the EPA standard of 100 pounds.  There were no on-site deaths, injuries, or property damage, or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering-in-place.  The reportable release occurred inside of one of our cold-storage freezers.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nHanover Foods maintains a written emergency response plan that includes evacuation procedures, emergency coordinator responsibilities, notification procedures, and emergency medical procedures.  We have a fully staffed and trained emergency response team that would respond to an ammonia emergency at the site.  Our team receives annual training on emergency response.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nHanover Foods provides ongoing training to its emplo"
