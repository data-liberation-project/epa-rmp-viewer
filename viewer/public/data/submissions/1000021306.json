      "SummaryText": "Carpenter Co., Conover, NC was built, in 1972, to produce comfort cushioning for the home furnishings industry.  The flexible polyurethane foam manufacturing process has been expanded, modified and upgraded several times over the years in order to improve the process, both with respect to equipment and with respect to chemistry, to conform to changing government regulations, and to meet ever increasing and changing needs of our customers.  It is this process that is subject to RMP requirements.  Bonded and un-bonded fiber batting is also manufactured and foam is fabricated at this facility.\n\nThe original Risk Management Program (RMP) for Carpenter Co., Conover was prepared and submitted in June 1999.  Federal regulations in 40 CFR Part 68 requires a periodic review and resubmittal when significant changes are made and a mandatory resubmittal is required every 5 years.  The 5 year resubmittal was prepared and submitted to the EPA in electronic form in June of 2004.  In 2006, a new pouring line was constructed and began operation on July 12, 2006.  The old line remained as a specialty production line for foams that could not, at that time, be manufactured on the new line.  The RMP was revised and resubmitted in March of 2007 to reflect the addition of this new line to the pouring process.\n  \nThrough continuous process and formulation development, the new line became capable of producing all foams in our product line. The old line, the only process using our sole Program Level 3 material pentane, produced its last batch of foam on April 3, 2009 and is was scrapped.  The pentane supply was removed from our tank on July 9, 2009.  That left toluene diisocyanate (TDI - an 80%/20% mix of the 2,4 and 2,6 isomers) as the only remaining RMP regulated substance in this process.\n\nWhile much of the process, facility and regulatory information remained the same, the removal of the old line and pentane was a significant change, under the RMP rule, necessitating an RMP resubmission "

This resubmittal was certified on September 4, 2009.\n\nIncreasing customer demand for certain specialty foams lead Carpenter to begin experimenting with the use of comparatively small quantities of pentane, in addition to the existing CO2 auxiliary blowing agent (ABA), in late 2010.  This enhanced ABA mix has proved successful and has become standard for these specialty foams.  For purchasing and logistical reasons, Carpenter plans to switch to full tanker load deliveries of pentane in the future.  This RMP resubmittal reflects this planned change - which will bring our on site inventory of pentane above the 10,000 lb threshold for RMP inclusion.\n\n1. Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\nCarpenter Co. is committed to comply fully with all federal, state, and local rules and regulations regarding the proper handling, use, storage, and emergency response preparedness to prevent accidental release of chemicals, toxic or otherwise. Furthermore, Carpenter Co. is committed to protecting the health and welfare of its employees and community residents - as well as protecting the environment.\n\nAn Emergency Response procedure for Carpenter Co., Conover has been developed and is located in the Contingency Plan.  This plan includes the procedures for informing the public and emergency response agencies when an accidental release occurs, documentation of proper first-aid and emergency medical treatment necessary to treat accidental human exposure, and procedures and measures for emergency response after an accidental release of a regulated substance.\n\n2.

      "SummaryText": "corporates the use of TDI as a reactant to produce the foam product.\n\nTDI is received primarily via railcars which hold approximately 190,000 lbs - although tank trucks may be used if conditions warrant.  These railcars are usually delivered directly to the TDI unloading station inside the plant. When required, the rail carrier moves a queued railcar from an outside holding area to the indoor unloading station.  Transfer hoses and associated equipment are connected and the unloading process is initiated.  TDI is transferred from the railcar to three 12,000 gallon storage tanks located in the interior tank farm near the pouring station.  From these tanks, TDI is transferred to a 30,000 gallon tank which feeds the pouring process.  All 4 TDI tanks are located in concrete secondary containment.  TDI is pumped from the storage tank to the pouring lines through a strainer, filter and heat exchanger prior to entry into the mix head.  In the mix head, TDI is combined with polyol, CO2 (for some foams), pentane (specialty foams) water and other minor raw materials to initiate the foam production reaction.\n\nPentane is used, in small quantities, to supplement the CO2 ABA in some specialty foam recipes.  It is received by the facility in tank trucks which are offloaded in a dedicated, secondary contained, unloading area adjacent to the outdoor storage tank.  The pentane tank is a 30,000 gallon commercial propane-type located within reinforced concrete secondary containment.\n\n3.The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and all applicable North Carolina requirements.  This facility complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management program for pentane.  The pentane tank and unload areas are covered in the facility's Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures (SPCC) plan - as well as our Industrial Storm Water Discharge General Permit and its required Storm Water Pollutio"

Carpenter - Conover's Risk Management Program (when a Level 3) was the subject of two dedicated inspections by the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources - Division of Air Quality, the last in December of 2005, and found to be in complete compliance with this rule.  Our Program Level 1 program was last inspected by NCDENR-DAQ on September 21, 2010 and found in compliance.  Personnel training with protective equipment and practice drills for emergencies and spill response are an important part of our safety and preventive measures.\n\nAll chemical tanks are equipped with electronic overfill alarms with automatic pump shutoff. The TDI tanks are all vented though a bank of activated charcoal filters to remove all TDI vapors.  The pentane tank is under an automatic nitrogen pad and uses a closed vapor-balancing system so no vapors are released at any time.  This process is equipped with a continuous TDI vapor monitor with electronic and audible alarms.  The pentane system has flammable vapor sensors at the unload pad, tank / transfer pump & secondary containment, metering pump, curing area and 2 sensors on the process line.  These sound audible, visual and electronic alarms and will automatically shut down the foam manufacturing process if vapors approach flammable levels at any sensor. \n\n4.
