The Risk\r\nManagement Program requires facilities that use certain substances\r\nabove certain quantity thresholds to develop a plan to reduce the\r\nlikelihood of an accidental release of the substances to the\r\natmosphere and reduce the likelihood of serious harm to the public\r\nand the environment.

This RMP document summarizes the existing safety\r\nsystems, policies, procedures, and on-going actions that are\r\ndesigned to prevent or minimize impacts of accidental releases of\r\nchlorine or sulfur dioxide to the environment.

Wastewater from St. Paul,\r\nMinneapolis, and sixty other surrounding communities is treated\r\nat the Metro Plant and discharged into the Mississippi River.\r\nThe wastewater treatment process includes preliminary screening,\r\nprimary settling and treatment, advanced secondary treatment and\r\nclarification, and chlorination and dechlorination before final\r\ndischarge. The Metro Plant treats approximately 225 million\r\ngallons of wastewater per day. The Metro Plant has a\r\nchlorination system"

Leak\r\nalarms activate an audible alarm throughout the plant as well as\r\na red flashing warning light in the storage areas and in the\r\nplant tunnels.

They are transported on roads, water, and railways.\r\nThe Metropolitan Council's Metropolitan Wastewater Treatment Plant\r\n(Metro Plant) stores chemicals that it uses in its daily\r\noperations. The facility currently uses chlorine stored in up to\r\ntwo 90-ton railroad tank cars and sulfur dioxide in stored in two\r\n50,000-pound bulk storage tanks. Chlorine is used to disinfect the\r\ntreated wastewater and the sulfur dioxide is used to remove\r\nresidual chlorine, or dechlorinate the treated wastewater to\r\nprotect organisms in the river when it is discharged.\r\n\r\nChlorine and sulfur dioxide are non-explosive and non-flammable.\r\nHowever, they support combustion under some circumstances. They\r\nare both respiratory irritants, and if accidentally released into\r\nthe environment, exposure through inhalation or through eye or\r\nskin contact can pose a health risk. As a precaution, the Metro\r\nPlant has special safety systems that are an integral part of the\r\nchlorine and sulfur dioxide systems.\r\n\r\nThe Metropolitan Council takes its safety obligations in storing\r\nand using chemicals as seriously as providing the environment with\r\nsafe disinfected water. The following document describes the steps\r\nwe take every day to ensure a safely operating plant, what could\r\nhappen if there was an accidental release of a chemical stored on\r\nsite, and what to do in event of an emergency.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\n\r\nThis document complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection\r\nAgency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program, appearing in Se"

For\r\nchlorine and sulfur dioxide, the distance a set endpoint\r\nconcentration of the gas would travel must be determined. In\r\naddition, an estimate of the population that could be affected by\r\na release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide was determined and\r\nsensitive receptors such as hospitals, schools, and nursing homes\r\nwere identified. As required by the rules, the Hazard Assessment\r\nconsiders two release scenarios- a worst case and an\r\nalternative case.\r\n\r\nPrevention Program\r\nThe Prevention Program consists of 12 elements designed to\r\nimprove the system safety and decrease the likelihood of a\r\nrelease.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nThe participation of the Metro Plant staff in preparing the\r\nRMP/PSM program was critical to the program's successful\r\nimplementation.
