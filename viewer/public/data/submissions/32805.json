              "Description": "The chlorination system at the Pawtucket Water Purification Facility was completely rebuilt in 1997. The upgrade included changing from a pressure system to a complete vacuum system, therefore eliminating 99% of all pressurized piping and related equipment. New vacuum check valves were installed on the one ton chlorine cylinders. These units also incorporate double check valves to stop the flow of gas if a drop in vacuum pressure is detected. Each unit is tied into an outside air intake manifold designed to take in outside air under high vacuum conditions, or relieve high pressure. Chlorine sniffers monitor the rooms air quality 24 hours a day. If the sniffer detects 1 ppm of chlorine gas or greater, six alarms are triggered: two audible inside the facility, two audible alarms outside, and two red strobes outside the facility. An Emergency Response and Preparedness Plan has been developed that identifies emergency contacts, first responders, SOP's for chemical handling, and evacuation routes. All employees were trained with this plan and a meeting was held with the local fire department to review response procedures.",

Effective February 15, 2004, Earth Tech, Inc. has been contracted to operate the facility. The facility is located in Cumberland, RI at the terminus of the Diamond Hill, Arnolds Mills, Abbot Run, Robin Hollow, and Happy Hollow Reservoir system. The facility provides potable water to over 100,000 people in Pawtucket, Central Falls, and South Cumberland. The facility processes an average of 13 million gallons of water per day. As part of the treatment process, gaseous chlorine is used to eliminate pathogenic bacteria. The chlorine is stored onsite in 9 tanks with a capacity for 2,000 lbs each. The management at Earth Tech is committed to only undertaking activities that we can do without injuring people, damaging property, or impairing the environment. Part of our Safety Management System is to only employ techniques to assist in the recognition, evaluation, and control of hazards at all our projects. All appropriate actions are taken to ensure that these hazards are communicated to our customers, staff and partners that may be impacted. To minimize the likelihood of accidental release of hazardous chemicals, a comprehensive Hazard Communication Program has been implemented as part of the safety and accident prevention program. Elements of this program include: training of all appropriate personnel in the proper handling of chemicals in their respective work areas, development of a worksite inventory of all hazardous substances used at the site, procurement and organization of MSDS for each chemical, proper labeling of all hazardous chemicals according to appropriate regulations, weekly and monthly meetings that cover chemical handling, spill prevention, and emergency preparedness procedures. An Emergency Preparedness Plan has been prepared for the faciliity that identifies emergency notification procedures to employees and the public, additional HAZMAT resources, and standa"

Elements to our prevention program are engineering controls that  includes the use of chlorine sniffers for leak detection, audible and visual alarms, and the use of a complete vacuum system. The most critical element is training all personnel that use chemicals at our worksite to be competent persons. This facility has had no accidental releases over the last five years."
