As you can see we have already started a PSM program in 2006 even though we were below threshold levels. At this facility the ammonia is used in a closed refrigeration loop to condense CO2. We have 2 systems one with approximately 12000 # and the second with approximately 1000#. Both systems are equipped with automatic safety shutdown circuits for high pressure, low pressure, high and low temperature and electric overloads plus safety relief valves to prevent over pressure if all other systems fail. Although our facility is located close to the town of Winnebago (1/2 mile) it is also to the East side of the town. Prevailing winds for this area blow from West to East so on a normal day, if an incident did occur; the wind would be blowing away from town. At this facility we pride ourselves on the safe and accident free operation of our ammonia system."
