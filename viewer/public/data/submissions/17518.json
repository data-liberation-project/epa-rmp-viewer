      "SummaryText": "Glynn County Environmental Quality Department's Risk Management Plan for safe handling of chlorine involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices to monitor potential chlorine hazards and minimize the risk of accidental chlorine releases. All applicable procedures of 40 CFR 68.170 are addresses in the plan, which seeks to provide employee safety, public health, and response agency interaction.\n\nThe Glynn County Board of Commissioners owns and operates the wastewater treatment facility known as the St. Simons Island Water Pollution Control Plant. This plant utilizes chlorine to disinfect treated wastewater before discharge into Dunbar Creek. Chlorination processes include (liquid) chlorine cylinders, chlorination equipment, electrical equipment, and process safety equipment.\n\nThe worst-case scenario, as defined by the EPA, states that the owner or operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over 10 minutes. The alternative scenario is defined as more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario. In each case the modeling program RMP Comp was used to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to a theoretical toxic endpoint.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for the St. Simons Island Water Pollution Control Plant involves a failure of a one-ton cylinder yielding a cumulative release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine. When using the RMP Comp modeling program, the distance to toxic endpoint is 0.9 miles.\n\nThe alternative scenario for the St. Simons Island Water Pollution Control Plant involves a failure at flanges, joints, welds, valves and valve seals, and drains of bleeds in the chlorine piping system. Using a hole diameter of 1/2 inches and a release rate of 620 lbs/min the distance to toxic endpoint is 0.3 miles. This is based on RMP Comp modeling.\n\nThe Glynn County Environmental Quality Dept.
