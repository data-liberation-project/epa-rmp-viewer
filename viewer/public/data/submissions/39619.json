      "SummaryText": "The North Water Treatment Plant has been successfully providing water to the community of Columbus, Mississippi for several years.  Located on Johnson Road in northeast Columbus, the plant lies along the western bank of the Luxapallila River.  On average the plant treats 4.5 million gallons of groundwater per day and has the capacity to treat over 6 million gallons per day.  The Plant boasts of a flawless safety record with no accidents to report over the history of the facility.  This flawless safety record can be attributed to the awareness and conscientiousness of the administration and staff.\nTo further improve the overall safety of the plant, a Risk Management Plan has been developed for chlorine, a hazardous chemical used in the treatment process.  When dealing with hazardous chemicals, it is imperative to take all necessary precautions to protect the safety of the employees and the surrounding community.  The North Water Plant has accomplished this through constant employee safety training, the use of proper methods and equipment for handling chlorine, and the preparation of emergency response procedures.\n\tChlorine is an essential chemical in the treatment of drinking water.  It is a strong disinfectant and is used in the treatment process to eliminate any pathogenic organisms in the final supply.  The chlorine at the North Plant is stored on-site in one-ton cylinders and 150-pound cylinders inside the chlorination building, located near the center of the facility.  A maximum inventory of 20,900 pounds can be found at the plant at one time.  The chlorination building serves to supply, meter, and apply the chlorine to the final water stream.  \n\tChlorine is listed by the EPA as an extremely hazardous substance (EHS.)  It has a characteristic penetrating odor and is greenish yellow in the gas phase and clear amber under pressure in the liquid phase.  Chlorine gas is primarily a respiratory irritant, while liquid chlorine will cause burning to the eyes and skin."

This program covers safety information, a review of potential hazards, operating procedures, employee training, and maintenance of equipment.  It is essential to have up-to-date and complete information available on these topics to protect the employees and the surrounding community by eliminating possible hazardous situations.  The North Water Treatment Plant keeps current material safety data sheets on chlorine available to the staff at all times.

Possible hazards identified include toxic releases, overpressurization of a cylinder, and equipment failure.  Safeguards in place to protect against these hazards include vent lines, manual shutoff valves, fire resistant walls, and the fact that the cylinders are stored inside a building.  Emergency air supply is also available for employees in the case of a release.
