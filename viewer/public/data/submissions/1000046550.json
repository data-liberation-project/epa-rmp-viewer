Material flow is controlled/shut off by flow sensors in case of an accidental hose rupture or disconnect.  \n\n\n\nThe gas house is a separate building, away from the main manufacturing process and has gas vapor sniffers installed to sense low (LEL) and high (UEL) vapor levels.  In the event that the vapor levels (LEL) would be reached, an audible alarm is sounded. If the vapor level continue to rises, the system is designed to automatically shut down.  ",

Due to increasing operations, aerosol products are expanding to this Venoy facility.  Aerosol products will be packaged using different propellent blends of propane, isobutane, and butane.  In addition, DME is sometimes used.  It is American Jetway's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations in the handling of these propellents.  Safety depends on the manner in which we handle the propellents and solvents combined with the safety devices built into the process and facility.  Safety is a priority at our facility and training programs are continually reviewed and updated.  Training to personnel is continous through safety meetings, observations and annual refresher training.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program includes procedures for notification of plant personnel as well as community response teams such as:  the local fire and police, federal, state, and hospital emergency response personnel, Detroit Water and Sewerage Department and any potentially affected neighborhoods.\n\n\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to package aerosol products using flammable propellents and solvent blends.  Propellents will be received at the facility in tankers and stored in 5 Above ground Storage Tanks (ASTs)( 1-12,000 gallon AST, and 4 -6,000 gallon ASTs.   Solvents will be  stored in 2-10,000 gallon ASTs and 6-6,000 gallon ASTs.  The 6,000 gallon ASTs are split tanks of 3,000 gallons each. \n\n\n\nAccess to the facility is restricted as fencing exists around the perimeter of the property with a set of gates.  Visitors and contractors are required to check in at the main office.\n\n\n\n3.

Only trained and designated facility personnel are allowed to participate in unloading operations.  The ASTs are not filled more than 85% to prevent overfilling.\n\n\n\n4.  Five-year accident history:\n\n\n\nNot applicable, none to report.\n\n\n\n5.  The emergency response program\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program is in place per the facility's RCRA Emergency/Contingency Plan.  In the event of an emergency, the local, state, and federal authorities will be notified as needed.  Training is conducted regarding emergency procedures and response on an annual basis as well as drills are conducted annually.  The facility has an excellent relationship with local responders and they participate in the drills as well.\n\n\n\nThe following plans are in-place for different response scenarios:  Site Emergency Plan, Safety Rules for Office and Plant Personnel, Procedure for Propellent Tanker Offloading, RCRA Emergency/Contingency Plan, Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure Plan(SPCC)/Pollution Incident Prevention Plan (PIP). \n\n\n\n6.  Planned changes to improve safety\n\n\n\nRegulatory requirements are being reviewed regularly to ensure the facility is in compliance. Standard operating procedures are being updated to reflect the new equipment at this facility and training has been completed for initial personnel but will be given again to additional personnel once the process is up and running.  The process hazard analysis has been completed and recommendations are being reviewed.  Inspections are being completed by facility and local agency personnel and changes required by the agencies will be implemented, as needed.  "
