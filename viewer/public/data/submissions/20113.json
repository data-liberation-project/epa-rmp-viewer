This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.)To save lives.\n2.)To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.)To protect the environment.\n4.)To minimize property damage.\n\nAlliant Foodservice maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Alliant Foodservice ammonia refrigeration system has been in operation since 1989.  Changes/modifications have taken place since the completion of the facility with the most recent change occurring on November 22, 1999.  This change included the addition of evaporators for cold storage and processing areas.  The ammonia refrigeration process was designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.  The facility is located at 4650 W. Buckeye Road, Phoenix, Arizona 85043.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses 17,132 pounds of ammonia for dock operations, warehouse cold storage, and freezer storage.  The majority of the system is located in the machine room including vessels and compressors.  The condensers are mounted at ground level outside the machine room as well as the water tank, and all of the evaporators are located in their respective cold storage rooms/areas.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMM"

The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used: 1.5 meters/second wind speed, rural topography, and F stability.  The SLAB modeling program was used to calculate the downwind distance.  This release reaches off-site and could impact population receptors.  No environmental receptors are affected by this potential release.\n\n\nAlternative Release Result Summary\nScenario Description: A release of ammonia gas from a 1/4 inch diameter leak.  The release rate of ammonia due to the pressure of the tank is 100 pounds per minute.  The meteorological conditions used were 3 meters per second wind speed, rural topography, and D stability.  The SLAB modeling program was used to calculate the downwind distance.  This release reaches off-site, but is not likely to impact population receptors.  No environmental receptors are affected by this potential release.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Alliant Foodservice facility was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of ammonia refrigeration systems.  These safety features include a water diffusion tank, ammonia sensors in the machine room as well as sensors in selected cold storage areas, and automatic shut down systems.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the machine room or outside of the machine room (condensers).\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility will operate in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines.  In particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems.\"\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThis facility has been in operation since 1989 with the most recent change/mo"

This study provided the mitigation measures outlined below to improve safety at the Alliant Foodservice facility located at 4650 W. Buckeye Road, Phoenix, Arizona.  Recommendations R01 through R31 have been complete as of June 30, 1999.\n\nR01  Determine the concentration level at which ammonia sensors will activate the audible alarm.  A different alarm (buzzer) is activated for a compressor shut down.\n\nR02  Ensure that the emergency kill switch is adequately located outside of the engine room from the exit doors. Include the procedures for activating the kill switch and personnel responsible in the emergency response plan.\n\nR03  Establish a workable emergency response plan that includes an emergency coordinator, evacua"
