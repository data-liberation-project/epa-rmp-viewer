Clemens Terminal incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nClemens Terminal has developed a team-based defect elimination process known as TPM (Team Perfected Manufacturing).  The objective of this employee-driven process is to eliminate equipment failures through predictive and preventive maintenance.  As this process continues to mature, we expect continuous and substantial improvement in operating reliability and safety. \n\nSAFE WORK PRACTICES\nClemens Terminal has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a Lockout/Tagout Procedure to verify isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) procedures for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to confirm adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.

All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.  \n\nTo confirm that process controls and/or process hazards do not deviate significantly from the original design safety features, Clemens periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.

New employees receive basic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) that they have adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nCONTRACTORS\nClemens uses contractors as part of its regular work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to verify that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a Process Overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) Emergency Response Plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.

The purpose of the PSSR is to confirm that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make certain construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\nClemens Terminal has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) Emergency Response Plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure they can perform their job in a safe manner.

The terminal verifies the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).  \n\nClemens Terminal also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to confirm that safety features in the process are not compromised.  \n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\nThe Clemens Terminal facility has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \n\nClemens Terminal primarily uses the HAZard and OPerability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.

Typically, it is assumed the entire contents of the vessel are released instantaneously, thus calculating the distance to a 1 pound overpressure endpoint.  However, Clemens Terminal is an underground storage facility with large amounts of storage which cannot be emptied instantaneously.  Modeling was based upon a 10 minute release of a substance in the cavern through a failure of the above ground piping, which is the only piping that enters or exits the cavern.  This piping is considered the closest release point whereby the cavern contents can be released into the atmosphere.  Based on this modeling, our worst case scenario was a failure of the 8 piping on a NGL underground salt dome storage cavern.  In a 10 minute time period, 3,290,000 pounds of NGL would be released into the atmosphere resulting in a potential vapor cloud explosion.  Due to the piping configuration of the salt domes as stipulated by EPA General Guidance question and answers (Worst Case and Mitigation) 4-11, we have taken credit for passive mitigation.  The resulting vapor cloud explosion would reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.\n\nThe Alternate Release Scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at Clemens is a vapor cloud explosion resulting from the release of NGL from a 1 nipple failure of associated piping on above ground piping of a cavern (59,640 pounds released over a 7 minute period).  The release is expected to be isolated by the operators within 7 minutes (active mitigation).  This event was selected as being a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response.  This scenario has no offsite consequences.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\nThe following is a summary of the general accidental release prevention program in place at the Clemens Terminal.
