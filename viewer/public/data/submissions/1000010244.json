ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Lilly Technology Center (LTC) is committed to operating and maintaining all processes in a safe and responsible manner.  This is especially important for those processes using hazardous substances.  The Lilly Technology Center has numerous systems in place to manage these chemicals.  Lilly uses a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to ensure the safety of employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.  LillyA?s accidental release prevention programs and contingency planning efforts help effectively manage the hazards that are posed to employees, the public, and the environment by the use of these chemicals.\n\nThe Lilly Technology Center has an Integrated Contingency Plan that contains procedures on how to handle emergencies that occur.  This plan includes procedures for notification of local authorities and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.  Additionally, individual business units at the plant maintain local emergency response procedures which focus on the actions of local personnel in the event of an emergency.\n\nThe Lilly Technology Center plays an active role in its Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).

Through LEPC, citizens can obtain information about hazardous substances handled at local facilities and about emergency planning efforts designed to successfully cope with accidents if they occur.  LEPC maintains a coordinated emergency response plan for the community detailing operational procedures to be followed in the event of an accident involving hazardous materials.  The plan is available for public inspection.\n\nThe Lilly Technology Center actively supports community outreach efforts through Community Advisory Panels and neighbor groups.  These panels provide useful feedback from the community and advise Lilly on community issues.  Lilly also hosts plant tours and informative evening programs for nearby neighbors.\n\n2.  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nEli Lilly produces a variety of pharmaceutical products using a variety of chemicals and processing operations. Morris Street on the North, Harding Street on the West, and Raymond Street on the South bind the Lilly LTC Site, which is comprised of 224 acres.  LTC North was originally opened in 1946 and LTC South in 1968.  The following regulated substances are handled at LTC in quantities above the threshold quantities established under the RMP regulations:\n\nToxics:  Ethylenediamine\n\nFlammables:  None\n\n3.  GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Lilly Technology Center is subject to OSHAA?s Process Safety Management requirements, as well as other OSHA requirements.  The facility is also subject to regulations by other agencies, including the Indiana Department of Environmental Management and the United States Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nSpecific prevention programs include conducting pre-startup and design hazard assessments, proactive maintenance programs, routine ve"

Responsible CareA? began in 1989 as a collection of management practices that are organized around Codes of Management Practice.  The original code consisted of Community Awareness and Emergency Response and was complemented by five other codes by the end of 1992.  Those five codes are Distribution Safety, Employee Health and Safety, Pollution Prevention, Process Safety and Product Stewardship.  At Lilly our strategy has been to integrate the management practices associated with these 6 codes (there are a total of 106) into our health, safety and environmental management policy and principles as well as our global policy requirements.  Continuous improvement has been driven by annual self-evaluations of the codes. \n\nA A?newA? Responsible CareA? was rolled out by the American Chemistry Council in 2001, which responds to both public feedback about the initiative and the changing global economic and socio-political climate.  The A?newA? Responsible CareA? initiative has resulted in a Responsible CareA? Management System (RCMS) technical specification, which all member companies must implement and then seek external certification to verify implementation.  Furthermore, an additional Code of Management Practice was added to address chemical security.  As required by the Responsible Care initiative, all affected sites have completed security vulnerability assessments.  As a result of these assessments, action plans were developed to address critical items identified.  Corrective measures have been put into place, and members of local law enforcement were brought in to verify this as a third party.  The A?newA? Responsible CareA? also requires public disclosure of selected HSE metrics, a practice that was al"

FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nLTC has had no accidents as defined in 40 CFR 68.42 during the past five years.\n\n5.  THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nEmergency Management at Lilly Technology Center\nThe Lilly Technology Center emergency response plan is linked to the plans of the Marion County Emergency Planning Committee.  The siteA?s response is coordinated by plant security using the plantA?s emergency response teams and equipment.  The emergency response plan spells out the A?howsA? of emergency response and the roles and responsibilities of the incident response and management response teams.  It includes response procedures for each building/area of the plant.  Regular drills test readiness and help employees practice responses to alarms and incidents.  The emergency response plan has been written based upon the A?one-planA? EPA guidance and covers all topics based on that guidance.\n\nRapid Notify (RN) System\nThe Lilly Technology Center implemented an innovative community emergency notification system in 1996.

It also generates a report advising what phones were not answered.  In conjunction with the Marion County emergency planning organizations, Lilly tests the RN system annually.\n\nEmergency Response Team\nSite emergency response teams undergo regular training to meet Local, State, Federal and Company requirements. On-site training facilities and simulators facilitate the training process.  In an emergency situation, one of the site emergency coordinators, or his designate, becomes the incident commander.  The emergency response staff has the responsibility for maintaining the emergency response equipment.  Vehicles on-site include the following:  two ambulances, response van, response truck, hazardous materials response truck, rescue truck, fire engine and two on-site medical facilities.\n\nHazardous Material (HAZMAT) Team\nTeam members are employees who hold full-time jobs in other parts of the plant. There are approximately 70 people from various work shifts who make up this team. In addition there are three outside contract personnel per shift.  There are professionally trained responders always on site, and all responders wear pagers when not at work. Hazardous material response includes responding to hazardous spills or vapor releases.  Responders are trained to use proper equipment and techniques to stabilize a hazardous area and rescue employees who may need help.  This team undergoes rigorous monthly training in HAZMAT response.  About 1/3 of the HAZMAT team are also members of the Confined Space Rescue Team. \n\nConfined Space Rescue Team\nThis team specializes in rescue from tanks, pits, and other confined areas.

If additional resources are necessary, the Indianapolis Fire Dept is called to support the fire brigadeA?s response efforts.\n\n6.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Lilly Technology Center is committed to ongoing safety improvement.  A system to conduct Process Hazard Assessments is in place.  The system will assure Process Hazard Assessments are conducted for each of the appropriate processes at the Lilly Technology Center.\n\nIt is the practice of the Lilly Technology Center to reduce its hazards through the pursuit of inherently safer process design.  Specifically, in 2007, the site was able to substitute the use of sodium hypochlorite for elemental chlorine, and in 2009 the site was able to reduce its anhydrous ammonia inventory below the threshold quantity.  Further efforts to effectively manage and reduce risk will continue to be considered as appropriate.\n\nThe mechanical systems are routinely tested to insure proper operation and performance.  Any problems found are corrected and opportunities for improvements are noted and evaluated.\n\nPractice drills are also conducted to practice and improve the procedures for responding to emergencies."
