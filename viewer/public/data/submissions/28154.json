Five-year Accident History\r\nHelena Chemical Company has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the\r\nlast 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, no accidental release has occurred\r\nduring this period.\r\n\r\n  6. Emergency Response Plan\r\nHelena Chemical Company maintains a written emergency action plan to deal with accidental\r\nreleases of hazardous materials.

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nWe at Helena Chemical Company in Pennville  are strongly committed to employee, public, and\r\nenvironmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release\r\nprevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance,\r\nand employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement\r\nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  We coordinate our\r\nresponse efforts with the Pennville Fire Department, which provides additional emergency response\r\nexpertise.\r\n\r\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\r\nammonia stored in a 18,000- and 30,000 gallon tank at our facility in Pennville (Figure 1).The \r\nmaximum amount stored is 40,800 gallons (209,957  pounds) at the maximum storage capacity of\r\n85%.  The largest single storage vessel at our facility contains 131,223 pounds at 85% standard\r\nmaximum storage capacity.\r\n\r\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\r\nWe utilized RMP Comp for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite\r\nconsequence analysis for our facility.  The following details these scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of one of the \r\nlargest single anhydrous ammonia storage tanks (131,223 pounds) in gaseous form over a 10-minute\r\nperiod.  We anticipated that administrative controls or mitigation would not effect the release rate. \r\nAt Class F atmospheric s"
