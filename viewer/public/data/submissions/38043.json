Pursuant to this commitment, the City makes every effort to operate the wastewater treatment facilities in a safe manner, in accordance with all applicable rules and regulations and according to established good engineering and management principles.  \n\n\n\nThe Baton Rouge South Wastewater Treatment Plant (SWWTP) was designed by qualified and experienced engineers and all operating personnel received the necessary training for the safe operation of the plant.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES.\n\n\n\nThe SWWTP receives domestic wastewater from the south third of the City?s urban perimeter and provides secondary treatment to this wastewater.  Before being discharged into the Mississippi River, the treated effluent is disinfected with chlorine and further treated with sulfur dioxide for removal of the residual chlorine.  The use of these two chemicals makes the SWWTP subject to the provisions and requirements of Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.\n\n\n\nChlorine.  The SWWTP has two 5,000-gallon storage tanks (nominal size) to satisfy the chlorine needs of the wastewater disinfection process.  Each tank?s working capacity is limited, by means of administrative controls, to a maximum of approximately 4,000 gallons, or no more than 50,000 lb.of  liquid chlorine per tank.  This chemical is delivered on the plant site by dedicated tanker trucks operated by the chlorine supplier.  All of the chlorine storage and handling facilities are enclosed inside a steel-frame and concrete building.\n\n\n\nSulfur Dioxide.  The SWWTP no longer uses sulfur dioxide for dechlorination.  By tightly controlling the chlorination"

      "SummaryText": " dosage, it has been possible to maintain the residual chlorine level within required limits, without the need to add sulfur dioxide.  \n\n\n\nHowever, there are still several unused, full SO2 one-ton cylinders on site, waiting to be moved to one of the City?s two other wastewater treatment plants. After this is done, the SWWTP will no longer keep any sulfur dioxide on site.\n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\n\n\nThe requirements of 40 CFR Part 68 includes, among other items, the development of a Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) and an Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) for the possible release of significant quantities of each regulated toxic substance (chlorine and sulfur dioxide).  The Executive Summary (ES) submitted with the original RMP included a discussion of the WSC and ARS?s, in compliance with such requirements.\n\n\n\nConsidering that the operation of the chlorination system has not undergone any changes since the original RMP was submitted, the WCS and ARS for chlorine and their underlying assumptions are still valid.  The WCS and ARS for sulfur dioxide are included in this RMP update, but they will no longer be applicable once the remaining cylinders are removed from the plant site in the near future.  \n\n\n\nNone of the WCS?s and ARS?s will be discussed further here.  In accordance with the 2004 revisions to 40 CFR Part 68 (69 FR 18819-18837, April 9, 2004), it is no longer required to include a discussion of the WCS?s and ARS?s in the ES.\n\n\n\n\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\n1.0    Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe South Wastewater Treatment plant of the city of Baton Rouge keeps on site the necessary documents related to the operation and maintenance of the plant in a safe manner.  Documentation kept on site provides information regarding the chemical properties and chemical hazards associated with the regulated chemicals (not only chlorine and sulfur dioxide but sodium hydroxide solution - caustic - as well); operating limits for all key process parameters; record of the current inventory of t"

They show material inventories and a record of the shipments of chemicals delivered on site.\n\n\n\nThe above records are updated as applicable and necessary.\n\n\n\n2.0     Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nA process hazard analysis (a detailed review of the hazards associated with the operation) of the chlorination and dechlorination systems at the SWWTP was performed in the late Winter and early Spring of 1999.  The Process Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) review technique was used to identify any hazards and to ensure that the necessary controls are in place to manage such hazards.\n\n\n\nA team of individuals representing the operations, maintenance, safety, engineering and management departments conducted the HAZOP review and issued a report that presented and discussed the ?Action Items? identified.  This report was submitted to management for resolution.  The corrective action(s) identified for each action item were documented and most were addressed and resolved, although a few outstanding items remain.\n\n\n\nOne of the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68 is that a PHA be performed on each covered process at least every five years.  Since there have been no changes in the chlorination system that would affect any of the findings of the original PHA, it was only necessary to perform a revalidation of the original HAZOP study, including a review of any outstanding action items from the original PHA.

These procedures address not only normal plant operations but other operating modes such as start-up, normal shut-down, emergency shut-downs, start-up following emergency shut-downs, etc.  These procedures also address the removal of individual components from the process for inspection and/or maintenance and they discuss the consequences of deviations from the normal operating conditions and the steps to be followed to correct such deviations.\n\n\n\nThe plant?s operating and maintenance procedures are reviewed and updated any time that the process undergoes a significant modification or improvement.\n\n\n\n4.0    Training\n\n\n\nAll of the employees involved in the operation of the chlorination and dechlorination systems at the SWWTP underwent initial class-room and hands-on training provided by the design consulting firm.  As a part of this training, the employees were given written tests to verify their understanding of the process, the operating conditions, the hazards inherent in the materials being handled and the appropriate responses to alarm conditions and emergencies.  \n\n\n\nAny time that the process undergoes modifications, changes or improvements, all operators affected by such changes will be provided with the necessary training.

      "SummaryText": "dioxide system design specification summary\n\n\n\nThe final version of the Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan was issued in 1997, at approximately the time that the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems were installed.  This plan was revised and updated in March, 2,001.\n\nAt the State of Louisiana?s (LDEQ?s) request, the full text of the emergency response plan was submitted in 2001 as part of a few minor corrections made to the RMP at that time. There have not been any significant changes made to this plan since.  The emergency response plan is periodically reviewed and verified for completeness and correctness.\n\n\n\nEmergency preparedness and response drills are held periodically with participation of personnel from all three of Baton Rouge?s wastewater treatment plants.  These drills also involve the participation of and are executed under the guidance of the Baton Rouge HazMat team and the Baton Rouge Fire Department.\n\n\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nAt the present time the SWWTP has not defined any process changes or improvements that may result in improved safety, except for the removal of the remaining sulfur dioxide cylinders.  These will be moved to one of the City?s other two WWTP?s, where this chemical is still being used.\n\nVjs - H:\\My Documents\\BTNROUGE\\5-yr RMP\\SWWTP\\rmp04exec-SWWTP.doc    Page 1 of 6 \n\n\n\n"
