We coordinate our\n\nresponse efforts with the Morris Fire Department, which provides additional emergency response\n\nexpertise.\n\n\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\n\nammonia stored in one 30,000-gallon tank, one 18,000-gallon tank, and twenty-four 1,000-gallon\n\nnurse tanks and three 1,450-gallon nurse tanks at our facility in Morris, Minnesota (Figure 1).  The\n\nmaximum amount stored at  85% standard maximum storage capacity is 64,897.5 gallons (333,962.5\n\npounds) including the capacity of the on-site nurse tanks.   The largest single storage vessel at our\n\nfacility contains 131,223 pounds at  85% standard maximum storage capacity.\n\n\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n  4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention\n\nrequirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.
