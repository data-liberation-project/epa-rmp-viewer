Petroleum products (i.e., gasoline and diesel) are received by pipeline.  Transport trucks deliver ethanol and other additives to the facility.  Transport trucks deliver the products to the facility?s customers.  HWRT has decided to activate a 30,000 gallon butane storage tank and add a butane injection process to the facility.  Butane has been identified by the Environmental Protection Agency as a regulated substance subject to section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act, which required the preparation of this Risk Management Plan (RMP).  HWRT is also subject to the OSHA process safety management standard and is submitting a program level 3 Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n\nThe initial construction of the terminal facility was completed in 1960, and it included construction of Tanks NC-01 through NC-04.  Tank NC-05 was constructed in 1987.  HWRT Terminal ? Norris City, LLC purchased the terminal from Crown Central Petroleum Corporation in 2004.\n\n\n\nThe facility is located on Cherry Street, approximately 0.5 mile west of U.S. Highway 1 and 0.25 mile north of Main Street in Norris City.  The immediate vicinity is sparsely populated; however, the closest residence is across the street from the facility?s exit gate.  The facility has eleven fuel and additive storage tanks having capacities from 1000 to 2,538,753 gallons.  Each of these tanks is provided with adequate secondary containment.  \n\n\n\n2    It is HWRT?s policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations.\n\n\n\nThe owners and management of this facility regard employee and public safety as a very serious matter and have taken many precautions to maintain a safe working and public environment.  Some of these precautions include:\n\n\n\n* Generating a Facility Response Plan (FRP);\n\n* Generating a Spill, Prevention, Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) Plan;\n\n* Instituti"

The SPCC Plan includes similar information as well as facility inspection forms.  Employees are typically provided with emergency response training, on-the-job training , spill prevention and spill response training and other supplemental training.\n\n\n\n\n\n3    Process Description\n\n\n\nThe planned butane injection process is fairly simple.  Liquified butane gas will be delivered in tank trucks and pumped into the butane tank.  Butane is stored under ambient temperatures which can exceed 100 degrees F in the summer.  Butane will be injected into gasoline by pumping it into the pipeline as the gasoline is being delivered to HWRT.  \n\n\n\n4    Worst-case release scenario.\n\n\n\nThe Clean Air Act risk management planning regulations require HWRT to prepare a worst-case scenario consisting of the release of the entire contents of the largest vessel containing a regulated chemical.  The largest butane-containing vessel is a 30,000 gallon tank, whose contents could be as much as 144,300 pounds.  The worst-case release is assumed to result in a vapor cloud containing the total quantity of butane in a concentration that is assumed to be between the upper and lower flammability limits of butane.  For the worst-case consequence analysis, the vapor cloud is assumed to detonate.\n\n\n\nThe endpoint for the consequence analysis of a vapor cloud explosion is an overpressure of one pound per square inch (1 psi).  The ?Automated Resource for Chemical Hazard Incident Evaluation? (ARCHIE) software was used to estimate the distance to this endpoint.  \n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario assumptions are as follows:\n\n\n\n* The entire contents of the tank are released.\n\n* T"

The public receptors within this distance include at least one residence and an industrial area.  Schools, hospitals, prisons, recreation areas, major commercial or office areas, national/state parks/monuments and wildlife refuges are not present inside this radius.  The population within this area was estimated at 18 using the ?Landview 6? software program by selecting the ?calculate population using block points? option.  The Landview software contains the latest (2000) census data available.  \n\n\n\n5    Alternative Release scenario\n\nHWRT is required to identify and analyze at least one alternative release scenario that is more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.  The scenario selected involves a leak while transferring butane from a truck to the tank due to a gasket failure or hose failure.  This is a potential failure mode identified during the Process Hazard Analysis.  The pressure drop in the hose would be detected by a sensor and the truck?s automatic excess flow shut-off valve would be activated and the butane flow would be stopped.  The contents of the hose could be released.\n\n\n\nThe hose is a nominal 3 inch diameter and the length is an estimated 30 to 50 feet long.  A 50 foot length will be utilized for a conservative scenario.  The volume of the hose is approximately 2.5 cubic feet.  Using a conversion factor of 7.48052 gallons per cubic feet and a butane density of 4.81 lb per gallon, the hose could hold about 90 pounds of butane.  For an extremely conservative scenario, it will be assumed that twice the total volume of the hose leaks out before the shut-off mechanism is activated so the total release would be 180 pounds.\n\n\n\nThis release is also assumed to result in a vapor cloud of butane in a concentration that is assumed to"

This is achieved through a combination of safety equipment, personnel training and operating procedures.  The safety equipment includes excess flow valves, pressure relief valves and emergency shut off valves.  The butane tank and supporting equipment was inspected, tested and refurbished in October, 2005 prior to initiating the butane process at this facility.\n\n\n\n6    Five-year accident history\n\n\n\nThis facility has not had a release of butane or any regulated substance as defined in 40 CFR 68.3 and 68.130 (or an OSHA highly hazardous chemical as defined in 40 CFR 29.1910(b)).\n\n\n\n7    Emergency response program\n\n\n\nThe facility ha"
