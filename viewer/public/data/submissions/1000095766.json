This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our trained refrigeration personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release from a safe distance. We coordinate with the City of Harrisonburg Fire Department which provides emergency response expertise and HAZMAT team capabilities.\n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nOur facility's primary activities revolve around chicken processing. Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance present at our facility. All of the ammonia inventory is attributed to its use as a refrigerant.\n\n\n\nThe Worst-Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release\n\n\n\nWorst case and alternate release scenarios were developed using the methodology given in the EPA \"RMP*COMP\" as well as the EPA \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\". The details of the chosen scenarios are located within the Risk\n\nManagement Program that is located on site.\n\n\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA. In addition, our facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.
