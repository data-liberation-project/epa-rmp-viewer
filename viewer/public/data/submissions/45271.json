      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nProcess Description\n\nThe water treatment process at the Winchester Water Treatment Plant involves the use of chlorine for disinfection purposes in order to provide safe drinking water to the city of Winchester and surrounding communities. For the first application point chlorine is mixed with sodium chlorite in order to generate chlorine dioxide, which is fed into the flash mix. For the second point of application chlorine, in its gaseous form, is mixed with treated water to form a chlorine solution that is added to water entering the clearwell.\nChlorine is listed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a regulated toxic substance. Facilities that handle amounts of chlorine over 2,500 pounds are required by the EPA to develop a Risk Management Program (RMP) to reduce the risk to employees and the public of injury from an accidental release of chlorine. The Winchester Water Treatment Plant will begin storing 8,000 pounds (four 2000 lbs cylinders) of chlorine by July 2006 and is therefore required to submit an RMP.  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe policy of the City of Winchester is that the operation of all chlorine equipment will be by trained and knowledgeable personnel only. Therefore, personnel at the filter plant are required to attend all training as specified in the RMP. The emergency response policy involves providing emergency awareness level training to employees and the cooperation of the facility with the local emergency response agencies and AEDC.\n \nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe Winchester Water Treatment Plant has developed an accidental release prevention program based on the EPA Risk Management Program and OSHA Process Safety Management regulations that includes the following:\n   Operating procedures to ensure safe operation of the chlorine equipment \n   Annual operator training regarding the hazards of chlorine, operating procedures, and emergency procedures\n   Routine maint"

      "SummaryText": "enance to prevent mechanical failure\n   Leak detector to minimize the effects of an accidental chemical release\n   Installation of a chlorine scrubber to neutralize any chlorine release that may occur\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nNo accidental chlorine releases have occurred at the Winchester Water Treatment Plant in the last five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe Winchester Water Treatment Plant is not currently included in the community emergency response plan developed by the Franklin County Emergency Management Agency. The primary responder in the event of an accidental chlorine leak is an AEDC response team. The water treatment plant has appropriate procedures in place to notify AEDC when there is a need to respond. \n\nChanges to Improve Safety\n\nAt the time this RMP was being developed the new chlorination system was not in operation. This newly designed system in combination with existing operating procedures, extensive training, and extremely conscientious operators adequately reduce the risk of accidental chemical releases. The installation of a chlorine leak detector in the chlorine dioxide room has been completed in order to further reduce the risk of accidential chemical release."
