      "SummaryText": "The City of Franklin owns and operates a water treatment plant in Franklin, Tennessee.  The plant uses chlorine for disinfection, which is classified as an extremely hazardous substance.\n\nSince the plant uses and stores chlorine in excess of 2,500 pounds, it is subject to federal requirements including the preparation of PSM and RMP programs.  Stringent RMP requirements (known as \"Program 3 Level\") apply to the City of Franklin because of Tennessee's OSHA jurisdiction.  The City of Franklin has developed an emergency plan to provide employees with specific details for emergency operations.  Additionally, in-house procedures are in place for training personnel on the chlorine system, mechanical inspection of equipment, incident investigation, compliance audits, and emergency response and action plan.\n\nThe facility has an excellent accident and chemical release prevention program.  Stringent loading, operation and maintenance procedures have been implemented to prevent the accidental release of chlorine gas.  There has never been an accident involving chlorine that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, or sheltering in place in the past 5 years.                                                                                                                 \n\nThe Emergency Response Program has been evaluated to produce the maximum impact in the least amount of the time.  The facility has coordinated with all local governments and fire departments to provide effective communications and rapid response in an emergency situation.  The staff will respond immediately to a release event by taking the following basic actions:\n1. Dial 911.  Notify the Emergency Management Agency.\n2. Contact the fire department hazard response team and verify notification by 911 operator.\n3. Evacuate the facilities and the appropriate perimeter area.\n\nThere are no planned changes as a result of the last safety review."
