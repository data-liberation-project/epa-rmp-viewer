      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe Risk Management Plan (RMP) has been prepared for Marchem Technologies, LLC (Marchem) facilities at 20851 South Santa Fe Avenue, Long Beach, California in accordance with the requirements of the California Code of Regulation (CCR) Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5 (California Accidental Release and Prevention Program [CalARP]).  \n\nMarchem manufactures surface-active agents (surfactants) and has an SIC Code of 2843.  Five regulated acutely hazardous materials are used, handled, or stored for manufacturing processes above the State Threshold Quantity (STQ): epichlorohydrin, ethylene oxide, isopropylamine , propylene oxide, and toluene diisocyanate (mixed isomers).  Processes handling these substances were determined to be eligible for Program 3 requirements.\n\nA Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) Team was established by Marchem to conduct HAZOP studies and Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs).  Since the most recent RMP submission, all previously conducted HAZOP studies and PHAs were reviewed and updated as necessary to incorporate recent process changes and modifications at MarchemA?s facilities.  The HAZOP Team consisted of the Maintenance Manager, experienced process operators, and experienced facility maintenance employees.  Additionally, the plant manager, engineer, president, and laboratory staff were often consulted during the Process Hazard Analysis processes as well.  The guideword approach was used in conducting HAZOP studies and PHAs to identify hazards.  Identified risks were assessed for likelihood and severity. Using the risk matrices listed within each study, risks were evaluated as being acceptable, acceptable with controls, undesirable, or unacceptable.  Based on each evaluation, remedy action issues were identified, discussed, and recommended for implementation.  A copy of each updated PHA is located in Appendix B.\n\nThe HAZOP Team also conducted an External Events Analysis.  The following external events were determined to have a reasonabl"

Missile impacts that may result from extreme winds, high summer temperature, lightning and seismic activity were found to present the greatest risk with undesirable or unacceptable consequences.  Details of the analyses and risk evaluation along with resulting recommended actions are provided within each Process Hazard Analysis.\n\nOff-Site Consequence Analyses were conducted for eight release scenarios to evaluate human health and environmental impacts associated with an accidental release.  Each release scenario considered the most conservative conditions that would result in the greatest off-site impacts.  The toxic substance worst case scenario as defined by Section 2750.3 of CCR Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, is the release of the maximum stored quantity of ethylene oxide in storage over a period of ten minutes .  This was chosen as the tank car release, since the storage tank is passively mitigated by location as an underground storage tank.  The second worst case scenario, as defined by Section 2750.3 of CCR Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, involves isopropylamine, a flammable liquid in a vapor cloud explosion.  Based on air dispersion modeling using average meteorological conditions, six alternative accidental release scenarios were identified during the HAZOP studies and/or external event analyses.  These release scenarios involved: a) the rupture of the epichlorohydrin offloading transfer line to the storage tank; b) the spill of epichlorohydrin in the drum storage area as a result of a forklift accident; c) the rupture of the ethylene oxide railcar unloading liquid line during a seismic event while unloading a tank car, actively mitigated by detection of the spill and shutdown of the system; d) the spill of isopropylamine in the drum stora"

These release scenarios were determined by the HAZOP Team to be likely and credible, being associated with either the compounded failure of administrative process controls, mechanical integrity, safety systems, or a serious external event.\n\nA detailed description of all incident categories that could have involved the acutely hazardous materials processed at the Marchem chemical manufacturing facility during the past five years is provided in Section 3.0.  \nMarchemA?s Risk Management and Process Safety Management Program is included in Appendix D.  It includes all programs relating to Training, Maintenance, Audits, Incident Investigations, PHAs, Mechanical Integrity, Management of Change, Pre-Startup Review, Employee Participation, Hot Work Permits, Confined Space Entries, Respiratory Protections, Preventative Maintenance, and Contactor Safety.\n\nMarchem has prepared, maintains, and conducts periodic training of its Emergency Action Plan.  This plan describes the procedures by which an emergency response is handled by the management team and operators at Marchem.  All employees at Marchem, including on-site contractors, are periodically trained on the Emergency Action Plan.  Additionally, the local Fire Department and its Hazmat team visit the site on an annual basis to familiarize themselves with our processes and emergency response procedures.  A discussion of the plan is provided at Section 4.0 and a complete copy located in Appendix E."
