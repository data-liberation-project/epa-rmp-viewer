Additional systems are in place to review proposed changes and assure that any new training requirements are met. Another system assures a detailed review for hazards in each operating unit on a prescribed frequency. Training and updating procedures are monitored with multiple systems.\n\nThe La Porte facility has an array of maintenance and inspection programs that minimize the possibility of equipment or piping failures. Routine inspections of equipment are done in the same manner as the initial quality assurance inspections completed prior to installation. Equipment inspections utilize procedures such as proof testing, where safeguard systems are forced to function in a controlled manner. This assures that the safeguards will function if they are ever needed. Preventive and predictive maintenance programs are utilized including, vibration monitoring, infrared images to detect differences in temperature, inspections by insurance specialists, and root-cause analysis procedures. Piping is inspected and tested with X-rays and hydrostatic tests prior to installation. The piping is monitored by methods such as visual inspections by the operators or maintenance personnel, emissions monitoring using sophisticated instruments, or thickness measurements by people trained in testing procedures. Maintenance personnel and supervisors are included in many of the training and testing programs that the operators utilize. Additional training and procedures have been developed for activities that are specific to maintenance.
