In fulfilling this policy, PPG has made a commitment to follow several guiding principles including:\r\n\r\n* providing a safe and healthful workplace for our employees;\r\n* operating our facilities so as to prevent harm to public health and the environment;\r\n* assuring that PPG products can be produced, distributed, used, and disposed of safely;\r\n* alerting potentially affected persons to known or reasonably foreseeable hazards of our products and activities\r\nand informing them about proper protective measures;\r\n* contributing to the public's understanding and management of any significant risks arising from our products or\r\nactivities;\r\n* training, equipping and supporting all employees in the management and implementation of environment,\r\nhealth and safety activities at our facilities; and\r\n* complying with applicable laws and regulations concerning environment, health and safety.\r\nPPG is committed to the Responsible Care(r) voluntary initiative for safe management of chemicals. PPG follows the Responsible Care(r) Codes of Management Practice, which are integral to the implementation of the PPG Environment, Health & Safety Policy.   The Responsible Care(r) Community Awareness Code of Management Practice and PPG's Community Awareness and Emergency Response (CAER) Policy are designed to assure emergency preparedness and to foster community right-to-know. PPG's CAER Policy requires each manufacturing plant to have a pro-active community awareness and emergency response program to handle emergencies that might happen in that facility.   Our community awareness programs include: emergency response plans; making Material Safety Data Sheets available to the appropriate"

Based on dispersion modeling using Phast Professional ver. 6.1, offsite concentrations of chlorine would cause offsite impact.\r\nAlternative case release scenarios (ACRS) were developed for each of the listed chemicals in the facility. These scenarios followed the guidelines provided by EPA and used the Phast Professional ver. 6.1 to perform the end-point calculations.

In addition, the site monitors more than 20,000 connections each quarter to detect fugitive emission sources.\r\nTrained personnel and environment, health and safety measures are included in all phases of the La Porte operation. Detailed engineering and design standards are used. These standards include national codes and standards, quality assurance inspections, over pressure protection systems, toxic gas detectors, emergency shutdown systems, a fire water system, and computer controls for the processes. Every individual in the facility receives appropriate training.

Additional systems are in place to review proposed changes and assure that any new training requirements are met. Another system assures a detailed review for hazards in each operating unit on a prescribed frequency. Training and updating procedures are monitored with multiple systems.\r\nThe La Porte facility has an array of maintenance and inspection programs that minimize the possibility of equipment or piping failures. Routine inspections of equipment are done in the same manner as the initial quality assurance inspections completed prior to installation. Equipment inspections utilize procedures such as proof testing, where safeguard systems are forced to function in a controlled manner. This assures that the safeguards will function if they are ever needed. Preventive and predictive maintenance programs are utilized including, vibration monitoring, infrared images to detect differences in temperature, inspections by insurance specialists, and root-cause analysis procedures. Piping is inspected and tested with X-rays and hydrostatic tests prior to installation. The piping is monitored by methods such as visual inspections by the operators or maintenance personnel, emissions monitoring using sophisticated instruments, or thickness measurements by people trained in testing procedures. Maintenance personnel and supervisors are included in many of the training and testing programs that the operators utilize. Additional training and procedures have been developed for activities that are specific to maintenance. Although some of the training and testing is specific to maintenance, the same monitoring process is used.\r\nFive-year accident history\r\n.\r\nThe La Porte plant has not had a release of a regulated chemical that meets the EPA's reporting guidelines in\r\nthe past five years.\r\nEmergency response program."

In addition, the plan is coordinated with the Channel Industries Mutual Aid plans.\r\nIn addition to the written plan, La Porte's emergency response program includes a permanently installed fire protection system; mobile fire fighting equipment; a PlantSafe computer based gas dispersion modeling program; membership in the local area-wide industrial emergency response organization; participation with the La Porte Local Emergency Planning Committee in coordinating emergency response plans and in planning and practicing emergency response drills\r\nPlanned changes to improve safety.\r\n\r\nPPG is committed to the process of continuous improvement. This commitment extends beyond production issues into the environmental and safety aspects of all operations. Changes in control instruments are made on an ongoing basis, as necessary, to assure that the most reliable and effective controls are used.
