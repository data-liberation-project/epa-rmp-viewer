Trialco is a secondary aluminum foundry, NAICS Code 331314.  We have operated at the same location since 1974.  The RMP is required due to the use of chlorine as a fluxing agent in our melting process.  Trialco has developed this RMP along with our Process Safety Management (PSM) Program in order to outline the controls and procedures in place to protect not only our 45 employees on site, but also our business partners and our surrounding community.  Beginning in 2016, Trialco also voluntarily registered with the Department of Homeland Security under the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism (CFAT) Program.  All of our operating policies are subject to periodic review and updates to stay current with changes in our operations.  Trialco is an active member of the Chicago Heights and South Suburban community, participating in many local business and charitable organizations along with our employees.\n\n  \n\nTrialco is committed to the safety of our employees and our community.  Our management team participates in monthly industry safety webinars and invites employees for applicable topics.  Two of our executives serve on the board of directors for the Non-Ferrous Foundry Society (NFFS).  Trialco enlists the help of outside consultants for the management of our air emissions, our storm water management system and our annual reporting of hazardous materials to local emergency responders.  Trialco maintains an excellent working relationship with the Chicago Heights Fire Department, which has a station less than ? mile from our facility.  We open our facility for the training of new firefighters when requested and the fire department conducts annual fire safety training on site for our employees.\n\n  \n\nThe RMP focuses exclusively o"

      "SummaryText": "n the accidental release prevention and emergency response policies regarding the storage and usage of chlorine at Trialco.  Our safety program begins with the handling of the chlorine cylinders used in our process.  Delivery and removal of chlorine cylinders are coordinated closely with our chlorine supplier.  Delivery and removal of chlorine cylinders is performed by licensed personnel employed by our supplier, with the assistance of only a limited number of Trialco maintenance staff.  Our staff attends periodic certification training at our chlorine supplier.\n\n \n\nThe maximum amount of chlorine on site is 72,000 lbs, most of which is kept in our locked storage area under surveillance cameras.  A maximum of 12 cylinders or 24,000 pounds is connected to our operating system for service to the furnaces.  Trialco operates 365 days of the year, so we always have at least 2 employees in our facility 24 hours per day, every day.\n\n\n\nThe handling and storage of the cylinders is controlled through the CFAT system.  With the assistance of Homeland Security, Trialco has improved our safeguards against theft or destruction of the chlorine cylinders.  The cylinders themselves are maintained by our chlorine supplier, checking for structural integrity and ensuring that valves and other controls are in safe working order.\n\n\n\nThe 12 cylinders connected to our furnaces, the related controls and the piping system are controlled through our Process Safety Management (PSM) system under the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA).  Under the PSM, only certified and trained employees are allowed access to the cylinders for replacing empties with full ones.  Inside our furnace buildings, all shift supervisors are trained to monitor the furnaces and check for accidental leaks.  All of our plant employees are trained in chlorine safety and instructed to notify supervisors or maintenance staff if they detect chlorine in the air.  Only maintenance staff is trained in shut down an"

      "SummaryText": "d restart procedures in the event of a release or an intentional shutdown of the chlorine system.\n\n\n\nTrialco has not had any accidental releases of chlorine gas in the 5 years preceding this Executive Summary (2015-2019).  Under both the PSM and the CFAT systems, all processes are reviewed at least annually.  During this five year period, these audits have resulted in upgrades to the physical security of our cylinders, as well as upgrades to our process controls and piping.\n\n\n\nDue to the small size of our workforce, there is a maximum of 25 employees on site at any given time.  Therefore Trialco relies exclusively on the Chicago Heights Fire Department and the Suburban Cook County LEPC for emergency response.  All of our employees are trained to evacuate any area once the chlorine release alarm is sounded.  Every year, the fire department and the Suburban Cook County LEPC are provided with our Tier Two Emergency and hazardous Chemical Inventory Form.  This form lists every hazardous chemical stored or used on site, not just the chlorine covered in this RMP.\n\n  \n\nAs noted throughout this executive summary, Trialco is dedicated to operating our facility safely for our employees and our neighbors.  We train our employees to operate all equipment in a safe manner and screen all of our visitors and subcontractors so they are aware of the dangers within our facility.  We are very proud of our accident and injury history and our employees take great pride in that record.  Our annual audits of the PSM and CFAT system lead to continuous improvement.  In 2020 we plan to re-pipe our main chlorine lines, install a new manifold at the entrance to the furnace room, and increase security during working hours at all entrances to our facility.  As technological or operational changes require, we will always be modifying and updating our facility.\n\n"
