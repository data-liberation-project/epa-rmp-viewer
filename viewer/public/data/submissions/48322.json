The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of UAP Distribution, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information - UAP Distribution, Inc., P O Box 66, Republic, Kansas  66984.  (785) 361-2110.  The facility is located on the Northwest part of Republic, Kansas.  The ammonia storage tank is located on the North side of the road.\n\n The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\n Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application.\n\n The maximum quantity stored would be 239,000 pounds, composed of 133,000 pounds in our 30,000 gallon storage tank, plus a total  potential of 106,000 pounds in up to 12, 1000 gallon nurse trailers and up to 8, 1500 gallon nurse trailers.\n  \nOperating procedures for an emergency situation, unloading at a storage facility, and loading of ammonia nurse trailers have been updated as of 03/08/2007.\n\n3.

The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThe facility has implemented most of the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29  CFR 1910.111, Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  The governing regulations are put forth by the Kansas Department of Agriculture and the facility is inspected on a regular basis by company personnel, inspectors from the Kansas Department of Agriculture, and representatives of the Company's insurance carrier.  Important differences between ANSI standards and KDA regulations involve color coding of valves, installation of a bulkhead at the truck unloading point, and remote shut-offs for the storage tank(s).  \n\n5.
