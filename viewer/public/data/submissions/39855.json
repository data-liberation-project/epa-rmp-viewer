Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Montrose Cooperative Association in Montrose, Colorado are strongly committed to\nemployee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our\ncomprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation,\noperating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our\nfacility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated\nsubstances.  We coordinate our response efforts with the Montrose Fire Department, which provides\nadditional emergency response expertise.\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\nammonia stored in one 30,000-gallon tank, sixteen 1,000-gallon nurse tanks, two 500-gallon nurse\ntanks and two 250-gallon nurse tanks at our facility in Montrose, Colorado (Figure 1).  The\nmaximum amount stored is 40,375 gallons (207,769.8 pounds) at 85% standard maximum storage\ncapacity including the capacity of the on-site nurse tanks.   The largest single storage vessel at our\nfacility contains 131,223 pounds at 85% standard maximum storage capacity.\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios (NOTE: This information is for\n  LEPC, Fire Department and Montrose Cooperative Association incident planning use. \n  These paragraphs were deleted from the Executive Summary sent to the EPA.)\n\n  4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention\nrequirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68."

Any findings from the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely\nmanner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nMontrose Cooperative Association maintains written operating procedures to ensure that activities\nwithin our covered processes are conducted safely.  These procedures address various modes of\noperation; the information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in\nthe processes (Appendix B).\n\nTraining\nMontrose Cooperative Association has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that\nemployees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with\nthese processes.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nMontrose Cooperative Association conducts documented maintenance checks on process equipment\nto ensure proper operation.  Maintenance checks are conducted by qualified personnel with previous\ntraining in maintenance practices.  Examples of process equipment that would receive maintenance\nchecks include:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency\nshutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance\nchecks are corrected in a safe and timely manner (Appendix C).\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Montrose Cooperative Association to manage changes in process\nchemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.

These reviews are conducted to confirm that\nconstruction, equipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior\nto placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nMontrose Cooperative Association conducts compliance audits on a regular basis to determine\nwhether the plan's provisions, set out under the 40 CFR part 68, are being implemented.  Any non-\ncompliance issue discovered during the audit is promptly corrected.\n\nEmployee Participation\nMontrose Cooperative Association truly believes that process safety management and accident\nprevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views\nconcerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees\nhave access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP,\nparticularly information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\n  5. Five-year Accident History\nMontrose Cooperative Association has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over\nthe last five years.  Despite our stringent release prevention policies, there was one accidental release\nby a farmer off-site on June 15, 2002.  When the farmer used a nurse tank at 5:06 PM, the metering\ndevice was not sealed and approximately 3,600 pounds of anhydrous ammonia was released.  The\nincident lasted thirty minutes.  The air temperature was 85 degrees Fahrenheit, the wind speed was\none mile per hour from the north-northwest, and there was no precipitation.  The fire department was\nnotified and responded.  There were no deaths as a result of the incident.  The farmer operating the\nnurse tank was hospitalized and three children were treat"

Emergency Response Plan\nMontrose Cooperative Association maintains a written emergency action plan to deal with accidental\nreleases of hazardous materials.  The plan addresses all aspects of emergency response including first\naid and medical treatment, evacuations, and in the event of an accidental release, Montrose Potato\nGrowers Cooperative Association will contact local emergency response agencies and the public\n(Appendix A).  Montrose Cooperative Association maintains a written emergency action plan which\nis coordinated with the local fire department and the LEPC.  The plan is intended to assist\nresponding agencies to address all aspects of emergency response including first aid and medical\ntreatment, evacuations, and notification of local emergency response agencies and the public.\n\n  7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nWe will continue to provide our employees with ongoing annual training to ensure that they are\ncurrent with all of the safe ammonia transfer and handling procedures, and provide regular inspection\nand maintenance on all of the ammonia equipment.  Authorized personnel will make changes to the\nfacility if any audits of the facility identify non-compliance with Section 112 (r)(7), Accidental\nRelease Prevention Requirements of the Clean Air Act."
