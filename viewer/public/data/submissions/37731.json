      "SummaryText": "General Safety Policies and Practices\n\nExcelda Manufacturing Warehouse is committed to providing a safe workplace for our associates, and limiting adverse impacts on our community.  Our approach to providing this level of safety is three-fold.  The first is the training of our associates, the second is the installation of structual safety measures, and the third is self-inspection.\n\nIn identifying the training needs of our associates, we recognize that the greatest single threat to safety at our facility is the threat of fire, associates are trained in the use of fire extinquishers, identifying and reporting fires to the appropriate individuals, and minimizing the impact of a fire through orderly evacuation, including the turning off of equipment and machinery, should evacuation be necessary.  We also train associates in our policies of no smoking inside buildings and no use of combustion driven equipment in the aerosol room.  Other safety related training that takes place in addition to these include Right-to-Know, our Hazardous Communications Program, Spill Response, Tornado/Severe Weather Response, and Forklift/Material Handling Training.\n\nWe have also installed a number of physical safety controls in the building.  These features include our \"Aerosol Room\" which is separated from the main warehouse by blast walls, automatic \"fire doors\" that close automatically in the event of a fire, which is used to store the majority of our flammable gas products.  There is also a sprinkler system throughout the facility, and which is heavily concentrated in the \"aerosol room\". The sprinkler system is fed through an on-site water retention pond which is kept full via a pump when rainfall is insufficient.  This retention pond also has a hose connection, which acts as a psuedo fire hydrant and can be used by the local fire department.  There is also complete vehicle access to all sides of the building from the outside.\n\nIn terms of self-inspection, our Safety Coordinator chairs"

      "SummaryText": " an associate Safety Committee which among other responsibilities conducts \"safety walkthroughs\" of the facility to identify fire and other safety concerns, and to make recommendations for improving the overall level of safety at the facility.  In addition to the Safety Committee we have a Steering Committee which looks into specific issues, including safety issues, that are brought up by associates or management, as well as an Environmental Management System Team that looks at environmental, and community safety concerns as part of our ISO 14001 certification.\n\nOverview of the Facility and Operations\n\nThe facility is a warehousing operations.  No repackaging is done, except for the processing of damaged/returned materials.  Repackaging is conducted in the \"aerosol room\" which provides the highest level of protection to the facility as a whole.  The bulk of the operation is the movement of packaged goods from trucks, to racking and floor storage, and back to trucks.  Additional activities include the \"building of mixed pallets\", and the processing of single case shipments.  Racking is metal, with safety screens under upper level positions to prevent damages or releases of material through \"falling\".  Material handling is performed by a number of devices including forklifts, powered pallet jacks, manual carts.  The \"aerosol room\" is maintained off limits to all powered equipment except for properly rated electrically powered equipment unless a \"special permit\" has been issued for a specific task, simliar to a \"hot work permit\".\n\nThe majority of materials stored in the facility are automotive related fluids, and cleaners.  The second largest type of material are retail size cleaners, polishes paints.  A large amount of non-flammable refrigerant gases are also stored, though this level is very fluid and seasonal.  The only substances stored at the facility that come close to the regulated threshold levels under this RMP are our flammable aerosols.  These are a mixtures"

As a result of this packaging, the distance to the endpoint of any container release is less than .01 miles (53 ft), and so all releases are expected to reach their endpoints prior to being released from the building proper so there are no expected public receptors to our operations regulated under this RMP, but rather public receptors are considered as part of our overall Environmental Management System.  The amount of this material that might be expected to be present at any one time varies greatly depending on the season, inbound shipments, and business growth.  However, the maximum amount of material that can be stored in the facility can not exceed 801,000 pounds.  \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Programs\n\nThe facility is not covered by any the OSHA PMS rule, nor by the EPA SPCC rule.  For this reason, the basis for responding to an accidental release is covered by our \"Fire Safety and Fire Emergency\" and \"Spill Response\" procedures, and coordination with local responders.  Training in these procedures is company wide and not limited to specific individuals.  Both of these procedures outlines how to classify the situation, and how to respond to each based on its classification.  Responses vary from responding through the use of the appropriate on-site fire extinquisher to calling the fire department so that the LEPC response plan can be implemented.  \n\nFive Year History\n\nWe have had no accidental releases of material regulated under the RMP rules in the past five years that have resulted in any injury to an individual, or damages to properties.\n\nThe Emergency Response Program\n\nWe coordinate our response with the local emergency responders.  The facility is listed with the LEPC and both the local Fire Department, and the LEPC are kept informed of storage types and amounts through an annual Tier II report.  We also pr"

In addition to the training that has been discussed previously in this summary, we also conduct fire drills, and test emergency systems including our alarms.  We also have inspections of our sprinkler system, pumps, and fire extinquishers conducted by outside contractors on a regular basis to ensure they are properly functioning.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nInstallation of a back-up generator that will, among other functions, provide power to our well pumps to ensure the fire suppression system is always supplied with an addequate amount of water."
