Contractors are required to abide by Doswell safety rules and procedures.\n \nFive-Year Accident History\n\nDoswell has had no offsite or significant release of ammonia since beginning its storage and use at the Facility.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nDoswell's One Plan instructs employees on emergency actions for employee protection and first aid, including for ammonia-related incidents. Doswell employees shall not respond to an occurrence that results or is likely to result in an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance. In the event of such an occurrence, Doswell shall (1) take measures to protect its employees and (2) call the Hanover County Communications Center for emergency personnel and equipment to respond to the release.  The Doswell non-response policy does not apply to incidental releases of hazardous substances where the substance can be absorbed, neutralized, or otherwise controlled at the time of release by employees in the immediate release area.  It also does not apply to responses to releases of hazardous substances where there is no potential safety or health hazard, i.e., no fire, explosion, or chemical exposure.\n \nDoswell expects employees to take actions to end a leak (e.g., by shutting a valve) or clean up a spill that do not pose an immediate health or safety hazard. Those measures shall be considered incidental emergency responses and employees are allowed such activities.\n\n The One Plan has instructions for notifying and coordinating with the local agency for response activities, Hanover County, in the event of a significant ammonia release at the Facility.  Hanover County will be immediately notified of any ammonia release that carries over the security fence.  Doswell has reviewed the One Plan and discussed emergency response with Hanover County officials. \n\nPlanned Safety Improvements\n\nDoswell strives for perfect execution of all processes and recognizes the need for training and drills.

Additionally, a table of estimated release rates and corresponding distances to the toxic endpoint is presented for ammonia stored under various pressures.

Before a job is started, it is reviewed for both safety and environmental impact.  If a job can not be done safely, it is not done.  If a job is safe but has environmental concerns, it is not done. \n\nStandard operating procedures and a preventive maintenance program partnered with the shared values are the backbone of Doswell's prevention program.  All production technicians are required to complete a series of Personnel Qualifications Cards (PQC).  Each system of the Facility is covered by a PQC.  The PQC program defines the knowledge and skill an individual must possess to operate or maintain any given system.  In addition to basic system knowledge, an individual must possess knowledge related to safety, emergency, security, integrated plant operations, and environmental impact as applies to that system.\n\nDoswell utilizes a computer based maintenance system.  Preventive maintenance (PM) work orders are issued on a periodic basis established by equipment manufacturers and equipment history.  PM's are used to maintain plant equipment in a good working order and prevent accidental releases due to normal equipment aging.  The system also issues and tracks corrective work orders.  Premature failures abnormal operating conditions, releases, safety incidents, and re-occurring corrective work orders are tracked using a computer based database, Event Response.  Event Response system drives Team members to analyze each event for root cause and implement countermeasures to prevent repeating events.  Event Response is used to prevent small repeating problems from growing into to future failures. \n\nWhile Doswell strives to have no emergencies, it is recognized that they are impossible to prevent completely.

As a part of protecting employee health and safety, Doswell designates itself as a non-responding facility. Facility self-designation as non-responding is recognized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Non-responder status was established as a risk ceiling for employee response.  Under no circumstances shall personnel jeopardize their health and safety or that of others in responding to an emergency. In responding, employees shall not exceed significantly the level of risk to which they normally are exposed and acclimated in their workplace.  \n\nFacility and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nDoswell Combined Cycle Facility is an independent electric power production facility.  The Facility consists of two identical power units. Each unit consists of two combustion turbines, two heat recovery steam generators (HRSGs), one steam turbine, one air-cooled condenser, and their plant support equipment. The primary fuel is natural gas with light distillate fuel oil as a backup fuel. The Facility has a water treatment plant to process makeup water for the combustion turbine steam injection, evaporative coolers, and boiler water losses. Wastewater produced onsite from the water treatment operation, process blowdown, and miscellaneous drains is treated in a zero discharge system.\n\nDoswell uses anhydrous ammonia to control nitrous oxide emissions from the burning of fuel oil and gas for electric power production.  The ammonia is stored as a liquid under pressure, which is vaporized and mixed with air before being injected into the Selective Catalytic Reduction unit on each HRSG. The ammonia is stored in two, 10,000-gallon tanks, which have a total capacity of 103,200 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. \n\nWorst Case Release Scenario\n\nEPA requires that the worst ca"

EPA has also established 0.14 milligrams per liter (mg/L) as the toxic endpoint for ammonia. The guidance prepared for the ammonia refrigeration industry, Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration (Ammonia Guidance, EPA, 1998), was used for Doswell's calculations because it stores ammonia in the same manner as in this industry.\n\nThe hypothetical, worst-case release scenario for Doswell is failure of primary containment at one of the Facility's 10,000-gallon tanks.  In accordance with the standard operating procedures of Doswell's ammonia supplier, the Facility's tanks may not be filled beyond 87 percent capacity. Therefore, a worst case failure of one of the ammonia tanks would release up to 44,892 lb. of ammonia or 4,489 lb/min over a ten-minute period. In such a scenario, the ammonia tank's secondary containment captures the entire liquid released. The distance to the toxic endpoint in a rural area was estimated using the following equation from the Ammonia Guidance:\n\nD=0.607(QR)0.4923\n\nWhere:\nD is the distance to the toxic endpoint (miles), and\nQR is the release rate of the ammonia (4,489 lb/min).\nBased on the equation, the distance to toxic endpoint for Doswell's worst case scenario is 3.8 miles. This is the distance over which airborne ammonia concentrations decrease to 0.14 mg/L assuming a worst case release rate of 4,489 lb/min and a stable atmosphere with a light (1.5 meter/second) but directionally persistent wind.  This distance extends offsite and includes public receptors. \n\nAlternative case release scenario\n\nThe Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration recommends estimating emissions resulting from a hole with a < to =-inch effective diameter for an alternative release scenario. Emissions expected from this size hole are similar to a pump seal leak or gasket rupture. The modeling for the alternative rel"
