Anhydrous ammonia (CAS No.7664-41-7) is listed as a regulated substance under OSHA and EPA standards, and exposure to it through inhalation or physical contact is hazardous to life and health.\n\nApproximately 18,000 lbs of anhydrous ammonia is utilized in the Quantum Foods refrigeration system.  The refrigeration process does not require any additional introduction of anhydrous ammonia into the system beyond this initial charge quantity; that is, the ammonia in the system is reused with every refrigeration cycle, and there is no regular transferring of this substance in or out of the facility.  \n\nIn the refrigeration process, the anhydrous ammonia is circulated through evaporator coils located at or above ceiling level throughout the refrigerated portions of the facility.  Ambient air is mechanically circula"

The temperature of the anhydrous ammonia within the coils is maintained at a lower temperature than the ambient air, thus allowing heat in the air to be absorbed by the anhydrous ammonia.  \n\nThe anhydrous ammonia is subsequently drawn from the coils, compressed to a high pressure, high temperature gas, and circulated through condenser coils located on the facility roof.  Water and outside air are circulated across the exterior surface of the condenser coils, cooling the anhydrous ammonia and condensing it to liquid state.  The anhydrous ammonia liquid is pumped back to the evaporator coils, where the process is repeated as described above.\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia is contained in a closed-circuit system throughout the process. All piping, coils, vessels, and mechanical equipment in which the anhydrous ammonia is contained meet or exceed all applicable Industry design and installation standards and codes.\n\nUnder normal operations, anhydrous ammonia is not released outside the system in any form or state.  However, since portions of the system are maintained below atmospheric pressure, it is possible for microscopic amounts of air and non-condensable particles inherently contained in air to migrate into the system through pump seals, valve packing, and similar system components.  These contaminants are routinely removed by automatic purging system.  Small amounts of anhydrous ammonia are removed along with the contaminants, and are diluted with water and discharged from the system into the facility waste water system as ammonium hydroxide (CAS No. 1336-21-6) in trace quantities.  Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), the reportable release quantity of ammonium hydroxide is 1,000 lb.  Ammonium hydroxide is not listed as a Hazardous, Extremely Hazardous, or Toxic Substance or Waste under EPCRA or under Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), or under the Resour"

This oil must be removed periodically, and is manually drained by Quantum Foods maintenance employees following standard operating procedures outlined in the Quantum Foods Process Safety Management program described below.  The drained oil, which contains trace quantities of anhydrous ammonia, is stored in sealed containers and is periodically removed from the site by a licensed, hazardous waste-hauling contractor.\n\nWorst-Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nIn compliance with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency Risk Management Plan, worst-case release and alternative case release scenarios have been calculated to determine the degree to which an uncontrolled release of anhydrous ammonia at Quantum Foods would adversely impact the surrounding community and environment.   The calculations were made following the EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) method.\n\nThe selected condition for the worst-case release considers a rupture of the intercooler/pump receiver vessel, located in the facility Engine Room, with the vessel containing anhydrous ammonia pressurized to a liquid state at the level corresponding to the high-level safety cut-out point of the vessel.  This level is prevented from being surpassed by operating procedures and high level alarm and cut-off controls.\n\nAt the internal vessel temperature of 25 0 F., this level is equivalent to approximately 16,500 lbs of anhydrous ammonia, and accounts for approximately 90% of the anhydrous ammonia held in the system.  \n\nIt is assumed that the rupture is at the bottom of the vessel and will thereby cause most of the anhydrous ammonia in to be released in a liquid state.  It is also assumed that the rupture is such that the all of the liquid will be drained from the vessel in a period of ten minutes, the anhyd"

The Engine Room is windowless, and has a volume of 45,000 cubic feet.  It can be assumed that only a portion of the anhydrous ammonia will be in vapor or liquid droplet form and thus be airborne.  Evenly dispersed, this portion will constitute approximately 1 lb. of anhydrous ammonia per 14 cubic feet.  The remainder will collect in pools on the Engine Room floor, evaporating relatively slowly and contributing to the rate of release from the building to a lesser degree.\n\nThe Engine Room is mechanically ventilated.  Assuming that all ventilation equipment is in operation at the time of release, resulting in over 40 air changes per hour, the estimated release rate from the facility into the surrounding environment is 560 lbs of anhydrous ammonia per minute.  \n\nThe OCA assumes existing meteorological conditions of a wind speed of 1.5 meters/sec., F stability class, 250 C (770 F) outdoor ambient temperature and 50% humidity.  Under these conditions, the area affected by the release will extend from the point of release at Quantum Foods to a radius of 1.4 miles (toxic endpoint) in the surrounding community.\n\nThe selected condition for the alternative case release scenario considers a flange failure, weld crack, valve stem leak, or gasket rupture in the pressurized, intermediate temperature anhydrous ammonia pipe line located on the roof of the facility.  The anhydrous ammonia in this line is in a liquid state under a pressure of 60 psig.\n\nAssuming that the breach in the line is the equivalent of a =\" hole, the release rate into the surrounding atmosphere is estimated to be approximately 310 lbs per minute.\n\nFor the alternative case scenario, the OCA assumes existing meteorological conditions of a wind speed of 3 meters/sec., D stability class, 250 C.

This significantly reduces the possibility of inadvertent damage to system components by forklift operations or other production or material handling activities.\n7 \nFive year Accident History\n\nThere has been no accidental release of anhydrous ammonia at Quantum Foods since the facility was constructed and operations were initiated in 1997. \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nAll employees involved in the operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system attend training classes that focuses specifically on responding to spills and uncontrolled releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Response equipment, including portable leak detectors, negative pressure respirators, personal protective equipment, and a full assortment of tools are readily accessible to promptly abate and repair any incidental and minor releases of anhydrous ammonia. \n\nQuantum Foods has developed a written contingency plan in conjunction with the Bolingbrook Fire Department and the Will County Emergency Planning Committee to address the occurrence of a significant release of anhydrous ammonia at the facility.  Emergency notification procedures to response agencies and the community are clearly outlined in the plan, along with critical site and system information to control and abate a release.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nQuantum Foods plans to continue its proactive approach toward safety assurance through continuous and attentive examination of new safety technologies in the refrigeration industry, and by exploring all new ideas and improvements that may enhance our existing programs.
