      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n40 CFR 68.155 states that the owner or operator of a regulated source shall provide an executive summary in their Risk Management Plan (RMP) that includes a brief description of the Risk Management Program elements established under the rule.  This Executive Summary is intended to satisfy those requirements.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nSF Phosphates Limited Company (SFP's) Rock Springs Fertilizer manufacturing complex is located approximately 4.5 miles southeast of Rock Springs, WY on Highway 430 in Sweetwater, County.  With the exception of a small residential subdivision to the southwest of the plant, the area is undeveloped.  This facility manufactures phosphate fertilizer used primarily for agricultural food crops.  The facility employs 200 full time staff and operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  SFP is a solid and responsible member of the local community.  The Company and its employees strive to contribute and improve the community they work and live in through their involvement, volunteerism and support of local programs.  \n\nSFP is committed to protecting the environment and preserving natural resources through the elimination or reduction of toxic substance use, pollution prevention at the source and responsible recycling, treatment and disposal of waste materials.  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nSF Phosphates Limited Company (SFP), Rock Springs Fertilizer Complex, Rock Springs, Wyoming, is committed to being a responsible community partner. Emergency response planning and training of all employees is current and on going.  The company fully supports an emergency response team, whose members receive more advanced training.  Every reasonable effort is made to prevent a \"significant accidental release\" to the air from the facility.  Local fire departments and local emergency management agencies receive annual Sara Title III reports that give information about materials that are manufactured, stored, and used at"

      "SummaryText": "the facility.  It is SFP's policy to fully cooperate with all inspections and requests for information from all regulatory agencies.\n\nRegulated Substances Processed, Stored, or Used: \n\t\n\tSFP's Rock Springs Fertilizer Complex manufactures phosphate fertilizer \nproducts and industrial chemicals. These processes require the use of two substances currently listed in the RMP rule.  These substances are anhydrous ammonia used to manufacture fertilizers and chlorine used strictly for water treatment.  The Rock Springs complex transfers, stores, and processes anhydrous ammonia and stores chlorine in quantities exceeding the rule applicability threshold limits, therefore requiring the facility to develop a Risk Management Program and submit an RMP.  Because these processes and substances are also subject to the OSHA-PSM standard and are not eligible for Program 1, the processes that contain these substances will be regulated as Program 3 processes under the RMP rule.  Both of these substances are regulated as toxic substances.  There are no regulated flammable substances above their respective threshold quantity at this facility. \n\t\t\nWorst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios:\n\t\n\tThe RMP rule requires facilities containing Program 3 processes to provide a hazard assessment of the potential worst-case and alternative release scenarios involving the regulated substances.  The rule requires that a worst-case scenario representative of all toxic substances and an alternative release scenario for each toxic substance be evaluated and reported in the RMP.  SFP has evaluated worst-case scenarios involving the largest vessels of anhydrous ammonia and chlorine and has determined that the worst-case scenario is dictated by the catastrophic failure of one of its pressurized storage tanks.  This hypothetical release dictated by the rule involves the sudden failure and subsequent release of the contents of one tank, administratively controlled to 161.5 tons, in 10 minutes.  This releas"

Assuming these conditions, the release was evaluated with the publicly available model DEGADIS, which has been demonstrated to provide reasonable estimates of concentrations and distances associated with that type of release.  The modeled results indicate that the impact from this hypothetical release will extend offsite, and under certain wind directions, can encompass public receptors.  In addition to the extremely unlikely probability of such a hypothetical scenario occurring, SFP has numerous prevention and safety features including elevation of the storage tanks, concrete barriers around all storage tanks, a comprehensive inspection program, pressure relief and emergency shutoff valves and water fog nozzles in place in order to reduce the potential for this scenario. \n\nAlternative release scenarios should be modeled and be representative of scenarios that may have occurred or are more likely to occur.  The SFP processes regulated under this rule have not had any previous accidental releases, therefore the alternative release scenarios are also based on a hypothetical, although more likely potential release scenarios.\n\nThe hypothetical anhydrous ammonia alternative release scenario consists of an accidental rupture of an 8-inch diameter overhead transfer pipe due to an impact from a mobile crane.  The scenario assumes that the pipe is completely severed, releasing anhydrous ammonia liquefied by pressure for approximately two minutes before the automatic shutoff valves cut off the flow.  The contents of the unblocked pipe lengths is assumed to subsequently drain out, prolonging the release slightly.  A total quantity of over 45,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia is estimated to be released.  This scenario was also modeled using the DEGADIS model assuming typical meteorological conditions as recorded at the Rock Springs Airport"

      "SummaryText": "and, conservatively, as a ground level release.  The impact of this scenario is predicted to extend offsite and under certain wind conditions, could potentially impact public receptors.  This release is highly unlikely to occur due to the general facility accident prevention program requiring all employees to be aware of potential dangers and other prevention steps in-place, such as signs and markings clearly indicating the location of the pipes and warning crane operators of potential danger.  \n\nThe hypothetical alternative release scenario for chlorine is based on the assumption that a 3/4 inch diameter fuse plug on the bottom of a one-ton cylinder fails and the contents of the tank are released, unmitigated.  It is estimated that the release would persist approximately 13 minutes.  The impact of this scenario, as modeled with the DEGADIS model, is predicted to extend beyond the plant boundary, however, no public receptors would be within the endpoint concentration.  This scenario has never happened at this facility and is also highly unlikely to occur in the future due to SFP's operator training in the use of chlorine cylinder repair kits and safe cylinder handling practices.  SFP is also currently evaluating possible replacement chemicals for chlorine, which could be safer to store and use.\n\nAlthough these release scenarios are hypothetical and unlikely to occur, SFP is prepared to respond to any release at the facility through the implementation of its Emergency Response Plan and deployment of the emergency response team, thus minimizing the impact of any release.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps:\n\nThe processes and substances regulated by the RMP rule have also been subject to the OSHA-Process Safety Management (PSM) standard for many years.  Under the OSHA Program, the facility is required to develop a prevention program, which is equivalent to that required by the Risk Management Program rule. SFP developed and i"

The prevention programs for the covered processes establish a multi-element program and management policies and procedures which when implemented will facilitate the prevention of accidental releases and will minimize any potential release.  SFP staff assigned to work on these processes are highly trained in the safe handling of all hazardous materials present at the facility, especially those in the covered processes. Each employee receives initial training and annual refreshers appropriate to the job when hired or when re-assigned. \n\tIn addition to Training, the following prevention program elements inherent in the Process Safety Management (PSM) program have been implemented in all areas where anhydrous ammonia and chlorine are present. The following elements of PSM decrease the likelihood of a release:\n\n(1) Mechanical Integrity is a preventative maintenance program that assures the structural integrity of process vessels and piping.\n(2) Hot Work Permits are required to prevent fires in areas where ammonia would be effected.\n(3) Process Hazard Analyses are performed on all new processes and periodically on existing process that contain ammonia or chlorine.\n(4) Management of Change procedures are followed in order to help prevent failure due to improper engineering or modifications.\n(5) Operating Procedures are in place and operators are trained\n\t\ton these procedures.\n(6) Incident Investigations are done on any accident or near miss to find possible changes that can be made to prevent future incidents.\n(7) Emergency Response and Planning helps to prepare facility employees to respond to a release of a hazardous material if such an event were to actually occur.\n(8) Pre-Startup Safety Reviews are done on all new or modified \n\t\t\tprocesses.\n(9) Compliance Audits.
