The Plant Engineer has overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of RMP elements. This position has direct supervisory responsibility for the operations and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system. This position coordinates RMP implementation by interaction with the site's Maintenance Technicians, Plant Engineer and contractors involved in the design, operation and maintenance of the system.\n\nExecutive Summary\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nFresh Express is committed to maintaining a safe work environment. The Plant Engineer for the Fresh Express Harrisburg site ensures that safe practices are followed in operations involving hazardous materials. This site has established emergency procedures and coordinates with the local Fire Department and a local Emergency Response Team (to be contracted) to ensure rapid and appropriate response to hazardous material emergencies, which include response to emergencies related to the ammonia refrigeration system covered by this RMP. The site has written evacuation, reporting, and response procedures in place to protect Fresh Express employees, the public, and the environment in the event of an ammonia release. \nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\nThe Fresh Express facility covered by this RMP is located at 7505 Grayson Road in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The facility receives produce to be processed, packaged for consumer use in various salad mixes, set for short-term storage, transported and distributed from the site.\nThe regulated substance is anhydrous ammonia. One fixed ammonia refrigeration system is used for refrigerating produce at various temperatures. The total charge to this refrigeration system is estimated at 13,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.

The worst-case release rate would therefore be approximately 1,300 pounds of ammonia per minute. Passive mitigation measures were considered to limit the off-site consequence distance for this scenario since the largest vessel is located indoors. The estimated distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case release scenario would be less than 0.1 mile. \nAlternative Release Scenario\nThe alternative release scenario was derived from the results of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) study conducted at Fresh Express in July 2008. The scenario chosen is a vapor release from a pressure relief valve resulting from overpressurization of the high pressure receiver or a release through a relief valve that has failed \"open\". Since the valve discharge point is located outdoors (i.e., mounted on the roof), no mitigation measures were considered. Based on the manufacturers stated release rate of 50 pounds of ammonia per minute and assuming that the entire system charge is released, the estimated distance to the toxic endpoint for this alternative release scenario would be 0.1 mile.\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nPrevention of accidental ammonia releases at Fresh Express is accomplished through sound industry practice in the original system design and construction, the specification and review of system modifications prior to their occurrence, and the regular operation, maintenance and monitoring of the system. This includes:\n* Compliance with industry standards and codes in effect at the time of initial construction of the system, as well as in the event "

A tabular summary of the release scenario data and results is presented at the end of this section.\nWorst-Case Scenario\nThe worst-case release scenario defined by the RMP regulations (19 CCR 2750.3) for ammonia used in this process is as follows: \"For regulated toxic substances that are normally gases at ambient temperature and handled as a gas or liquid under pressure, the owner or operator shall assume that the quantity in the vessel or pipe (whichever is greater) is released as a gas over 10 minutes.\" In this worst-case scenario, the total system charge is assumed to be released within 10 minutes from the high-pressure receiver resulting from a breach of containment, based on the system design. \nFresh Express has determined that the current total system charge is approximately 13,000 pounds. The worst-case release rate would therefore be approximately 1,300 pounds of ammonia per minute. The largest vessels of the system are indoors and hence passive mitigation measures were considered to limit the off-site consequence distance for this scenario. The estimated distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case release scenario would be less than 0.1 mile.\nAlternative Scenario\nPursuant to RMP regulations, the alternative release scenario was identified as that which is more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario, and that which will reach an endpoint offsite. The alternative release scenario used meteorological conditions more representative of the site than those used for the worst-case scenario. The alternative release scenario was derived from the results of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) study conducted at Fresh Express in July 2008. \n\nThe scenario chosen is a release of the entire contents of the system through a pressure relief valve resulting from "

Based on the manufacturer specified release rate of 50 pounds of ammonia vapor per minute and assuming that the entire system charge is released, the estimated distance to the toxic endpoint for this alternative release scenario would be 0.1 mile.\nRelease Scenario Map\nThe figure presented at the end of this section depicts the above release scenarios, plotted on a map of the area generated by LandView(r) 6 desktop mapping program.\nOffsite Impacts\nAs required by the RMP regulations, the populations that fall within the circles defined by the distance to toxic endpoints for both the worst-case and alternative release scenarios have been estimated using LandView(6 desktop mapping program. Population data in the program is based on Census 2000.\nResidential Populations\nThe LandView(6 desktop mapping program was used to pinpoint the Fresh Express facility and estimate populations within the release scenario radius.

As a result, subsection (a) is intentionally excluded.] \n* The NAICS code for the process is 311991 (Perishable Prepared Food Manufacturing), which is the NAICS code for the facility.\n* The name of the substance covered is ammonia (anhydrous).\n* July 08, 2008 was the date on which the safety information was last reviewed. Under normal operation, the system neither exposes personnel nor releases ammonia to the surrounding atmosphere. The process uses ammonia for refrigerating produce.\nEquipment safe operating limits for the ammonia refrigeration process are as follows:\n\nEquipment Safe Operating Limits\n* Pressure \n140-170 psig (high pressure receiver)\n29-30 psig (low pressure receiver, chillers)\n25-35 psig (air units)\n30-40 psi (oil)\n* Flow \n46 gpm max (low pressure receiver)\n1050 gpm max (condenser water)\n80-220 gpm max (chillers)\n* Temperature\n17-95 ?F (system)\n120-145 ?F (oil)\n120-145 ?F (compressors)\n* The date of completion of the most recent PHA for the ammonia refrigeration system was July 08, 2008, and the techniques used included HAZOP and What-If.\n(1) The expected date of completion for all changes resulting from the PHA is December 31, 2008.\n(2) The major ha"

These SOPs are incorporated by reference into the Prevention Program document supporting this RMP, and are maintained by the Facilities Maintenance Department. These procedures are in place for the following activities: Startup, Routine Operation, and Shutdown. There is no Temporary Operation applicable to the system. Each procedure contains steps for each applicable operating phase, and lists operating limits and hazard consequences of deviation where they are applicable. A general operating procedure stating safety and health considerations (including exposure hazards/prevention measures) and describing safety systems has also been developed. \n* The ammonia supplier provides training to its own operators and drivers who have responsibility for transporting ammonia to and offloading ammonia at customer sites. The types of competency testing used by the supplier for its employees include written tests, skills demonstration and observation to ensure that these employees are able to perform their duties in a safe manner. \n* Fresh Express and contracted ammonia system operations and maintenance personnel have extensive amm"

Maintenance is performed by Fresh Express employees and/or contractors as per manufacturer recommendations and established procedures. Fresh Express is to inspect and monitor the system on a regular basis. These inspections are to be documented, and records of these inspections are to be reviewed and maintained by the Facilities Maintenance Department. \n* Initial development of management of change procedures related to the ammonia refrigeration system resulted from the compliance requirement for Fresh Express to develop a Program 3 Prevention Program that includes these procedures.\n* The most recent pre-startup review of the ammonia refrigeration system occurred prior to its initial operation in 2000.\n* RMP compliance audits are to be conducted in the future at least once every three years, with the first one to be conducted in April 2008. \n* To-date, few minor incidents related to the covered process have occurred. According to facility personnel, these incidents have not resulted in onsite or offsite environmental, health or safety impacts. \n* For incidents involving injuries, Fresh Express's normal incident investigation process begins through notification of the injured employee's supervisor or manager, who contacts the Plant Engineer.
