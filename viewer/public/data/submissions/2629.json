The Facility Policy\n\n\tMFA Incorporated, and the employees of the MFA Agri Services in Jefferson\nCity are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If\nan accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Jefferson City\nFire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact\nof the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n\tThe primary activity at the facility is the receiving, storage and distribution of\nbulk dry and liquid fertilizer and anhydrous ammonia for direct application as a crop\nnutrient. The\nfacility also handles pesticides, grain, feed and farm supply products. \n\n\tThe maximum quantity stored would be 76,500 pounds in our 18,000 gallon\nstorage tank. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a transport\ndelivery truck holding approximately 50,000 pounds.\n\n3. The worst-case and alternative release scenario.\n\n\ta. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the\nstorage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be\n76,500 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as\nlimited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200\nppm) is 1.8 miles.\n\n\tb. The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a\nrelease from a break in a 3\u0014 transfer hose during receiving operations. This release is\nassumed to last approximately 2 minutes before automatic or manual shut-off stops the\nflow. The maximum quantity release would be 26,638 pounds. The distance to the\nendpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.2 miles.\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n\tThe facility has implemented the provisions of"
