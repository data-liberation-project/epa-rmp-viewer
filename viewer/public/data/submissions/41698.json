Facility Accidental Release Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of John Taylor Fertilizers Company, Rio Linda facility (herein referred to as the Facility) at 841 West Elkhorn Blvd., Rio Linda, California, 95673 are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the Facility is the storage, blending, and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  Anhydrous Ammonia is also used in the production of ammonium polyphosphate fertilizer.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received by truck and stored in two thirty-ton bullets at the site.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled in this process is 103,800 pounds.\n\nAqua ammonia (25% of ammonia by wieght) is received and stored in two 168,000 gallon above ground tanks at the site.  The storage tanks are located within a secondary containment structure.  The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia handled is 2,553,600 pounds.  The total quantity of ammonia present in aqua ammonia, based on 25% active ingredient by weight, is 638,400 pounds.\n\nAmmonium polyphosphate is produced at the site using anhydrous ammonia  and a 10-34-0 reactor. The end product, ammonium polyphosphate, is not a regulated substance. \n\n3.  The Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nIn compliance with the 40 CFR 68 revised 2004 regulations to"
