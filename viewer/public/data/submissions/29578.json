The RMP was prepared in compliance with 40 CFR\nPart 68 and Clean Air Act (CAA) Section 112(r)(1).  The Prevention Program elements build\nupon the facility's Process Safety Management (PSM) system prepared in compliance with 29\nCFR Part 1910.119. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIt is CAPR's policy to comply with applicable Federal and Puerto Rican requirements.  The\nchlorination process at the Comerio Wastewater Treatment Plant uses chlorine, a hazardous toxic substance regulated by EPA, OSHA, and PROSHO.  Due to the hazardous characteristics of chlorine, the Comerio Wastewater Treatment Plant observes various safety precautions in the\nstorage, conveyance and use of chlorine.  The safety precautions are necessary to protect\nemployees, contractors, and visitors at the Comerio Wastewater Treatment Plant and the\nimmediately surrounding areas.  Safety precautions include procedures and equipment to minimize\nthe potential for accidental release, as well as a written emergency response program for response\nto any chlorine release that may occur.\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Comerio Wastewater Treatment Plant provides treatment for up to 1.0 million gallons per\nday of wastewater.  The regulated substance handled at the Comerio Wastewater Treatment Plant is chlorine.\n\nChlorine is delivered to the facility via truck in ton containers.  The storage building has space for\nup to three full containers, a total of 6,000 pounds of chlorine.  Chlorine containers are connected to vacuum chlorinators.  The chlorinators regulate chlorine use.  From the chlorinators, chlorine gas is distributed under vacuum to i"

The chlorinated water is mixed with the wastewater plant flow for disinfection and odor control.\n\nWorst-case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case release scenario was determined following EPA's Risk Management Program\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The worst-case release scenario is a vapor release of the\nentire contents of a ton container over a ten minute period (200 pounds of chlorine per minute). \nOther worst-case assumptions required by EPA include a low wind speed (1.5 meters per\nsecond), stable atmosphere (Class F), urban topography, and no active mitigation of the release.\n\nEPA requires the determination of the area (zone of vulnerability) which may be exposed to a\nchlorine concentration of 3 ppm or greater.  According to the American Industrial Hygiene\nAssociation, 3 ppm is the maximum concentration of chlorine in air below which nearly all people\ncould be exposed for one hour without serious health effects.  Based on the worst-case\nassumptions, the zone of vulnerability was determined to extend 1.3 miles from the chlorine storage area.\n  \nThe following are known to be within the zone of vulnerability for the worst-case release\nscenario: residences, religious institution, and recreation area.\n\nApproximately 2,900 residents are located within a 1.3 mile radius of the\nchlorine storage area.  Many of these residents would not actually be impacted in even a\nworst-case release, as the chlorine would travel in the direction of wind.  No known\nenvironmental receptors (such as state parks or officially designated wildlife preserves) are\nlocated within the zone of vulnerability.\n\nThe conditions and parameters for the worst-case scenario are specified by EPA.  A more realistic\nalternative release scenario was examined, also following EPA's Risk Management Program\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The alternative release scenario is a vapor release of the\nentire contents of "

If the\ncontainer was not shut off, the contents would be released at a rate of 21 pounds of chlorine per\nminute over a 95 minute period.  More typical weather conditions are also used (wind speed of\n3.0 meters per second, atmospheric stability Class D).  Other conditions remain the same as in the\nworst-case scenario (urban topography and no mitigation of the release).\n\nThe zone of vulnerability for the alternative release scenario is determined to extend 0.1 miles from the chlorine storage area.  Approximately 10 residents and recreational area are located within a 0.1 miles radius of the chlorine storage area.  These residents and recreational area could be impacted, depending on the direction of wind.  No known environmental receptors are located within the zone of vulnerability.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nCAPR complies with PROSHO requirements for Prevention Programs and for Process Safety\nManagement.  Operators, maintenance staff and contractors are informed of chlorine hazards, and\nhazard signs are posted in the chlorine storage area.  Standard operating and maintenance\n procedures have been developed, and employees who work with chlorine are provided training.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nCAPR has an emergency response program.  Chlorine gas detectors are located within the storage\narea for early detection and warning of any leak.  Leak repair kits are maintained on site, and\noperators are trained in how to quickly stop any leak that may occur.  The emergency response\nprogram is coordinated with Civil Defense for notification of the public.\n\nCAPR periodically conducts various training programs, including emergency response training. All CAPR facilities are scheduled to recieve refresher training by September 30, 1999.\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nWithin the past five years there have been no unplanned releases of chlorine in excess of"

Issues identified from a PHA are then addressed in CAPR's Prevention Program. \nRecommendations from the most recent PHA include more frequent training in operating and\nmaintenance procedures, and an improved preventative maintenance program.
