FACILITY POLICY:  The owners, management and employees of Farmers Cooperative Elevator of Ottosen, Iowa (the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2. FACILITY INFORMATION:  The facility is a country grain elevator which buys, stores and sells grain and provides inputs (fertilizer, seed, etc.) to local farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient. It is stored in two (2) steel containers: one (1) @ 26,000 gallons (appoximately 113,815 pounds) and 1 @ 12,000 gallons (approximately 52,530 pounds) and 35 nurse tanks: 29 @ 1,450 gallons (approximately 184,100 pounds) and 6 @ 1,000 gallons (approximately 26,265 pounds). The maximum quantity stored would be about 377,000 pounds.\n\n3. WORST CASE AND ALTERNATE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS:  A) The Worst Case Release Scenario would be the release of the total contents of the largest storage tank as a gas over a period of 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be about 113,815 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion of the gas to 2oo parts per million, or ppm) would be about 2.4 miles.  B) The Alternate Case Release Scenario would be a release from a break in a 3\" transfer hose, lasting 2 minutes before an automatic or manual shut-off intervenes to stop the flow. The maximum quantity released is estimated to be about 26,640 pounds. The distance to the endpoint would be about 1.6 miles.\n\n4. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRA"

      "SummaryText": "M:  The facility has been reviewed for general compliance with applicable standards for storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia. Those standards include: the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI); US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" and Iowa Administrative Code (IAC) Part 21-Chapter 43-Rule 43.6(200), \"Standard for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n5. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:  There have been no accidental releases of anydrous ammonia over the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage, nor, to the best of our knowledge, have resulted in any off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:  The facility has: A) a written Emergency Action Plan (EAP) in accordance with OSHA Standrad 29 CFR 1910.38 and B) provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:  Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
