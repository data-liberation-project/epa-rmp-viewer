General accidental release and prevention policy of Shaws Southern Belle Frozen Foods. \n\nIn this frozen food product manufacturing facility we handle ammonia which is considered\nhazardous by the EPA.  The same properties that make ammonia a valuable refrigerant also makes\nit necessary to observe certain safety precautions during it's use to prevent human exposure,\nreduce the threat to our workers personal health, the surrounding community and the\nenvironment.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state regulations.  Safety\ndepends directly on our proper handling of ammonia combined with the safety devices that are\nincorporated in our facility and the safe handling procedures that our personnel are trained in.\n\n2.  Stationary source and regulated substance handled.\n\nShaws Southern Belle Frozen Foods, 821 Virginia Street, Jacksonville, Florida, is responsible for\nthe manufacturing of frozen seafood. There are approximately 90 employees at this facility which\nincludes hourly and salary personnel.  The plant manufactures product from 6:00 am to 4:30 pm,\n(5) five days a week. Shaws Frozen Foods  is located on the north west side of Jacksonville. The\nresidential receptors in the community are predominantly located to the west and south-west of\nthe plant.\n\nThe potentially hazardous chemical used at the Shaws Southern Belle Frozen Foods facility is\nANHYDROUS AMMONIA.    The dominant characteristic of ammonia vapor is it's pungent,\ndistinct odor.  Persons exposed to ammonia will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small\nconcentrations, although these levels would not result in any health risks. \nRisks from accidental exposure to ammonia in a vapor state are irritations to the eyes, nose and\nthroat. The extent of irritation depends on the exposure amount and length of exposure time.   \nAmmonia is cl"

      "SummaryText": "assified non-flammable by the Department of Transportation.  It will burn, but only\nin a very narrow, high concentration level with a constant ignition source.\n\nThe normal operating level of ammonia that is used at the Southern Belle Frozen Foods facility is\n11,000 pounds. The anhydrous ammonia is used as the refrigerant chemical in the  manufacturing\nand storage  process. The possible hazards that could lead to an accidental release include, but are\nnot limited to, equipment failure, damage to piping, damage to equipment, human error, etc. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Worst and Alternate Case Release Scenarios.  \n\n     Worst case release scenario criteria for Shaws Southern Belle Frozen Foods facility:\n\n Worst case scenario depicts continuous source leak from the High Pressure Recirculator (HPR)\nlocated inside the machine room.  This vessels normal operating level is 3,600 pounds of liquid\nammonia,  approximately 60% of it's total capacity. Although it's maximum capacity is 5,800\npounds, engineered limit switches and administrative procedures prevent it from exceeding an\n80% operating level at any time.\n\n     Potential Ammonia Release Quantity:     3,600 pounds\n     Rate of Release:                   360 lbs / min. (10 min. release)\n     LOC (Level of Concern):            200 ppm  (EPA ERPG-2)  \n     Physical State:                    Gas \n           Type of Area:                     Urban\n     Wind Speed:                        1.5 meters per second\n     Distance to Endpoint                    1.2 miles\n\n\n           Alternate case release scenario criteria for Shaws Southern Belle Frozen Foods facility:\n\nAlternate release scenario is represented by the release of ammonia vapor from a safety relief\nvalve (SRV) due to an over-pressurization condition on a vertical vessel located within the Shaws\nSouthern Belle Frozen Foods facility machine room.  SRV would be performing exactly as it is\ndesigned to do. Although the actual valve would open on the vessel in the machine room, it would"

Detector control system  activates\nlocal alarms to alert refrigeration operators and personnel in the immediate area that a leak has\nbeen detected. \n     *  High liquid level switches are configured to pressure vessels (intercoolers, recirculator\nand subcooler) to alert refrigeration personnel in the event of a deviation from normal operating\nlevels.\n     *  Safety relief valves are installed on pressure vessels and condensers to eliminate a\npossible over pressurization condition in the associated vessel.\n     \n\n     *  Refrigeration operators on duty 18 hours a day (6:00 am - 12:00 pm), Monday - Friday. \nOperators make periodic rounds and log entries each shift to monitor equipment status.\n     *  Periodic Maintenance Program is conducted by a refrigeration contractor to ensure all\nrefrigeration components are kept in optimum operational and mechanical status.\n     \n\n4.  Five-year accident history.\n\nShaws Southern Belle Frozen Foods has had no accidental releases over the last five years.  \n\n\n5.   Emergency Action Program\n\nThe purpose of the Shaws Southern Belle Frozen Foods Emergency Action Program is to:\n\n     1.   Minimize exposure to our employees and the surrounding community in the event of a\n     hazardous material release or spill.\n\n     2.  Assure the safe emergency evacuation of the plant in the instance that it is required.\n\n     3.  Provide for prompt medical attention to any employees who become ser"
