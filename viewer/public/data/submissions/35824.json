      "SummaryText": "North Star Coop's approach ro chemical safety is a work in progress.  The program is a work in progress because of changing rules/regulations and outside impacts on our business.  Our cooperative is always looking for ways to improve security and safety both for ur facilities and employees.  One of the major outside impacts in our business is the increasedmeth traffic in our small rurla area.  We now keep all nurse tanks empty dring the off season months and do not fill them until called for in the spring.\nOur Ammonia (anhydrous) facility is separate from the rest of our operationsand is a retail fill site.  The facility has two bullets on our Park River site.  North Star Coop trains employees to safely work with hazardous substances.  Each employee is also given instruction as to the procedures to follow should a release occur.  Our county Emergency Management and local fire department personnel are aware of our Ammonia (anhydrous) facilities.\nNorth Star Coop has not had any accidental releases in the past five years.\nShould and accidental release occur, North StarCoop employees are to notify the following offices by dialing 911:  county Emergency Management, local fire department and police department.  The supervisor contacts the general manager.\nNorth Star Coop is a young company in the process of updating our compliance programs.  We are training our employees to follow rules and regulations put forth by the many governing agencies like the EPA to name one.  We are striving to teach our employees that safety is not something that is taught one day and forgotten the next, but that all training no matter what the topic covered is to ensure their safety on the job.  By following rules and regulations they can make a difference even if it is just by buckling their seat belt while operating a lift truck.  One the employees are given the tools they need to work safely in their environment, they then start to police each other and create a safer working environment."
