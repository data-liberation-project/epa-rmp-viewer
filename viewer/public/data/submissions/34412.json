      "SummaryText": "The BOC Edwards,  Hillsboro facility, owned and operated by The BOC Group, Incorporated is located at 4655 Northwest 235th Ave.; Hillsboro, OR  97124. The management and employees of the Hillsboro facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of Trichlorosilane.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the community and the environment.\n\nThe facilities primary operation is the storage and distribution of Trichlorosilane into DOT containers for distribution to customers. Trichlorosilane is received and stored in a 6,000 gallon (67,200 lb) tank.  The Trichlorosilane is then filled into various size DOT containers for distribution to customers.\n\nThe worst-case scenario, based on the EPA's definition for a flammable gas release, would be the rupture of the 6,000 gallon Trichlorosilane Tank. The result would be a maximum release of 67,200 lbs of Trichlorosilane over a 10 minute period.\n\nThe Alternative release scenario was based on a release from a 550 lb container over a 10 minute period. Results were calculated using RMPComp.* version 1.07 and \"LandView V\" to determine effected population. Results can be gotten from contacting BOC Edwards, Hillsboro site and requesting to view documentation.\n\nThere were no reportable accidents in the past five years. \n\nThe facility has developed a comprehensive prevention program designed to prevent accidental releases of Trichlorosilane.  The program utilizes state-of-the-art technology, sound engineering practices, administrative controls and active employee participation.  Employees serve on task groups and teams in developing and maintaining risk management program elements.  They are frequently consulted concerning the various aspects of the program and ways to continually improve the safety of the process.\n  \nWritten process safety information was developed fo"

This information was utilized to develop a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) which assists management and employees in making decisions for improving safety and reducing the consequences of releases of Trichlorosilane. The PHA focuses attention on equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions, (routine and nonroutine), and external factors that might impact the process by identifying potential failure points or failure modes in the process. The PHA was review and updated on May 3, 2001 and will be updated at least every 5 years. \n\nDetailed 0perating procedures exist which describe tasks to be performed, dates to be recorded, operating conditions to be maintained, samples to be collected, and safety and health precautions to be taken.  The procedures were reviewed/approved to ensure they are technically accurate by employees, managers and personnel with the technical expertise/knowledge of the process.  The operating procedures were review on May 12, 2004 and are annually reviewed/revised as necessary to reflect current operations.\n\nEmployees are thoroughly trained, including maintenance and contractor employees.  The training meets and exceeds the requirements as outlined in OSHA?s hazard communication standard 29 CFR 1910.1200.  Training includes operating procedures, safe work practices, emergency procedures (including alarms), special assignments, evacuation and emergency response; safety rules and procedures; routine and nonroutine work authorization; and other pertinent process safety information.  Each employee trained has a defined and documented program based on their job duties.  The training goals and objectives have been established and written in clear and measurable terms.

The employees  are periodically evaluated to ensure they posses the necessary skills and knowledge via written tests, observation and/or oral interviews. The training program was last reviewed in May 2004.\n\nA contractor screening process has been established and is designed to ensure that contractors hired or used can accomplish their assigned tasks without compromising the safety and health of employees and the public.   The screening program involves obtaining information on the contractor's safety performance, including injury and illness rates, and experience.  In addition, the contractor's safety performance, job skills, knowledge, and certifications (such as pressure vessel welders) are also verified. The contractors safety procedures were last review in May 2004.  \n\nPreStart-up Safety Reviews (PSSR) are used for new or modified processes to improve the design and construction of the process from a reliability and quality stand point.  The PSSR recommendations are resolved before final installations are complete. Other items completed prior to initial process startup include piping and instrument diagrams, operating procedures, and ensuring operating personnel are fully trained.  The initial startup and normal operating procedures are fully evaluated as part of the PSSR to assure a safe transfer into the normal operating mode for meeting the process parameters. The last PreStart-up Safety Review was conducted on July 31, 1998.\n\nAn on-going mechanical integrity program (maintenance) is used to ensure safe process operations. Equipment used to store, process, or handle Trichlorosilane has been designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize releases.  The mechanical integrity program includes the identification and categorization of equipment/instrumentation, inspection/tests and their frequencies, development of mainte"

This program was review in May 2004.\n\nHazardous work or nonroutine work is controlled in a consistent manner.  The hazards identified is communicated to those performing the work and to operating personnel whose work could affect the safety of the process.  The BOC Hazardous Work Program describes the steps that a supervisor, contractor representative or other authorized issuer needs to follow to manage hazardous work.   The program references and coordinates applicable lockout/tagout procedures, line breaking, hot work authorization, elevated work/fall protection, controlling access to covered process areas, and excavation procedures. BOC's Confined Space Entry Program is a separate permitting system designed to manage it's employees/contractors in performing this type of work. This Program was review in May 2004 for both employees and contractors.\n \nManagement of Change (MOC) procedures have been developed for permanent changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment and facilities.  MOC procedures are designed to ensure that prior to any change occurring, that technically qualified personnel with knowledge and expertise of the chemical process, reviews and approves the proposed changes.  This would include both technical and mechanical changes.  Process changes include all modifications to equipment, procedures, raw materials and processing conditions other than \"replacement in kind\".  A Process Change Authorization is required for all changes.
