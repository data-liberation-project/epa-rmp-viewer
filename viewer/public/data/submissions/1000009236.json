The primary activity at the Facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and unloaded at the Goshen Yard Facility. The Goshen Yard Facility sells fertilizers, pre-packaged agricultural chemicals, and seeds to farmers in Tulare and Kings counties.\n\nThe Buttonwillow Warehouse Company, Inc. has developed a risk management program to address the EPA RMP Program requirements (Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) A?Risk Management Plan (RMP)A? 40 CFR A?68).  The facility is diligent in the handling of all chemicals and dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community.  The facilityA?s staff is trained and utilizes equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while effectively and safely storing and distributing anhydrous ammonia. This is a EPA RMP Program 3 facility.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nButtonwillow Warehouse Company, Inc. has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the ammonia storage and distribution system.  It is the Buttonwillow Warehouse Company's policy to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated toxic substances.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\nThe Goshen Yard facility receives, stores, and distributes anhydrous ammonia.  The largest Storage tank has a capacity of 15,000 gallons, however administratively controlled not to exceed 80% of each tankA?s maximum capacity. The Goshen Yard Facility's largest Storage tank currently contains 62000 lbs of anhydrous ammonia. \n\nThe system is composed of the following key equipment:\n- Anhydrous Ammonia 15,000 gallon Storage Tank\n- Anhydrous Ammonia (38) 1,000 gallon "

The worst-case scenario is presented in the Hazard Assessment section of the RMP folder. \n\nAlternative Release Scenarios Results Summary:\n\nScenario Description: A realistic toxic alternative release scenario was modeled utilizing a pressure relief valve (PRV) failure. The alternative release scenario is presented in the Hazard Assessment section of the RMP folder.\n\nOff-site Receptors\nRMP requirements state that sensitive populations such as schools, hospitals, day-care centers, long-term health care facilities, prisons, residential areas, public use parks/recreational areas, and major commercial facilities, located within the A?at riskA? area must be identified.  These sensitive populations include individuals who could not remove themselves from the exposure area without assistance.  The sensitive populations also include industrial installations which may have a hazardous process that can not be immediately left unattended. \n\nRisk Considerations\nAlthough the storage and distribution of anhydrous ammonia has inherent potential risks, and the worst-case release scenarios will likely reach a community; the Buttonwillow Warehouse Company, Inc., has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be e"

In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.\n\nThe toxic material Prevention Program 3 elements include:\n- Process Safety Information\n- Process Hazard Analysis\n- Operating Procedures\n- Training\n- Mechanical Integrity\n- Management of Change\n- Pre-Startup Safety Review\n- Compliance Audits\n- Incident Investigation\n- Employee Participation\n- Hot Work Permit\n- Contractors\n- Emergency Planning and Response\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no RMP-applicable releases of toxic materials at the facility in at least the past five (5) years. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nButtonwillow Warehouse Company, Inc. maintains an emergency response plan in compliance with local emergency response agencies.
