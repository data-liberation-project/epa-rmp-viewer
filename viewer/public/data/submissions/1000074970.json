Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Great Lakes Chemical, South Plant are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.    We are also completely coordinated with Union County Arkansas LEPC which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass organic and inorganic chemical synthesis.  We have 9 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include ammonia, bromine,  chlorine, oleum (fuming sulfuric acid) [sulfuric acid, mixture with sulfur trioxide], propylene oxide [oxirane, methyl-], sulfur dioxide (anhydrous), and sulfur trioxide.  The regulated substances at our facility are involved in several uses.  Ammonia is used for acid adjustment and neutralization. Ammonia is used in closed circuit refrigeration and chilling systems. Bromine is produced and used for chemical synthesis.  Chlorine is used for bromine replacement.  Oleum (fuming sulfuric acid) [sulfuric acid, mixture with sulfur trioxide] is used for chemical synthesis.  Propylene oxide [oxirane, methyl-] is used for chemical synthesis. Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) is used for chemical synthesis.   Sulfur trioxide is used for chemical synthesis. \n\n\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s"

Scenarios reflect worst case release of largest vessel of each hazardous substance with the worst conditions reported in the RMP.  Alternative cases were determined from historical release information, and from EPA guidance.  Multiple scenarios were evaluated and scenarios with potential impact outside the fence line chosen to report.\n\n\n\n4.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps.  Our facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with recognized and good engineering practices.  A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nGreat Lakes Chemical, South Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is what if checklist.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of  five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Great Lakes Chemical, South Plant maintains written o"

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nGreat Lakes Chemical, South Plant has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nGreat Lakes Chemical, South Plant carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Great Lakes Chemical, South Plant to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Great Lakes Chemical, South Plant.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe sta"
