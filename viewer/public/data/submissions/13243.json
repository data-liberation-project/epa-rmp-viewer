Proper fully encapsulating suits with self-contained breathing apparatus should always be worn.  Compatible materials may include Kapplor responder.  Many types of bunker gear will break down after even mild exposure to chlorine fumes or liquid.\n\nFirst aid measures include decontamination, removing to fresh air, and keeping the victim at rest.  Dyspnea should be treated with oxygen and eyes should be flushed for a minimum of 15 minutes, if exposed.\n\nDecontamination should include removal of all clothing and washing of affected body areas with soap and water.\n\nIn fire situations, water may increase the evolution of vapors from spilled liquid.  Surrounding materials should be extinguished with the appropriate agent.  Approach from upwind on all possible leaks; remove containers from fire area if it can be done without unreasonable risk.  Exposed containers may have to be cooled with large quantities of water to prevent container rupture.\n\nAlways control the scene and restrict entry to those requiring same.  In spill situations, always protect sewers and storm drains from contaminated run off.  If contamination of waterways or drainage systems does occur, notify affected parties downstream, including waste water treatment facilities.  Evacuate local and downwind areas as conditions warrant.\n\nThe optimum mitigation technique is to stop the flow of the chlorine.  Water spray can be used to knock down vapors for retention, but plans must be made to contain the run off.  Neutralization may be an option but it may involve its own inherent risks.  It should only be attempted after consulting technical manuals or technical experts.\n\nThe application of chlorine kits can be used to stop a leaking chlorine container.  The local Haz-Mat unit carries one type of "

The B Kit is for use on one (1) ton containers (see Attachment #2 for application).\n\nHEALTH HAZZARDS\n\nPoisonous and may be fatal if inhaled.  Contact may cause burns to skin and eyes and may cause bronchitis or chronic lung conditions.  (EPA 1990)\n\nFIRST AID:\n\nWarning:  Effects may be delayed.  Caution is advised.  Chlorine is corrosive and may be converted to hydrochloric acid in the lungs.  Signs and Symptoms of Acute Chlorine Exposure: Signs and symptoms of acute exposure to chlorine may include tachycardia (rapid heart rate), hypertension (high blood pressure) followed by hypotension (low blood pressure), and cardiovascular collapse.  Pulmonary edema and pneumonia are often seen.  The eyes, nose, throat, and chest may sting or burn following exposure to chlorine.  Cough with bloody sputum, a feeling of suffocation, dizziness, agitation, anxiety, nausea, and vomiting are common.  Dermal exposure may result in sweating, pain, irritation, and blisters.\n\nEmergency Life-Support Procedures:  Acute exposure to chlorine may require decontamination and life support for the victims.  Emergency personnel should wear protective clothing appropriate to the type and degree of contamination.  Air-purifying or supplied-air respiratory equipment should also be worn, as necessary.  Rescue vehicles should carry supplies such as chlorine-resistant plastic sheeting and disposable bags to assist in preventing spread of contamination.\n\nInhalation Exposure:\n\n1. Move victims to fresh air.  Emergency personnel should avoid self-exposure to chlorine.\n2. Evaluate vital signs including pulse and respiratory rate, and note any trauma.  If no pulse is detected, provide CPR.  If not breathing, provide artificial respiration.  If breathing is labored, administer oxygen or other respiratory support.\n3. Obtain authorization and/or further instructions from the local hospital for administration of antidote or performance of other invasive procedures.\n\n"
