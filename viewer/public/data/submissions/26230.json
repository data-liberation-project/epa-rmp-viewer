The Facility Policy\n\n    MFA Incorporated, and the employees of the MFA Agri Service in Lineville are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Lineville Fire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n    The primary activity at the facility is the receiving, storage and distribution of dry fertilizer, and anhydrous ammonia for direct application as a crop nutrient.  Pesticides, feed, farm supplies, and grain are also handled at this facility.\n\n    Based off predictive filing the maximum quantity stored at any one time would be 585,124 pounds. There is (1) 30,000 gallon storage tank, (1) 12,000 gallon storage tank, and the largest tank onsite would be a railroad car containing approximately 162,563 pounds. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a rail car holding approximately 162,563 pounds. The facility also has (50) 1,000 gallon nurse tanks and (4) 550 gallon tank applicators for product distribution.\n\n3. The worst-case and alternative release scenario.\n\n    a. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the largest storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 162,563 pounds, which represents the volume of the railcar at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.7 miles.\n\n    b. The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a 3? transfer hose during receiving operations. This release is assumed to last approximately 2 minutes before automatic or manual shut-off stops t"

The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n    The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, 1989\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" and the Iowa Dept. of Agriculture Fertilizer Law.\n\n5. The Five-year Accident History\n\n    There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program.\n\n    The facility has;\n\n    a. a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA\n       Standard, 29 CFR 1910.38; for the notification and \n        evacuation of employees.\n\n    b. provided State and Local authorities with the emergency\n       planning and community right-to-know information as\n       required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\n    c. a written emergency response program, in accordance with\n       OSHA Standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency\n       planning and employee training in the event of a release.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n    Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
