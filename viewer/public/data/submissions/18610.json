A PSM program has been developed to further reduce the likelihood or severity of an accidental release.  Refrigeration system components are located in areas that are not as likely to become damaged (i.e., tanks placed away and protected from forklift and truck traffic).  The facility has a written Emergency Action Plan and key personnel receive OSHA HAZWOPER training.\n\n2.0  Source and regulated substances handled ('68.155(b)).\n\nApproximately 24,000 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia is contained within the refrigeration system on site at Cutler Egg Products, Inc., Abbeville, AL.  The EPA requires a Risk Management Plan be developed and maintained when the total amount of anhydrous ammonia exceeds the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.  No other substances, in quantities subject to EPA RMP certification requirements, are located at the Cutler Egg Products, Inc., Abbeville, Alabama facility.\n\n3.0  Ammonia Worst Case and Alternate Case Release Scenarios ('68.155(c)).\n\n3.1  Worst Case Scenario (WCS)    \n\nThe high-pressure receiver, located outside adjacent to the compressor pad, contains the largest total quantity of anhydrous ammonia, on site, on a predictable worst case basis.  This vessel is typically maintained at less than 60% full.  However, during some shutdown operations, this vessel is used for pumping down the system.  During these operations, this vessel could be filled to approximately 90% capacity or 5,920 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, under an internal pressure and temperature of approximately 114 psig and 70 0F.  The Worst Case Scenario as required by EPA, assumes that the tank's contents are fully released as a gas/vapor over a 10-minute per"

Approximately 183 people, as determined by Landview Census data, in the surrounding community, reside within the radius to the toxic endpoint (level of concern = 200 ppm, anhydrous ammonia).  There are residences and one recreation complex, as reportable by EPA RMP criteria, which lie within the radius to the toxic endpoint. There are no environmental receptors, as reportable by EPA RMP criteria, within the radius to the toxic endpoint.\n\n3.2  Alternate Case Scenario (ACS)\n\nThe Alternate (more realistic) Case Release Scenario for the Cutler Egg Products, Inc., Abbeville, AL facility was selected to involve a 3/4 inch relief valve lifting at 250 psig.  Anhydrous ammonia (at approximately 250 psi and 113 0F) was estimated to have a flow rate of approximately 92 lbs./min., determined from the EPA alternate case ammonia release table.  It is estimated that the relief valve could be isolated, or the overpressure condition corrected, in approximately 10 minutes by trained operators on site, with a corresponding anhydrous ammonia quantity released of approximately 920 lbs.\n\nThe EPA RMP Ammonia Guidance Document Endpoint Tables predicted, with a wind speed of 3 m/s (6 mph) and atmospheric stability class D, that the anhydrous ammonia release may travel approximately 0.2 miles.  There are 13 people, as determined by Landview Census data, within the radius to the toxic endpoint (level of concern = 200 ppm, anhydrous ammonia).
