It is our belief that those things that contribute to safe operations also improve quality and reduce costs.   This commitment to safety can be seen in the investment of resources made for accident prevention.   These efforts include extensive employee training and a systematic approach to safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.   Our policy is to implement effective controls to prevent foreseeable releases of dangerous substances.  To supplement these controls, additional safeguards are provided to reduce the impact of a release should one occur in spite of all precautions.   Plant employees and managers are trained to take appropriate action in an emergency to protect the welfare of the public, our employees and surrounding environment.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nAkzo Nobel Surface Chemistry?s Fort Worth Plant is a specialty surfactant manufacturing facility located at 611 East Northside Drive in Fort Worth, Texas.  The plant is situated on approximately 5 acres in north Fort Worth.  The immediate area surrounding this plant is open undeveloped land to the north, industrial development including Ferro Corporation and residential zoned areas lie to the west, commercial/residential-zoned areas to the south, and the Trinity River to the east.\n\nSpecialty surfactant manufacturing has been conducted at this location since 1974.  This facility makes a variety of specialty surfactants that are used in industrial and agricultural applications throughout the world.  The plant is operated 24 hours per day, seven days per week.

This product was first produced in 1978 and has remained a leader in the dispersants market to this day.    This product?s manufacture is carried out in two reactors vessels especially suited for this type of operation.    The finished product is a water-based surfactant with highly efficient dispersant properties.   Specific applications include agricultural product formulations to retard sedimentation of water dispersible granules such as herbicides, insecticides, and fungicides.    \n\nIn the same unit, formaldehyde is diluted in water to a concentration less than 1% and used to abate odors in a product with an unusually strong odor.   These uses and process areas were identified during either during the initial evaluation of this facility?s inventory of raw materials, finished products, and process intermediates or have been noted subsequent to that evaluation.   The facility?s use of regulated substances in a process equal to or greater than the listed threshold quantities are listed in the table below.  The processes themselves use relatively small quantities of formaldehyde but are subject to regulation due to their connection to the larger storage tank.

Other measures in place significantly reduce the possibility of smaller, less serious releases.  Process equipment design considers the consequences of a variety of process scenarios and incorporates safeguards to prevent or minimize the effect of deviations in normal operating conditions.  Process equipment including vessels, piping, pumps, control systems and safety systems are inspected and maintained in accordance with a mechanical integrity program.   Trained personnel perform critical operations in accordance with standard operating procedures.  \n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention programs in place at Akzo Nobel Surface Chemistry Fort Worth Plant.   The first section lists and explains engineering safeguards installed on the R-331/332 process.  The remaining sections describe management systems intended to address process hazards from initial design and construction through on-going operation and maintenance.\n   \n     R-331/332 Process Safeguards\n\nBoth reaction vessels and storage tank are protected from overpressure conditions with pressure relief devices or conservation vents.   Both reactors and the storage tank vent to a scrubber system that removes or destroys affluent gases and vapors.  During transfers from shipping container to storage tank, releases are prevented by a combination of level indicators and high level alarms that warn personnel if a specified level is exceeded.   Process temperature is monitored from a control room where flow rates may be adjusted as needed.

The plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using reliable process controls and monitoring instruments, emergency relief systems and two stage scrubber system, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., emergency shutdown systems).\n\nThe plant also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n     Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) and Off-Site Consequence Analysis\n\nThe Fort Worth Akzo Nobel Surface Chemistry Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each new and altered process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure the adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nMethodologies used to perform these evaluations include the hazard and operability study (HAZOP) and the What-If/Checklist technique.  These analyses are conducted using cross-functional teams having operations and engineering expertise.   These teams identify and evaluate hazard scenarios, ranking each scenario?s risk level with respect to event likelihood and severity.

The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from those originally planned for in design safety features, Akzo Nobel Surface Chemistry?s Fort Worth Plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis studies.   These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years for covered processes and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.

This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper material and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\n     Safe Work Practices\n\nAkzo Nobel Surface Chemistry?s Fort Worth Plant employs widely accepted safety work practices as a matter of daily routine.   Those safe work practices used include (1) lockout procedures for control of hazardous energy, (2) entry/exit control procedures for maintenance, laboratory, contractor, and support personnel, (3) linebreaking/opening process equipment procedures, (4) a hotwork permit program to control possible ignition sources, and (5) a permit-required confined space entry procedure.  These procedures are used by all personnel involved in both user and non-user maintenance activities.\n\n     Management of Change\n\nThe Akzo Nobel Surface Chemistry?s management of change program is a system to review and evaluate changes to process chemistry, operating conditions or limits, equipment, and procedures to prevent unexpected adverse impacts.    The management of change program uses a quantitative risk assessment to determine the significance of the change.   This risk level assessment determines the levels of authorization required to approve the action.   Design review checklists are used to evaluate different types of changes to prevent new hazards being created or equipment changes which are not suited to the service as it exists in the process.   Another important feature of the management of change program is that is verifies and documents that procedures, records and equipment information are updated and that personnel affected by the change are notified and trained in the change.\n\n     Incident Investigation\n\nAkzo Nobel"

By investigating accidents and near misses, important lessons are learned.   Corrective actions can then be used to prevent similar events in the future.   Incident investigations are documented and recommendations tracked to their completion.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years to facilitate their use during PHA updates and revalidation.\n\n     Compliance Audits\n\nTo assure that the goals of the accident prevention programs are met, program performance is periodically evaluated in the form of compliance audits.   An audit team reviews records and documents to determine the degree of program compliance.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.   Audit team findings are documented and presented to plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to audit findings are tracked until they are complete.   The two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\n     Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe risks associated with this process described earlier in this executive summary require proper management to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances in this facility.  Those steps are briefly explained in the following paragraphs.\n\n     Specialized Safety Features\n\nAkzo Nobel Surface Chemistry?s Fort Worth plant has engineered safety features on those units which process regulated hazardous chemicals to (1) Prevent a release through early warning of impending upsets, and/or (2) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.
