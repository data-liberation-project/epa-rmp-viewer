The RMP was established to meet the requirements of the Risk Management Program as outlined in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40, Part 68 (40CFR 68).\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant for the Dean Foods North Central, LLC plant refrigeration system. Liquid ammonia is circulated as needed to the evaporators, where heat is absorbed. The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system is  a closed loop industrial grade system. The ammonia is not used or mixed in any manner with other chemicals.\n\nDean Foods North Central, LLCI utilizes the applicable elements of it's Process Safety Management (PSM) program (29 CFR 1910) to fulfill the requirements of the level 3 release prevention portion of the RMP.  Process specific training is provided to maintenance and operator/mechanic personnel to ensure that the refrigeration system's mechanical integrity is maintained throughout the life of the process.  Administrative controls are in place to manage process and equipment changes so that training and accident prevention programs can be modified accordingly.  The various facets of the RMP and PSM program are linked through documentation and communication.\n\nA contingency plan was developed for responses to various personnel, chemical, and weather related emergencies.  The contingency plan documents the processes for emergency response, training, resource management, and inforation tracking for the possible emergency incidents that may occur at this facility.  The plan also documents the lines of authority for personnel that may need to manage and/or respond to potential incidents at the facility.\n\nDean Foods North Central, LLC addresses and incorporates recommendations resulting from action items developed from: process hazard analyses, off-site consequence analyses, incident investigations, and program a"
