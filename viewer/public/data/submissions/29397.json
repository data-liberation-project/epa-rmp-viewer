Maintenance personnel receive training on 1) an overview of the process and its hazards, 2) applicable maintenance procedures, and 3) certification for employees conducting nondestructive testing, welding, etc.  Written procedures  ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed and documented to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency in equipment is identified, it will be corrected before further use.\n\n\tAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  Kinder Morgan incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases, installation and repairs to assure consistency with design specifications and manufacturer's instructions.  This practice also applies to contractor supplied equipment and parts. \n\n\tI.\tSafe Work Practices\n\n\tKinder Morgan has long standing safe work practices in place to ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include: 1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, 2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, 3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, 4) a permit and procedure to control spark producing activities (i.e., hot work), and 5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology,  operating procedures, and other changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  The system not only addresses the permanent changes, but also includes emergency and temporary changes.  All these changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the changes.  Affected chemical hazard information, process technology, equipment information, and procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  A Management of Change Request form is used to facilitate the necessary reviews, approvals, and updates.\n\n\tK.\tIncident Investigation\n\n\tKinder Morgan has established and implemented a procedure to investigate all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, personal injury or death, significant property damage, or release of contaminants which caused or could have caused significant environmental damage.  The investigations are initiated as promptly as possible, but no later than 48 hours following the incident.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the root cause of the incident and to develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent recurrence, and forwards these results to management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.

There have been no accidental releases of regulated substances with off-site impacts in the past five years.\n\nVII.\tEmergency Response Program Information\n\nKinder Morgan has developed and implemented a written emergency response program to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance potentially resulting from a fire or explosion, severe weather, environmental spill,or pipeline failure.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, and post incident cleanup, reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on factors such as modifications made to the plant process or operating procedures, or a change in the communication procedures.\n\nThe emergency response program is coordinated with the local emergency response and government officials.  The facility has round-the-clock communication capability with appropriate local emergency planning committee (LEPC) officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to meetings with the LEPC, the facility conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the local community and emergency response organizations.\n\nVIII.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAll findings from the previous PHAs, incident investigations, and safety audits have been successfully resolved.

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the plant.  Kinder Morgan's policy is to implement reasonable measures to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to effectively control, contain and mitigate the release.\n\nII.\tDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Tract 75 NGL Plant (Tract 75) in the Yates Field Unit, located near Iraan, Texas, extracts natural-gas liquids from natural gas.  The plant contains several regulated flammable substances including methane, ethane, propane, butane, and pentane.  The plant does not have any regulated toxic substances with an amount greater than the threshold quantity specified in 40 CFR 68. \n\nIII.\tOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe worst case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances at Tract 75 is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the inventory of the largest storage tank after consideration of administrative controls.  This scenario involves a release of 30,000 lbs of a hydrocarbon mixture consisting of 12,000 pounds of propane and 18,000 pounds of butane and pentane.  This inventory is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a VCE.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.25 miles.  Although there are numerous controls at Tract 75 to prevent such releases and to mitigate their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\nIV.\tGeneral"

Examples of employee participation include compiling and updating technical documents, chemical information and operating procedures; participating in and providing suggestions on the emergency response drills; and participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team, an incident investigation team, or an audit team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program.
