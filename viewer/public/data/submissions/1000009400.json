We store frozen, perishable cooler, and dry products for many western New York companies, as well as out of state and Canadian companies.  We handle many customer endpoint shipments for our storage clients.  \n\n\n\nWe utilize anyhdrous ammoina in our cold storage process.  Safeguards are in place to monitor and control the refrigeration system. If the system reaches levels outside normal operating specification, the entire refrigeration system is automatically shut down.  The shut down triggers an alarm through our ADT System and all members of the Allied management team are dispatched to the facility.\n\n\n\nAllied Frozen Storage has made significant progress in maintaining and monitoring its ammonia refrigeration system.  We have upgraded the onsite computer monitoring system and retained the corporate engineer with 35 years experience in the field of ammonia refrigeration process.  The corporate engineer is based at our Cheektowaga, NY facility.  The engineer is responsible for daily inspections and maintenance, control and monitoring, and all repairs.  He also plays a key role in the proper training of our emergency response team members.  The Corporate Engineer has been connected to the onsite computer monitoring system at his residence.  He has the ability to monitor the system 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  This permits Allied to be proactive in the safe operation and monitoring of our ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nAllied Frozen Storage is actively participating in safety meetings and training to maintain, as well as being proactive in the changing regulations facing these times.  We have learned from the mistakes of others.  We know that being involved and concerned with both our employees and the community is of the utmost priority.
