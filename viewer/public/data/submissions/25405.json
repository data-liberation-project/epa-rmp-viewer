If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to\n notify the Kanawha Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nDescription of Facility:\n This facility is a retail farm supplier. We sell anhydrous ammonia to local farmers for the purpose of crop\n production. On site we have a 26,000 gal  and a 12,000 gallon storage tank for anhydrous ammonia.  These tanks are filled to a maximum of 85% of capacity to allow for product expansion.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario:\n Our worst case scenario is a gas release from one of our storage tanks. Acording to EPA's RMP Comp\n the distance to endpoint is 2.80 miles. There are residences, schools, recreation areas and a large\n industrial area within the distance to endpoint, with a total of 248 people affected.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario:\nOur alternative release scenario is a transfer hose failure. According to EPA's RMP Comp the distance to end point is 0.20 miles with residences within this distance with a total of three people being affected. \n\nThis facility is equipped with excess flow valves and emergency shutoffs to minimize the chances of a release. All personnel are trained annually in the safe operation of the equipment and facility. We have installed concrete barriers in the traffic pattern area in an effort to eliminate any damage from a vehicular accident.\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n This facility complies with EPA's accident preevention rule and all applicable federal, state and local codes \n and regulations. This facility is inspected annually by in-house personnel and the Iowa Department of\n Agriculture.\n\nFive-Year Accident Histor"
