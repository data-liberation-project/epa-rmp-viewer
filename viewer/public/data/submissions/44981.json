The District\u00bfs program provides all information necessary to properly manage the regulated chemical \u00bf Chlorine.\nPlant Personnel are trained in the safe handling and use of Chlorine and are provided with the necessary safety equipment for working in proximity with this substance.\nIt is the District\u00bfs policy to utilize the Palm Beach County Fire Department\u00bfs HAZMAT team to respond to all major emergency conditions.\nThe District\u00bfs Wastewater Treatment Facility is a 9.0 mgd activated sludge treatment process which serves a 73-square mile area and includes the municipalities of Jupiter, Juno Beach, Tequesta, Northern Palm Beach County, and Southern Martin County.\nThe plant utilizes chlorine gas for disinfection of the plant effluent prior to distribution to the reuse system.  The maximum quantity of chlorine stored on-site is 16,000 lbs. in the form of 8 1-ton cylinders.\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves the release of 2,000 lbs. of chlorine gas from a ruptured ton cylinder.  The area of impact is a 2.6 mile radius from the chlorine storage facility.  In the unlikely event of such a release, off-site impacts would occur and include risk to public and private receptors, such as schools, businesses, and residences.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the release of 780 lbs. of chlorine gas from a leaking transfer hose.  Area of impact is a 938 yard radius from the chlorine storage facility which will impact a small industrial business park.  There are no off-site environmental impacts associated with this scenario.\n\nThe District\u00bfs Wastewater Treatment Facility complies with all requirements stipulated in EPA 40 CFR Part 68 \u00bfAccidental Release Prevention Requirements:\nRisk Management Program\u00bf an"
