      "SummaryText": "Elite Comfort Solutions is committed to operating and maintaining its facilities and processes in a safe and responsible manner, which provides safe conditions for Company employees, the surrounding community and the environment.\r\nThe Conover facility manufactures flexible polyurethane (PU) foam products for the furniture and bedding industries.  One of the major chemical ingredients used in the PU foam manufacturing process is toluene diisocyanate (mixed isomers) (TDI), CAS # 26471-62-5. The TDI inventory is maintained above 10,000 pounds.  In accordance with 40 CFR Part 68 (Chemical Accident Prevention Regulations), the worst case scenario was defined as the rupture and immediate spillage of the contents of a TDI railcar into a concrete containment area. The impact of this spill was evaluated using the ALOHA model and resulted in no public receptors within the endpoint radius of 46 yards from the railcar.\r\nThis facility will offer awareness level response to spills of TDI requiring emergency response, and has contracted professional emergency responders as back-up.  If required, the assistance of the Conover fire department will be requested.\r\nThe facility's Emergency Response Plan has been coordinated with the LEPC, local fire department, and local police department.\r\nThere have been no accidental releases involving TDI (mixed isomers) at this facility which require reporting in the five-year accident per the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42(a)."
