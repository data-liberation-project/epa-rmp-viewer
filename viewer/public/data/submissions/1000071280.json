This philosophy involves making each and every employee and contractor accountable for their own safety as well as that of the community around them.  As a company we follow a close adherence to all applicable federal, state, and local laws to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all.\n\n\n\nEmployees who enter the Gordon Gas Processing Plant complete a thorough training, both in the classroom and on-the-job, that enables them to address emergency issues as they arise.  This preparation includes standard operational, emergency operational, and release prevention training.  In addition, periodic refresher courses help to keep operators' problem solving abilities up to date and in sync with our recurring safety improvements.  Our regular internal audits provide an excellent checks and balances system for monitoring these high standards that we set.\n\n\n\nThe Gordon Gas Plant is a natural gas plant that extracts natural gas liquids (NGLs) from natural gas.   The facility is a natural gas plant that operates many processes to recover petroleum products (NGL's) from field gas and stores them on site prior to sale to wholesale markets. Two 30,000 gallon NGL tanks are used to store the flammable liquids.  The facility also has two 18,000 gal propane tanks.  The facility consists of multiple small lube oil, waste oil, condensate and fuel tanks and their associated piping, valves, pumps, and compressors on site that support the plant's compression as well as the NGL tanks.  As such, the Gordon Gas Processing Plant is classified as a Program 3 RMP facility.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about our operations at the facility, our programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, our emergency respo"

In the case of the Gordon Gas Processing Plant, this would involve our 30,000 gallon flammable natural gas liquids tank (115,189 pounds).  Such a scenario is highly unlikely; however, using the EPAs RMP Comp calculations, the distance at which the resulting vapor cloud explosion could cause an overpressure of 1 psi would be approximately 0.4 miles (approximately 2,112 feet).  An overpressure of 1 psi is the EPA's threshold for measurable impacts. \n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario characterized as a more likely scenario that would involve offsite consequences is calculated to reach approximately 0.1 miles (approximately 528 feet) from the release point.  This distance calculation is also based on the EPAs RMP Comp, which is known to be highly conservative and should over predict any potential release from such a scenario.  We have selected the alternative release scenario based on a release from our 18,000 gallon Propane Tank due to a four inch puncture of the tank and a release of 8,920  pounds of  Propane in 10 minutes resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  This incident could occur if a truck backs into the tank or piping is broken off of the tank in the event that a truck drives off while load lines are still connected.  Additionally, this sceanrio would account for any potential releases from process piping including flanges, joints, welds, valves, and valve seals, Any releases from vessels including drains, bleeds, cracks, seal failures, plug failures, overfiling, overpressurization, and venting would also be accounted for in this scenario"

As a method of preventing such events, signs are posted in conspicuous locations to provide constant reminders to the drivers about proper unloading techniques.\n\n\n\nColt has discussed these potential hydrocarbon releases with its employees and with local emergency response officials in Palo Pinto County, thereby further reducing the possibility of any impact on the public.  \n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nBelow is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Gordon Gas Processing Plant.  Because the processes at the facility are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) and are also subject to the OSHA PSM, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation:  Active employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of Gordon Gas Processing Plant's PSM program is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals.  Employee involvement will help to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are implemented.  Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues.  Gordon Gas Processing Plant strongly promotes employee imvolvement in safety issues through existing programs.  These programs include Unit Safety Teams (which are made up of a cross section of employees and supervision), regularly scheduled safety meetings, tail-gate safety meetings, Hazard Communication, Safety Suggestion Forms, and special training programs (Emergency Response Training, First Aid, etc.). \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information:  Complete and accurate written process safety information (PSI) concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to an effectiv"

The PSI will be useful to the operators; the team performing the PHA; those in charge of training; contractors; those conducting pre-startup safety reviews; and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.  Process safety information is readily available to all employees.  Gordon Gas Processing Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response / exposure treatment consideration, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA):  Gordon Gas Processing Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  The facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  Periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:  Gordon Gas Processing Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, an"

Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.  \n\n\n\nTraining:  In addition to training on operating procedures, the facility has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process.  New employees receive basic training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skill and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.  \n\n\n\nContractors:  Gordon Gas Processing Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules, and (6) inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with orientation sessions pertaining to these key points.  \n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Review (PSSR):  Gordon Gas Processing Plant conducts a PSSR on any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.
