The chilled high pressure liquid is then sent to the +20\u00b0F Cooler Recirculator and the Glycol Chillers (#9, #10, & #11).\n\nThe +20\u00b0F Cooler Recirculator feeds controlled pressure liquid ammonia to Air Handling Units #1 - #3 and #9 - #11 (+35\u00b0F). At the evaporators, the liquid ammonia, flowing through coils in the unit, is partially boiled as it absorbs heat from the product and room. The resulting 'wet suction' (liquid/vapor mix) from AHU #1 - #3 and #9 - #11 and is returned to the +20\u00b0F Cooler Recirculator, wherein the liquid drops to the bottom of the vessel and vapor is drawn from the top of the vessel by the Compressors.  \n\nThe Chillers receive chilled high pressure liquid ammonia from the Liquid subcooler to cool product in the process areas at the facility.  The liquid ammonia boils off, and the Chillers return cooler suction (vapor) to the +20\u00b0F Cooler Recirculator.\n\nThe Frick Compressors (#3 - #7) draw vapor from the +20\u00b0F Cooler Recirculator. The vapor discharged from the Compressors is routed to the Condensers.  The compressors receive subcooled liquid from the Liquid Subcooler for oil cooling.\n\nAt the Condensers (#2, #3, #4 & #5), air (fans) and water (pumps) are used to condense the compressor discharge into high pressure liquid, which then drains to the High Pressure Receiver to begin the refrigeration cycle again.  \n\nThe system is also equipped with an Automatic Purger that removes non-condensables, i.e. air, from the system.\n\nAll process equipment and piping are designed according to ASME standards.  All ASME vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that vent to the water diffusion tank at 150 psig, 250 psig, or 300 psig."

These changes include the following items:\n\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\n\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\n\n3. Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n\n4. Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."

To save lives.\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n  4.)

      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Tropicana ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with Cal/OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.  The facility conducts maintenance and any necessary minor repairs in house, but an outside contractor is hired for major repairs. The facility also maintains a contract with a professional refrigeration contractor to conduct preventative maintenance and any necessary repairs.\n\nThe facility including the ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety features include a water diffusion tank, ammonia sensors in the engine room as well as sensors near the evaporators, and automatic shut down systems. In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine room and just outside of the engine room (Condenser and High Pressure).  All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that are commonly piped to the water diffusion tanks.\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, Tropicana has developed a preventive maintenance program that utilizes the services of a professional refrigeration contractor to complete regularly scheduled inspections and tests of the ammonia refrigeration system as well as repairs as needed to process equipment.  \n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe EPA's RMP Program defines accident as the following:\n\nThe release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process.\n\nThe release must have caused at least one of the following:\n \n-\tOn-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (\u00a768.42(a)); or\n-\tKnown offsite deaths, injuries,"

The system is checked on a regular basis to ensure it is functioning properly and in good repair.\n\nThe facility has an emergency evacuation plan that includes ammonia leaks.  If an ammonia leak or an alarm indicating an ammonia leak is observed by facility personnel, the decision to evacuate the building is made by management.  Professional emergency responders and the facility's professional refrigeration service firm are called to assist with the ammonia leak. \n\nThe management at Tropicana is committed to safety.

The system was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the Uniform Fire and Mechanical Codes.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses 23,371 pounds of ammonia for the cold storage of fruit juice and fruit juice beverages.  The majority of the system is located inside the Machine Room, Process Area, Glycol Chiller #9 Room, Glycol Chiller #10 Room, Glycol Chiller #11 Room, outside, and in the Freezer and Storage areas.  \n\nThe refrigeration process equipment at the facility operates continuously.
