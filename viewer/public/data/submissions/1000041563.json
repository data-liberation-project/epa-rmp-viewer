This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operation, maintenance, and employee training associated with our ammonia refrigeration systems. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of ammonia. Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our safety systems are designed to protect and mitgate the impacts associated, as well as a highly trained emergency response personnel are available to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also coordinated with the City of Norwood Fire Department and the Hamilton County LEPC for emergency response support.\r\n\r\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nOur facility facility is primarily used for production of ice cream products. The only RMP regulated substance present at the facility is anhydrous ammonia which is utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-loop refrigeration system. Refrigeration is a critical part of our business, providing cold storage capabilities for products per Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations. Due to the  and characteristics of our refrigeration Process, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, this facility is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\r\n\r\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nOur facility has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68.
