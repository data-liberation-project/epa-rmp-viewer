      "SummaryText": "1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\n\nAirgas is actively involved in the management and prevention of risk associated with the storage and use of propylene, anhydrous ammonia, and chlorine, acutely hazardous chemicals, at their facility in Sacramento, California.  The existing accidental release prevention plan was drafted in 1996 to provide a program for propylene, anhydrous ammonia, and chlorine storage cylinders at the Sacramento facility.  Airgas has been active in following the safety policies and procedures, and has not experienced any severe releases during this time.  \n\nThe Airgas Risk Management Plan involves all employees, from the awareness level to the operations level.  The plan includes provisions for various levels of training, emergency response, and handling procedures.  Only authorized personnel who have been trained to follow operating, inspection, and maintenance procedures are allowed to handle these chemicals.  Any changes to the equipment or procedures are recorded.  \n\nThe Airgas Risk Management Plan is coordinated with the policies of Airgas supplier of the propylene, anhydrous ammonia and chlorine.  Airgas requires notification when the delivery truck is onsite, and provides available personnel to oversee the delivery.  Inspections and maintenance of the propylene storage tank are done by BMS personnel, either on a regular basis or when requested by Airgas.  Airgas receives copies of all maintenance and audit reports.\n\nThe Airgas Sacramento Risk Management Plan operates in conjunction with the company emergency response plan.  Any accidental releases of these chemicals are reported and addressed according to incident investigation procedures.  Onsite emergency equipment includes alarms and personal protective equipment.  All emergency coordinators receive training to be familiar with and knowledgeable of emergency response procedures.  In the event of any major releases of hazardous materials, the emergency coordinators an"

Description of Regulated Processes and Substances\n\nThe business at this location was originally owned by AIRCO and the facility was built in 1947.  Airgas purchased the business in 1994, and has been located at the current site since that time.  The site has always distributed and manufactured industrial gases.The company is a supplier of a variety of gas products.  The gases associated with this study are propylene, anhydrous ammonia, and chlorine gases.  These gases are purchased from an independent vendor and  stored at Airgas.\n\nAirgas maintains the following levels of these chemicals on site:\n    Propylene17,000 pounds\n    Anhydrous Ammonia6,000 pounds\n    ChlorineCurrently, none is on site\n\n\n3. Offsite Consequence Release Scenarios\n\nIn order to adequately prepare a risk management plan, a company must acknowledge the occurrence of possible release scenarios.  For the Airgas Sacramento Risk Management Plan (sorry  should be capitalized here)for propylene, anhydrous ammonia, and chlorine, multiple release scenarios were considered to comply with the California Accidental Release Program requirements.  A worst-case scenario was considered, defined as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to a specified endpoint.  An alternative release scenario was also considered, which would have the potential to reach an endpoint offsite of the Airgas facility thereby impacting the public.  \n\nThe worst-case scenario for the Airgas facility would be the catastrophic rupture of the propylene storage tank.  The rupture would results in an immediate release and vaporization of 90% of the maximum tank quantity (15,213 lbs).  No mitigation or secondary containment effect was calculated.  In addition, worst case scenarios were evaluated fo"

General Accidental Release Prevention Program & Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nAirgas Sacramento has several automatic controls to prevent or control an unintentional release.  The controls include pressure safety valves, pressure relief valves, and excess flow check valves.  Emergency shut off valves on the propylene storage tank and the delivery truck would minimize a release.  A facility-wide fire alarm, bell alarm, and communication system can be triggered by security to alert all personnel of emergency release scenarios. \n\n Airgas Sacramento has also instated several administrative and managerial procedures to minimize the possibilities of release.  In order for the delivery truck to enter into the storage area, the drivers must notify the counter staff before entering the storage area.  An Airgas personnel is required to attend unloading operations by the propylene delivery truck.  The delivery driver performs documented inspections of the tank during each delivery. \n\n\n5. 5-year Accident History\n\nAirgas has not experienced a release during the past five years. \n\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAs a result of the update and review of the Airgas Risk Management Plan for the propylene, anhydrous ammonia, and chlorine storage and handling system, changes will be made to improve safety in several areas, including written documentation, practices, and procedures.  The Airgas contingency plan will be updated to include specific procedures relating to emergency releases of these chemicals.  For example, Airgas plant management will research installations and modifications that would provide containment or improved mitigation in the event of an propylene release, such as the modification of emergency shut off switches at the propylene tank."
