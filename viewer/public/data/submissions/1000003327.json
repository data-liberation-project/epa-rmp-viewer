These products are used in a variety of applications including packaging, pipe insulation, and assorted consumer goods.  The company has a strong commitment to preserving the safety of its employees and surrounding communities, as well as minimizing impacts on the environment.  As a result of this commitment, Nomaco redesigned the manufacturing process of all of its plants to phase out the use of Hydroflurocarbon-containing gases (HCFCs) which deplete the ozone layer.  After much research, Nomaco decided to replace HCFCs with isobutane gas.  Isobutane is used in the foam manufacturing process as a blowing agent.  It is a regulated substance under the Risk Management Program (RMP) with about the same flammability as lighter fluid and propane. The facility is regulated under Program 3 requirements under the applicability criteria of A?68.10.\n\nPropane is used for fuel in maintenance and fork-lift vehicles are required to move materials around the plant.  However, there is no central propane storage tank on site since the facility operates by exchanging the 7.5-gallon tanks on the vehicles.  Flammable fuels used as fuel or held for sale at a retail facility are removed from coverage by the RMP program by the Chemical Safety Information, Site Security and Fuels Regulatory Relief Act (Publ"

Therefore, propane use at the facility is not addressed in this RMP.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by Nomaco.  These high standards include:\n\nA?    Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations. \nA?    Operating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\nA?    Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\nA?    Correcting non-compliance found by regular audits of the facility.\n\nPrevention Program\nThe Nomaco facility is operating under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include:\nA?    Preventative maintenance and testing of vessels to ensure that structural failures do not occur.\nA?    Use of a sophisticated gas detection system is used to continuously monitor gas levels.  Gas detectors located throughout the manufacturing facility as well as in product storage locations signal facility personnel of any gas concentration release reaching 10% of the lower explosion limit (LEL).  At 20% LEL and at 40% LEL, additional visual / audible alarms are activated.  \n\nFive-Year Accident History\nWithin the last five years, there have been no releases of RMP substances that resulted in onsite injuries, death or property damage or offsite impacts.\n        \nEmergency Response Progr"

As appropriate, also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the North Carolina State Police and the local police and fire department.  The Nomaco Plant Manager or his designate has overall responsibility for site personnel, buildings, and equipment.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials.  The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n    \nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.  Some of the key components of the safety program are:\n\nThe Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures are considered.\nA?    The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) and Job Safety Analysis (JSA) provisions serve as tools to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards.\nA?    The Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of the safety program.\n\nSpecific actions that will be taken in the future to improve the level of safety at the facility include:\nA?    Internal and third party compliance audits will ensure that the level of safety protection at the facility is periodically evaluated for improvements.\nA?    An ongoing dialogue with the Wake County LEPC Director or his designate will ensure a constant state of readiness to respond to any potential emergencies, as well as a means to"
