      "SummaryText": "SITE DESCRIPTION.   Aerofin Corporation is located about 0.3 miles north of the intersection of State Route 29 and Candlers Mountain Road, in Lynchburg, Virginia.  State Route 29 bounds the site on the west, and Murray Place road bounds the property on the east.  In general the site is located in an industrial and commercial area.  Aerofin is owned by Ampco-Pittsburgh Securities V Corp. which is owned by Ampco-Pittsburgh Corporation, and manufactures heat exchange coils at its plant in Lynchburg, Virginia.\n\nThe plant is heated by natural gas.  A propane and air blend  is  used to supplement the natural gas in the heating of the plant during peak demand periods in the winter.  This propane is stored in a 30,000 gallon tank located about 100 feet to the southeast of the main building.  Maximum filling of this tank is 80%.\n\nPROPANE TANK STANDARDS. Commonwealth Gas Co. installed the propane tank system in 1974 to provide a supplement to natural gas during high demands.  Trinity Industries, Inc of Dallas Texas manufactured the storage tank in 1974.  It was designed per the ASME Pressure Vessel Code Section VIII, Div. 1 in effect at that time.  Also installed in this system is a direct fired vaporizer and venturi mixer module manufactured by Alternate Energy Systems of Peachtree City, Georgia.  Operation of the propane tank system is in general accordance with NFPA Publication 58, Standard for Storage and Handling of Liquefied Petroleum Gases.  An Operation and Maintenance Manual for the Propane Tank System is kept in the office of the  Manager of Human Resources.\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO.  Our worst case release scenario per the RMP is the failure of the 30,000 gallon storage tank when filled to 80%, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The 1 psi end point is an 0.4 mile radius circles around the tanks.  The area is an industrial and commercial area of Lynchburg. \nNo homes are in the area.\n\nALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO.   The alternate release scenario involves a rup"

      "SummaryText": "turing of the liquid fill pipe, leading to a release of twice the volume of the liquid fill line or about 173 #'s of propane and an explosion.  The 1 psi endpoint is a 0.03 mile radius circle around the tank.  This endpoint area does extend to the plant building and slightly off the property to the east.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM.  Design of the Propane Tank System included placing manual shut-off valves and automatic excess flow valves in both liquid and vapor line at the fill station, at the tanks; in the gas distribution line from the tank and in the vaporizer/mixer.  The shut-off valve in the vapor extraction line at the fill station is an emergency shut-off valve connected to a remote pull line.  A 6 ft. chain link fence with locking gates surround the tanks.  In addition operation, maintenance, and inspection procedures have been established as required by the RMP in general accordance with NFPA-58.  \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE.  In the event of a fire emergency, the Lynchburg Fire Department would be requested to respond to the emergency by dialing 911.  \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY.   There has not been an accident involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage or evacuation.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY.   Improved equipment labeling, warning signs and painting the tank are planned."
