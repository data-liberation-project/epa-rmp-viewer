McGlynn Bakeries Retail Division provides bakery products for over 280 retail bakery locations in the Minneapolis/St. Paul area and in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  Our Frozen Products Division, Concept 2 Bakers, produces and markets frozen bakery foods to bakeries across America.  The Commerce Lane facility operates twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.\n\nThe facility operates several different coolers and freezers, the largest being approximately 60' wide x 225' long x 80'high.  This freezer has 2880 pallet slots and operates with an automatic pallet picking system.  The regulated chemical used at this facility to provide refrigeration for these processes is anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is a colorless alkaline gas possessing a sharp penetrating odor.  At -1080F anhydrous ammonia freezes; at -280F it boils.  When a product boils, it changes from a liquid to a vapor state.  Ammonia vapor is lighter than air; and, therefore, during most climatological conditions, it should rise.  As vapor it occupies about 850 times its liquid volume.  Liquid ammonia, when released suddenly to the atmosphere, will vaporize and form a white cloud.  This cloud can be dispersed by large volumes of water.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is classified by the Department of Transportation as a nonflammable, compressed gas.  However, within a limited range of concentration in air, ammonia vapor can be ignited.  The ignition point is obtained by having a mixture of air approximately 16% to 25% by volume of ammonia vapor with a temperature of 1,2000F.  Contamination of ammonia by oils from compressors and other equipment may lower its ignition temperature.\n\nAmmonia has two basic effects on the human body.  At low concentrations, less than 500 parts per million (ppm), it's affinity for moisture can cause irritation of they eyes, skin and mucous membranes.  In a more concentrated"

At 50 ppm, there is a corrosive effect on human tissue and exposure is limited to an eight-hour period.  At 400 to 700 ppm, serious eye, nose and throat irritations can take place.  When concentrations of 2,000 or 3,000 ppm are approached, convulsive coughing, severe eye irritation, skin burning, and even fatality may result after only a short time exposure.  Concentrations above 5,000 ppm will produce death by suffocation within minutes.\n\n\nAlert and Warning System\n\nMcGlynn Bakeries Central Bakery has an alert and warning system in place which is capable of alerting individuals as quickly as possible to dangerous conditions.
