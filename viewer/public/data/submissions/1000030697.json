EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nThe Terra Nitrogen Verdigris plant (Verdigris plant) manufactures anhydrous ammonia and urea ammonium nitrate (UAN) solution and the by-products liquified carbon dioxide and argon.  Intermediates in the manufacture of these products include nitric acid, urea solution, and ammonium nitrate solution.  The regulated substances, as defined by 40 CFR Part 68, which are present at the facility in more than a threshold quantity are ammonia and chlorine.\r\n\r\nIt is Terra Nitrogen's policy to prevent accidental releases from the Verdigris plant by effective process safety management programs and procedures that include: participation by all plant employees in every element of PSM; regular analysis of process hazards utilizing current and accurate process safety information; maintaining current and accurate written operating procedures; providing timely and comprehensive training for all employees involved in operating and maintaining process equipment; overseeing the activities of contractors and ensuring that they are trained to perform their job safely; following established pre-startup safety review and management of change procedures to ensure that modifications are adequately evaluated for safety; administering a comprehensive mechanical integrity program to ensure that process equipment is maintained in accordance with good engineering practice and accepted industry standards; investigating incidents when they do occur to promptly correct deficiencies and learn from the experience; and audit the entire PSM program on a regular basis to verify that elements, procedures, and systems are in place and adequate.  In addition, it is the Verdigris plant's policy to maintain a current and accurate written emergency response plan, a well trained and equipped onsite  emergency response team, a system to notify facility neighbors in the event of a release, and to coordinate emergency response planning with local authorities and exercise those p"

The Alternative Release Scenario for ammonia is a 2\" pipe break, resulting in the release of 5,400 pounds over a ten minute period.  The distance to the toxic endpoint for ammonia (200 ppm) is estimated to be 0.57 miles.  The Alternative Release Scenario for chlorine is a 3/8\" pipe break resulting in a release of 1,560 pounds over a 120 minute period.  The distance to the toxic endpoint for chlorine (3 ppm) is estimated to be 0.7 miles.  The effect of the alternative toxic releases is limited by the operation of excess flow valves and emergency shutdown procedures in place at the facility.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\r\nThe Verdigris plant has a comprehensive Process Safety Management (PSM) Program and is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's standard for process safety management of highly hazardous chemicals found at 29 CFR Part 1910.119.  Key elements of the PSM program include: 1) stringent design standards of equipment which incorporate substantial safety factors and include state of the art monitoring and control instrumentation designed specifically for ammonia manufacturing and storage service; 2) extensive ammonia manufacturing process specific safety information that is accurate and up to date; 3)  well trained operating, maintenance, and contractor personnel; 4) written operating, maintenance, and safe work procedures specific to the ammonia manufacturing industry; 5) mechanical integrity procedures for process equipment inspections and quality control; 6)  management of change and pre-startup review procedures; 7)  periodic, detailed evaluation of each process area by a team utilizing HAZOP methodology; 8)  regular PSM program audits; and 9) employee participation in every element of the PSM program.\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\nThere have been no accidental releases from cov"

Verdigris plant personnel are members of the Rogers County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  The plant exercises its emergency response plan annually and participates as requested in county-wide drills that are staged by local emergency response authorities.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nEfforts to continue improvements in safety include numerous items:\r\n-The participation in OSHA's VPP program, which recognizes the sites committment to continuous improvement in the areas of safety and process safety management. As a result of this committment, the site has succcessfully been awarded OSHA \"Star\" status for 2 consecutive terms. \r\n-The development of a EHS Board - composed of hourly employees, authorized to review, recommend, and implement improvements to the site's safety programs, safety policies, safety practices and associated goals.\r\n-The development of a \"Hazard Identification\" program that includes participation from all employees in identifying and correcting physical hazards at the site.\r\n-The development of Corporate safety objectives (incident reporting, supervisory communications, field task risk assessment/job hazard analysis, and EHS excellence program) measured and evaluated quarterly."
