The Sidney Terminal complies with NFPA-58 requirements for LP-Gas Storage, and it is company policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is company policy to notify the Sidney, MT Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated substances:\n\nThe Sidney Terminal is a bulk terminal that receives butane and propane by over the road transports.  Butane and propane is stored at the Sidney Terminal and loaded onto rail car tankers for distribution.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\nThe Sidney Terminal has developed and implemented the following general accidental release and prevention program elements in accordance with all the elements of a Program 3 Risk Management Plan (RMP) accident prevention rule, all the elements of OSHA\u00c2\u00bfs Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, NFPA-58 and all codes and regulations:\n\nProcess Safety Information:  The Sidney Terminal has compiled written process safety information for all PSM covered processes.  The process safety information includes the hazards of chemicals used or produced in the process, process technology information, and process equipment data.  The process safety information is updated whenever process changes are made.\n\nAccurate and complete process safety information enables the Sidney Terminal employees involved in operating and maintaining the terminal to identify and understand the hazards of the process.  Process safety information is used to conduct process hazard analysis on the existing process or a proposed modification to a process.  \n \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA):  The Sidney Terminal is committed to perfor"

Each process is systematically examined to identify potential hazards, controls in place to manage these hazards, and recommend additional controls, as appropriate.\n \nThe Sidney Terminal uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and check list PHA methodologies, which are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  The team identifies and evaluates potential hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and / or mitigation measures.\n\nAs a minimum the Sidney Terminal will perform periodic PHA reviews or revalidations every 5 years as long as the process is operating.\n\nPHA findings and recommendations and their resolution are documented.  The Sidney Terminal has implemented a system to address and resolve all PHA findings and recommendations in a timely manner through a written schedule.  All PHA findings and recommendation resolutions are communicated to all effected employees.  All recommendations must be resolved by management.\n\nOperating Procedures: The Sidney Terminal has developed and implemented written operating procedures that describe the tasks that terminal operators and transport drivers must perform, the safe process operating parameters that must be maintained, and safety precautions for operations and maintenance activities.  The Sidney Terminal written operating procedures address various modes of process operations, including: (1) initial start-up, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) emergency operations, (6) normal shutdown, and (7) start-up after turnaround.  \n\nContractors:  The Sidney Terminal has developed and implemented a program to ensure that contractors used to supplement its workforce to perform maintenance, renovation or specialt"

Additionally, any new units added at the Sidney Terminal which is considered PSM covered processes will also require a PSSR to be performed and documented.\n\nMechanical Integrity:   The Sidney Terminal has developed and implemented procedures to maintain the on-going mechanical integrity of critical process equipment in accordance with NFPA 58 and industry recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.\n\nInspections and tests are documented and deficiencies outside of the acceptable limits are corrected before further use or in a safe and timely manner.  \n\nSafe Work Practices and Procedures:  The Sidney Terminal has developed and implemented safe work practices that include methods for controlling plant entry, presence and exit of support personnel, and lockout/ tagout procedures to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, hot work procedures and permits for work with the potential for generating ignition sources in the presence of flammable or combustible material, and confined space entry permits and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry is allowed into a permit required confined space.\n\nTraining:  The Sidney Terminal has developed and implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process or loading a truck transport.  The training programs may include classroom, practical and computer-based training.  Employees are tested to demonstrate their understanding of the training and competency.\n\nManagement of Change:  The Sidney Terminal requires that a management of change (MOC) be performed for any modification to equipment, procedures,"

The Sidney Terminal has established a system to promptly address and resolve incident investigation findings and recommendations.  \n\nCompliance Audits:  The Sidney Terminal will conduct audits on a regular basis to ensure that the facility is in compliance with applicable all the elements of the EPA Risk Management Plan (RMP) accident prevention rule, all the elements of  the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, NFPA-58 and all applicable codes and regulations.\n\nFive-year Accident History:\n\nThis is a new facility, no 5 year accident history.\n\nEmergency Response Program Information:\n\nThe Sidney Terminal Emergency Response Plan is site-specific.  It includes required actions by plant employees as well as required notification and coordination with local responders and agencies. All employees are trained in the execution of the Emergency Response Plan and drills are conducted annually.\n\nEmergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nThere are no planned changes to improve safety at the Sidney Terminal."
