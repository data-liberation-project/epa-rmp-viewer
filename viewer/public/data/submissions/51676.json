              "Description": "The alkylated formaldehyde resins process is a batch process carried out in a jacketed, stirred tank, pressure vessel (reactor).  The reactor can be oil-cooled or heated to control the reaction rate and temperature.  The reactor is equipped with overhead reflux condensers to condense the unreacted overhead vapors and to return them to the reactor.  The condenser is also used to control the temperature of the reaction by condensing water. The reactor is also equipped with safety relief devices, either safety relief valves or rupture discs or both, to prevent overpressurization of the reactor that could cause a catastrophic release of toxic chemicals.  The reactors are vented to the plant absorber systems or flare (or both) to minimize release of toxic chemicals to the atmosphere when loading or depressurizing the reactor.\nThe listed chemical for this process is a formaldehyde (37 percent) in water solution (i.e., formalin).  The largest quantity of this chemical onsite is in an aboveground storage tank.  The formalin storage tank is a stainless steel resin, vertical, atmospheric storage tank vented through a scrubber.  The tank and piping are visually inspected for corrosion on an annual basis.  Because this tank is an atmospheric tank and the formalin vapor pressure is low, there is virtually no chance of overpressurization and catastrophic failure of this tank.  The formalin in the storage tank is replenished by tank truck deliveries.  \nFormalin deliveries are scheduled on an as needed basis to prevent overfilling of the tank.  The formalin is transferred by pipe from the storage tank to the reactor.  Check valves are installed in the piping to prevent backflow and possible contamination of the storage tank or overflow from the tank.  The formalin feed rate is controlled to stabilize the reaction and temperature and pressure in the reactor.  A maintenance program is in place to inspect the piping, pumps, reactor, and process vessels and to promptly make appropriate repairs if a problem is discovered.\nA formal operator training program is in place to instruct and review the procedures necessary for the safe operation of the process.   The operators and supervisors are trained in the execution of the written emergency response plan.",

These storage tanks are horizontal pressure vessels rated at 150 psig.  They are equipped with safety relief devices to prevent catastrophic release of EO or PO as a result of tank overpressurization.  The EO and PO in the tanks are blanketed with nitrogen to prevent an explosive atmosphere in the tanks.  The nitrogen presure does not exceed 75 psig, which is well below the 150 psig pressure rating of the tanks.  No- leak-design, canned pumps are used to transfer the EO or PO from the storage tank to the reactor.  The transfer lines contain check valves that inhibit reverse flow from the reactor to the storage tanks to prevent contamination and/or overpressurization of the storage tanks.  The storage tanks and piping are inspected for thickness and corrosion every three years by an outside contractor to ensure mechnical integrity.\nThe EO and PO storage tanks are loaded by railroad tank car.  A system is used to recycle vapors from the storage tank to the railcar while the liquid EO or PO is pumped into the storage tank.  This system prevents venting of EO or PO to the atmosphere.\nAll operators and supervisors are trained in the safe handling of EO and PO and in emergency response procedures.  A written maintenance program is used to ensure inspection and timely correction of any leaks that might develop in the process.",

              "Description": "The esterification process is a batch process utilizing a jacketed, stirred tank, pressurized vessel (reactor).  All safety devices described on the other batch reactors apply to this reaction system.  Safety relief devices protect the reactors from catastrophic failure caused by overpressurization.  These reactors vent through a condenser to an acid/base absorber/scrubber system and a final activated carbon bed or the flare to minimize harmful emissions to the atmosphere.\nThe regulated chemicals for this process area anhydrous ammonia and acetaldehyde.  The largest quantity of ammonia onsite is contained in a horizontal 250 psig pressure rated storage tank.  The acetaldehyde is received in the trailer tank.  The trailer tank contains enough acetaldehyde for 24 batch reactor runs and is removed from the site at the completion of this approximately two and one half hour production run.  A maximum of two runs per week is made, with a maximum of 24 runs per year.  Acetaldehyde is not store onsite.  The trailer tank is DOT rated and inspected for the safe transportation and storage of acetaldehyde.\nBoth the trailer tank and ammonia storage tank are protected by safety relief devices to prevent rupture by overpressurization.  When onsite, the acetaldehyde trailer is within ten feet of the batch reactor.  Excess acetaldehyde is vented through the reactor to the flare via the plant scrubber system.  The trailer tank has an excess flow valve.  The ammonia storage tank is loaded from a delivery tank truck using a closed, vapor recycle system to prevent emissions of ammonia to the atmosphere.  The ammonia tank also has an excess flow valve that will shut down the flow of ammonia within one minute in case of a line leak or excessive flow to the reactor.\nThe ammonia tank is inspected for corrosion and wall thickness every three years by an outside contractor to ensure tank integrity.  Like the other processes, a maintenance plan is enforced to maintain mechanical integrity of the process.  \nAll operators and supervisors are trained in the safe handling of ammonia and acetaldhyde.  They are also required to attend monthly safety meetings.  As at all Champion Technologies' sites, the operators and supervisors are instructed in the following areas:  a) overview of RCRA rules and regulations; b) emergency response and spill prevention; c) Right-to-Know laws; d) use of safety equipment; e) job -specific training; f) chemical safety training; g) respiratory protection; and h) confined space entry procedures.  A full file of material safety data sheets (MSDS), readily available for both the employees and the public, are located at each of the Champion Technologies' sites.",

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nA number of processes at this facility are subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. The plant PSM program incorporates all of the PSM elements identified in the regulation. The standards and procedures developed for the PSM program are applied uniformly in the plant to both PSM covered processes and other chemical processes to ensure that the plant is operated safely. The plant operations have also incorporated the requirements of the 40 CFR Part 68 accidental release prevention program into plant operational procedures and practices. \n\nThe processes at Champion have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. Section 7 of the RMP describes existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances at the facility. The accident prevention program is applied to all RMP-regulated processes at Champion. Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accidental scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human error.\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\nChampion has implemented a written emergency response plan to handle accidental releases of hazardous materials. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including bringing releases under control (when feasible), adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, and the notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas. Employees receive training in emergency procedures. To ensure proper functioning, emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced. In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within processes that would require a modified emergency response. The emergency plan has been coordinated with and"
