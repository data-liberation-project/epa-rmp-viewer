Describe Accidental Release and Emergency Response Policies.\n\n\n\nSchepps Dairy has developed and implemented a Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program in compliance with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119) and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemicals Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).  Emergency action plans have been reviewed as well as part of a comprehensive management commitment to safety and preventing an accidental release of ammonia.  The Plant manager is responsible for the management of these accidental release, prevention and emergency action programs.   \n\n\n\nB.  Describe your Facility and the Requlated Substance Handled.\n\n\n\nSchepps Dairy operates a production facility where fluid milk, and juice products are processed, packaged, and distributed.  The facility is located at the corner of Dolphin Rd. and Haskell Ave. The address of this facility is 3114 S. Haskell Ave. Dallas Texas.  This facility uses anhydrous ammonia (CAS # 7664-41-7) as the refrigerant in it's stationary refrigeration system.  This stationary refrigeration system is a closed loop system where liquid ammonia is piped to equipment and controled to provide the desired refrigeration affect.  The liquid is converted to gaseous ammonia during this process.  The gaseous ammonia is piped to the compressor room where it is compressed and pipied to the condensors that cool the gas and convert it back into a liquid ready to be used for cooling again.  There is no consumption or loss of ammonia during this process making it a closed loop system. \n\n\n\nC.  Summary of Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario at the facility would involve the failure of the high pressure reciever. This quantity includes all the ammonia in the receiver, cooling towers and thermosyphon systems and associated lines. The maxim"

This release scenario would include the ammonia in the cooling jacket and associated vessel, valves, and lines.  \n\n\n\nBoth release scenarios although possible are unlikly due to the design and maintenance of the facility and the positive affects of the PSM/RMP programs on the overall condition of the refrigeration system, training, and operating procedures.\n\n \n\nD.  Description of the accidental release prevention program.\n\n\n\n1.  Employee Participation:  All refrigeration maintenance employees, Maintenance Management, and Plant safety manager participated in the Process Safety Management Team (PSM).  The PSM team developed the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP's), training requirements, and Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), and other elements of the PSM program. \n\n\n\n2.  Process Safety Imformation:  Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&ID) have been developed where all major components of the ammonia refrigeration system and all piping have been assigned a number.  Information has been gathered to enable employees to identify and understand the potential hazards of the system.  The written information includes the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\n3.  Process Hazard Analysis:  A formal sudy of the ammonia refrigeration system with management, safety, and maintenance personnel was conducted using the What-If Check List method to evaluate the potential hazards of the system. \n\n\n\n4.  Operating Procedures:  Written standard operating procedures have been developed for the ammonia refrigeration system that describe the steps to be taken to ensure safe operation of the system.\n\n\n\n5.  Training:  All ammonia refrigeration maintenance employees are requied to complete an in house training program using on the "

Contractors:  Contractors are screened and evaluated prior to the award of any contract for work on or near the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\n7.  Pre-Startup Review:  Pre Startup Checklist / Review includes P&ID updates, training requirements, review of operating procedures, PHA review, amd verification that construction has been accomplished according to design specifications. \n\n\n\n8.  Mechanical Integrity:  Daily log sheets, Preventative maintence work orders, Vibration analysis, Oil analysis, and Annual inspections are all part of the mechanical integrity program. \n\n\n\n9.  Hot Work Permits:  All HOT work on or near the system requires a signed Hot Work Permit prior to work.\n\n\n\n10.  Management of Change:  System changes are planned, tracked, and reviewed using Management of Change procedures.  This procedure ensures that all changes have been properly documented and reviewed.\n\n\n\n11.  Incendent Investigation:  All incidents and near misses are investigated, reviewed, and documented using an investigation team.\n\n\n\n12.  Emergency Planning and response:  Schepps Dairy is utilizing The City of Dallas Fire Department as the first responders and has contracted with a third party contractor for emergency response.  In addition Schepps Dairy has developed an Emergency action Plan for all conceivable emergencies.\n\n\n\n13.  Compliance Audits:  Audits are conducted every three years to ascertain whether or not the program is in place and working properly.\n\n\n\nE.  Five-Year Accident History:  No reportable releases have occured in the past 5 years\n\n\n\nF.
