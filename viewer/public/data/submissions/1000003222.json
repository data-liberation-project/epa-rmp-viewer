      "SummaryText": "Henkel Corporation owns and operates an adhesive manufacturing facility at 485 Cedar Springs Road, which is located within in Rowan County, North Carolina. This facility is surrounded by local businesses and residences. Approximately 70 people from the surrounding community are employed full-time by Henkel.\n\nIt is the policy of Henkel Corporation to meet all requirements established by applicable Federal, State and local safety, health and environmental regulations. Salisbury has always put safety first.\n\nThe entire facility was previously owned by National Starch and Chemical. The facility was sold and two companies - Azko-Nobel and Henkel, now own and operate it. Henkel owns the portion containing adhesives (called Unit H) and electronic adhesives manufacturing.\n\nHenkel does not store any RMP chemicals in its portion of the site. However, it does have one process that uses a single RMP chemical, vinyl acetate (CAS no. 108-05-4), in a maximum, potential quantity above the reportable threshold.\n\nHenkel currently maintains an OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program for the covered RMP chemical. Henkel (and prior owner, NSC) has previously analyzed hazards associated with this process and developed emergency response plans for responding to potential incidents. No reportable Accidental Releases have occurred since this process was commissioned on June 1, 2006. Although Compliance Audits were conducted by NSC, Henkel plans on conducting another Compliance Audit by the end of this calendar year.\n\nHenkel has worked to maintain a safe environment for its employees and the surrounding community.
