As a requirement of the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program and the EPA Clean Air Act Amendments 112; Accidental Release of Hazardous Air Substances program, Pacific Ethanol Madera, LLC completed a risk management plan (RMP) for chemicals stored on-site above reporting thresholds. Regulated chemicals at Pacific Ethanol Madera, LLC include isopentane and pentane (each exceed 10,000 pound threshold).  \r\n\r\nRegulated Substances Handled\r\nThe facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn and process by-products known as distillers' grain, distiller's syrup and distiller's corn oil which are used as livestock feeds. The fuel ethanol production process requires use of a denaturant (natural gasoline) blended with ethanol at approximately 2.5% to render the product unfit for human consumption prior to shipping.  Regulated chemicals at Pacific Ethanol Madera, LLC include isopentane and pentane (each exceed 10,000 pound threshold). These two chemicals are in a flammable mixture of Natural Gasoline (Denaturant).  The maximum amount of denaturant on-site is approximately 170,000 pounds. Pacific Ethanol Madera, LLC has evaluated the worst-case and alternative case scenarios as they relate to the regulated substances. An Emergency Action Plan (Integrated Contingency Plan, or ICP) for these scenarios has been prepared and implemented.
