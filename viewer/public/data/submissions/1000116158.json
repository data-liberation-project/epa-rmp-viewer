      "SummaryText": "Introduction\nA Risk Management Program has been implemented at Arkema's Calvert City production facility for the reduction of accidental releases of hazardous materials.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to the community of hazardous chemical releases.  \nArkema Policies for Health, Environment, and Safety.\n\nArkema\u0092s commitment to health, environment, and safety (HES) starts with the CEO.  Senior management routinely dedicates time to a review of HES matters.  This emphasis on safety is carried through to the facility level, where the plant manager, the health and safety manager, the environmental manager, and the plant safety committee regularly review safety performance, take corrective actions, and strive for continuous improvement.  The success of Arkema's HES programs is also reflected by a strong commitment to safety by employees and contractors.\n\nFacility Identification and Regulated Substances in Covered Processes\nThe Arkema Calvert City facility, a wholly-owned contiguous facility of Arkema Inc., is located at 4444 Industrial Parkway, Calvert City, Kentucky.  As such it is considered a single stationary source requiring one RMP submittal.  The facility manufactures refrigerants by continuous chemical reaction and purification processes in four operating units (designated as K-97, K-98, 1233zd, and monomer (vinylidene fluoride (R-1132a)).  In addition, the company operates an AHF unloading and storage facility, a chlorine unloading and storage facility, and a hazardous waste incinerator.  Certain substances used and produced within these operating units are regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule.  The substances that are present at or above the minimum threshold for RMP applicability are hydrogen fluoride (HF), chlorine, aqueous hydrogen chloride (HCl), and vinylidene fluoride (R-1132a).  HF and chlorine"

      "SummaryText": "are used as raw materials in the production of refrigerant gases.  Aqueous hydrogen chloride is a co-product of the refrigerant process, producing a 36% HCl solution.  Vinylidene fluoride is both a product for off-site sale and a reactant in a polymerization process.\nNormal production of aqueous HCl results in a solution below the 37% threshold concentration for coverage under the RMP rule.  It is possible, due to brief process upsets, for a production unit to produce hydrochloric acid at a strength of greater than 37% and collect it in a short-term storage (shift) tank.  Because the plant HCl production specification requires acid strengths between 35.21 and 36.9%, plant procedures require that any off-specification acid will be disposed of or diluted to meet specifications before packaging.  As such, aqueous HCl will be included as predictive reporting.\n\nHF is shipped to the facility in railcars.  In addition to the regular number of cars held in the plant, there are situations such as curtailed production or supply chain issues which could result in an additional number of cars in the facility, increasing the HF inventory.  As a precautionary notification, Arkema has included in this submittal a quantity equal to the maximum number of railcars that could be expected on site at any one time.\nLiquid chlorine is transferred from a railcar to a storage tank, where it is distributed throughout the plant.  Normally a railcar is ordered when one car is unloaded, using a production forecast to determine when a car should be needed.  It is possible, however, that a production interruption or business disruption could allow a car to arrive in the plant before the storage tank has enough room to allow the car to be unloaded, increasing the plant\u0092s overall inventory.  This submittal predicatively assumes that the storage tank contains chlorine above the normal unloading weight and a full railcar is onsite.\n\nVinylidene fluoride (R-1132a) is loaded into intermodal containers c"

The reported inventory of vinylidene fluoride includes a number of these trailers on site as well as the amount held in tanks.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and the EPA Risk Management Program.  This prevention program covers those processes that handle HF, aqueous HCl, chlorine, and flammable substances (including vinylidene fluoride) above the threshold quantity of either the PSM or RMP rules.\n\nThe prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents.  Some of the specific activities in the prevention program include:\n\u0095\tIn-depth process hazards analyses are completed every five years by qualified personnel using techniques approved under the OSHA PSM standards;\n\u0095\tUp-to-date written operating procedures are used for training and directing the work of operators, who receive refresher training every three years;\n\u0095\tOperators, mechanics, and contractor personnel are qualified, trained in the general hazards in the facility, and informed of any temporary situations affecting safety;\n\u0095\tA safe work permit system assures that process work is done safely and properly;\n\u0095\tA management system is in place to ensure that changes are managed safely;\n\u0095\tCritical equipment is inspected on a planned, periodic basis to assure proper operating conditions;\n\u0095\tPre-startup reviews are done to insure that conditions for safe operation have been satisfied prior to starting new or modified equipment or when significant shutdowns have occurred;\n\u0095\tIncidents are investigated and actions are taken as part of a continuous improvement effort; and\n\u0095\tRoutine audits are conducted to assure that safe practices are being followed.\n\nThis systematic approach to process safety involves employees and strives for c"
