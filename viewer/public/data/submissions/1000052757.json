The RMP for this facility has been updated to meet the 5 year update requirement by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.  Updated changes to the 1999 RMP include: 1) the requirement that information on reportable chemical accidents be added to the RMP within 6 months of the accident date; 2) the requirement that changes to the emergency contact information be reported within 1 month; 3) the removal of the original requirement to include a brief description of the off-site consequence analysis (OCA) in the Executive Summary of the RMP; and 4) the addition of 3 data elements to the RMP consisting of: emergency contact e-mail addresses if the addresses exist; b) the purpose and type of any submission that revises or otherwise affects the previously filed RMP; and c) the name, address, and telephone number of the contractor/consultant who prepared the updated RMP.\r\n\r\n\r\nColumbus Water Treatment Plant No. 1 and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe Columbus Water Treatment Plant No. 1 (Columbus WTP No. 1) treats drinking water for the City of Columbus, Indiana.  The processes at the plant include mixing, filtration, sedimentation control, clarification, and chlorination disinfection of drinking water for the City of Columbus.  The only regulated substance used at the plant is chlorine.  The facility purchases pressurized cylinders that are filled with 2,000 pounds of liquified chlorine.  A total of 10,000 pounds of this substanc could be stored at the plant at any one time.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe Columbus WTP No. 1 is covered by the Emergency Planning and Right-to-Know (EPCRA) program and the OSHA Process Management Plan requirements.  The only substance representing a hazard to humans and the environment is the potential toxic release of chlorine gas.  Potential releases of chlorine gas coul"

The facility has the following process controls in place to reduce the risk of chlorine: vessel relief valves, manual shutoff controls, automatic shutoffs, gas detection alarms, and rupture disks.  When the outer access doors to the gas cylinder storage room are closed, the chlorine storage building provides significant passive control and mitigation of chlorine gas escape from the facility.  Pursuant to U.S. EPA guidance, the storage building passive control could reduce the rate of chlorine gas release to the environment by approximately 55%.  Chlorine gas leaks can be detected through the use of chlorine gas sensors within the storage room area and in the process room.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccidental Release and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe City of Columbus has a strong commitment to the protection of the public and environment from releases of hazardous chemicals from any of its facilities.  The individual facility managers are responsible for safe operating and maintenance of all potentially hazardous treatment processes as well as the enforcement of emergency response policies.  Guidance and policies for the handling of accidental releases of hazardous substances at its facilities are provided by: 1) a Process Safety Management Plan (June 1999); and a 2) Comprehensive Emergency Response Plan (under the direction of the Office of Emergency Preparedness.
