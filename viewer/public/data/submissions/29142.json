Founded in 1924, Univar USA Inc. supplies the water and waste water industry, food industry, compounders, pharmaceuticals, mining, forest products, oil and gas producers, electronics, coatings and many other key industries with the chemical raw materials required to produce or refine products utilized in numerous end-use markets.\n\nUnivar USA Inc. is a member of the National Association of Chemical distributors (NACD) and complies with the Responsible Distribution Process (RDP), an environmental, health and safety improvement initiative.\n\n\nSome of the products stored and handled by Univar USA Inc. are subject to EPA's Risk Management Program rule (40 CFR Part 68).  A key requirement of this rule is the preparation and submission of an RMP Plan, contained herein. The contents of the RMP plan are prescribed by EPA, including this Executive Summary.\n\nCORPORATE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE APPROACH\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nProcesses that are subject to OSHA's Process Safety management (PSM) standard AND are regulated under EPA's RMP rule are subject to the Program 3 Prevention program.  Univar USA Inc. has documented the Prevention Program in its Process Safety Management Manual. Briefly, this program includes provisions and requirements for:\n\n* Process Safety Information\n* Process Hazard Analysis\n* Operating Procedures\n* Training\n* Mechanical Integrity\n* Management of Change\n* Pre-Startup Review\n* Compliance Audits\n* Incident Investigation\n* Employee Participation\n* Hot Work permits\n* Contractors\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE APPROACH\n\nUnivar USA Inc. has an Emergency Contingency Plan in place.

Joint emergency exercises are conducted when possible.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE\n\nThe Providence, Rhode Island site stores, handles and delivers a variety of hazardous and non-hazardous chemical products to wholesale customers in New England. In addition, bleach and dilute ammonia solutions are processed and distributed. Prepackaged containers of 37% formaldehyde solution are handled at inventory levels above the threshold planning quantity of 15,000 lbs. The typical inventory level for formaldehyde is 25,000 lbs. in drums or intermediate bulk containers. Prepackaged containers of 70 % hydrofluoric acid solution may be are handled at levels above the threshold planning quantity of 1000 lbs. Railcars of chlorine are received at the facility and utilized in the processing of liquid bleach above the threshold planning quantity of 1,500 lbs. The typical inventory level for chlorine is 700,000 lbs in railcars. Anhydrous ammonia is received at the facility and repackaged into 150 lb cylinders or into bulk transports above the threshold planning quantity of 10,000 lbs. The typical inventory level for anhydrous ammonia is 240,000 lbs in railcars and cylinders. Anhydrous ammonia is further processed into containerized dilute ammonia solutions. The typical inventory level for dilute ammonia solution is 275,000 lbs in drums, bulk, or intermediate bulk containers.  \n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe Worst-Case Toxic Release Scenario for the site would involve a total container failure with a release of chlorine from the railcar according to the EPA proscribed release protocol. This would result in a release of 180,000 pounds of chlorine in a 10 minute time period. Air dispersion modeling projects an affected area and distance to endpoint of approximately 25 miles.\n\nALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE"

Air dispersion modeling projects an affected area and distance to endpoint of up to 1108 feet or .21 miles. \n\nGENERAL PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nAs outlined previously, Univar USA Inc. is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation and utilizes this program to meet the prevention program requirements under RMP.\n\nChemical-specific prevention steps include the following:\n1.The maintenance of minimal practical inventories.\n2. Employee training and operating procedures.\n3. Employee release detection and mitigation activities.\n4. Equipment and containers designed to meet appropriate regulatory guidelines  \n\nACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe site has experienced no accidents as specified in 40 CFR Part 68 related to the handling of formaldehyde solution, hydrofluoric acid solution, chlorine, anhydrous ammonia and dilute ammonia solutions in the previous 5 years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nAn emergency contingency plan has been prepared and made available to local emergency response agencies. The Providence fire department is familiar with and periodically visits the site.  A contract has been formalized with Clean Harbors Inc, an emergency response contractor to provide on site and off site emergency response services in the event of a release.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
