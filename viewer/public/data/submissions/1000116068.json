The contractor brings a mobile reactor and uses ammonia from our storage tank to react with acid and the new fertilizer product into a storage onsite for future use in custom blends. The contractor's RMP/PSM prevention plan and documents, as well as safety policies, are provided to the facility for review prior to coming onsite to confirm they are up to date.\n\nAccidental Release Program: \n\nThis Anhydrous ammonia facility implemented the provisions and requirements of the State of Louisiana for storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia and the \" Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Ammonia \" as published by American National Standards Institute and Compressed Gas Association (ANSI/CGA G-2.1), and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". \n\nFive Year Accident History: \n\nIn the past five years there have been no accidental releases at this site. \n\nEmergency Response Program: \n\nThis facility is a non-responding facility and an emergency action plan has been developed and put in place for ensure employee safety, rather than a full-fledged response plan. Included in this plan are notification procedures to local responders. Coordination activities with the LEPC and local responders are conducted to ensure this facility is included in the community response plans for an uncontrolled release of anhydrous ammonia. This facility provides any requested information to the LEPC and local responders necessary for developing a strategy for response and mitigating the threat posed by an uncontrolled release of anhydrous ammonia. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety: \n\nSafety and Environmental programs are very dynamic, since this is an ongoing process, changes toward improvement are evaluated and implemented periodically.
