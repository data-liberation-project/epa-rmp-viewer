OTK has implemented training programs for personnel to help (1) ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes and (2) evaluate possible hazards.  In the event of an accidental release, OTK implements policies and procedures created for the protection of employees and prevention of injury to the public and the environment.  OTK provides first responder training to specific personnel, designates emergency response commanders to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the Mobile County, Alabama Emergency Management team (LEPC).\n\n\n\n2.0    Stationary source and regulated substances\n\n\n\nOTK is a manufacturer of stainless steel products.  Two chemicals, which are listed in EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulation, are used to manufacture these stainless products.  These regulated chemicals, 70% hydrofluoric acid and anhydrous ammonia, are used to clean (pickle) the stainless products in two process areas.  The 70% hydrofluoric acid is received from tractor trailer trucks and is transferred to an on-site storage tank.  The anhydrous ammonia is received from tractor trailer trucks and is transferred to an on-site storage tank.  These chemicals are then transferred by pipelines to two process buildings; the hot annealing pickling line (HAPL) and the cold annealing pickling line (CAPL).  OTK conforms to the requirements of RMP program level 3 as the Calvert facility is classified by the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 331111 and anhydrous ammonia is listed in OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.\n\n\n\n3.0    General accident prevention program\n\n\n\nOTK has a formalized general safety program that addresses all applicable OSHA safety regulations.\n\n\n\n3.1    "

OTK consults with and involves employees and their representatives to obtain feedback to the details of each covered process.  This written plan is located in the Acid Storage Building and will be available on OTK's shared server.  Employees participate in performing process hazards analyses (PHA's), gathering and organizing process safety information, conducting incident investigations, developing process related training, developing operating procedures, and other PSM related activities as needed.\n\n\n\n3.2    Process Safety Information\n\n\n\nOTK has compiled written process safety information before conducting any process hazard analysis as required by OSHA's process safety management regulation.  This information enables OTK employees who are involved in operating the processes to identify and understand the possible hazards created by the regulated chemicals.  This information pertains to the hazardous properties of the regulated chemicals, technology of the process that contains the regulated chemicals, and process equipment that contains the regulated chemicals.  Safety Data Sheets (SDS), block flow diagrams, piping and instrumentation diagrams, and equipment information are stored in the Acid Storage Building and will be available on OTK's shared server and process equipment files.\n\n\n\n3.3    Process Hazard Review\n\n\n\nOTK performed an initial PHA on the processes that contain the regulated chemicals and the meeting was completed on December 6, 2010.  PHA revalidations are required at least every five years.  The \"HAZOP\" method combined with checklists was used for the December 2010 meeting; however, other methods may be used when appropriate.  OTK reviews all PHA findings and recommendations to ensure all are (1) resolved in a timely manner, (2) documented, and (3) communicated to affected employees. \n\n\n\n3.4    Operating Procedures\n\n\n\nOTK has develo"

Additionally, safe work practices are developed for the control of hazards and include confined space entry, opening process equipment or piping, lockout/tagout, and control over the entrance into the process areas that contain the regulated chemicals.  These safe work procedures are reviewed, revised as needed, and certified on an annual basis or more frequently as may be needed.\n\n\n\n3.5    Training\n\n\n\nEach employee at OTK involved in operating regulated chemical containing processes receives training on the (1) PSM and RMP regulations, (2) safety and health hazards of the regulated chemicals, and (3) safe operation of the process. To complement the written procedures for process operations, task progression experience is used as a means for operator growth and advancement. After operators demonstrate having adequate knowledge to perform the tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  \n\n\n\nRefresher training is scheduled and completed every three years or more frequently as may be needed to ensure operator skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  OTK also gathers input, through the use of surveys and/or interviews, from employees who are involved in operating regulated chemical containing processes.  This information is used to refine the refresher training content and frequency.\n\n\n\n3.6    Contractors\n\n\n\nOTK selects contractors who perform maintenance or repair, turnaround, major renovation, or specialty work on or adjacent to a covered process by obtaining and evaluating their safety performance and programs.  Each contractor is informed of any known hazards related to the contractor's work and the process and any applicable emergency response procedures.

This review ensures all requirements are met before the introduction of any regulated chemical into a new or modified process.  This review is completed prior to startup to ensure all safety related action items are implemented.  \n\n\n\n3.8    Mechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nOTK has a mechanical integrity program to ensure the integrity of the process equipment.\n\n\n\n3.9     Hot Work Permit\n\n\n\nOTK issues hot work permits for any hot work operations conducted on or near regulated chemical containing processes.  Each permit documents that the fire prevention and protection requirements in 29 CFR 1910.252 (a) have been implemented prior to beginning the hot work operations.  They also indicate the date(s) and time authorized for hot work and the identity of the object on which hot work is to be performed.  After the hot work job is completed, the area is inspected for any smoldering fire hazards.  If none are found, the hot work permit is closed out.  Each permit is kept on file until completion of the hot work operations and inspections.\n\n\n\n3.10    Management of Change\n\n\n\nA Management of Change (MOC) system is in place at OTK to prevent changes in the process and supporting equipment from introducing unacceptable hazards to workers.  This MOC system has written procedures for managing changes, which need to be made to the regulated chemical containing processes.  The procedures require review prior to a change and training must be completed for the affected employees and contractors.

There are many systems in place to achieve this goal.  Major efforts to improve safety are also underway with OTK's job safety analysis (JSA) program.  The program consists of systematically analyzing jobs from a safety perspective.  This is accomplished by identifying all the jobs performed and breaking each job down into the steps taken to complete each task.  The potential accidents and hazards of each task are identified and recommendations are then provided on how to prevent these hazards from occurring. Employees participate in this program by providing input on each analysis.  The resulting JSAs are used in the various training programs.  \n\n"
