      "SummaryText": "     Vero Chemical Distributors, Inc., is a supplier of gas chlorine (CAS# 7782-50-5) to the waste water industry. We distribute gas chlorine in 150 pound cylinders, not the one ton cylinders seen at city and county owned plants. We do not manufacture or process this chemical, we simply warehouse it and distribute it.  However, we are equipped to handle leaks that may occur.  In our warehouse a full protection suit with a breathing apparatus along with a patch kit, allows us to seal leaks immediately.  Over the years we have had many safety seminars wherein our supplier explains proper safety procedures.  We have also worked with the local fire department on this matter, and they too are well equipped to handle any type of leak.  We are required to give a five-year accident history on any chlorine gas release.  To date, we have had no such incidents.   In the event of a leak, the EPA requires that we come up with a worst-case scenario.  If that were to happen, the chlorine would be released into our building and mixed with the surrounding air.  The estimated distance to the toxic endpoint would be approximately .3 miles.  In a more likely alternative scenario, the chlorine would still be released into our building and mixed with the surrounding air.  The estimated distance to the toxic endpoint would then be less than one-tenth of a mile.  Notwithstanding our clear record,  we are properly equipped and trained to handle any accidental release."
