It is part of the Friction Materials Business Unit of Honeywell.  Headquartered in Morris Township, New Jersey, Honeywell is an advanced technology and manufacturing company serving customers worldwide with aerospace and automotive products, chemicals, fibers, plastics, and advanced materials.  With year 2000 sales of approximately $25 billion, the company ranks among the top 100 of the Fortune 500.  Honeywell has approximately 120,000 employees at 350 facilities in 40 countries.  Honeywell operates thirteen major businesses: Home and Building Control, Industrial Control, Aircraft Landing Systems, Aerospace Engines and Systems, Aerospace Electronic Systems, Aerospace Services,  Federal Manufacturing and Technologies, Performance Polymers, Specialty Chemicals, Electronic Materials, Consumer Products Group, Transportation and Power Systems and Friction Materials.  More information about Honeywell may be found at its Web Page: www.Honeywell.com.\n\nIt is the world wide policy of Honeywell to design, manufacture, and distribute its products and to handle and dispose of materials throughout their life cycle in a manner that protects the environment and safeguards employees, customers, and the public from unacceptable risk.  Honeywell's complete Health, Safety and Environment Policy may be found at the Honeywell Web Page.\n\nThe Honeywell Green Island Plant is an automotive manufacturing facility that has approximately 70 employees.  Several different product lines are made at this facility, which also manufactures phenol formaldehyde resin.  This process involves the use of formaldehyde solution, which is on the RMP Rule's list of regulated substances.  The Honeywell Green Island Plant' stores more than the Rule's specified threshold quantity of 15,000 lbs and is therefore regulated under the RMP Rule.\n\n\n1.  Accidental Release and"

EPA also assumes that the failure takes place over 10 minutes and that all safety systems fail to operate.  In addition, the release must take place during the worst possible weather conditions.  For a number of reasons discussed in this submittal, it is extremely unlikely that this event would ever occur.  In addition, the Green Island site is required to analyze the impact of an alternative accidental release scenario for the chemicals covered by the RMP regulations.\n\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis for a worst-case release scenario at the Green Island Plant's stationary source was performed for the largest single vessel of formaldehyde solution. This vessel has a maximum capacity of 144,000 lbs.  The vessel is a cylindrical steel tank located in an outdoor tank farm adjacent to the facility.  The tank sits on a solid concrete base with a concrete walled dike designed to contain the full contents of the vessel should a release occur.  The tank's actual operational storage content is maintained at an average of 75,000 lbs., which is intentionally below its maximum design capacity.  The parameters used for the worst-case release scenario for the formaldehyde source were those defined and pre-set by EPA in the RMP Rule for toxic liquids.\n\nIn accordance with the RMP Rule, the maximum 144,000-lb. full capacity contents of the vessel were assumed to be released instantaneously to the surrounding dike and allowed to evaporate for one hour.  With these assumptions, the model run showed that there would be an offsite impact from this release.\n\nThe Plant's alternate-case scenario is a hose uncoupling from a tank containing 46,000 lbs. of solution.  The hypothetical spill of 40,000 lbs. was of a 49 percent formaldehyde solution in water.  It was assumed that the 40,000 lbs. of solution was spilled into the dike over a 20 m"

All contractors working in or adjacent to the resin plant production area or tank farm are covered by this procedure. A comprehensive training session is conducted with each contractor prior to work. Re-training is conducted for all involved contractors for each successive job relating to the resin production plant.\n* Pre-Startup Safety Review\nPre-Startup safety reviews help to ensure that designs and procedures are complete and thorough prior to bringing a new facility on line or restarting an existing unit after a change or shutdown.  A documented checklist is completed at our facility whenever a change in equipment or procedures occurs. This pre-start up review is then communicated to all involved personnel via the process safety management team.\n* Mechanical Integrity\nThe written procedures that are in place regarding mechanical integrity assure that equipment used to process, store, or handle highly hazardous chemicals is designed, fabricated, installed, and maintained to minimize the risk of releases of these chemicals.\nThis standard applies to all equipment designated as critical.  Critical equipment is defined as pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, pumps, compressors, and relief devices that handle any of the chemicals listed in OSHA 1910.119.  In addition, safety-critical equipment such as emergency shutdown systems, emergency generators, control power sources, and designated controls are included in the mechanical integrity program.  \nA thorough mechanical review was conducted on our process piping, vessels, and storage equipment.

General Accident Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Accident    \nPrevention Program\n\nHoneywell's prevention program for a Program Level 3 RMP facility is comprehensive, consisting of twelve elements.\n* Process Safety Information\nThe Process Safety Information procedure is designed to help those involved in operating the process to identify and understand the hazards posed by those processes involving highly hazardous chemicals.\nProcess Safety Information accumulated at the Green Island facility included information on: 1) the hazards of the highly hazardous chemicals used or produced by our resin process, 2) information on the technology of the process, and 3) information on the equipment design of the process.\n* Process Hazardous Analyses (PHA)\nProcess Hazards Analyses are part of  OSHA's Process Safety Management Directive.  A PHAwas completed at our facility and it included an analysis and review of areas used in the transport, storage, or processing of resin. The Hazards and Operability Method was used to perform this Process Hazards Analyses. The information generated from the analyses was formalized into a safety improvement action plan with specific time frames and responsibility assigned for completeness. \n* Operating Procedures\nThe purpose of operating procedures is  provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in all of our processes.\n All of the resin production processes were identified and specific written instructions were addressed for each process including operating phases, operating limits, emergency actions, safety and health considerations, and safety systems.

Employees must fully understand the safety and health hazards associated with the chemicals and processes in their work environment.\nAll employees, including maintenance and contract employees involved with highly hazardous chemicals, are trained on the specific safety and health hazards of the process, emergency operations including shutdown, and other safe work practices that apply to the employee's job tasks. All changes to the process, equipment, or procedures, and all incidents involving the process are reviewed in training sessions with all involved personnel. \n* Compliance Audits\nA complete program audit is conducted at least every three (3) years on all the elements of the Risk Management program. All items identified from these audits are addressed in a timely manner to assure the integrity of the process.\n* Employee Participation\nEmployee participation is an important element of the program.
