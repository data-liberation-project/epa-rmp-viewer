In this scenario, safety and emergency systems operate as expected, and plant personnel respond to take action to control and stop the release\r\n\r\nAmmonia scenario assumptions:\r\n+ Partial failure of the piping system containing ammonia liquid under pressure.\r\n+ Detection of ammonia by instruments or personnel in the area, shutdown of the ammonia supply equipment by remote control, and closure of valves by site personnel to stop the leak.\r\n+ Release during typical weather conditions experienced at the site.\r\n\r\nTrimethylchlorosilane scenario assumptions:\r\n+ Partial failure of the piping system during the trans-loading of Trimethylchlorosilane.\r\n+ Operators are present during the trans-load and can immediately stop the transfer should a leak occur. \r\n+ Release during typical weather conditions experienced at the site. \r\n\r\nV. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nDuring the past five years, COOPER RIVER PARTNERS has not experienced any release of ammonia that requires listing in the RMP information we are submitting.\r\n\r\nVI. EMERGENCY RESPONSE\r\nIncident and Emergency Guidelines\r\nCOOPER RIVER PARTNERS has multiple safeguards in place to ensure safe handling of ammonia and Trimethylchlorosilane to prevent releases of these substances. Our facility is prepared to handle emergencies such as hurricanes and tornadoes as well as chemical releases. In the unlikely event a release occurs, we work to contain the release quickly and to minimize its impact on plant personnel and neighbors. If a release occurs:\r\n+ Equipment that supplies the regulated substance would be shut down quickly by remote control.\r\n+ The plan"

Protection of our employees and neighbors is our highest priority, and that is why we have installed multiple safeguards to ensure that all chemicals are handled safely. We also work closely with our suppliers, other companies, local officials and the public to maintain stringent safety and environmental programs and to minimize risks. In keeping with our commitment, COOPER RIVER PARTNERS has developed a risk management plan in compliance with guidelines established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Under EPA guidelines, facilities that handle certain quantities of regulated chemicals must submit plans that show the consequences of hypothetical chemical releases. Facilities must also outline their measures to reduce the risk of releases and minimize their effects.\r\nCRP is regulated by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements listed in 29 CFR Part 1910.119.

      "SummaryText": "ted in 40 CFR Part 68. The RMP includes COOPER RIVER PARTNERs ammonia refrigeration system and ISO storage of Trimethylchlorosilane. The Ammonia system contains liquefied gas under pressure, and is regulated as a toxic substance. The site stores iso vessels containing Trimethylchlorosilane that is also regulated as a toxic substance.The COOPER RIVER PARTNERS site does not have any flammables that require inclusion in the Risk Management Plan.\r\nCRP uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in the plant-wide refrigeration system. Ammonia is a colorless gas with a strong pungent odor. Exposure to ammonia can irritate the eyes, nose and throat. Exposure to extremely high levels can result in a buildup of fluid in the lungs and can be life threatening.\r\n\r\nCRP also provides interim short-term storage of Trimethylchlorosilane, pending shipment to its final destination.\r\n\r\nIV. RELEASE SCENARIOS\r\nA worst case and alternative case scenario is included in the plan for ammonia and Trimethylchlorosilane. \r\n\r\nToxic end-point or Level of Concern (LOC)\r\nThe Emergency Response Planning Guideline 2 - Level of Concern (ERPG2-LOC) is the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals can be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or serious health effects, or symptoms which impair their ability to take protective action. The release impact distance is the distance down wind to the ERPG2-LOC concentration. The ERPG2-LOC for ammonia is 200 parts per million (ppm) and the EHS-LOC for Trimethylchlorosilane is 0.05 ppm.\r\n\r\nThe Extremely Hazardous Substance Level of Concern (EHS-LOC) is the airborne concentration 10 times safer than the concentration (estimated from toxicity data) that is immediately dangerous to life and health. The release impact distance is the distance down wind to the EHS-LOC concentration. All scenarios evaluated used EPA's published model, RMPComp, to provide toxic end-point determinations based o"
