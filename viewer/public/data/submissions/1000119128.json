      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\nClary Waste Treatment Plant\r\n\r\nThe Board of Public Works of Gaffney, South Carolina ( BPW ) accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  This policy complies with all the applicable requirements of section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) and all applicable procedures of the Environmental Protection AgencyA\u00bfs Risk Management Program(RMP).  The BPW Risk Management Program involves the preparation of response plans that are tailored to each facility.\r\n\r\nThe Broad River Waste Treatment Plant, the Clary Waste Treatment Plant, the Cherokee Water Treatment Plant, and the Victor Gaffney Water Treatment Plant are facilities owned by the BPW that exceed the OSHA Process Safety Management Program ( PSM ) ( 29 CFR 1910.119 ) threshold limit of 1500 pounds for Chlorine ( CAS: 007782-50-5 )and 1000 pounds for Sulfur Dioxide(CAS:7446-09-5) at the Clary and Broad River WWTP's.  These facilities are manned and are required by 1910.119 to establish a PSM program.  The BPW has implemented a PSM program that is unique to each facility.  Presently, all the facilities exceed the threshold limit of 2500 pounds of chlorine established by CAA 112r,therefore, each facility has implemented a Risk Management Program based on CAA 112r Program 3 requirements.  In addition the, Clary and Broad River WWTP's exceed the threshold limit of 5000 pounds for sulfur dioxide established by the requirement.\r\n\r\nEach facility has special characteristics such as number of employees, hours the facility is manned, density of the surrounding population, and public receptors that required the BPW to develop RMP for each of the facilities.  The facilities use many technological and managerial practices that are not unique, in fact are common in the water-waste water treatment industry. Liquid chlorine is delivered to each of the facilities in ton cylinders and placed in a tank st"

Gaseous Chlorine, collecting in the top of the tank as a function of temperature, is piped off by a vacuum chlorinating system and injected into potable water to form a solution of hypochlorite.  The solution is piped to contact chambers for the purpose of disinfecting water and wastewater.  The equipment at each facility includes a tank storage area, chlorinator room that contains the chlorinators, flow recorders, various safety equipment, and electrical panels. Gaseous Sulfur Dioxide collecting in the top of the tank as a function of temperture, is piped off by a vacuum sulfurnating system and injected into the contact chambers.  A compete listing of equipment, along with block flow diagrams, and pipe and instrumentation diagrams are included in the BPW PSM for each facility.\r\n\r\nThe offsite consequence analysis, required by CCA, includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios and two for sulfur dioxide, identified as A\u00bfworst case releaseA\u00bf and A\u00bfalternative scenarioA\u00bf.  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that A\u00bfthe owner or operator shall assume that the A\u00bf maximum quantity in the largest vessel A\u00bf is released as a gas over 10 minutes,A\u00bf due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as A\u00bfmore likely to occur than the worst-case release scenarioA\u00bf.\r\n\r\nAtmospheric dispersion model was performed for each facility based on the RMP COMP VER. 1.07. The RMP COMP PROGRAM was used to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine and sulfur dioxide released before its concentration decreases to the A\u00bf toxic endpointA\u00bf selected by EPA of 3 ppm or 0.0087 mg/L for chlorine and 0.0078 mg/L for sulfur dioxide, which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the A\u00bfmaximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irrever"

The response of the operator would take 60 minutes or less and is an active mitigation measure.  An additional active mitigation system is the remote vacuum type chlorinators and sulfurnators.  This system will reduce significantly the amount of chlorine or sulfur dioxide released in the case of a piping rupture. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Accidental Release Prevention Program at the Clary Waste Water Treatment Plant is based on the elements of the OSHA PSM Program.  The PSM Program is a comprehensive and detailed toxic chemical management program that is available for inspection at the plant.  The program includes the following accidental release prevention elements:  \r\n\r\nA\u00bf\tHigh level and continuous training of the operators\r\nA\u00bf\tPreventive maintenance program\r\nA\u00bf\tThe use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators\r\nA\u00bf\tThe use of state of the art process and safety equipment\r\nA\u00bf\tPerformance of a hazard assessment of equipment and procedures\r\nA\u00bf\tImplementation of an auditing and inspection program\r\nA\u00bf\tContinuous review of process information including study of  Material Safety Data Sheet which includes information on the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine\r\nA\u00bf\tChemical-specific steps include the availability of full face respirators and self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), worn by the operators worn by operators during tank change outs and alarm response\r\nA\u00bf\tChlori"
