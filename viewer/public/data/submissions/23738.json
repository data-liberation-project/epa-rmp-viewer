      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nWe at A.E. Staley Manufacturing Company-Decatur are strongly committed to employees, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated wtih the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement the appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the manufacture of corn syrup, dry dextrose, industrial starch, and baking starches.  We have two regulated substances at our facility, ethylene oxide and sulfur dioxide. Ethylene Oxide is used in Starch Modification.   Sulfur dioxide is utilized in the steeping step of the corn wet milling process.\n\nEthylene Oxide storage was recently upgraded to incorporate additional safety measures and enhanced active mitigation methods.The storage system for EO is designed to prevent overheating and contamination of EO.   Specific additional measures for EO storage passive mitigation include a break tank and a sump in the secondary containment area. Specific measures for EO storage active mitigation include a one-million gallon disposal tank, a packed-column vapor scrubber, improved cooling of ethylene oxide transfer, enhanced process controls and detection systems.  Nitrogen continues to be utilized for the bulk storage tank, break tank, and railcar blanketing. The capability has been added to use nitrogen for maintenance purging\n\nPASSIVE MITIGATION\nThe addition of a BREAK TANK creates a \"BREAK\" between the process and the bulk storage tank.  Isolating the process from bulk storage will reduce the risk of any contaminants getting into bulk storage.  Contaminants could lead to unwanted reactions causing temperature rise, pressure rise, or increase in leve"

      "SummaryText": "l.\n\nThe new storage area incorporates a sloped diked area around railcar unloading and bulk storage, draining to a sump.  The sump allows reclamation of any spilled material or deluge water.\n\nACTIVE MITIGATION\nThe one-million gallon DISPOSAL TANK allows emptying and dilution of the EO in the bulk storage tank and the break tank.  The tank is maintained at sufficient levels of water to allow dilution of the EO. There are also provisions to mix caustic with the diluted EO to speed conversion to ethylene glycol. \n\nVapor can be generated for maintenance activities requiring tank and/or pipe purging. Vapor can also result from venting of the bulk storage tank in the unlikely event that high pressures and high temperatures occur from contamination of the EO.  The new PACKED COLUMN vapor scrubber converts EO vapor into glycol liquid which can be safety handled in the facility pre-treatment plant.\n\nThe IMPROVED COOLING SYSTEM in the new storage compound maintains the temperature in the storage tank at 50-55 F.  The Cooling System still includes a cooling jacket on the bulk storage tank and a heat exchanger on the transfer system.\n\nPROCESS CONTROLS have been utilized in the past to ensure the continuous monitoring of EO.\nThe new Ethylene Oxide storage system has many layers of safety to prevent a release of ethylene oxide from the storage tank and associated system.  All control interlocks are designed to shut down the system and bring it to a safe state for inspection and troubleshooting. There are EO ambient sensors placed around the new EO storage compound that are continuously monitored by Central Control personnel. The EO storage tank has a mechanical excess flow valve on its discharge.  The new system also has an emergency air supply enabling system operation even in the event of a power outage.\n\nSulfur Dioxide is an addition to the Risk Management plan.   Normal processing operations do not require on-site storage of sulfur dioxide gas. The Decatur facility normally o"

During these limited maintenance periods a bulk tank truck will be utilized on-site as temporary storage.  The tank truck storage capacity exceeds the sulfur dioxide threshold for inclusion in the Risk Management Program.\n\nTHE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIOS\nTo evaluate the worst case scenario and the alternate scenarios we have used the  EPA's RMP Guidance for Off-Site Consequence Analysis and EPA's RMPComp*.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO submitted involves a catastrophic release from the Ethylene Oxide tank.  In this scenario 220,000 lb of Ethylene Oxide is released.  The toxic gas liquefied under pressure is assumed to evaporate entirely over 10 minutes. At class F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed and urban topography a distance of 9.9 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.9 mg/L.\n\nThe ETHYLENE OXICE ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO involves PUNCTURING a rail car of Ethylene Oxide while moving the car from the staging area to the bulk tank storage compound.  The release cannot be mitigated and the entire 170,000 lbs contents of the railcar is released.  Under neutral weather conditions of class D atmospheric stability and 3 m/s wind speed and assuming urban topography a distance of 1.7 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.9 mg/L.\n\nTHE SULFUR DIOXIDE ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO involves a two-phase release of liquid sulfur dioxide from the 1\" pipe line running through the process building. The leak is not detected for 60 minutes. Mitigation of  the release rate is assumed as outlined in the \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Waste Water Treatment Plants.\"   The calculated release rate utilizing mitigation "

This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-30 standard, NFPA-36 standard, applicable ANSI and ASME standards, and considering chemical supplier recommendations. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary facility.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\nA.E. Staley Manufacturing Company-Decatur maintains a record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment design associated with all processes.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS (PHA)\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the What If Scenarios.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering maintenance, and process operations and are revalidated at regular intervals.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA review for the entire Ethylene Oxide system was performed March 15, 2000; the storage compound portion was reviewed again on January 1, 2001.  The most recent PHA review for the Sulfur Dioxide System was performed January 22, 2001.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\nFor the purpose of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, A.E.
