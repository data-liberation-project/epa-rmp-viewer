Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Howard County Equity Co-op Association in Elma are strongly committed to employee,\npublic, and environmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive\naccidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating\nprocedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is\nour policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. \nIf such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and\nmitigate the effects of the release.  We also coordinate our response efforts with the Elma Fire\nDepartment, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\nammonia stored in 30,000 and 18,000-gallon storage tanks at our facility in Elma (Figure 1,\nammonia).  The maximum possible amount stored with nurse tanks is 450,882 pounds\n\nWe also have propane stored in 30,000- and 18,000-gallon interconnected tanks located at our\nfacility in Elma (Figure 1, propane).  The maximum amount stored is 40,800 gallons (172,298.4\npounds) at the maximum fill capacity of 85%.\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\nWe utilized RMP PRO for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite\nconsequence analysis for our ammonia and propane facility.  The following details these scenarios.\n\n            3.1     Ammonia\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the"

At\nClass F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, and urban topography, the maximum distance to\na toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L is 5.2 miles (Figure 2).  The estimated population within a 5.2-mile\nradius of this facility is 1,400.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a release from an anhydrous ammonia product line.  The\nscenario involves the release of 7,616.42 pounds of ammonia in a gaseous form over a period of 30\nminutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14\nmg/L of ammonia is 0.31 mile (Figure 3).  The estimated population within a 0.31-mile radius of the\nfacility is 300.\n\n            3.2     Propane\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the\ninterconnected propane storage tanks (172,298.4 pounds) in gaseous form over a 10-minute period. \nAt Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance to an endpoint of\n1 psi overpressure is 0.45 miles (Figure 2).  This amount of overpressure can cause partial\ndemolition of houses and can result in serious injury to people within this distance.  The estimated\npopulation within a 0.45-mile radius of this facility is 600.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a 30-minute release of propane from a product line that\ncontacts an ignition source and detonates, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under neutral\nweather conditions, the maximum distance to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 0.12 mile (Figure\n3).  The estimated population within a 0.12-mile radius of this facility is 50.\n\n  4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention\nrequirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.
