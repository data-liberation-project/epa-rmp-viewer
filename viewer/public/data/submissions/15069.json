IF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS REPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIE DEPARTMENT, OR OTHER AUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE TO PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT. FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS SUMMARY, THE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THE  FACILITY IS THE STORAGE AND TRANSFER OF FERTILIZERS FOR SALE TO FARMERS. ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECIVED, STORED, AND DISTRIBUTED TO FAR MERS FOR THE BENIFIT OF EFFECTIVE AGRONOMY PRACTICES. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY STORED WOULD BE 53,000 PPOUNDS IN OUR 12,000 GALLON STORAGE TANK, THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY REIEVED BY TRUCK IS 41,000 POUNDS. THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF A STORAGE TANK RELEASED AS A GAS OVER 10 MINUTES, THE MAXIMUM QUANITY RELEASED WOULD BE 53,000 POUNDS WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE LARGEST STORAGE TANK AT 85 PERCENT CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS, THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT USING AN ENVIORMENTAL PLUM MODELING DEVICE IS .74 MILES. THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO BASED ON DATA RECIEVED FROM INDUSTRY EXPERTS IS A REALEASE FROM A BREAK IN A TRANSFER HOSE, THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT ( POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS .41 MILES.OUR FACILITY HAS AN EXCELLENT SAFETY RECORD AND HAS HAD NO REPORTABLE RELEASES IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS THAT HAVE CAUSED DEATHS, INJURIES, OR SIGNIFICANT PROPERTY DAMAGE AT OUR FACILITY OR TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, HAVE RESULTED IN OFFSITE DEATHS, INJURIES, EVACUATIONS, SHELTERING IN PLACE, PROPERTY DAMAGE, OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE. OUR EMPLOYEES HAVE GONE THROUGH AND WILL CONTINUE TO RECIEVE TRAINING WHICH MEETS OR EXCEEDS THAT REQUIRED BY VARIOUS REGULATORY A GENCIES INCLUDING, OSHA, KDA, DOT AND EPA.  WE HAVE EMERGENCY ACTION PLANS AND HAVE HAD  EMERGENCY TRAINING FOR OUR EMPLOYEES IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT AN ACCIDENT WOULD HAPPEN.  WE LIVE,WO"
