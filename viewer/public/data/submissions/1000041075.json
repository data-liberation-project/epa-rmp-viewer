      "SummaryText": "Honda Transmission Manufacturing of America, Inc. (HTM) has developed and implemented policies which directly impact and influence Honda's accident release prevention and emergency response activities.                                          First, HTM's Safety Policy expresses HTM's commitment to:\n\n- provide a safe and healthful work environment\n\n- conduct its operations with the highest regard for associate safety\n\n- continually improve the safety management system\n\n- train associates in respect to on the job safety\n\n- comply with all applicable safety and health requirements and standards mandated by federal, state and local law.\n\n\n\nSecond, HTM's Environmental Policy expresses a commitment to:\n\n- Comply with all applicable environmental requirements mandated by federal, state, and local law\n\n- operate and continually improve the environmental management system \n\n- implement methods to prevent pollution, conserve natural resources and reduce waste\n\n\n\nWith these policies as a foundation, HTM has made an effort to ensure compliance and best management practices in all areas relating to chemical safety. HTM has implemented the full prevention program and emergency response requirements to comply with both the USEPA Risk Management Program (RMP) and the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standards. Facility representatives have an open line of communication with local emergency planning committee members to establish emergency response procedures necessary to protect the surrounding community and the environment.\n\n\n\nA Description of the Facility and regulated Substances:\n\n\n\nHTM manufactures automatic transmission for Honda automobiles assembled in North America. The facility has a Program 3 covered process due to onsite storage and use of propane as a raw material. HTM operates carbon heat treat furnaces to harden steel parts prior to a finishing process. Propane is used as a raw material in this process.\n\n\n\nPropane Process:\n\n\n\nPropane is stored in an 18,000 gallon"

      "SummaryText": " storage tank, limited to 15,300 gallons by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Chapter 58.  Liquid propane is passed through a vaporizer to supply vapor to the ENDO Gas Generators for use in the heat treat furnaces. Propane is also used as a fuel for the ENDO generators pilots.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Program:\n\n\n\nSubject to both RMP and PSM standards, HTM uses a combined RPM/PSM program. The program includes a written management system for meeting compliance with each of the prevention program elements. \n\n\n\nThe propane storage system is leased from a certified propane supplier. The supplier is responsible for the mechanical integrity of the equipment and ancillary system. The supplier is a certified Honda Supplier compliant with the Contractor Requirements in the HTM RMP.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nHTM has not had any RMP reportable releases in the past five years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\n\n\nHTM has an implemented Emergency Response Plan for the facility. The Plan describes the responsibility and procedures of HTM associates and establishes a system in which the members of Emergency Response Teams work with local emergency response organizations. The HTM Emergency Response Teams conduct annual training on chemical specific response scenarios and maintains chemical specific response equipment. \n\n\n\nContinuous Improvement \n\n\n\nHTM is constantly seeking methods to improve safety. Through the Internal Audit Process and Process Hazard Analysis revalidation, the propane system will be periodically reviewed and consideration given to new means of reducing risk and improving the overall safety performance. \n\n\n\nAnnual meeting are held with members of the Logan Co ERC and other local officials to review operations at the facility. The meetings include a review of all response plans and an in depth tour of the facility.  "
