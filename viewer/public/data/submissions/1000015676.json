              "Description": "This process includes three interconnected production units, Aqueous Choline, Choline Salts, and TMAC. All information included in this prevention program applies to all three units with the following exceptions: - The TMAC system is not equipped with a camera monitoring device. - Only Aqueous choline operates with all valves opened. The valves will close automatically due to loss of system pressure under the following conditions; loss of nitrogen supply, rupture of nitrogen tubing due to mechanical failure, a fire at the unloading pump causing the plastic tubing to melt resulting in sealing the vessel, power failure,switch being manually turned, high storage tank temperature, and high rate of rise in storage tank level. Vessels are equipped with relief valves and high level indicators. The Aqueous choline system is equipped with a camera monitoring device as an additional safeguard in detecting any deficiences in the safe operation of the process and to lessen the risk of any accidental releases. The dates of the PHA, which are 10/03/2006, 03/06/2007, and 12/04/2009 are for Aqueous choline, Choline salts, and TMAC respectively.",

All are present in quantities that exceed the threshold quantity for applicability of EPA's Accidental Release Program. Ethylene oxide, methyl chloride (both are toxic chemicals), and trimethylamine (a flammable chemical) are utilized at this facility for the manufacture of nutritional supplements, animal food products for the poultry, beef, dairy, and companion animal industry, and also in the oil well production industry. Ethylene oxide is also repackaged for use in the sterilization of medical implements and spices. BCP Ingredients commitment to providing a safe and healthy work environment for employees, as well as providing a safe and healthy environment for the surrounding community is supported by the incorporation of the latest technology in process controls, active mitigation, passivemitigation, and monitoring detection systems. BCP Ingredients adheres to all applicable Federal, State, and local safety and environmental regulations for the prevention of releases of these and all chemicals. All information regarding BCP Ingredients Risk Management Plan has been submitted to EPA utilizing EPA's RMP Submit Software.                                                                                                                                                               \nAccidental Release Prevention Program:\n\nBCP Ingredients complies with the Process Safety Management Rule of OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.119 for the prevention of hazardous chemical releases, and is therefore subject to the requirements of EPA's Program 3 instead of Program 2. It should be noted that no data is reported for Program 2 in the RMP submit data because BCP Ingredients is subject only to Program 3.
