This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program.  The program in place at the Kenova facility encompasses such areas as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility.  It is the policy of MarkWest to implement appropriate controls to prevent the possible release of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, MarkWest is completely coordinated with the Cabell/Wayne County Local Emergency Planning Committee which provides emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substance Handled\n\nThe primary function of the MarkWest facility encompasses natural gas liquid (Y-Grade) extraction.  Y-Grade is the one substance present at the facility regulated by Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations.  This flammable substance is a mixture comprised of propane, normal butane, isobutane, and natural gasoline (pentanes and hexanes).  \n\nThe Y-Grade is extracted from a natural gas transmission pipeline.  Once extracted, the Y-Grade is stored in a 42,000-gallon capacity pressure vessel (D-5).  The Y-grade is then transferred via pipline to a fractionation facility.\n\nThe total quantity of product stored in the 42,000-gallon capacity vessel D-5 is administratively controlled to ensure that the vessels are not filled above 90% of full capacity.  Additionally, pressure relief devices provide added assurance that the vessels are not over-filled to pressures above 250 pounds per square inch (psi).  These controls are in place to prevent the potential for over-pressurizat"

The worst case and alternative case radii of effect were determined utilizing RMP*Comp software provided by the EPA.  The following describes details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case scenario for Program 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from vessel D-5.  The scenario involves the release of the entire quantity of the vessel, approximately 37,800 gallons (171,519 lbs) of propane.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions (wind speed of 3.4 miles per hour), the maximum distance of 0.4 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 pound per square inch (psi) overpressure. \n\nUtilizing Landview III and Marplot software, the worst case scenario radius of 0.4 miles is illustrated in the graphic file kenovawc.jpg (electronic version) and in the attached map (provided in non-electronic versions only).  Two major industrial facilities, Columbia Gas Transmission and Marthon-Ashland, are located within this radius.

Utilizing this data, the maximum distance of 0.3 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure. \n\nThe alternative case scenario radius of 0.3 miles is illustrated in the attached map (provided in non-electronic versions only).  Two major industrial facilities, Columbia Gas Transmission and Marathon-Ashland Refinery are located within this radius.  Based on Landview III 1990 census data utilizing the block group proration method, 23 households and 63 people are located within the 0.3 mile radius.\n\n4.\tThe General Accident Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention \n\tSteps\n\nMarkWest has taken all the necessary steps to comply with accidental release prevention requirements set forth under 40 CFR Part 68 of the RMP regulations.  The natural gas liquid extraction and storage process at MarkWest is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\nThe following briefly describes the elements of the release prevention program in place at the MarkWest Kenova facility.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nMarkWest maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nMarkWest conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that the hazards associated with the processes at the facility are identified and controlled efficiently.  The HAZOP methodology is used to carry out these analyses.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified person"
