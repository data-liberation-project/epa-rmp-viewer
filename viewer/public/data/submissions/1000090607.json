The Risk Management Plan covers the above process including storage of up to 22 propane railcars, 17x 57,500 gallon propane vessels, approximately 30,240,000-gallons of cavern storage, approximately 1,500 gallons of ethyl mercaptan (used as an odorant), and associated transfer equipment, piping, and instruments.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Buckeye Development and Logistics, LLC - Tuscola Terminal covered process is compliant with the National Fire Protection Association Code #58 for Liquefied Petroleum Gas Storage and it is the Facility's policy to follow the most current editions to the extent feasible and adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and Local codes/laws. If an emergency were to occur, it is the Facility's policy to contact the Tuscola Fire Department and the Douglas County Emergency Management Agency, as appropriate, through the 911 Service.  The primary hospital response is provided through the Douglas County Jarman Memorial Hospital.  The Facility currently maintains a trained incipient stage fire response and first responder-operations level hazardous materials response team to respond to the initial stages of an emergency.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe covered process at Buckeye Development and Logistics, LLC - Tuscola Terminal complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Accident Prevention Rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D- Program Level 3).  Additionally, this plan meets the requirements of the U.S. Department of Labor - Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management regulations (inclusive of all 14 elements) for Highly Hazardous Chemicals (29 CFR Part 1910.119).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Worst Case and Alternate Case release scenarios were evaluated and communicated to the local r"
