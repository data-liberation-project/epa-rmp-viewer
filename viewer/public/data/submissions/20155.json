      "SummaryText": "Because chlorine is covered under OSHA's Hazardous Materials Program (29CFR1910.120), it requires a Haz Mat team to contain a chlorine release. We do not have a Haz Mat Team on the premise. For this reason, we have arranged for a Haz Mat Team to be notified in Gastonia, a neighboring town, should a chlorine release occur.  Jim Pharr, Gaston County's LEPC would also be notified, and would handle the coordination of the Emergency Services involved, in accordance with Paragraph 9.1.a. of EPA's Risk Management Program.  We are currently working with the City of Mount Holly  (of which we are a subsidiary), to fashion a plan for notifying members of the community, in the event of a chlorine release. We expect to have a fully operational plan by March 1, 2000. * We do not perform welding operations at our facility; however the program designated our lack of a date under Hot Work Permits to be a \"record error\". We have, therefore, designated the date of 11/15/99 as the last date on which we issued a Hot Work Permit."
