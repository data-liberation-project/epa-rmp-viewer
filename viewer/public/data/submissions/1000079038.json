The facility is subject to the OSHA and EPA standards because the chlorination process contains a regulated chemical in excess of the OSHA threshold quantity.  Under OSHA Process Safety Management, chlorine is classified as a highly hazardous chemical (HHC) with a threshold quantity of 1,500 pounds, OSHA standard requires regulated facilities to develop comprehensive management programs and emergency action plans.  The effective date for the OSHA Process Safety Management standard was May 26, 1992.\n\nThis facility is also regulated under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program rules (40 CFR 68) as a result of managing chemicals in excess of its Risk Management Program threshold quantity.  Under the EPA rule, chlorine is classified as a regulated substance with a threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds.  The effective date for the EPA rule was June 21, 1999.\n\nAs the major elements of the OSHA and EPA regulations are very similar, WVAW has taken the approach of developing a combined program that accommodates both the OSHA and EPA requirements in an integrated manner. This document provides the program management procedures.\n\n\n\nThe Bluestone Water Treatment Plant has a design capacity of 5.0 MGD.  It is a surface water treatment plan with its source water being the Bluestone River.  The facility is located in Summers County in the State of West Virginia.  The chemical treatment process utilizes the following chemicals:  polyaluminum chloride, chlorine, fluoride, potassium permanganate, corrosion inhibitor, powered activated carbon, sulfur dioxide, sodium hydroxide and non-ionic polymer. \n\n\n\nThe Bluestone Water Treatment Plant uses chlorine for the purpose of disin"

The hazards of this chemical make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in the use and handling to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is WVAW policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends on the manner in which chlorine is handled and used, combined with the safety devices inherent in the design along with operating procedures and the training of our personnel.\n\nThe facility's emergency action plan is based upon OSHA 1910.38 (Employee Emergency Plans) and experience obtained from community emergency response drills.  The facility's emergency response plan is reviewed annually and audited once every 3 years.\n\n\n\nThe Risk Management Plan must be updated and resubmitted every 5 years and within 30 days of any change that requires changing the process hazard analysis, the Offsite Consequence Analysis, or the EPA RMP Prevention Program. If a new regulated chemical is introduced above a threshold quantity, a revised submittal is required no later than the date the chemical is first present. If the inventory of chemicals drops below the EPA RMP thresholds, a revised RMP registration indicating the change must be submitted within 6 months.\n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario at our water treatment facility involves a failure of a single one (1) ton cylinder holding approximately 2,000 lbs of liquefied chlorine gas under pressure, resulting in a release with vaporization of approximately 2,000 pounds of chlorine gas. In this scenario, the chlorine is released as a vaporizing liquid inside a completely enclosed chlorine storage room in our water Chemical Feed building.

According to the software modeling, since this facility is located in a urban area, the toxic cloud potentially formed by the evaporating chlorine should reach nearby public receptors based upon the calculated distance of 0.9 miles to off-site end points.\n\nA below grade trench is provided with floor level grating to collect and contain portions of a liquid release that do not immediately vaporize. Access to the chlorine storage room is electronically controlled and monitored to prevent unauthorized access. WVAW also utilizes the SCADA system to monitor and remotely control the chlorine feed system. \n\n\n\nNumerous administrative controls are in place to prevent a release of this type. Controls include container design, storage, operation, maintenance and inspection; container repair and emergency response equipment; and personnel training conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements, chlorine industry standards and practices, local standard operating procedures, and our company's corporate policies and procedures, which are strictly enforced at the water treatment plant.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur alternative release scenario for chlorine involves a chlorine release of     approximately 317 lbs through the failure of a rupture disk or a relief valve on a vacuum system between the chlorine cylinder and the supply manifold. Though it would be unlikely, a failure of one of these devices could permit the connected container to release a small amount of chlorine gas. Credit is taken in accordance with EPA's simplified approach for the partial containment of chlorine vapor by the room/building enclosure, which mitigates the release. Such building confinement reduces the release rate of chlorine vapor directly to the outdoors.

Therefore, in determining the ARS endpoint distance we have not taken credit for active mitigation provided by engineered safeguards that include chlorine monitors/detectors that automatically activate. The chlorine leak detection system is calibrated to initiate alarms at 1.0 ppm which is lower than industry recommended settings. Some of our additional engineering safeguards are outlined in the following section of this summary and include isolation valves. Isolation valves are provided in the downstream chlorine feed system to isolate downstream chlorine sources.  As stated in the description of the WCS, numerous administrative controls are in place to prevent a release of this type and to provide effective emergency response should one occur.\n\n\n\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our site/facility emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\n\n"
