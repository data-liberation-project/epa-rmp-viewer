      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\nThe City of Katy, Texas has prepared a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the Wastewater Treatment Facility located at 25839 Katy Freeway, Katy, Texas 77493. The purpose of this Plan is to help prevent or minimize risk of exposure to chlorine and sulfur dioxide gas for both employees of the Facility and also the surrounding community.\r\n\r\n1. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\nAccidental releases of chlorine and/or sulfur dioxide are prevented through the use of standardized procedures recommended by the manufacturer.  Only the chlorine and sulfur dioxide supplier will install or remove chlorine and sulfur dioxide containers at the facility.  Plant personnel have been trained in procedures regarding the use of chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  The chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems operate under a vacuum to minimize the potential for release.\r\nThe Facility has implemented written procedures in compliance with the RMP regulations to help minimize the risk of a chlorine and/or sulfur dioxide release. The revised RMP Manual outlines training requirements, operating procedures, maintenance procedures, emergency response policies and defines responsible persons for implementing the aspects of the Plan. The RMP Manual will continue to provide guidance for the Facility's day-to-day operation, thereby creating a safer and more effective work environment.\r\n\r\n2. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\nThe City of Katy Waste Water Treatment Plant has the capacity to treat an average of 3.4 million gallons of wastewater per day. The plant utilizes chlorine gas as a disinfectant and sulfur dioxide for dechlorination. During normal operations, the Facility may have up to 6,000 pounds of chlorine and 6,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide stored at the site.

      "SummaryText": "Environmental Protection Agency Regulation 40 CFR 68. A Facility is required to follow this regulation when it houses more than a threshold quantity of a regulated material for use in a wastewater treatment process. The City of Katy Waste Water Treatment Plant maintains more than the threshold quantity of chlorine(2,500 pounds)and sulfur dioxide (5,000 pounds)on-site at any given time. An RMP update was submitted to the EPA in June of 2009. This edition represents the required five-year update of that earlier Plan.\r\n\r\n3. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nThe City of Katy Waste Water Treatment Plant has been operating for over 35 years with an excellent record for handling and feeding chlorine and sulfur dioxide.

FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nThe Plant has had no accidental releases of either chlorine or sulfur dioxide in the past five years.\r\n\r\n5. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\nThe City has developed an Emergency Action Plan (29 CFR 1910.38) which serves as the Facility Emergency Response Plan.  It addresses the requirements of 40 CFR 68 pertaining to notification, medical treatment, response procedures, planning, use and maintenance of emergency equipment, employee safety training and emergency response evaluation dealing with chlorine and sulfur dioxide gas.   After discovery of a leak, the operator and one other person will make an assessment of the situation.
