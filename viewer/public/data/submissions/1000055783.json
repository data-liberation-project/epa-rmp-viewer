This system consists of 2 Liquid Hydrogen storage tanks at an operating pressure of 110 psig.  These horizontal tanks are connected to a single vaporization/distribution header feeding a customer gas pipeline.  These tanks are periodically filled by liquid Hydrogen transport.  This location is monitored by a remote system (Tracker) and CAPOC (Calumet Area Pipeline Operations Center) Operators.\n\n\n\nRegulated Substances\n\n\n\nThis facility uses, manufactures, or stores a chemical listed in part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, beyond a threshold quantity, as estabvlished by the EPA;\n\nHydrogen - vaporized liquid feed to area pipeline.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Policy\n\n\n\nPraxair is dedicated to being the best performing industrial gas company in all aspects of our business, including safety, health and environmental affairs.  Our safety, health, and environmental policy call for a commitment to protecting the health and safety of our employees, neighbors, and the surrounding environment.  This policy is the basis for engineering and construction programs that produce equipment and process systems that minimize the possibility of accidental chemical releases and operational safety programs that ensure safe operation of our facilities.  Praxair is committed to the continuous improvement of these programs.\n\n\n\nPraxair is an active member of the American Chemistry Council and subscribes to the council's program of Responsible Care, Employee Health and Safety Code of Management Practices.\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nIn accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and EPA's Risk Management Program rule, the Praxair Chesterton Indiana site has a comprehensive accident prevention program in place.  This program is built around process safety concepts such as:\n\n- Technical documentation of Process Safety Information, describing the p"

Following is a description of some of these safety features.\n\n\n\nThe Hydrogen facility is protected by a perimeter fence and keypad entry gate.  Tank levels are constantly monitored by a \"Tracker\" system.  Trained and experienced Customer Service Technicians maintain the Hydrogen storage tanks.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe Chesterton Indiana site accident history indicates continuous safe operation of our covered chemical process over the last five years.  There were no covered process releases that resulted in an EPA RMP recordable accident.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Programs\n\n\n\nPraxair has an emergency response program in place to minimize the effects of accidental release of regulated substances on employees, the public, and the environment.
