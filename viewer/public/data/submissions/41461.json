While meeting our business objectives, our employees strive for safety, health, and environmental excellence in all aspects of Bayer's activities.\n\nWithout exception, every Bayer employee is responsible for working safely.  Safety is the top responsibility at all levels of management and supervision where they are expected to set an example with their own behavior.  The design, operation, maintenance, and regular inspections of Bayer facilities safeguard employees and the public.  Bayer works to make its operations safer by continually improving safety and health measures.\n\n\"Responsible Care\" is a public commitment to which the Bayer Baytown Industrial Park actively supports as a member of the American Chemical Council.  Responsible Care is focused on continuous improvement of health, safety and environmental performance.\n\nThe Bayer Baytown Industrial Park is a \"Super Star\" facility and a Star Among Stars in the OSHA Voluntary Protection Programs. \n\nDescription of the Facility\n\nLocated in West Chambers County on 1,700 acres along Cedar Bayou, Bayer's first operating units came on line in 1971 with steady growth continuing over the next 30+ years.  The site doubled its manufacturing capacity between 1997 and 2001 with Bayer's largest-ever capital expansion ($1.4 billion). Known today as a thriving industrial park, approximately 35% of the Bayer acreage are developed.  Bayer hosts four guest facilities (Borden Chemical, El Dorado Nitrogen, First Chemical Texas, and Texas Brine) to provide raw materials for the facility and one energy center (Calpine Corporation) to produce steam and electricity for the entire complex.\n\nRecently, a portion of the corporation including several Baytown units, separated to become a "

The management team at Bayer Baytown has designated the entire site as a Process Safety Management site.  All processes are covered at the full PSM level and are considered to be Program Level III processes under the scope of Risk Management.\n\nThere are five chemicals that are used in quantities greater than the threshold quantities as defined in the RMP regulations:\n* Ammonia\n* Chlorine\n* Formaldehyde solution (37%)\n* Phosgene\n* Toluene diisocyanate (mixed isomer form).\n\nTwo other chemicals (anhydrous hydrogen chloride and hydrogen) are used at the Baytown site that are covered in the RMP regulation but exist in quantities significantly less than threshold quantities.\n\nManagement of Risk\n\nThe site is covered by Process Safety Management (PSM).  PSM elements are:\n\nEmployee Participation:\nEmployees participate on numerous safety steering committees that potentially affect the work life of each area at the Bayer Baytown site.  Action items that are identified from inspections, incidents, process hazards analyses, etc. are provided to employees for review.  Involvement of personnel in the OSHA-VPP program has been exceptional.\n\nProcess Safety Information:\nAll site personnel have access to the company's electronic mail system and Intranet.

The information resides in a controlled electronic system that is updated regularly.  All Process Safety Information (PSI) is verified at each scheduled process hazards analysis.\n\nProcess Hazards Analysis:\nEvery five years, process hazards analyses (PHA's) are conducted in each process.  The HazOp method is used to conduct PHA's.  Findings are identified, prioritized and then promptly corrected.  The information is shared with personnel who are impacted by the findings.  The action items and completion schedules are available through the electronic system.\n\nOperating Procedures:\nOperating procedures that address normal and abnormal operating situations are in place.  Deviations from established operating limits and the consequences of these deviations are clearly identified and easily referenced.   The procedures are reviewed annually to assure accuracy.\n\nTraining:\nTraining on these operating procedures is ongoing to assure that operators know and understand the safe operation of their unit and that they understand the necessary actions for abnormal situations.  Employee training is documented and tracked through a network system.  The system allows specific training needs to be identified as well as tracks the completion of required modules. \n\nContractor Safety:\nControl of contractor activity in operating areas is well established.  A safety steering committee and safety council actively monitors the actions of contractors to assure their safety, the safety of the Bayer facility and its employees. Contract employees are required to participate annually in comprehensive industry safety training. \n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews:\nReviews are conducted of any new facility, major modification, or a change (management of change) before the new system can become operational.

All aspects of hot work and abnormal situations are controlled.\n\nManagement of Change:\nThe proper management of change generates appropriate assessment of possible impacts on the level of safety and health on an area.  All impacted documents and procedures are altered as required.  Appropriate personnel are informed regarding changes before they operate the new system.\n\nIncident Investigations:\nIncidents, injuries and near-miss situations are investigated.

There have been no RMP-defined accidents with either onsite or offsite injury or damage in the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nBayer MaterialScience Baytown maintains a trained emergency response team on site at all times.  Each shift has an emergency response team with up-to-date training.  There are emergency medical technicians on each shift and an ambulance and fire truck staged for their immediate use.  An auxiliary trailer has additional equipment (air bottles, escape equipment, etc.) for immediate access during emergencies.\n\nThe emergency team includes members who have completed requirements for hazard materials (HazMat) response. Equipment for emergency HazMat use has been prepared for this facility.  \n\nThere is a designated organization that responds during daytime emergencies and off-shift emergencies.
