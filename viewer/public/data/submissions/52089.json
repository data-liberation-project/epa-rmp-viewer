As part of that commitment, we have implemented safety, environmental protection, and risk management programs to prevent any accidental releases of hazardous materials.\n\nThe Dogwood Energy Facility (Plant) maintains one substance, anhydrous ammonia, on site in amounts exceeding the RMP rule threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds. The Plant stores anhydrous ammonia in an 18,190 gallon storage tank with administrative controls limiting the tank level to 80% capacity (i.e. 75,670 pounds). \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as an air pollution control system additive, to minimize the formation of nitrogen oxides in combustion turbine flue gas emissions. The Plant is a combined cycle electric generating plant, consisting of two combustion turbines with heat recovery system and a common steam turbine generator. Each combustion turbine is equipped with a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system. Part of the SCR system is the anhydrous ammonia tank, piping and associated equipment which are addressed in this Risk Management Plan. \n\nThe Plant is also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (codified in 29 CFR 1910.119) because it stores greater than 10,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. As such, the facility is required to have a PSM program, which is essentially equivalent to the RMP prevention program. \n\nPLANT DESCRIPTION The Plant is located in Cass County, Missouri, at 25111 E. 175th Street, Pleasant Hill. The facility is located approximately 1.5-miles west of downtown Pleasant Hill and 1-mile east of the intersection of State Highway BB and E. 175th Street. The property immediately surrounding the power plant is unimproved or used for agricultural purposes. The topography is generally hilly with small pockets of woodlands along fence rows and hollows. \n\nAMMONIA SYSTEM DESCRIPTION"

      "SummaryText": "The ammonia unloading and storage system is composed of four (4) major components: a tanker truck unloading station, ammonia storage tank, ammonia vaporization skid, and SCR equipment. The tanker truck unloading station is designed to provide a safe means of linking the ammonia delivery truck to the storage tank for the transfer of ammonia. One 18,190-gallon horizontal tank is provided for anhydrous ammonia storage. The tank is situated in a concrete dike. In the event that the ambient temperature outside the tank falls below a temperature that will generate enough heat to provide the required ammonia flow rate the SCR system requires, an ammonia vaporizer skid provides additional heating to keep an adequate vapor supply from the storage tank. Ammonia vapors drawn from the tank are regulated for pressure, mixed with air, and injected into the combustion turbine flue gases within each respective ammonia injection grid. In combination with the catalyst in the SCR unit, nitrogen oxides are reacted and emissions of the pollutant are reduced. \n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO \nThe worst case release scenario for ammonia was identified as the loss of the contents of the entire 18,190-gallon tank as a gas in accordance with the definition provided in the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidance for RMP development. As allowed in 40 CFR Part 68.25 (b)(1) of the RMP rule, the administratively controlled maximum tank level of 80% liquid by volume was taken into consideration in the evaluation of this release. The conditions of the scenario, such as release time and weather status are those specified in the EPA Off-Site Consequence Analysis Guidance. The distance of potential impact was determined using RMP*Comp modeling software provided by EPA. This distance and a list of the types of receptors in a circle constituting the potential impact area are provided to EPA elsewhere in the RMP submittal. In the event of a release, it is expected that an ammonia plume would disper"

The likelihood of such an incident occurring is extremely low. EPA release reporting databases and industry experience suggest that the worst-case release scenario as defined in the RMP regulations is so unlikely that it should not be used as the basis for emergency planning.  A more reasonable potential release scenario for emergency planning is presented in The alternative release scenario(s) section below. Anhydrous ammonia tanks are installed with multiple safety systems to prevent the release of an entire tank in a single event.  \n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO \nThe alternative release scenario is, by definition, a more likely release scenario than the worst case. Engineered controls, such as automatic shut-off valves, check valves, relief valves, ammonia vapor leak detection system and alarms are considered in the analysis.\n\nThe type of system failure identified for the alternative release was a loss of ammonia caused by a major leak in the liquid piping network between the storage tank and the vaporizers. As a conservative estimate, the rate of release was assumed to be the maximum flow rate that would not cause the tank liquid excess flow valves to automatically shut. The leak was assumed to continue until the sounding of the ammonia vapor detector alarm, at which time the operator would be alerted to check the ammonia system. The main isolation valve would then be closed, manually if safe to do so. If the ammonia vapor concentration proved unsafe for facility response, the Pleasant Hill Fire Department would be called to respond to the emergency. The worst case time from leak detection to complete response for the Fire Department in the alternate release scenario was estimated to be 45 minutes.  The results of the process hazard analysis (P"

Based on this commitment, the Plant Manager has assumed overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the Risk Management Program.  The Plant staff has clearly defined accountability and responsibility for each of the prevention program elements to meet both EPA and OSHA Process Safety Management requirements.\n\nTo ensure that a worst-case or alternative release scenario does not occur, Dogwood Energy Facility maintains a release prevention program with the primary focus of protecting the public and plant employees from the hazards associated with an accident or release involving anhydrous ammonia.  The multifaceted program includes:\n\n\u00c2\u00bf\tAmmonia gas detectors and alarms to rapidly alert operators to any problems.\n\n\u00c2\u00bf\tProcess Safety Information is compiled to document the safe process design.\n\n\u00c2\u00bf\tInitial and periodic process hazard analysis is conducted on the ammonia system using a Hazard and Operability Analysis (HAZOP) type safety review to evaluate chemical and process hazards associated with the system design and operation.
