If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  Access to the site is restricted to authroized faciltiy employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 84,000 pounds.\n\n3.  The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 84,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint of .14mg/L for the worst-case scenario is .89 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario based on the most likey potential incident is a release froma  break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint of .14 mg/L for the alternative scenario is .19 miles.  This release has the possibility of extending beyond the facility boundary.\n\n4.  This facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted by the state regulation and the standards of the U S Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA, 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n5.  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past"

The facility has:\n     - a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n     - provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n     - a written emergency response plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7.  Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no specific safey recommendations for implementation at this time."
