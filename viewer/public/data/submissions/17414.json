Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Union Carbide Texas City Plant is committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We have implemented a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well to protect the environment.  These programs include both Union Carbide's Responsible CareR requirements and governmental requirements, such as the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.\n\n2.\tDescription of the Facility and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Union Carbide Texas City Plant is a manufacturing facility that annually produces more than 5 billion pounds of  chemical products in its various operating units.  Most are intermediates used in other Union Carbide processes, or sold to customers who convert them into finished products.  The RMP rule requires that if a facility, such as the Texas City Plant, has a specific amount (threshold) or more of any one of 140 toxic and flammable chemicals, the facility must follow the RMP rule requirements for that chemical.  The Union Carbide Texas City Plant has the following RMP-regulated toxic substances in quantities above the threshold: \n7 Vinyl Acetate\n7 Chlorine\n7 Isopropyl chloroformate\n7 Ethylene Oxide\n\nThe plant has the following RMP-regulated flammable substances in quantities above the threshold:\n7 1,3-Butadiene\n7 Propylene\n7 Ethane\n7 Methane\n7 Propane\n7 Ethylene\n7 Hydrogen\n7 Ethyl ether\n7 Vinyl chloride\n\n3.\tKey Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\nEPA\u0012s RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenario(s) and alternative release scenario(s) for our facility.

Specific steps to prevent this scenario from occurring, and to mitigate its effects should they occur, include:\n7 Equipment Design and Construction:  Design and construction codes and standards are met or exceeded.\n7 Gas Detection Devices and Alarms: The  process area is equipped with gas detection devices and alarms.\n7 Surveillance: The process is monitored by computers and trained, certified operators.\n7 Emergency Response Plans: Emergency response plans are current and drills are performed and critiqued.\n7 Emergency Response Personnel and Equipment: An Emergency Director is on site and trained emergency responders and mobile fire protection equipment available.\n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\nOur general accident prevention program consists of compliance with the EPA RMP rule and OSHA's PSM standard and implementation of Union Carbide's Operational Safety Program and Episodic Risk Management System.  Key elements include:\nEquipment Design:  Vessels (including shipping containers) and other process equipment are designed according to recognized industry standards and/or governmental requirements.\nProcess Safety Information: Chemical hazard, process technology, and equipment information is documented, maintained up-to-date, and available to operating personnel.\nProcess Hazard Anal"

      "SummaryText": "ysis:  Process hazard analyses are conducted every five years to identify major process hazard scenarios and to recommend corrective action(s) needed to prevent their occurrence.\nEpisodic Risk Management:  Periodic reviews are conducted to identify hazards which could have significant community impact and to recommend corrective action(s) needed to prevent their occurrence.  These reviews utilize advanced quantitative risk assessment techniques.\nOperational Safety Standards:  Design requirements for active and passive mitigation controls used to prevent major process hazards are documented in operational safety standards.\nOperating Procedures:  Operating procedures provide detail on how to safely operate a process and are maintained up-to-date.\nOperator Training/Certification Program:  The plant has a training and testing program which provides operators with the proper skills and knowledge prior to allowing them to independently operate a process.\nTechnical Staff Training and Support:  Trained technical staff employees are available 24 hours a day to support operations.\nMaintenance Procedures:  The plant has specific procedures for maintaining process equipment so that it operates safely.\nMaintenance Training:  The plant trains persons who perform routine or complex maintenance tasks on process equipment.\nMechanical Integrity Program:  Vessels (including shipping containers) and other process equipment are periodically tested and/or inspected to ensure safe operation of process equipment, following recognized industry standards and/or governmental requirements.\nManagement of Change:  The plant has a management system to ensure that modified facilities and processes will be safe to operate.\nPre-startup Safety Reviews:  Reviews are conducted just prior to startup to ensure that modified facilities and processes are safe for operation.\nIncident Investigation:  The plant has a program to ensure that accidents and incidents are properly investigated to determine the cau"

This Program includes accountabilities for timely and proper implementation of the program elements.\n\nThese general prevention elements and the chemical-specific steps discussed in the previous section are parts of an overall management system to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standards that these management systems set.  We have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\n5.\tFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no releases of RMP covered chemicals at the Texas City Plant in the past five years that resulted in known off-site death, injury, evacuation, shelter-in-place, property damage or environmental damage. The following incidents meet the EPA Risk Management Program reporting requirements with respect to on-site injuries involving a release of a RMP covered chemical:\n\n11/4/94\tAn employee experienced irritation of the face and  shoulder after exposure to \nliquid vinyl acetate spray.  The employee showered and changed clothing and returned to work.\n\n12/29/95\tAn employee exp"
