Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Union Carbide Texas City Plant is committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We have implemented a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well to protect the environment.  These programs include both Union Carbide's Responsible CareR requirements and governmental requirements, such as the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.\n\n2.    Description of the Facility and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Union Carbide Texas City Plant is a manufacturing facility that annually produces more than 5 billion pounds of  chemical products in its various operating units.  Most are intermediates used in other Union Carbide processes, or sold to customers who convert them into finished products.  The RMP rule requires that if a facility, such as the Texas City Plant, has a specific amount (threshold) or more of any one of 140 toxic and flammable chemicals, the facility must follow the RMP rule requirements for that chemical.  The Union Carbide Texas City Plant has the following RMP-regulated toxic substances in quantities above the threshold: \n7 Vinyl Acetate\n7 Chlorine\n7 Isopropyl chloroformate\n7 Ethylene Oxide\n\nThe plant has the following RMP-regulated flammable substances in quantities above the threshold:\n7 1,3-Butadiene\n7 Propylene\n7 Ethane\n7 Methane\n7 Propane\n7 Ethylene\n7 Hydrogen\n7 Ethyl ether\n7 Vinyl chloride\n\n3.    Key Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\nEPAs RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenario(s) and alternative release scenario(s) for our facility.

EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Texas City Plant maintains a written emergency response program to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to  releases of hazardous substances, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including:\n7 Proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures\n7 Evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation\n7 Notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs\n7 Post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements, and\n7 Inspecting, testing, maintaining, and using emergency response equipment.\nThe emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes. \n\nThe Texas City Plant maintains a trained emergency squad to handle fires, explosions, toxic vapor releases, spills, and medical emergencies.  The plant squad trains and drills with local emergency responders to enhance their skills and tactics for responding to an accidental chemical release.  Critiques are held on drills and actual events.  In addition to the plant emergency squad, Union Carbide's Hazardous Emergency Leaks Prevention (HELP ) team responds to accidental releases from transportation incidents occurring in the continental U.S.\n\nThe emerg"
