Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Union Carbide Texas City Plant is committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We have implemented a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well to protect the environment.  These programs include both Union Carbide's Responsible CareR requirements and governmental requirements, such as the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.\n\n2.    Description of the Facility and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Union Carbide Texas City Plant is a manufacturing facility that annually produces more than 5 billion pounds of  chemical products in its various operating units.  Most are intermediates used in other Union Carbide processes, or sold to customers who convert them into finished products.  The RMP rule requires that if a facility, such as the Texas City Plant, has a specific amount (threshold) or more of any one of 140 toxic and flammable chemicals, the facility must follow the RMP rule requirements for that chemical.  The Union Carbide Texas City Plant has the following RMP-regulated toxic substances in quantities above the threshold: \n7 Vinyl Acetate\n7 Chlorine\n7 Isopropyl chloroformate\n7 Ethylene Oxide\n\nThe plant has the following RMP-regulated flammable substances in quantities above the threshold:\n7 1,3-Butadiene\n7 Propylene\n7 Ethane\n7 Methane\n7 Propane\n7 Ethylene\n7 Hydrogen\n7 Ethyl ether\n7 Vinyl chloride\n\n3.    Key Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\nEPAs RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenario(s) and alternative release scenario(s) for our facility.

Rail cars are specifically designed for ethylene oxide. \n7 Equipment Operating Standards: There are multiple levels of protection to prevent a back flow situation involving railcars that include check valves and differential pressure trips. Operating pressures also provide an inherent protection against reverse flow. \n7 Surveillance:.  The process is monitored by trained, certified operators.

This Program includes accountabilities for timely and proper implementation of the program elements.\n\nThese general prevention elements and the chemical-specific steps discussed in the previous section are parts of an overall management system to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standards that these management systems set.  We have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\n5.    FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no releases of RMP covered chemicals at the Texas City Plant in the past five years that resulted in known off-site death, injury, evacuation, shelter-in-place, property damage or environmental damage. The following incidents meet the EPA Risk Management Program reporting requirements with respect to on-site injuries involving a release of a RMP covered chemical:\n\n11/4/94    An employee experienced irritation of the face and  shoulder after exposure to \nliquid vinyl acetate spray.

EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Texas City Plant maintains a written emergency response program to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to  releases of hazardous substances, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including:\n7 Proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures\n7 Evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation\n7 Notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs\n7 Post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements, and\n7 Inspecting, testing, maintaining, and using emergency response equipment.\nThe emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes. \n\nThe Texas City Plant maintains a trained emergency squad to handle fires, explosions, toxic vapor releases, spills, and medical emergencies.  The plant squad trains and drills with local emergency responders to enhance their skills and tactics for responding to an accidental chemical release.  Critiques are held on drills and actual events.  In addition to the plant emergency squad, Union Carbide's Hazardous Emergency Leaks Prevention (HELP ) team responds to accidental releases from transportation incidents occurring in the continental U.S.\n\nThe emerg"

PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nOn-going programs, such as process hazard analysis reevaluations, continually aim to improve process safety.  The following is a list of specific improvements that we are planning to implement at the Texas City Plant to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\n7 A new Corporate program that uses semi-quantitative assessment techniques in process hazard analyses to ensure that controls used for prevention or mitigation of hazards provide adequate protection\n7 A new Corporate program designed to ensure that process safety information is kept up-to-date.\n7 An updated Corporate program that improves procedures and standards for safely handling spills of flammable materials.\n7 An updated Corporate program that improves procedures and standards for small sample shipping.\n7 Union Carbide continues to implement a corporate-wide strategy to avoid computer hardware and software systems operating disruptions due to the year 2000 changeover.  The latest information on the company's Y2K efforts can be found on our Internet site -- www.unioncarbide.com. This information will be periodically updated through first quarter 2000.\n\n\n\n\n"
