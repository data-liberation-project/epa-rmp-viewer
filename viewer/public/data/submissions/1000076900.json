      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary for Trinseo, Dalton, GA Site\r\n\r\nThis plan is being updated for the following reasons:\r\n\r\na)\tIn accordance with EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Regulations at 40 CFR part 68, the owner or operator of an RMP facility must update and resubmit their RMP at least once every 5 years.\r\n\r\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nTrinseo, Dalton, GA Site is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release does occur, our well-trained personnel will take actions to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also coordinated with The Whitfield County Fire and Sheriff Departments, both of whom we rely upon for additional emergency response expertise.\r\n\r\n2. The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\nTrinseo manufactures latex for primary distribution into the paper and carpet industries. This facility is located at 1468 Prosser Drive, S.E., approximately 10 miles south of the town of Dalton, GA. The facility leases a portion of the property to The Dow Chemical Company for the manufacturing of Styrofoam board which is used predominately in the construction industry as an insulating material. The site has 3 regulated substances present at the facility. These substances include 1,3-Butadiene, Vinylidene Chloride [Ethene, 1,1-dichloro-], and Ammonia Solution (30%).  These substances are used as raw materials at the Latex Manufacturing plant in the production of latex.\r\n\r\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nThe facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the acciden"

The facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements. The facility has an air operating permit ID under Title V of the Clean Air Act. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at the stationary source.\r\n\r\na. Process Safety Information: The Dalton Facility maintains a record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes.\r\n\r\nb. Process Hazard Analysis: The Dalton Facility has an active Process Hazard Analysis program to identify, evaluate, and control the hazards of the processes. Plant management is also responsible for the documentation and follow-up of action items from these reviews.  Trinseo Environmental, Health, and Safety (EH&S) requirements specify that risk assessment or analysis be used to evaluate hazard potentials of all installations. Trinseo Hazard Analysis programs were instituted and operational prior to the issue of RMP. In particular, the programs listed below constitute the Trinseo interpretation of a Process Hazard Analysis:\r\ni.\tReactive Chemical Review\r\nii.\tFire & Explosion Index (F&EI)\r\niii.\tChemical Exposure Index (CEI)\r\niv.\tLayers of Protection Analysis (LOPA)\r\nThese studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, process safety, and process operations are revalidated at a regular interval. \r\n\r\nc. Operating Procedures: For the purposes of safely conducting activities within the covered processes, the Dalton facility maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround. The procedures"

Training: The Dalton facility has a comprehensive training program to ensure employees who are operating processes or newly assigned to the process are trained in an overview of the process and are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Refresher training is provided every three years and more frequently as needed.\r\n\r\ne. Mechanical Integrity : The Dalton facility carries out a highly documented Planned Preventative Maintenance Program (PPM) which provides checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. The facility follows Trinseo's Global Mechanical Integrity Safety Standard (GMISS) which details testing, inspection, and repair requirements. Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, control, and pumps and compressors. Maintenance and installation activities are carried out by qualified personnel. Any equipment deficiencies identified by these tests and/or inspections are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\nf. Management of Change: The Dalton facility requires management of all modifications to process equipment, procedures, process chemicals and process conditions other than like for like, by identifying and reviewing the change prior to implementation. The Management of Change policy ensures that all changes have appropriate reviews and approvals, training is conducted, documentation is in place, and appropriate communication to affected personnel is completed.\r\n\r\ng. Pre-startup Reviews: Pre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and significant modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular prac"

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures, and training are adequate and in place prior to putting the change in service.\r\n\r\nh. Compliance Audits: The Dalton facility participates in numerous program audits, assessments and reviews. The facility  is audited by qualified Trinseo internal auditors in conjunction with the Trinseo Environmental, Health and Safety (EH&S) Integrated Audit Program. These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are completed in a safe and prompt manner. \r\n\r\ni. Incident Investigation: The Dalton facility promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the root cause of the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the incident from reoccurring. All incident investigation reports are retained for 5 years.\r\n\r\nj. Employee Participation: It is important to the Dalton facility that employees understand and actively participate in the plant safety programs and utilize the tools available to assist with the safety programs.  The facility has an empowered work force and employees actively support and participate in plant safety programs. Employee participation is the key to a safe work environment at Dalton.  For example, employees participate in goal setting activities, Environmental, Health, and Safety (EH&S) teams, submitting safety suggestions, accident investigations, developing and reviewing operating procedures, Process Hazard Analysis reviews, management of change, pre-startup safety reviews etc. In addition, employees have access to all information created as part of the facility implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses.\r\n\r\nk.

Contract employees are informed of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the process. This information is shared via safety indoctrinations as well as safe work permitting. Contractors are also informed of emergency response procedures and plan should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\r\n\r\n4. Five-year Accident History\r\nTrinseo, Dalton, GA Site has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years. Due to the stringent release prevention policies, there have been no accidental releases as defined by the RMP rule of regulated substances during this period.\r\n\r\n5. Emergency Response Program\r\nTrinseo, Dalton, GA Site has a written emergency response plan and procedures addressing accidental releases of regulated substances. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, use of emergency response equipment, emergency response training, notification to local emergency response agencies and the public, evacuations, as well as post-incident remediation of affected areas.\r\n\r\nTo ensure proper functioning, the emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and maintained.
