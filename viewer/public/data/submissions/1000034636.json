The City's accidental release prevention program integrates management practices, safety procedures, employee participation, process safety and operating information, process hazard analysis, compliance auditing, pre-start up safety reviews, mechanical integrity, management of change procedures, incident investigation, emergency planning and response, and updating practices and procedures. The facility is applicable to and this program is based on Program 3 risk management requirements. The emergency response program is tailored to the facility's operations with respect to the available emergency responders and the Defiance County LEPC, includes emergency notification as well as plant evacuation procedures.\n\n\n\nThere are two covered processes involved at the WPCP. One is the storage of chlorine and sulfur dioxide containers and the second is the feeding of chlorine and sulfur dioxide to the WPCP effluent.\n\nThe chlorination system for the WPCP is used to disinfect wastewater prior to discharge to the Maumee River. The chlorination facilities include outside storage for one-ton containers, a chlorine scale and feed room, various safety equipment and controls, two chlorinators, the necessary cylinder handling equipment, a chlorine gas alarm system and a residual chlorine analyzer. Normally chlorine is supplied from two one-ton containers connected to the process feed piping. The cylinders in service are controlled automatically using a switchover device that limits the operation to a single cylinder at any time. Plant operators check the operation of the chlorination system at least once each shift and respond to trouble or warning alarms, promptly.\n\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE A"

Predictive release information was obtained using EPA's RMP*Comp model to identify the distance to endpoint for a potential chlorine release. The worst-case scenario involves a failure or rupture of a one-ton container releasing the entire contents of the container within ten minutes. The distance to the end point is estimated to be 1.3 miles from the chlorination facilities assuming a wind speed of 1.5 meters/second and atmospheric stability class F. The endpoint determination assumes outdoor storage of the container. The potential population affected by the worst-case scenario is estimated to be 770 persons. \n\n\n\nThe alternate release scenario involves a potential pipe leak where 1,845 pounds of chlorine gas may be released during a 15-minute accidental release. The distance to endpoint is estimated to be 0.2 miles from the chlorination facilities assuming a wind speed of 3.0 meters/second and atmospheric stability class D. The endpoint determination includes enclosure of the container within the scale and feed room. The potential population affected by the alternate release scenario is estimated to be 5 persons.\n\n\n\nActuation of the chlorine gas detectors is considered to be an active mitigation measure. Additionally, the chlorine gas piping is vacuum tube connected directly to the chlorine gas header. A loss of vacuum in the tubing immediately stops the flow of chlorine gas from the header and reduces the possibility of a chlorine release due to a piping leak.\n\nThe dechlorination system for the Defiance WPC is used to dechlorinate wastewater using sulfur dioxide gas prior to discharge to the Maumee River. The dechlorination facilities include outside storage of one-ton containers, a sulfur dioxide scale and feed room, various safety equipment and controls, two sulfinators, the necessary cylinder handling eq"

On June 6th, 2011, a faulty cylinder stem caused approximately 8 pounds of sulfur dioxide to be released. Emergency responders were notified and a bonnet was placed on the sulfur dioxide tank to stop the leak. One employee was sent to the hospital for observation, but no injuries occurred. The emergency response plan was revised to include procedures to only allow emergency response vehicles entry to the plant during an emergency situation. The entrance will be blocked to visitors and contractors. Additionally, repair kits were moved to another building to allow for easier access during emergency situations. \n\n\n\nAn emergency response program has been established and coordinated with the Defiance County LEPC. The program includes plant evacuation procedures, emergency notification procedures for responders, and a notification plan. Plant evacuation drills are performed in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.38. Emergency response drills are performed in accordance with LEPC schedules. No recommendations for change from the process hazard analysis and the compliance audit were identified from these activities. \n\n\n\nKEY ELEMENTS\n\nThe WPCP RMP's key elements are listed below. These elements are aimed at preventing a chlorine or sulfur dioxide release from the chlorination and dechlorination systems:\n\n?    High level operator training and maintenance training;\n\n?    An established preventative maintenance program;\n\n?    Implementation of an audit and inspection program;\n\n?    Use of effective written operating procedures;\n\n?
