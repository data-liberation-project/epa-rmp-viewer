Cybertech GSP's Taylors, South Carolina facility has implemented the requirements of the Risk Management Program (RMP) herein described in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.  The objective of this program is to minimize the potential of a release involving a hazardous material and if a release occurs, to minimize the impact to Cybertech GSP employees, the community, and the environment.  Cybertech GSP achieves this objective through the use of good engineering practices, established operating procedures, providing appropriate training to employees, and coordinating response activities with local emergency response providers.  Cybertech GSP\u00bfs management is committed to providing the resources necessary to implement this program and achieve the objectives established within 40 CFR Part 68.\n\n\nFacility Description\n\nCybertech GSP is located at 1116 Tanner Road in Taylors,  Greenville County, South Carolina.  The facility operates as a specialty chemical manufacturer under the NAICS code of 32521.  Vinyl Acetate is utilized at the facility in sufficient quantity to be subject to the RMP requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.  The facility utilizes best management practices for vinyl acetate and additional chemicals that are not subject to the RMP provisions.\n\n\nConsequence Analysis\n\nAn Offsite Consequences Analysis (OCA) has been performed for the worst-case release scenario and one alternative release scenario for the regulated chemical and process. \n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nRohm and Haas Company, the former owner of the facility, reported no records of releases of vinyl acetate within the last five years from the Taylors facility that met the reportable release definition contained in the U.S. EP RMP rule.  Furthermore, no vinyl acetate releases have occurred under Cybertech GSP ownership facility that mee"

As such, Program 3 requirements of the RMP apply to the Taylors, South Carolina facility.\n\n\nEmergency Response\n\nCybertech GSP has established emergency response and notification procedures for accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The emergency response procedures include elements for response actions for different accidental release scenarios based upon the threat to human health and the environment.   Any accidental release with the potential to cause offsite impacts will be communicated with the surrounding community, while methods of communication are determined on a case by case basis."
