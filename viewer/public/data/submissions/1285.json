SPS takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at all of its facilities by ensuring that its employees are properly trained in the safe operation of covered processes and the safe handling of treatment chemicals.  As for emergency response, SPS has established and maintained procedures for emergency notification and response.  These are reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and revised to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur.\n\nSPS management understands its duty to provide a safe working environment and to take measures to prevent accidents that may have an effect on the surrounding community.  This understanding is reflected in procedures described and referenced in the RMP manual.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\nCunningham Station is a natural gas-burning electric generating station.  The regulated substance handled at this facility is chlorine.  The chlorine is used for cooling and drinking water biocidal control and is stored in one-ton containers with a maximum intended inventory of 2 containers on site, and is stored in 150 lb. cylinders with a maximum inventory of 2 containers on site, respectively.\n\nRelease Scenarios\nWorst-case and alternative release scenarios have been determined after careful review of the regulation and consideration of the storage vessel configuration at the facility.  For worst-case release scenario, the regulation is clear.  The assumption is that the single largest container of a regulated substance (one-ton container of chlorine) is released over a ten-minute period.  No active mitigation may be considere"

      "SummaryText": "d.  Worst-case meteorological conditions are also assumed to be present.  The RMP*Comp air dispersion model was used to determine distances to toxic endpoints.  For chlorine, a distance of 3.0 miles to the toxic endpoint was determined for a release of 2000 pounds in ten minutes. \n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine consists of a release of 313 pounds of chlorine over a one-hour period due to a severed 5/16 inch valve on the one-ton container.  No active mitigation devices were considered to influence the release scenario.  A distance of 0.1 miles to the toxic endpoint was determined.\n\nPrevention Steps for Chlorine System\nThe prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are described in detail in the Cunningham Station Chlorine System PSM/RMP manual.  The prevention programs include the following elements:\n7 Employee participation, which includes provisions for active participation by plant employees in the development and implementation of the plant PSM/RMP programs, as well as ready access to program information\n7 Process safety information, which has been collated into the PSM/RMP manuals located in the Cunningham Station Facility Safety Specialist's office\n7 Process hazard analysis (PHA) - A PHA for the chlorine system was conducted in February 1999.  All recommendations from the PHA have been, or are in the process of being, addressed.\n7 Operating procedures for the chlorine process, which are included in the system PSM/RMP manuals\n7 Training for all personnel involved in the operation and maintenance of the chlorine system\n7 Contractor management policy, which is not to allow contractors to operate or maintain the chlorine system\n7 Pre-startup safety review procedure for implementation for significant system changes to ensure that the construction and equipment installation is according to design specifications, appropriate procedures are in place and accurate, a PHA has been done and the recommendations resolved, and employees are trai"

The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect personnel and regulatory changes.\n\nPlanned Changes for Improved Safety\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees.  Employee safety meetings that focus on chemical safety issues are held regularly at this facility.  Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards.\n\nDuring the development of the Cunningham Station PSM/RMP program, process hazard analyses were conducted with key employees to meet the prevention program requirements.  During these sessions, recommendations were made for the purpose of improving safety and preventing accidental chemical releases.  Each recommendation has been or will be considered for implementation.  Though not all recommendations may be implemented, all will be considered.  The exercise has provided all affected employees with a heightened awareness of safety issues related to the covered processes."
