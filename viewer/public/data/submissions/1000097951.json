The management and employees of the Guayanilla facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous Ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the community and the environment.\n\n \n\nA description of operations is as follows:\n\n\n\nCylinder: The Guayanilla facility repackages compressed gases either in pure form or in the form of gas mixtures. Pumps, compressors or partial pressures are utilized to transfer products from one container to another. All containers in which products are stored and transported are Department of Transportation (DOT, TC) approved containers either cylinders or cryogenic containers (i.e. dewar's). After filling, these cylinders are stored or delivered directly to customers. \n\n\n\nASU: This facility produces liquid nitrogen and oxygen, which are manufactured by low temperature distillation of liquid air. Atmospheric air is filtered then compressed. This high-pressure air is chilled. The chilled air enters a distillation column where the air is fractionally distilled at very low temperature into its components: oxygen, nitrogen, argon, etc. The heat exchanger and distillation column are housed in a structure known as a cold box. Product is delivered to the customer by transport trailers in liquid form. \n\n\n\nISO Containers: The Guayanilla facility receives anhydrous ammonia in ISO Containers for storing at a designated area to transported and delivered directly to the customers. Ammonia is only storing at the facility.\n\n \n\nThe worst-case scenario, based on the EPA's definition for a toxic gas release and the alternate release scenarios were conducted and endpoints were determined using EPAs RMPComp*."

These include emergency response plan and a preventive maintenance schedule for the system, and safeties. \n\n \n\nThe facility has developed a comprehensive prevention program designed to prevent accidental releases of Ammonia.  The program utilizes state-of-the-art technology, sound engineering practices, administrative controls and active employee participation.  Employees serve on task groups and teams in developing and maintaining risk management program elements.  They are frequently consulted concerning the various aspects of the program and ways to continually improve the safety of the process.  \n\n\n\nWritten process safety information was developed for the Ammonia system to enable managers, supervisors, and employees to identify and understand the process hazards.  This information was utilized to develop a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) which assists management and employees in making decisions for improving safety and reducing the consequences of releases of Ammonia. The PHA focuses attention on equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions, (routine and nonroutine), and external factors that might impact the process by identifying potential failure points or failure modes in the process. The PHA will be updated at least every 5 years. \n\n \n\nDetailed operating procedures exist which describe tasks to be performed, dates to be recorded, operating conditions to be maintained, and safety and health precautions to be taken.  The procedures were reviewed/approved to ensure they are technically accurate by employees, managers and personnel with the technical expertise/knowledge of the process.  The operating procedures are annually reviewed/revised as necessary to reflect current operations.\n\n \n\nEmployees are thoroughly trained, including maintenance and contractor employees."

Training includes operating procedures, safe work practices, emergency procedures (including alarms), special assignments, evacuation and emergency response; safety rules and procedures; routine and nonroutine work authorization; and other pertinent process safety information.  Each employee trained has a defined and documented program based on their job duties.  The training goals and objectives have been established and written in clear and measurable terms.  Hands-on training is provided to employees to enhance their senses beyond listening.  In addition, employees receive traditional classroom instruction computer assisted training (IMSS), videos, programmed and on-the-job instruction.  Employees are encouraged to actively participate.  The employees are periodically evaluated to ensure they possess the necessary skills and knowledge via a computer-based system call TRACCESS which includes written tests, observation and/or oral interviews.\n\n \n\nA contractor screening process has been established and is designed to ensure that contractors hired or used can accomplish their assigned tasks without compromising the safety and health of employees and the public.   The screening program involves obtaining information on the contractor's safety performance, including injury and illness rates, and experience.  In addition, the contractor's safety performance, job skills, knowledge, and certifications (such as pressure vessel welders) are also verified. \n\n \n\nPre-Start-up Safety Reviews (PSSR) are used for new or modified processes to improve the design and construction of the process from a reliability and quality stand point.

The hazards identified are communicated to those performing the work and to operating personnel whose work could affect the safety of the process.  The Messer Hazardous Work Program describes the steps that a supervisor, contractor representative or other authorized issuer needs to follow to manage hazardous work.   The program references and coordinates applicable lockout/tagout procedures, line breaking, hot work authorization, elevated work/fall protection, controlling access to covered process areas, and excavation procedures.
