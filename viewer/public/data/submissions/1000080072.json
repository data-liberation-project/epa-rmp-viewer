This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.

The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures and plans, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\r\n\r\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner. Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (i.e. adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service, or a MOC team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment. Another integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The Solvay plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.

HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe HAZOP team's recommendations are forwarded to management for resolution. These recommendations are reviewed and all approved recommendations are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained. To help ensure that the process controls and or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Solvay plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years as long as the process exists. The recommendations from these updates are also forwarded to management. Final resolution of the recommendations is tracked, documented, and retained.\r\n\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe Solvay plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures are developed"

      "SummaryText": "dress process safety and personal safety issues. These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety. The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operation, maintenance, engineering, and plant management\r\n\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe Solvay plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Each process has documentation available showing the location of this information to help employees and visitors locate any necessary process safety information. Chemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known exposure concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For process areas, the plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (i.e. temperature, level, composition). The plant assures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems.\r\n\r\nThe plant also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical ratings of equipment, piping and instrument drawings, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised."

The distance to end point (< 0.1 miles) was calculated for the alternative release scenario using the methodology outline in EPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance using the RMP*Comp online tool.  The assumptions used were a wind speed of 3.0 meters/second with atmospheric stability class D and air temperature of 25 degrees Celsius.  The release occurs at ground level with urban topography surrounding the manufacturing site.  There are no public/environmental receptors or population effected by this release.   Other scenarios (process piping releases from failures at flanges, joints, welds, valves and valve seals, drains or bleeds, or gasket leak) was considered for the alternate case scenario but the PSV release was selected because it is the most probable.  Specific information on this release is presented in more detail in the plan. \r\n\r\n\r\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Solvay plant.  Because processes at the plant that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard this summary also addresses the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the prevention program.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nThe Solvay plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the plant prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the prevention program are documented in the employee participation plan that addresses prevention program elements. In addition, the plant has a number of initiatives under way that ad"

The potential affected population is 138 (140) people (based on the 2010 United States Census) and nearby public receptors (Ohio River) could be affected by this type of release.  Other scenarios (transfer hose releases due to splits or sudden uncoupling and shipping container mishandling, breakage, or puncturing leading to a spill) were considered for the worst case scenario but the loss of the entire contents of C-151 was selected because it has the largest impact distance for the toxic endpoint. \r\n         \r\nPC-151 maximum capacity is 31,700 LB but the maximum working capacity is maintained at 26,650 LB.  Inventory of both tanks are tracked on a daily basis and a tank truck order is placed when the level indicator reads 12,000 LB or less with a maximum order quantity of 25,000 LB from the vendor with a 5 to 7-day lead time including 2-day transit time.   The level is verified to be less than 15% before unloading the tank truck.  There are safety critical interlocks in place (SCIs are tested on a routine basis) that will shut tank valves, turn off pumps, and turn off the compressor if the pressure, temperature, or level exceed set points.  There are two emergency shutdown device (ESD) buttons for the unloading system (to shut down the compressor (PK-130), pump (PG-104) and close bottom valves on both storage tanks) located adjacent to the Methyl Chloride unloading area.   There are also LEL indicators that alarm in the control room that are located in the Methyl Chloride storage tank area to detect a leak.
