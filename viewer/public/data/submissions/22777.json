The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material and if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to Eastman employees, the public and the environment.  This objective will be accomplished by utilizing general good operating procedures, providing appropriate training to all employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary, with the local emergency response providers.\n\nEastman's management is committed to providing the resources necessary to implement this policy.  Further, Eastman recognizes that it has a duty to protect its employees and neighbors from the effects of all dangerous chemicals.  While chemicals are a fundamental component of the coatings that Eastman manufactures, each chemical is given due consideration with regard to techniques for safe handling and processing.  Therefore, even though a particular compound may not be listed within the regulations, it is handled according to any hazardous properties that it possesses.\n\nFacility Description\n\nEastman Chemical Company - Columbus is located in Columbus, Georgia and operates primarily as a manufacturer of synthetic resins.  The main product is resin, including polyesters, powder coating, solution acrylics,curatives, and latex.  All processes are conducted in a batch mode.  Support operations include wastewater treatment, storage tanks and administrative offices.\n\nOne chemical, vinyl acetate, is utilized at the facility in sufficient quantities to be subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68, RMP.  Vinyl acetate is a raw material (monomer) used for resin formulations.  \n\nWorst"

      "SummaryText": "-Case and Alternative-Release Scenarios\n\nRMP regulations require that each facility identify worst-case and alternative case release scenarios.  EPA has defined a worst-case release as the instantaneous release of the entire contents of the largest vessel or connected piping that contains a regulated substance.  Railcars transport approximately 25,000 gallons or 190,000 lbs of vinyl acetate onsite to the railcar unloading area.  Vinyl acetate is pumped from the railcar into a 30,000 gallon atmospheric storage tank capable of storing an estimated 233,000 lbs of vinyl acetate.  The storage tank is located in a dike with a capacity of 49,173 gallons, which would contain a spill from the storage tank.  The railcar unloading area is not diked and USEPA guidance suggests that an instantaneous release of the enitre contents of the railcar should be considered as constituting the worst case.\n\nThe release rate is then evaluated using modeling techniques and/or reference tables to define the distance to a specified endpoint (concentration or overpressure).  The distance to the endpoint is affected by several factors including molecular weight, volatility, heat of combustion, and physical setting (urban or rural).\n\nThe alternative release scenario must be one that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario and that reaches an endpoint offsite, unless no such scenario exists.  The alternative release scenario is also evaluated to define the distance to the specified endpoint.  Under 40 CFR 68 Subpart B 68.22(e), the RMP rule identifies surface roughness as a parameter to be used in the hazard assessment to determine the physical setting of the site, urban or rural.  Urban means there are many obstacles in the immediate area; obstacles include buildings or trees.  Rural means there are no buildings in the immediate area and the terrain is generally flat and unobstructed.  Due to the presence of buildings and terrain with significant features in the immediate vicinity o"

      "SummaryText": "f the Columbus, Goergia facility, an urban dispersion environment was assumed.\n\nA computerized dispersion model was used in determining the distance to the vinyl acetate endpoint that is defined by the regulation.  The OCA Guidance contains assumptions that make both the release rate and distance to endpoint calculations for a toxic liquid release highly conservative.  More refined calculation methods are available, such as Kawamura and Mackay method.  However, some dispersion models include the release rate model in their calculations.  Thus, it is important to determine the dispersion model before selecting the release rate model.  The combination of facility location and chemical at Eastman restricts the availlable models.  Vinyl acetate behaves as a dense gas.  Common models available for dense gases include SLAB, DEGADIS, and ALOHA.  The Eastman facility is able to consider an urban environment.  As such, ALOHA is selected as the refined model.  Additionally, ALOHA includes a release model.  Thus, ALOHA is used for both the release rate calculation and the dispersion modeling calculation.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for vinyl acetate included an instantaneous release of the contents (190,000 lbs) of a railcar in the unloading area.  Other assumptions included that the incident would occur at maximum air temperature (102 F) and humidity (70 percent); the ground roughness is characterized as urban; the windspeed is 1.5 meters/sec and an atmospheric stability classification of F (stable).  The ALOHA model provided an estimated distance to the endpoint of 1.7 miles.\n\nThe selected alternative-release scenario for the vinyl acetate storage tank is a release that results from an overfill of the tank (7,945 lbs).  Other assumptions included that the incident would occur at ambient air temperature (65 F) and humidity (70 percent); the ground roughness characterized as urban; the windspeed is 3.0 meters/sec and an atmospheric stability classification of D.

New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and as needed whenever changes are made to the procedure.\n\nMechanical Integrity - Eastman carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper functions.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.
