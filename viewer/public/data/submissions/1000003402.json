Corporate Policies\n\nArclin is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to the comprehensive accidental release prevention program that we have in place for our Portland facility.  This program covers areas such as equipment design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our resin and overlay manufacturing and processes.  It is our policy to implement effective controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances from our operations.  \n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur primary activities are manufacturing of phenolic resin and phenolic overlays.  We store and use only one regulated substance (formaldehyde solution) at our facility.  The formaldehyde solution is a 50% (by weight) solution of formaldehyde in water and is used as a raw material to manufacture phenolic resins and glues.\n\nThe maximum inventory of formaldehyde solution at our facility is currently 321,600 lbs.\n\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\nTo perform the off-site consequence analysis for our facility, we have used ALOHA evaporation calculations and dispersion modeling.  We compared these results to manual calculations using the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance.  There was close agreement between these methods.  The following paragraphs provide details of two release scenarios that we considered.  \n\nThe worst-case release scenario for formaldehyde assumes an instantaneous loss of the entire contents of our formaldehyde storage tank.  The tank contains 33,500 gallons of a 50% formaldehyde solution in water.  The solution is stored at 140oF (60oC).  The release is con"

Allowing for the excluded volume of other tanks, the spill puddle covers 4,700 square feet.  \n\nEvaporation of the formaldehyde spill occurs at a rate dependent on the vapor pressure of formaldehyde gas over the solution of formaldehyde in water.  We used NOAA/EPA's ALOHA 5.4.1.1 modeling program and NOAA's Cameo Chemical datasheets to estimate releases from this spill scenario.  According to NOAA's data, the vapor pressure of 50% formaldehyde is 18 mm Hg at our storage temperature.  Due to the large volume of the spill, the solution does not cool appreciably when it contacts the concrete containment area.  \n\nThe ALOHA program calculated a maximum release rate of formaldehyde to air of approximately14.8 pounds/minute.  Assuming this rate occurred for 1 hour, 813 lbs of formaldehyde would be released.  This is expected to form a plume of contaminated air above the EPA toxic endpoint (0.012 mg/L) approximately 0.6 miles long and between 0.1 and 0.5 miles wide (depending on variations in wind direction and speed). \n\nThese results were compared to those calculated using the EPA's Off-site Consequences Manual.  The OSC calculation showed a distance to the same toxic endpoint of 0.62 miles, consistent with the ALOHA calculations.  The results of the ALOHA calculations are shown graphically in Figure 1.   \n\nAn alternative release scenario was also prepared for formaldehyde solution.  The alternative release scenario assumed a leak from the tank's delivery line.  This is more likely than the complete failure of the tank.  The solution will cool upon contact with the concrete containment dike and begins to solidify at approximately 125oF.  A maximum release rate of 14.5 lbs/minute was calculated using ALOHA.  A release duration of 60 minutes was assumed with the release rate decreasing with time.  The ALOHA model calculated a distance of 0.16 miles to the toxic endpoint.  This is show"

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the chemical accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68.  A number of processes at our facility are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Arclin voluntarily participates with Oregon OSHA's Safety and Health Achievement Recognition Program (SHARP) to further enhance plant safety and compliance.\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of our release prevention program that are in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nArclin maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all of our processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts regular detailed studies to ensure that the hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses includes the use of specific checklists and \"what-if\" scenario analyses.  These studies are performed by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, chemistry and process operations and are re-evaluated when new equipment or processes are added or at the intervals specified in the PSM regulations.  Any deficiencies or possible improvements that are identified during the hazard analyses are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Arclin Surfaces maintains written Standard Operating Procedures.  These procedures address virtually all elements of plant operation including initial process start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and start-up after process repairs or modifications.  The information is regularly reviewe"

New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided at least every other year and when processes are modified, new equipment installed or as deemed necessary by operations management.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nWe perform and record maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper functions.  Process equipment examined during these checks includes; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, pumps, monitors and other elements.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices and chemical safety.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Arclin to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Arclin.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operation and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe start-up prior to placing equipment into service.\n\nCompliance Audits\nWe conduct audits on a regular basis to determine whether the prov"

These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.  Arclin also uses a continuous behavioral-based safety audit program (STOP) in which all employees participate to promote safe plant operation.\n\nIncident Investigation\nWe immediately investigate any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  No incidents have occurred in more than 5 years.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  Arclin uses the ABS Consulting Root-Cause Analysis program for incident analysis.  Many of our employees have been formally trained in this process.  All incident analysis reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.  \n\nEmployee Participation\nArclin Surfaces truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, in particular information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  We have a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and Arclin's processes.

Five-year Accident History\n\nArclin Surfaces has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.  The plant has had no time-loss accidents in more than 4 years.  No accidents involving hazardous materials have occurred in more than 5 years.\n\n\n6. Emergency Response Plan\n\nWe maintain a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is inspected and serviced annually.  Arclin maintains accounts with emergency response contractors to provide cleanup services in the event of a major release.  In addition, the emergency response plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nOver the years, many safety developments have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  Many of these have come from our own employees and operators.  Our safety record confirms that our programs are working extremely well.  It is our intention to continue to emphasize our current plan and encourage employee input.  At this time, all recommended changes have been implemented.\n"
