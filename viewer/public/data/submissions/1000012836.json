Several of the grades involve a process in which chlorine is added to the milled flour to achieve a desired pH.  In addition, a small amount of chlorine is added to the wheat prior to storage and milling to inhibit microbial growth.\n\nChlorine is delivered to Mennel Milling Co. and used in one ton containers and 150-pound containers.  The supplier delivers full chlorine containers to the site via truck.  The containers are unloaded and stored in the indoor storage area by the use of an overhead crane rail hoist.  Mennel Milling staff connects the ton containers and 150-pound cylinders to the feed system.  The maximum number of ton containers is 6 (12,000 pounds) and 150-pound cylinders is 2 (300 pounds).\n\nMennel Milling Co. uses vacuum feed systems that are inherently safe.  These systems involve the use of air or water flowing through an eductor that creates a vacuum.  This vacuum allows for the feed of chlorine from the containers into the piping system.  If a chlorine line downstream of the vacuum regulator is broken or develops a leak, the vacuum is interrupted and the vacuum regulator automatically closes, preventing the discharge of chlorine gas.\n\nMennel Milling Co. has contracted with Research Products Co.(REPCO) of Salina, Kansas to perform preventive and corrective maintenance on the chlorine feed systems.\n\nMennel Milling Co. has developed a comprehensive, accidental release prevention program as part of the OSHA PSM program.  The elements of this program include:\n\n??    Process Safety Information\n??    Process Hazard Analysis\n??    Operating Procedures\n??    Training\n??    Management of Change\n??    Pre-Startup Safety Review\n??    Compliance Audits\n??    Incident Investigation\n??    Contractor Management\n??    Hot Work Permits\n\nIn the past five years, there have been no acci"

This plan contains measures that Mennel Milling Co. staff can take to alert employees to a release, how to distinguish between an incidental release and a significant release, and many other\nelements.  Mennel Milling Co. staff will receive training to allow for defensive action in response to an on-site release.  In the event of a chlorine release, Mennel Milling will contact the Dowagiac Fire Department for technical support.  The fire department is trained and equipped to respond to chlorine incidents.  The facility has coordinated its emergency response activities with the City of Dowagiac Fire Department and the Cass\nCounty Emergency Management Coordinator (EMC).\n\nMennel Milling Co. has reviewed hazard evaluations previously prepared for the chlorination processes at the facility.  As a result of this evaluation, several changes are planned to improve safety.  These changes include (but are not limited to):\n\n??    When meetings of the Chlorine Safety Team are convened,\n      minutes should be taken and retained on file--Noted\n??    Develop a system to ensure that the findings and\n      recommendations of the revalidated PHA are addressed--In Progress\n??    Provide for an annual review of the written operating\n      procedures and certify that they are current and accurate--Done\n??    Provide annual operations and maintenance training\n      including:\n\n     o    Confirm that all affected employees have received the necessary training and \n           that the tests used to determine their competency are on file--Done\n     o    Implement the training program included in Section 5.0 of the PSM Program.
