Facility Policy.\r\n\r\nThe owners, management and employees of WinField United. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Mills County LEPC, and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.     Facility Information.\r\n\r\nThe primary activity at the facility is the manufacturer and distribution of fertilizer products.  The fertilizer product, anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and used to manufacture fertilizers as a nutrient for crop production.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in tanks designed for this purpose.\r\n\r\nConsistent with the compliance guidelines of 29 CFR Part 1910 and 40 CFR Part 68, this facility has developed a management system to minimize consequences associated with manufacturing anhydrous ammonia-based fertilizers.\r\n\r\nWinField United has its Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and developed emergency plans.  This program provides plans and information that will assist emergency responders in the event of an accident at the facility.\r\n\r\nFinally, the management system provides procedures and plans to assist employees in conducting both routine and non-routine plant operations, to identify potential hazardous situations, and to address actual emergencies.\r\n\r\n3.     Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe facility is in compliance with the provisions of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\" and our state regulations covering anhydrous ammonia. \r\n\r\nThe facility personnel are committed to employee, public and environmental safety.

In the unlikely event of a release, we have an emergency action plan in place to minimize potential effects.\r\n\r\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substance Handled:\r\n\r\nThis facility has one regulated substance at the facility - anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in a horizontal bullet-tank.  The facility produces two (2) versions of nitrogenous fertilizer from anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\nThe first process reacts anhydrous ammonia with phosphoric acid (68%, CAS No. 7664-38-2).  This process uses TVA Pipe Reactor technology to neutralize the phosphoric acid with ammonia.  The resultant liquid product is an ammonium polyphosphate fertilizer, NPK: 10-34-0.   This product is only marketed to retailers.\r\n\r\nThe second process mechanically blend-reacts anhydrous ammonia with solid monoammonium phosphate (MAP).  This process occurs in a mixing tank.  Water and clay are also used in various amounts (recipes) to produce a NPK liquid fertilizer. \r\n\r\n\r\n4.     The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario.\r\n\r\nThe Fertilizer Institute (TFI) / DEGADIS-generated Lookup Tables were used to perform offsite consequences analysis.  The following two paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios:\r\n\r\n\tThe worst-case scenario involves the catastrophic release of anhydrous ammonia.  In this scenario, ammonia would be released to atmosphere over a 10-minute period.  The gaseous ammonia is released at Class F stability with 1.5 m/s wind-speed.  \r\n\r\n\tThe alternative-case scenario involves the release of ammonia over a 2-minute period.  Ammonia is assumed to be released in gaseous form.  The release is assumed to be controlled by excess flow valves, emergency shutdown and/or emergency action procedures.  Weather conditions are assumed to be neutral.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-"
