The impact of these potential releases must be quantified in accordance with release criteria dictated in the rule.  The projected impact distance is determined using EPA-defined atmospheric conditions and is intended to provide a conservative estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected.  According to the EPA, the hypothetical ?worst-case? scenario is intended to ensure that no potential risks to public health are overlooked, but the distance to an endpoint estimated under worst-case should not be considered a ?public danger zone?.  Possible causes or the extreme improbability that such releases may occur are not considered.\n\nThe alternative release scenario definition is a release that is more likely to occur than the worst-case release; however, as with the hypothetical ?worst-case?, the alternative release improbability is not taken into consideration.\n\nWorst-Case Toxic Release ? Anhydrous Ammonia \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is a colorless gas with a strong pungent odor and is one of the most widely used industrial chemicals.  It is prepared industrially from natural gas, steam and air.  Some of this ammonia is used for direct injection into croplands as a fertilizer.  A large amount of industrial ammonia is reacted with carbon dioxide to make urea fertilizer or reacted to make ammonium nitrate f"

Direct liquid contact to the skin can cause severe burns.\n\nKNC has considered potential ?worst-case? releases from the refrigerated atmospheric storage tank which is passively mitigated by a secondary containment dike and the bullet tank, the two largest vessels onsite.\n\nKNC?s hypothetical ?worst-case? scenario involves an anhydrous ammonia release from the terminal?s 30,000-ton atmospheric storage tank.  As required by the rule, the hypothetical ?worst-case? release assumes that this entire quantity is released in 10 minutes as a result of a catastrophic failure of the tank.  This unlikely event was modeled with a publicly available model (DEGADIS), which has been demonstrated to provide reasonable estimates of concentrations and distances associated with this type of release event.  The impact of this release scenario is predicted to extend beyond the facility boundary and impact public receptors.\n\nWe believe this scenario is a hypothetical ?worst-case? event dictated by the rule and extremely unlikely to occur for many reasons.  In addition to the stringent design controls for this type of pressurized vessel, facility maintenance and inspection programs address the integrity of process and storage vessels, including this one, and largely preclude such massive and unlikely failures.\n\nAlternative Toxic Release ? Anhydrous Ammonia \n\nMore likely release events than the hypothetical ?worst-case? tend to concentrate in areas where the ammonia product is handled, such as loading and other transport activities.  Generally, significantly lower quantities are involved due to numerous shutdown safeguards present throughout the terminal.  Operator intervention tends to mitigate and limit the consequences of failures.\n\nThe hypothetical ammonia alternative release scenario considered for this process is a relea"

The impact of such a release was modeled with the DEGADIS model which shows that the impact of the release would extend off-site under typical ambient conditions.  \n\nPlanned Changes for Safety Improvements \n\nSafety improvements are a continual and ongoing process at the facility which is facilitated by the Prevention Program/PSM Program.  Formal process hazard analysis is conducted at least every five years, but review is constant through management of change procedures, operator training, incident investigation and mechanical integrity programs.  As a result, changes relevant to safety occur continuously as needs are identified through these procedures and policies."
