      "SummaryText": "The Facility and Regulated Substance\n\nThe City of Taylorville, Illinois - Taylorville Water Treatment Plant is a chlorine disinfection water treatment facility located in Taylorville, Illinois. The plant injects chlorine as a disinfection agent as part of the plant's overall treatment process to provide potable water to the municipality's water system. The chlorine in the cylinders is liquefied under pressure. The plant uses administrative controls to limit the maximum inventory of chlorine to 8,000 pounds (4 full cylinders; 2 connected and 2 spare). The Risk Management Plan (RMP) addresses the storage and handling of chlorine used in the disinfection process. \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies and Programs\n\nThe Taylorville Water Treatment Plant has established an Accidental Release Prevention program for the chlorine system that complies with the regulatory requirements of both OSHA (Process Safety Management, PSM, 29 CFR 1910.119) and EPA (Risk Management, RMP, 40 CFR 68). In addition, responding to emergencies the Plant has an Emergency Action Plan that complies with various regulatory programs, including OSHA Emergency Response Planning requirements (29 CFR 1910.120(q). These plans have been coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\n\n\nAccident History and Recent Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThere have been no RMP accidents at the new Taylorville Water Treatment Plant. An initial HAZOP has been conducted, and opportunities to improve process safety were identified and implemented. The system is equipped with chlorine detectors in the chlorine ejector room which will alarm (audible and visual) at 1 ppm, shut down chlorine feed (closes emergency shut off valve), and activate the scrubber system at 3 ppm. The scrubber system is designed to adequately scrub the contents of one chlorine cylinder.  Emergency shutdown procedures are in place. Chlorine cylinders are stored inside the chorine building after delivery to t"
