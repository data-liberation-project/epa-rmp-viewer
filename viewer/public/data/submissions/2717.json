ADRIAN, MN. 56110\n\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT THOMAS BROLSMA GENERAL MANAGER\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1.  THE FACILITY POLICY\n\n     The owners, management, and employees of Five Star Co-op Fertilizer Co. are committed to the \nprevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur\nthe facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any \nrelease and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  FACILITY INFORMATION\n\n     -The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\n     -Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application. \n \n     - The maximum quantity stored would be 130,000 pounds in our 30,000 gallon storage tank.\n\n3.  The worst case release scenario and the alternate release scenario.\n\n    a.  The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank\nreleased as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 13,000 pounds which\nrepresents the volume of the storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.  The \ndistance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.16 miles.\n\n     b.  The alternate release scenario based on the best information possible is a release from a \nbreak in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is\n.56 miles.\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\n     The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety requirements for the Storage and Handling\nof Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the\nstandards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111,\n\"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".\n\n5.  The five year Accident History\n\n     a.  There have been n"

There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia\nsafety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\n\nThomas Brolsma - General Manager"
