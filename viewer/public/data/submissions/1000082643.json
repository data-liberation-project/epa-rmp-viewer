The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material and if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to Ajinomoto Foods employees, the public and the environment.This objective will be accomplished by utilizing general good operating procedures, providing appropriate training to all employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary, with the local response providers. This plan covers all Ajinomoto Foods owned activities at this facility.\n\nAjinomoto Foods management is committed to providing the resources necessary to implement this policy\n\n\n\nFacility Description: Ajinomoto Foods operates a food processing facility at this location. Ajinomoto Foods is a producer of Asian potstickers, batter fried and batter breaded  vegetable  & cheese appetizer  products. Support operations include cold storage, an analytical laboratory, and administrative offices.\n\n\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nAjinomoto Foods takes many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system.  These precautions include safety controls (detection systems, alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure.  We also have a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems and a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel.

Facility and Regulated Substances\n\nAjinomoto Foods located in Carthage, MO processes and stores various food products. The regulated substance at this facility, anhydrous ammonia, is used in a closed-loop refrigeration system for product cooling and preservation. In order to protect its employees, the public and the environment, an integrated safety management program has been established to prevent ammonia releases and mitigate the consequences of a release, should one occur.\n\n3. Worst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios\n\nOff Site Consequence (OCA) data is available for review onsite at the Ajinomoto Foods facility.\n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Ammonia Specific Prevention\n\nThe Ajinomoto Foods facility has an accidental release prevention program that complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Rule. The prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n- Employee Participation Program\n\n- Process Safety Information\n\n- Process Hazard Analysis\n\n- Operating Procedures\n\n- Training Program\n\n- Contractor Safety Program\n\n- Pre-Startup Safety Review Procedures\n\n- Mechanical Integrity Program\n\n- Hot Work Permit Procedures\n\n- Management of Change Procedures\n\n- Incident Investigation Procedures\n\n- Emergency Planning and Response\n\n- Compliance Audit Procedures\n\nThe Carthage, MO facility has an emergency action plan that addresses the response necessary for a release of ammonia from the refrigeration system.
