      "SummaryText": "  SouthernGate Terminal, LLc is a wholesale distribution facility for propane and butane. SouthernGate receives propane and butane by way of rail, unloads the products, and then provides loading services for transport trucks. The facility consists of 4 above ground storage tanks, a 12 spot tankcar unloading rack, and a total of 3 loading stations for trucks.\n  This facility complies with NFPA 58 requirements for LP Gas storage, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Bearpond Volunteer Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n  Our worst case scenario is the failure of our largest tank, a 90,000 gallon tank filled to the maximum allowed (88% @60F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. According to EPA's look-up tables, the distance to the endpoint is 0.5 mi.\n  This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. The facility was designed, installed, and is maintained in accordance with NFPA 58 and state law.\n  SouthernGate Terminal LLC has never had an accident involving propane or butane that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage.\n  In the event of an emergency involving our facility, it is our policy to notify the Bearpond Volunteer Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. Members of the fire department have inspected our facility during training seminars."
