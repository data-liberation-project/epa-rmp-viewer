This group monitors the on-site implementation of the Process Safety Management programs through periodic meetings at each regulated facility.  In addition, the corporate safety group in conjunction with the local Depot Managers are responsible for maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all employees and the surrounding communities.  This policy is administered through Costco Wholesale?s safety and environmental programs.  These programs include forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout / tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers? documentation, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\nThe Costco Wholesale facility has an emergency action plan in effect.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document which is maintained at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n - To save lives.\n - To minimize and avoid injuries.\n - To protect the environment.\n - To minimize property damage.\n\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nStartup of the ammonia refrigeration system at the Chill Plant occurred on September 9, 1998 with Costco Wholesale personnel taking full responsibility for operating the entire facility in late September 1998.  The facility is located at 25862 S. Schulte Court, Tracy, California.  The refrigeration system was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the Uniform Fire and Mechanical Codes.\n\nThe C"

      "SummaryText": "hill Plant ammonia refrigeration system was expanded in early 2004 to increase the capacity of the cross dock operations.  The ammonia refrigeration uses approximately 22,000 pounds of ammonia for cross dock operations and warehouse cold storage.  The majority of the system is located in the Chill Plant engine room including vessels and compressors.  The condensers are mounted on the engine room roof, and all of the evaporator coils are located in the cross dock warehouse.  At one end of the warehouse, there are several evaporator coils that are used to maintain a slightly lower temperature for meat products.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Costco Wholesale ammonia refrigeration systems have many safety features.  Much of the safety of the systems is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the systems.  For example, the Costco Wholesale facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.  Refrigeration contractors, experts in the ammonia refrigeration industry, are contracted at the Chill Plant to maintain the system. \n\nThe Costco Wholesale facility, including the ammonia systems, was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of ammonia refrigeration systems.  These safety features include a water diffusion tank, ammonia leak detectors in the engine rooms and the cold storage/process areas, and automatic shut down systems.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside each engine room and just outside of the engine rooms (condensers).  All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that protect the integrity of the equipment in case of a high pressure situation.\n\nAmmonia refrigeration systems do not experience any chemical reactions or internal corrosion.  The only composition change that occurs within the systems are phase changes, "

      "SummaryText": "as ammonia is cycled through various stages of liquid and vapor, similar to a household refrigerator.  The refrigeration system is a closed-loop system without any regular emissions or releases.  Any leaks are noted and repaired immediately.\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, Costco Wholesale has developed a preventive maintenance program that utilizes the services of a professional refrigeration contractor to complete regularly scheduled inspections and tests of the ammonia refrigeration system as well as repairs as needed to process equipment.  This program is implemented throughout the company.\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Costco Wholesale facility has not had any reportable ammonia releases during the past 5 years (June 1999 - June 2004).  No injuries have occurred at the facility due to the operation of the ammonia refrigeration processes.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nCostco Wholesale has an emergency action plan in effect at the facility.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document, which is maintained at the facility.  Emergency response activities are coordinated with the local Tracy Fire Department.  In case of a major ammonia emergency, the facility will first call 9-1-1 to alert the local Police and Fire Departments.  Other responders will be called as needed, including the county Hazardous Materials Response Team.  If a release exceeds the federal reporting quantity of 100 pounds for ammonia, the National Response Center will be called.\n\nThe Costco Wholesale facility has an Emergency Command System in place.  The Depot Manager will assume command in an emergency situation with backup personnel appointed to serve if he/she is not available.  Costco Wholesale maintains a safety committee whose members include the designated emergency coordinators for the facility including the maintenance manager and the assistant managers.  The Plan provides the response organization "

The facility holds evacuation drills at least once per year.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe facility has worked to address safety issues as they arise in a continued effort to ensure a safe work environment.  A Compliance Audit was completed in December 2002 and a PHA Revalidation was completed in December 2003 that generated recommendations to improve safety at the facility.  These include installing additional vehicular impact protection, updating the process safety information to account for system modifications, revising the emergency evacuation policies, revising the operating procedures based on the most review, updating the preventive maintenance procedures, and improving the ammonia pipe labeling.  Costco Wholesale is proceeding with the few remaining mitigation measures associated with these studies.\n\nThe corporate safety group has also implemented an annual program to review the PSM and RMP programs at each of the facilities to ensure on-going compliance with the Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program."
