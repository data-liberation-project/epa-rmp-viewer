Alll of us must incorporate safety, health, and environmental considerations into our daily buismess activities.  It takes a total team effort to truly be a Responsible Care company.\"\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION:\n\nThe primary activity at the Milwaukee Plant is the manufacture of chemical additives used in the pulp and paper industry.  For example, epichlorohydrin is used in the production of wet-strength resin.  These resins are used in paper towels, napkins, tissues, etc. so that they will not come apart easily when wet.  Epichlorohydrin is a raw material for the process and is consumed in a chemical reaction to make the product.  The plant receives epichlorohydrin in tank trucks and railroad tank cars and stores the material in a storage tank.  The storage tank is provided with a containment dike and leak detectors to minimize adverse impacts from any leaks for spills.  \n\nWORST-CASE SCENARIO:\n\nThe worst-case scenario for epichlorohydrin is the failure of an entire railcar of epichlorohydrin.  This scenario would result in off-site impact, but it requires the extemely unlikely event of a catastrophic failure of the railcar.  The railcar is unloaded from the top, which means that an unloading hose failure can not cause the release of the entire car. \n\nALTERNATIVE CARE SCENARIO:\n\nThe alternative case scenario for epichlorohydrin is a leak in a line downstream of the pump and outside of containment.  The impact from this scenario would result in an off-site impact, but would be limited by the fact that plant personnel are present during this process. Operaitng proc"

      "SummaryText": "edures and process monitors will limit the duration of leakage.\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM:\n\nThe process is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management standard (29CFR 1910.119) and has a complete process safety management systems im place.  This includes the use of process hazards analysis to identify and address potential hazards, management of change procedures to control modifications, mechanically integrity procedures for minimizing mechanical failiures, detailed operating procedures for process control, and operator training for personnel involved in the process.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nTwo OSHA injuries have occurred in the last 5 years due to epichlorohydrin.  Both were the result of burns due to employees contacting the material.  One event occurred within a builiding and the other was a small amount leaking onto an employees boot during the unloading process.  Corrective actions to prevent such injuries have been implemented.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nThe Milwaukee Plant has a written emergency response plan and coordinates emergency response matters with the local fire department.  The plant has provided emergency response training for all plant employees and has a  trained emergency response team.   \n\nPLANT IMPROVEMENTS:\n\nThe Milwaukee Plant has a major capital project underway that will provide 100% containment of the liquid contents of a rail car or a tank truck spill on-site.  It is expected that this project will be completed in early 2000."
