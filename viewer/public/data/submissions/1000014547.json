In addition, its is our policy to adhere to all apllicable federal,state, and local laws.\n\nOne of our company Goals states, To provide for the Safety and Security of our employees, our customers, the general public and to be good stuarts of the environment for which we serve.  To fulfill these goals, we enroll in regulatory management service that assists in maintaining and administer comprehensive safety and environmental programs, procedures and training courses. We perform a thorough annual audit program and monitor facility internal audit utilizing checklists survey forms that are reviewed regularly and updated as necessary to ensure all applicable federal,state, and local regulations are correct. These checklists are used to measure regulatory compliance including those governing the safe handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia. Procedures require a timely response and correction of all recommendations resulting from these audit checklists.\n\nA 'Site Safety Coordinator' is identified and used as an extension of the general manager and management service personell for a hands on manager of the day to day safe working activities,maintain the required regulatory recordkeeping,conduct monthly safety meetings, conduct employee training and act as the locations contact during emergency incidents that are rehearsed biannually.\n\nA DESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED.\n\nThe facility is"

      "SummaryText": "a wholesale farm supply and distribution center and as such we store and distribute a wide variety fo pesticides and fertilizers including anhydrous ammonia. Anhydrous Ammonia is received by truck, is handled and stored on-site and is a regulated substance by the EPA requireing us to comply with this Risk Management Program. Ammonia is used for blending into mixed grade liquid fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in 1@30,000 stationary storage tank on-site. 140,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia is the maximum storage capacity of stationary storage tank. Therefore, the total facility anhydrous ammonia storage capacity for this location is 140,000 pounds. The largest storage vessel at our facility contains 140,000 pounds.\n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO\n\nOur worst case scenario is the loss of the total contents of the 30,000 gallon storage tank, when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), released as a liquid over 10 minutes, resulting total vaporization. The maximum quantity released would be 140,000 pounds. According to DEGRADIS modeling, the distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 PPM) would have off-site impact. It should be noted that our company has never had a total release of an entire storage tank.\n\nALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe most common alternate release scenario from an anhydrous ammonia storage facility would not reach an endpoint off-site. The alternate release scenario modeled for the purpose of this plan is a two-minute release from a stationary storage tank representing a valve and hose failure requiring a manual shutdown. The total amount of anhydrous ammonia released in this scenario would be 300 lbs for a storage tank. \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe ammonia storage system is designed, installed and is maintained in accordance with ASTM standards and the ASME codes. This facility complies with the ANSI K61.1 standards (1999 edition),"

The main storage tank valves are locked when not in use. Lighting for the facility has increased to discourage the increase of meth theft.\n\nTraining is provided to all employees at least annually, whenever there is a change in the process or whenever competency with the regulations are questioned. In accordance with the 1999 ANSI standards, training is also offered for all ammonia customers to attend on a regular basis and offered to the local fire department personnel during there annual tour of our facility and operations. These training courses consist of classroom lecture, current and approved videos or compact disc, testing both verbally and written, demonstration and observation for each person working with the process that are certified while on-going training is always improved upon.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere has been no accidents involving anhydrous ammonia that has caused deaths, recordable injuries, property or environmental damage including evacuations on or off-site."
