The processes are designed in accordance with good engineering practices.  The management of change process is used to evaluate any system changes or modifications to insure continued compliance with regulatory requirements and good engineering practices and identify any needed safety precautions prior to implementation of the changes.

This is a comprehensive program with elements that include development of process safety information appropriate to the process, process hazard analysis, employee training, operating procedures, mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-startup safety reviews, contractor safety, emergency planning and response, compliance auditing, safe work procedures, and employee participation.\r\n\r\nThe program ensures that the process and the equipment in the process is designed, constructed, operated, and maintained according to industry codes and standards and accepted good engineering practices.  Process hazards analyses have been conducted on EnviroTech processes to identify and characterize potential hazards in the processes and to develop control measures for the identified hazards.  Operating procedures have been prepared and training has been conducted for all affected employees.  A management of change process is used to insure that no hazards are introduced through any changes in chemicals, equipment, procedures or the operation of the processes. The mechanical integrity element of the program includes identification of critical equipment and scheduled inspections and tests of that equipment including storage and containment features as well as monitoring and control devices in the process to detect any deficiencies or defects in equipment.

All elements of the Process Safety Management Program help to minimize the potential for an uncontrolled release of hazardous chemicals. \r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program Overview\r\n\r\nEnviroTech has developed an emergency response plan (in accordance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) rules at 29 CFR 1910.38 and 29 CFR 1910.120) that includes provisions to respond to chemical emergencies on-site with trained EnviroTech personnel and provisions to evacuate personnel from the facility in the event of an uncontrolled accidental release of a hazardous chemical. The emergency response program focuses on the following key elements: discovery and notification of a release or other incident, facility evacuation and head count procedures, mobilization of the appropriate response effort, coordination with local response agencies and authorities, identification of trained responders and incident commanders, post-incident recovery and clean-up procedures, media relations, and the conduct of training, drills and response critiques.  In addition to chemical releases the emergency response plan also addresses medical emergencies, fires and explosions, severe weather events, seismic events, and security events such as bomb threats, suspicious mail, unauthorized personnel on site, etc.\r\n\r\nIt is EnviroTech's policy to contact the local emergency response agencies, including the local fire department in the event of a hazardous chemical release. EnviroTech has coordinated with the local emergency planning committee on its emergency response plan, and in the unlikely event of an uncontrolled release, the local authorities will be notified by EnviroTech and a joint decision will be made on whether local areas will be evacuated. The local authorities will notify any affected neighbors or surroundin"

      "SummaryText": "Facility Description\r\n\r\nEnviroTech operates one process in its Helena, Arkansas facility that are subject to the requirements of both the Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Plan (RMP) rule (40 CFR 68) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration Process Safety Management standards (29 CFR 1910.119).  The process, BromMax, uses bromine and chlorine as raw materials in the manufacture of stabilized bromine salts.  In this process, bromine is received in bulk and stored in one 1,000 gallon and one 2,400 gallon storage tanks prior to use in the process.  Chlorine is received, stored, and used from one ton cylinders.  Up to two cylinders may be connected to the process at any one time.  The bromine and chlorine are then used in a reactor vessel to make the final product.  The covered process includes the storage and handling of the bromine and chlorine up through the reactor vessel.\r\n\r\nEnviroTech also operates a process at the Helena facility to manufacture peracetic acid.  In the previous RMP submittal this was included as a covered process due to the fact that the product contains more than 1% of peracetic acid which is a RMP listed chemical.  However, the RMP rule also states that if the partial pressure of a listed substance in a mixture is less than 10 mmHg, the process containing that mixture is not subject to the RMP requirements.  EnviroTech has determined through calculation that the maximum partial pressure of the peracetic acid in the solutions at the facility is 2.68 mmHg.  Therefore, this process is no longer included in this submittal. \r\n\r\nEnvironmental, Health, and Safety Policy\r\n\r\nEnviroTech's commitment to providing a safe, healthy work environment for employees as well as providing a safe, healthy environment for the surrounding community is the primary goal of EnviroTech's management. The properties of chlorine and bromine, as well as other chemicals in use in the facility, make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions"
