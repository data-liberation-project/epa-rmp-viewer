The corporate core values championed by our President, embraced by our Senior Leadership Team, encouraged by our Managers/Supervisors and pledged to our associates are: a) Caring Relationships, b) Entrepreneurial Spirit, c) Strategic Foresight, and d) High Performance. These 4 core values support our Safety and Health philosophy and management efforts. Interpersonal communications, problem solving, planning and safety achievement have a direct relationship with the core values when applied to safety training, hazard assessment/investigation, post-accident/incident recovery and generating solutions to potential risk exposures. U.S. Venture integrates Safety expectations as a part of Manager/Supervisors' responsibilities in order to create a meaningful daily presence during all work activity. All departments at the corporate level including Risk Management, Legal, People Resources, Finance and Operations reinforce strategic safety planning and solid operation level decision-making that will reduce risk exposures.\n\nThe U.S. Energy Bettendorf Terminal is divided into two 9-acre facilities (East and West) located on the north shore of the Mississippi River in Bettendorf, Iowa.  The facility is a bulk petroleum terminal that stores refined petroleum products, including gasoline, diesel oil, denatured ethanol, fuel additives, and biodiesel in various tanks with capacities ranging from 500 to 3.3 million gallons.  These products are brought in via truck or pipeline and shipped out via truck.  In addition, the terminal stores butane (West facility) supplied by truck transports in two 30,000 gallon pressure tanks that are then transferred via piping and associated equipment on site and blended into gasoline.  The quantity of butane that is stored onsite exceeds the"

The Iowa State Fire Marshall Division has approved the installation of the system.   If an emergency were to occur, it is the facility's policy to notify the Bettendorf Fire Department by calling 911, which may trigger involvement by Scott County Emergency Management as necessary.  All personnel at this facility are 40-hour HAZWOPER certified and receive annual refresher hazardous materials training.\n\nU.S. Energy has an outstanding safety record, and to date, has not had an accident involving butane that has resulted in death, injury, property/environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release of butane at the U.S. Energy Bettendorf Terminal butane system, Terminal Emergency Response Personnel have been trained to immediately activate an emergency shutdown device (ESD) at one of five locations depending on location of the release and is the policy of the terminal to initially contact the Bettendorf Fire Department and request their assistance (via 911).  The facility emergency response plans are coordinated with the Bettendorf Fire Department and Scott County Emergency Management.\n\nWhen an ESD is activated and the alarm is not acknowledged within 20 seconds, CEC (Terminal Security Company) will be notified and a representative will call the terminal on-call phone number in response to confirm whether there is an actual emergency.

CEC will continue calling terminal employees until they are able to speak with somebody in person to communicate the situation (they will not leave a voice message).\n\nThe U.S. Energy Bettendorf Terminal has conducted facility tours with the Bettendorf Fire Department which included educating members of the fire department on the hazards of butane, evacuation plans, and assembly points.  \n\nPlanned changes to improve safety include tying in the East and West Terminal Emergency Shutdown (ESD) systems.  This Safety System will be installed to help communicate problems/shutdowns when the east facility is manned.  Currently, the East Terminal is not manned, but in the future will be for extended periods of time when barge transfers will occur.\n\nOur continuous improvement process, inclusive of historic analytics, risk assessments, and corrective/preventive actions, focuses on three primary objectives:\n1. Safety of clients, servicers, and community,\n2. Up time performance and user experience and,\n3. Site cost drivers and reductions through root cause analysis and long term corrective/preventive actions.\n\nWhile uptime and site costs goals are easily quantifiable, Safety is paramount to U.S. Venture as this establishes our credibility and reputation with employees, communities, and the industry.\n\nSafety and Environmental compliance are of primary importance to U.S. Venture at all times."
