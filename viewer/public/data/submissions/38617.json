      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe Fashing Plant is committed to protecting the health and safety of company personnel, contractors working in the facility, our neighbors in the surrounding community, and the environment.  This commitment is stongly supported by management and is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as employee training and in considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our facility.  The Fashing Plant implements both administrative and engineering controls to reasonably minimize the risk of an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance. The facility does not anticipate having any type of uncontrolled release. However, if an uncontrolled release does occur, the personnel at the facility in cooperation with local agencies are trained to respond, minimize, and/or eliminate any exposure that could occur to protect employees and the surrounding area.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\nThe Fashing Plant is a facility that receives raw natural gas from well production. The raw gas is dehydrated and contaminants removed.  Marketable natural gas is delivered via pipelines. Natural gas liquids are extracted and stored on site. The extracted natural gas liquids are combined in a mixture known as Y-Grade that is delivered to market via pipeline or transport vehicles. The propane stored on site is a purchased product used as a refrigerant. There are no listed toxic substances stored at this facility that exceed threshold quantities .\n\nHazard Assessment - Worst Case Scenario\nThe Worst Case Scenario for this facility is the rupture of either the propane tank or one of the Y-grade tanks and an ensuing vapor cloud explosion. The tanks are in close proximity to one another and the assumption is that all three tanks would ultimately explode. The combined quantity of the three tanks is 414,275 lb, and the explosion would have an offsite impact"

Qualified individuals operate the facility, and the equipment is inspected regularly.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\nThere was no Alternative Release Scenario determined because the facility is Program Level 1.\n                                 \nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nThis facility is regulated by 29CFR 1910.119 (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals), 1910.38 (Employee Emergency Plans), 1910.120 (Hazardous Waste and Emergency Response), 40CFR 112 (Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure), RCRA and State and Federal EPCRA Rules/Laws, as well as other federal, state and local regulations which are all developed to reduce the potential for the release of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.\n\nThis facility has implemented the Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals along with additional requirements of the Risk Management Program as the Accident Release Prevention Program.  There are other practices and measures, which are contained in numerous plans and procedures that all assist to prevent the release of highly hazardous chemicals.  Facility accident prevention programs promote the proactive identification, evaluation, and mitigation or prevention of releases of highly hazardous substances that could occur as a result of failure in processes, procedures or equipment.  The implementation of The Employee Participation Program requires the development of the necessary expertise, experiences, judgement, and proactive initiative within the workforce.\n\nAn established comprehensive training program has been developed and implemented at the facility.  All employees are trained in an overview of the process as well as in appropriate safe work practices per the corporate safety guidelines.  In addition to the training required of all employees, personnel having resp"

Safe work practices include site control, lockout/tagout, line breaking, confined space entry and hot work to ensure the safety and well being of employees and the surrounding area.\n\nThis facility has a policy of investigating every incident that has the potential of creating a release in order to prevent a similar accident from recurring.\n\nThe Company has established an audit procedure to assure the continued integrity of the prevention program.  Ensuring the safety and well being of employees and the surrounding area.\n\n5 Year Accident History\nThe Fashing Plant has had an excellent accident prevention program over the last five (5) years.  There have been no releases of listed Hazardous Substances which resulted in offsite effects.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThe Fashing Plant maintains a written emergency response plan to protect workers, ensure public safety and to protect the environment.  The plan details the procedures for responding to an emergency, including the release or potential release of a hazardous substance.  The procedures include instruction for response, communication, first aid, evacuation, accounting for personnel, company and agency notification procedures, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination.  All emergency equipment is maintained following established procedures.  Employees are trained in the procedures and use of equipment appropriate to their role in the response effort.  The emergency response plan is coordinated with the local emergency responders such as local law enforcement, local and state government officials, and the local emergency planning committee.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nThe plant personnel are continually developing new ways to improve the safety of the facility.
