The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material and if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to Reuben employees, the public and the environment. This objective will be accomplished by utilizing general good operating procedures, providing appropriate training to all employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary, with the local emergency response providers.\n\nReuben's management is committed to providing the resources necessary to implement this policy.\n\nFacility Description\n\nReuben operates a foods processing operation at this facility (see Figures 1-1 and 1-2). Wholesale deli meats are the main product produced by Reuben at this facility. Operations at the facility include food processing machinery and a number of coolers and chillers.\n\nOne chemical, ammonia, is utilized at the facility in sufficient quantities to be subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68. Ammonia is used as a refrigerant throughout the facility.\n\nWorst-Case and Alternative-Case Release Scenarios\n\nRMP regulations require that each facility complete worst-case and alternative-case release scenarios. USEPA has defined a worst-case toxic release as the release of the entire contents of the largest vessel that contains a regulated substance in a 10-minute period. This release rate is then evaluated using modeling techniques and/or reference tables to define the distance to a specified endpoint (concentration or overpressure). The distance to the endpoint is affected by several factors including molecular weight, volatility, heat of combustion, and physical settin"

      "SummaryText": "g (urban or rural).\n\nThe alternative-case release scenario for each covered process must be one that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario and that reaches an endpoint offsite, unless no such scenario exists. The alternative release scenario is evaluated using the same techniques as the worst-case scenario to define the distance to the specified endpoint.\n\nUnder 40 CFR 68 Subpart B ?68.22(e), the RMP rule identifies surface roughness as a parameter to be used in the hazard assessment to determine the physical setting of the site, urban or rural.  \"Urban means there are many obstacles in the immediate area; obstacles include buildings or trees.  Rural means there are no buildings in the immediate area and the terrain is generally flat and unobstructed.\"\n\nNo trees, hills, and/or other structures are located in the immediate vicinity of the Santa Teresa, New Mexico facility; therefore, a rural dispersion environmental was assumed.\n\nAmmonia\n\nThe data provided in the document \"Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration\" (May 1996) was used to estimate the toxic endpoint distance for the worst-case and alternative-case ammonia release scenarios. The EPA's \"RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance\" (May 1996) was not used to determine the toxic endpoint since it classifies ammonia as a \"neutrally buoyant gas.\" The worst-case ammonia release scenario would involve liquid and would come from a pressurized liquid system; therefore, the released gas should be classified as a \"dense gas\" (a result of evaporative cooling). The ammonia refrigeration document provides calculated endpoint distances for typical meteorological conditions.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for an anhydrous ammonia release is a release of all the contents of the high-pressure receiver tank in a 10-minute period (per EPA guidelines). This release translates to a release of 8,988 pounds of ammonia in 10 minutes or 899 lbs/min. Other assumptions included in the worst-"

The results of the worst-case scenario for an ammonia release shows that the plume must travel 1.68 miles (2.70 kilometers) before dispersing to the endpoint concentration of 200 ppm.  Figure 1-3 details the ammonia worst-case release zone.\n\n\n\nThe selected alternative-case release scenario for the ammonia system is a release from an ammonia relief valve due to overpressurizing a 1 1/4-inch line under a 300 psig pressure extending from a condenser. The largest relief valve has a relief rate of 64.12 pounds of air per minute (lbs/min).  As a matter of convention, the specified release rate of any relief valve is always in pounds of air per minute.  The release rate of 64.12 (lbs/min) correlates into a release rate of 45.5 pounds of ammonia vapor per minute.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration document provides calculated endpoint distances for typical meteorological conditions (3 m/s wind speed, D atmospheric stability, 50% relative humidity).  It has been determined, through a review of Reuben's operational history, that the total release would likely be 455 pounds or less of ammonia.  Based on the release rate of 46 lbs/min, the duration for a 455-lbs/min release is 10 minutes.  Other assumptions include, no active or passive mitigation measures are currently in place and a rural dispersion environment in the nearfield.  The results of the alternative-case release scenario for an ammonia release indicate that the endpoint concentration of 200 ppm is reached at 0.13 mile (209 meters) from the release point.  Figure 1-4 details the ammonia alternative release zone.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Santa Teresa, New Mexico facility is governed by a set of O"

Key personnel are responsible for conducting and implementing the findings from the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for the ammonia system.  Reuben employees are also members of the facility emergency response team.

Each new employee is provided comprehensive safety training during his or her initial orientation for the facility.

These personnel receive annual training on emergency procedures and response techniques, including training that is conducted as part of the hazardous communication training that incorporates emergency drills.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nReuben completes a thorough review of the ammonia system each time a design change is implemented.
