The Facility Policy\n\n           The owners, management and employees of New Sharon, Iowa are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n           The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n           Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application.  Anhydrous ammonia is used for crop production nutrients.  \n           The maximum quantity of ammonia stored would be 397,396 pounds in our 30,000 gallon storage tank and nurse tanks. The maximum quantity of a tank truck would be  handled would be 40,000 pounds   \n\n3. The accidental release prevention program.\n\n            The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the Standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \" Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". In addition, Iowa Dept. of Ag Rules.

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the facility's release prevention program.                                                                                                                                                              (1) Safety information:  the facility was designed and constructed in accordandce with applicable Federal and State of Iowa regulations.  All plans and procedures maintained ath the facility are periodically reviewed by facility management for safety updates and changes.  MSDS sheets, equipment specifications and the codes and standards used to build and operate the NH3 equipment are maintained at thefacility                                                                                                                                                             \n(2)  Hazard Review:  Facility management conducts reviews or the hazards associated with the handling and storage of NH3.  The reviews identify the opportunity for equipment malfunctions or human errors the could cause an accidental release, the safeguards to control hazards and prevent releases, and the steps used to detect or monitor releases.  The results of the reviews are documented and problems identified are addressed in a timely manner.                                                                                                       (3)  Operating Procedures:  The facility maintains written operating procedures for the handling and storage of NH3.  The procedures gennerally follow the provisions of OSHA standard, 29 CFR1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of NH3\" and the ANSI standard, \"Safety Requirements for the storage and Handling of NH3, K-61.1.  The written procedures are reviewed by facility management on a regular basis and revised as necessary.         "

Initial training for new employees consists of classroom type instruction(e.g. reading safety information, operating procedure and response followed by a written test.)  and on-the-job supervision.  Refresher training for all employess is condusted once a year.  The training program is reviewed by facility management and revised as necessary.                                                                                                                                        (5)  Maintenance:  The facility maintains written equipment inspection and maintance procedures.  Storage and transfer/process equipment inspections are preformed by qualified personnel on an approximate annual basis and ar documented.  Equipment maintenance procedures follow either instrustions furnished by the equipment vendors, Fed or State regulations or industry codes.  The written procedures are reviewed by facility management on a regular basis and revised as necessary.                                             (6)  Compliance Audits:  As required by the RMP rule, compliance audits will be preformed at least once every 3 years.  The audit will be documented and conducted by a person knowledgeable in the safe handling and storage of NH3.  Corrective actions required as a result of each compliance audit will be prformed promtptly and documented.                                                                                                                 (7)  Incident Investigation:  Facility management will investigate each incident that results in, or could have reasonably resulted in a catastrophic release of NH3.  The investigation will be preformed to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as corrective actions to prevent the release from roccurr"

The Five-year Accident History.\n\n             a. There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n                 have caused any death, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility:  nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injures, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n5.   The emergency response program: In the event of an emergency, it is the facility protocol to notify the local fire department and othe emergency responders and request they respond to the emergency.  Facility employeeswill not respond to accidental releases of NH3 except for those that are small or incidental, can be controlled at the time of the release by employees in the immediate release area(e.g., shutting a valve) and do not appear to pose an immediate sfety or health hazard.  This protocol has been discussed with the local fire department and the other emergency responders and the facility has appropriate mechanisms in place to notify the emergency responders when there is a need for a response.  The facility is also included in the written community emergency response plan developed ender the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act.\n\n                 the facility has:\na.  A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb.  Provide state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\nc.  Coordinated with local emergency responders.\n\n6.
