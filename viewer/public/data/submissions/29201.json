It is our policy to ensure that the entire handling process for the NGL product stored and loaded onsite will always be a minimal hazard situation.\nIt is also our policy to minimize abnormal process operations by providing alarms and callouts for key process variables to ensure that remediation of any important deviations are cause for operator response and action in a timely manner.\nDew Point Control will be supervising the removal of Natural Gas Liquids from the site by experienced and trained haulers to ensure safe technique and verification of the Kinder Morgan Condensate and Propane Loading procedures and safety policies already in place system wide.  Some specific details of these items are presented below.\nAdditionally, DPC gives blanket authority to operations staff at all levels to initiate a shutdown of operations when a potentially hazardous condition or accidental release, in their sole judgment, is imminent.  Proper engineering assistance to evaluate and alleviate the hazard or avoid the release is available to the operations staff on a 24/7 basis.\nNo smoking will be allowed on any part of the site.\nDew Point Control follows OIA and other industry recognized standards for equipment and hazardous area spacing, specifically in the electrical area, to minimize risks of ignition.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nHankamer Station No. 9 is located in Hankamer, Texas, U.S.A and is an unmanned facility.  Its purpose and function is to refrigerate a natural gas stream in order to remove natural gas liquids (predominantly gasoline and heavier components) detrimental to the safe transportation and subsequent uses of the gas.  The process consists mainly of heat transfer and separation equipment, and mechanical refrige"

The resultant condensed liquid hydrocarbons are then removed via conventional separation technique, directed to pressure storage tanks, and periodically removed from the site via pressurized tank trucks.  The resultant drier natural gas vapor is returned to the pipeline after being reheated by the inlet gas stream.\n\nThe facility contains one flammable mixture above threshold quantity.  The facility contains only one covered process for the purpose of this plan.  \n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nThe hazard assessment for the flammable mixture Worst Case Scenario (WCS) was modeled using the EPA equation for flammable mixtures.   The WCS associated with the release of flammable substances at the facility is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of two storage vessels containing a flammable mixture. In this case, the full inventory of both vessels is assumed to be released, completely vaporized, and ignited, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  Although there are controls on each of these storage vessels to prevent such releases and to manage the consequences should one occur, no credit for administrative controls for mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS.  Furthermore, the WCS does not have any offsite impacts of public receptors.\n\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n(1) Valves are provided on all inlets and outlets of the NGL tanks to provide positive means of isolating each one. Automated as well as manually actuated fail/safe valves are provided to minimize release upon hose or pipe rupture, or tank truck driveway while connected to loading connections/hoses.\n(2) Alarms are provided via a SCADA system that give early indication of approaching process operating limits and provide opportunity for operator intervention.\n(3) Pressure control devices are provided by the operating partner, Kinder Morgan, which will initiate an automated bypass of the facility should plugging by freezing,"

Dew Point Control, L.L.C. will coordinate with the Chambers County Emergency Mngmnt to prepare for an emergency response from a release.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nSeveral additional process and storage remote monitoring systems are planned for post-startup, including the remote readout of NGL tank inventories."
