This commitment is reflected in the safety and environmental programs that are implemented at the facility.  For example, written procedures have been created for operating the ammonia process, and only trained personnel are permitted to operate the system.  Southwest Cheese has also developed a robust maintenance program to ensure the equipment is in good operating condition.  All of these programs are geared towards the prevention of an accidental release at the facility.  In addition, these programs incorporate emergency procedures to mitigate the effects of a release if it does occur.  At such an event, emergency coordinators will assess the situation and notify outside responding agencies as necessary.\n\n\n\nIn addition, Southwest Cheese has developed an Emergency Action Plan which detail the notification and evacuation procedures in the event of a release.  Drills are conducted regularly to test the effectiveness of the Plan and evaluations of the Plan are completed and reviewed.  Sprinkler systems and fire extinguishers are installed throughout the facility and are inspected and maintained as required.\n\n\n\nStationary Source\n\nThe Southwest Cheese Company facility is a joint venture between Glanbia Foods, Select Milk Producers (SMP) and Dairy Farmers of America (DFA).  Glanbia is responsible for running the plant production, warehousing, and distribution, while SMP and DFA guarantee the milk requirements of the plant, which are approximately 14.1 million pounds milk per day.  The 300,000 square foot facility lies on a 3,000-acre site southwest of the town of Clovis, New Mexico.\n\n\n\nConsidered to be North America's largest cheddar cheese production plant, the facility produces blocks of cheese weighing up to 640 pounds.  Annual production reaches 551 million pounds of cheese and 34 million pounds of whey prot"

Bonelli & Associates of Oakland, California.  Dahlgren Group of Seattle, Washington and the Carlisle Group from Minnesota constructed the plant.  Applied Process Cooling Corporation (APCCO) of Modesto, California designed and installed the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nThe Southwest Cheese Company plant is located at 1141 Curry Road 4 about six miles south of Clovis and Highways 60/84 and about two miles west of Highway 70.  The Clovis site was chosen for its proximity to a large, well-developed dairy producing region.  The plant is surrounded by approximately 100 acres of grassland and wheat and there are two large dairies about 2 miles away.\n\n\n\nClovis lies nine miles west of the Texas border town of Texico in Curry County in east-central New Mexico.  There are approximately 35,000 people living in Clovis, which was incorporated in 1909.  Prevailing winds are from the south and southeast.\n\n\n\nRegulated Substance Handled\n\nThe single stage system has been designed with six (6) Vilter screw compressor packages and four (4) rooftop BAC evaporative condensers.  Screw compressor oil cooling is accomplished with a thermosiphon cooling recirculation arrangement using a thermosiphon receiver and liquid from the condenser drain line.\n\n\n\nHigh pressure liquid ammonia is drained from the evaporative condensers to the high-pressure receiver.  The receiver provides liquid to the recirculator vessel for direct cooling in the evaporator coils via the recirculator package ammonia pumps.  A liquid transfer vessel returns excess pumped liquid to the high-pressure receiver.  The recirculator package also provides liquid for glycol cooling via three(3) glycol heat exchangers.  A fourth heat exchanger utilizes liquid ammonia for polishing water cooling.\n\n\n\nThere is a single oil pot in the system at the recirculator.  The ve"

An auto purger removes non-condensibles and air as required to maintain an efficient refrigeration process.\n\n\n\nEvaporator piping and valve trains are located on the roof, while the evaporators are located in rooftop penthouse units above the storage cooling and rapid cooling areas.  The evaporator coils are defrosted with hot gas from the high stage discharge line.\n\n\n\nA Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) and compressor microprocessors provide system management and control.  Level columns are provided on most vessels and most level columns have level switches and alarms as necessary.  Additional safeguards include an emergency shutdown system, ventilation and detection, manual stop valves, and compressor safety cutouts.\n\n\n\nSouthwest Cheese has increased its production of whey and cheese which demanded more storage space and refrigeration, therefore the reason behind the necessary RMP update.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nSouthwest Cheese has developed an accidental release prevention program for compliance with OSHA's PSM and EPA's RMP regulations.  The program includes but is not limited to the following elements:\n\n\n\n?    Safety information regarding the chemical hazards, and operating and technical specifications for the equipment;\n\n?

Relief valves are installed on pressurized ammonia vessels to prevent equipment rupture in the event of overpressurization.  Regular inspections and tests are performed to ensure these controls are in good working order.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nA review of the facility's five year accident history showed that there have been no incidents at the facility that meet the RMP criteria for a reportable accident (onsite deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place). \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nSouthwest Cheese has developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) for the purpose of protecting employees and the surrounding community in the event of an uncontrolled release of ammonia.  The EAP covers procedures for: 1) evacuating and accounting for visitors and employees, 2) handling chemical releases and other foreseeable emergencies that could occur onsite, and 3) notifying external agencies.  Employees perform drills and receive annual refresher training on the EAP.  \n\n\n\nSouthwest Cheese has also coordinated with the local emergency responders and will maintain regularly-scheduled familiarization tours to ensure that the responders are familiar with the system and with the general safety and accidental release program at our plant.
