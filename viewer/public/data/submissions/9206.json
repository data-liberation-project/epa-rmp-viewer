Accidental Release Prevention and Emegency Response Policies.\n\nSacramento Chemical Co, Inc. stores and repackages chlorine which is considered a hazardous material that is a regulated subtanceand is considered in the Risk Management Plan (RMP). The properties of chlorine make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent human exposure, and to reduce the threat tothe facility's workers and nearby members of the community. It is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the safe procedures used to handle chlorine; the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of the pertinent personnel.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nSacramento Chemical Co, Inc. provides chlorination services to swimming pools. Chlorine is repackaged at the facility from one ton chlorine containers to 20 pound capacity service cylinders. The 20 pound service cylinders are used by Sacramento Chemical Co, Inc. service staff to chlorine customer swimming pools. The facility operates five days per week (M-F), ten hours per day for fifty weeks per year.\n\nThe facility consists of two separate buildings. One building is a dedicated office building and the other building is used exclusively for the repackaging of chlorine.  \n\nThe amount of chlorine repackaged per month is seasonally dependent. The summer months, for \nobvious reasons, are the busiest time of the year. Consequently, the quantity of chlorine on site is \nhighest during this period. Sacramento Chemical Co, Inc. stores a maximum of 8000 pounds of chlorine.\nThis amount includes the contents of 2 one ton containers, 88 twenty pound cylinders, and the one-ton container in the repackaging process.\n\nChlorine is purchased from and delivered by commercial chlorine suppliers. Delivery of one- ton containers is during normal working hours. The one- ton containers, up to a maximum of 3 ar"

Any residual chlorine in small diameter, short length piping is directed to a \nLiquid caustic absorption scrubber. The twenty- pound cylinders are transported by company services \npersonnel to customers' swimming pools where the services personnel dispense the chlorine as a gas \ninto the pool. The twenty- pound cylinders are owned by the company and maintenance is performed in \naccordance with the Chlorine Institute's Pamphlet 17 Cylinder and Ton Container Procedures for \nChlorine Packaging.\n\nOff-loading of the one- ton chlorine containers from the commercial delivery vehicle is accomplished with\na hoist. The one- ton containers are placed on the rails in the chlorine building (Fill Yard). The one- ton \ncontainer are then manually rolled to the desired rail location and chocked to prevent movement.\nEmpty and full twenty pound cylinders are segregated and are chained or strapped in place in an upright\nposition. The company has administrative procedures in place that limits the amount of chlorine at the \nfacility to no more than 3 one- ton containers and 88 twenty- pound cylinders for a total of 8000 pounds.\nThe procedure, in part requires, the owner/operator to verify existing chlorine inventory to ensure that an\norder and delivery of a one ton container will not cause the aggregate quantity to exceed 8000 pounds.\n\nThe driveway and yard area provides adequate room for the delivery and parking of delivery vehicles during the off-loading of full one-ton containers and the loading of the empty one-ton containers.The entire facility is fenced with a locking gate.
