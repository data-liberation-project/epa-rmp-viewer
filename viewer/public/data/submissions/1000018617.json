WIC has engineered  safety\ninto its processes including those utilizing chlorine, sulfur dioxide and anhydrous ammonia.  Continuous monitoring includes temperature and pressure sensors that are interlocked with control valves and shutoffs.  The technicians perform hourly observations that are written on logs.  The pressure relief valves are subject to a regular maintenance schedule.  The storage tanks have been tested for mechanical integrity.  WIC believes that preventative maintenance is the key to minimizing the potential for accidental releases.  Standard Operating Procedures have been reviewed and revised to enable the employees to perform their work in a safe and efficient manner.\n\nWIC has taken steps to educate and inform the operators, supervisors, and maintenance crews in the appropriate response to an accidental release.  The training includes classroom training and operating procedures on the proper response to emergency situations. \n\nThe Woodward Iodine plant recovers iodine from subterranean brine from the Lower Morrow Brine Sandstone through the use of a series of production wells that average 7500 feet in depth. As the water arrives at the plant the iodine is in the form of NaI or sodium iodide.  Chlorine gas is injected into the brine oxidizing the iodide to free iodine.  The free iodine is blown out or stripped from the brine and then reabsorbed in a vessel containing sulfur dioxide and water.  The reduced iodide is concentrated in the form of an acid.  At this p"

The process liquor is then fed to a crystallizer where gaseous chlorine reacts with the hydriodic acid to form solid iodine crystals.  The iodine is melted, cooled and packaged in prill or flake form and packaged in  saran and poly liners within fiber drums. \n\nThe effluent brine is acidified upon entering the plant to increase the iodide blow out efficiency and the pH must be brought back up to a neutral of 7.  A side stream of gaseous anhydrous ammonia is used for this purpose. Sulfur dioxide is also used at this point to scavenge any oxygen remaining in the water.  Following treatment the brine is filtered and pumped into disposal and injection wells .\n\nWIC has complied with and documented Process Safety Information pursuant to regulations set forth in the Clean Air Act and the OSHA PSM standard.  In conjunction with the Process Hazard Assessment WIC has completed a compilation of written process safety information in order to enable our supervisors and employees who operate the processes to identify and understand the hazards posed by processes involving highly hazardous chemicals.  The processes involving highly hazardous chemicals are continuously monitored by instrumentation and personnel.  WIC has these processes tied to control systems and alarms in the case of deviation from optimum process levels.\n\nIn the last 5 years, there have not been any accidental releases from the covered processes that resulted in deaths injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nThe employees at WIC have been trained in the event of a release of a hazardous substance.
