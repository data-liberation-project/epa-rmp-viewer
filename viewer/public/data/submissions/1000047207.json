The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 130,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint(point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.1 miles.  B. The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from the break in the transfer hose, This would result in a release of 12,000 pounds over a 2 minute time span until manual shut off could be completed.
