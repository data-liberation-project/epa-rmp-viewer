Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nWe are committed to conducting our activities with the highest regard for environmental, health, safety, and community well-being. All applicable laws and regulations are adhered to with special emphasis on environmental and safety standards.  Our comprehensive accidental release prevention program covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training.  If a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nOur facility's primary activities are the manufacture of cumene.  We handle two risk management plan rule substances at our facility, propylene and propane.  We receive and store propylene and propane together as a mixture (P/P mix), so they are covered together as a flammable mixture for purposes of our risk management plan.  The propylene in the P/P mix is used to produce cumene, while the propane passes through our process and is sold.  We bring in P/P mix by tank truck, railcar, and pipeline. Propane is shipped from our facility primarely by pipeline, but can also be exported via tank truck.\n\n\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\n\n\nINEOS's worst case and alternative release scenarios do not impact any homes, schools, or hospitals.  The scenarios could, however impact our employees and our industrial neighbors. The following paragraphs provide details of the two scenarios.\n\n\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario (WCS)\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release from a storage sphere.  The sphere is a vessel used for the storage of a pressurized liquefied mixture of prop"

      "SummaryText": "ylene and propane feed (P/P Mix).  The scenario involves a release of P/P mix, which finds an ignition source and develops into a vapor cloud explosion. \n\n\n\nSeveral unlikely events must occur for this worst case scenario to materialize.  The sphere would have to be completely full; the 1 1/4 inch-thick steel walls of the sphere would have to fail instantaneously; all of the liquid material in the sphere would have to form a vapor cloud within 10 minutes; all of our safety systems would have to simultaneously fail; all our personnel would have to do nothing to contain or stop the release; specific weather conditions, which would tend to keep any vapor cloud confined and concentrated, would have to be present.  In the improbable event that each and every one of these conditions was to occur, the maximum distance to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure would still not reach any homes, schools, or hospitals.  \n\n\n\nAlthough the EPA does not allow companies to consider any active safety measures when analyzing the worst case scenario, INEOS has a number of safety systems in place to prevent a release from ever occurring at the sphere.  The sphere meets strict design and construction standards.  It is constructed of 1 1/4 inch-thick steel and wrapped with a 4-inch-thick layer of insulation to help control the temperature and pressure inside the sphere. To prevent the vessel from over pressuring and releasing, the sphere has two relief valves.  These valves are inspected and tested in accordance with current standards and good engineering practice applicable.  An automatic isolation valve is located on the discharge of the sphere to shut off flow if there is a rupture downstream of the valve.  Numerous instrument alarms are in place to warn of potential equipment malfunction, including multiple pump malfunction alarms and automatic shutdowns on the sphere pumps.  Remote valves are installed to isolate and limit any release from the sphere, including a check valve on the sphere "

In addition, we have a facility-wide leak detection and repair program to identify and repair leaks before they could ever result in an emergency.  This program includes scheduled monitoring of pumps, valves, connectors, and other equipment using portable hydrocarbon leak detectors.  When a leak is found, it is repaired and remonitored to verify that it is leak free.\n\n\n\nAlternate Scenario (AS)\n\nINEOS's alternative release scenario involves the failure of a two-inch diameter P/P mix railcar unloading vapor hose.  In the scenario, propylene and propane are released from an unloading hose, followed by a vapor cloud explosion.  Like the worst case scenario, the maximum distance to the endpoint of 1 psi overpressure would not reach any homes, schools, or hospitals.  \n\n\n\nINEOS has installed safety systems to prevent a railcar unloading hose failure from ever occurring.  The stainless steel-braided hoses used at INEOS exceed the design and construction requirements for our railcar unloading conditions.  Hoses are inspected prior to each use and fittings are replaced whenever indications of visible wear are present.  Railcar grounds are used to prevent any static discharge.\n\n\n\nThere is a relief valve on every P/P mix railcar to prevent the railcar and unloading hose from over pressuring.  We have instrument alarms to warn of potential equipment malfunction and equipment shutdowns to shut off flow.  Each unloading station is monitored via closed circuit television from a manned control room.  An automatic shutoff valve is located on each railcar to shut off flow if the unloading hose fails.  We have multiple remote block valves, check valves, and a control valve that can shut off flow to the railcar unloading line to isolate and limit any release.  \n\n\n\n4.
