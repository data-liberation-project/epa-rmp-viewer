      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThe City Brewing Company, LLC stores ANHYDROUS AMMONIA at the City Brewery in an amount that \nexceeds the threshold established by EPA for Risk Management Planning.  The City Brewing Company, \nLLC believes that risks associated with ANHYDROUS AMMONIA storage at this facility are well managed.\n\nSOURCE AND PROCESS DESCRIPTION\nRefrigeration is a critical component of malt beverage production.  Refrigeration is required for chilling water \nand beer, and for controlling air temperature in storage cellars.  Refrigeration is provided through \nevaporation of liquid anhydrous ammonia by a heat source.  Evaporated ammonia gas is contained in \nclosed loop system where it is mechanically compressed back into a liquid state for re-use on demand.  \nLiquid ammonia is moved by system pressure from storage through piping to locations where refrigeration \nis needed.\n\nSUMMARY OF MAJOR HAZARDS\nAmmonia is a hazardous substance.  As a gas, it is severely irritating to the eyes and moist skin and \nmucous membranes.  As a liquid, contact can cause freezing and third degree burns.  Exposure to \nconcentrations of ammonia gas or vapor (approximately 2,500 to 6,500 ppm) for up to two hours induce \nchemical pneumonitis; burns to the eyes, face and mouth; severe local edema (fluid in lungs); and death \nafter 30 minutes.\n\nThe consequence of equipment failure or improper control of refrigeration system temperature and \npressure could be a sudden release of ammonia.  In the refrigeration system, ammonia is stored as a \nliquid under pressure, then evaporated into a low pressure gas-vapor state as it cools its intended heat \nsource (latent heat of vaporization), then compressed into a high pressure gas state, and then \ncondensed by by evaporative condensers once again into a liquified state and returned to storage.  \nAccidental release of ammonia could occur during any of these system processes.\n\nAn accidental release of liquid ammonia under elevated pressure would created an airbor"

      "SummaryText": "ne mixture of \nammonia vapor and very fine liquid droplets that would not fall to the ground.  The droplets would entrain \nair quickly as they try to evaporate.  Evaporation of the droplets would cool the air creating a cold \nmixture of air and ammonia vapor.  The mixture would be denser than air forming a cloud that would \ntend to stay at ground level until evaporation to a gas was complete.  A release of liquid ammonia inside \na building would cause an initial overpressure condition due to flash vapor expansion and underpressure \ncondition due to air cooling from droplet interaction.  Instantaneous over- or under-pressure greater than \none pound per square inch (psi) could cause explosion effects such as structural damage to windows \nand blowout panels; greater than 2 psi could cause explosion effects such as shattering of concrete or \ncinder block walls.  In addition, ammonia can be explosive at concentrations between 15% and 25% by \nvolume in air with ignition by a high intensity source.\n\nAn accidental release of gaseous ammonia vapor at various temperature and pressure would create a \nbuoyant ammonia jet less dense than air.  The rate of release would be much less than that of liquid \nammonia.\n\nCONSEQUENCES OF FAILURE TO CONTROL THE HAZARDS\nEPA has established a toxic endpoint value of 200 ppm as the maximum airborne concentration below \nwhich an individual could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing serious health effects or \nsymptoms that would impair the ability of an individual to self rescue.\n\nA worst case release senario at the facility is defined as the release of 56,300 pounds of liquid \nanhydrous ammonia from a liquid storage receiver which represents the largest single container (vessel) \nat the facility.  According to a computer program (RMP Comp) an accidental release of 56,300 pounds \nof ammonia within a 10 minute period would reach a toxic endpoint at a distance of 2.8 miles.

Safety shutoff valves would activate in this instance as a \nrelease control.  Ammonia system operating pressure is 150 psi and at this pressure the release \nwould be 540 pounds per minute for a 1/2 inch diameter hole.  According to a computer program (RMP \nComp) a release of 540 pounds of ammonia for 10 minutes would reach a toxic endpoint at a distance of \n0.2 miles.  According to a 1991 Bureau of Census computer database (Landview III), the more likely \nalternative release would affect a population of 280 people, residences, and commercial, office, or \nindustrial areas within this radius.\n\nIn either release senario, release would not affect any environmental receptor such as a park, forest, \nmonument, wildlife sanctuary, preserve, refuge, or Federal wilderness area.\n\n5 YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere has not been any accidental release of ammonia from the refrigeration system since 1994 that \ncaused any of the following:\n* On-site death, injury, or significant property damage.\n* Known offsite death, injury, property damage, environmental damage, evacuation, or sheltering in \nplace.\n\nEXPLANATION OF HOW RELEASES ARE PREVENTED\nOverall responsibility for coordination of the Ammonia Refrigeration System Risk Management Plan \nis assigned to the Director of Plant Engineering.
