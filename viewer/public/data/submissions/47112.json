      "SummaryText": "a. Alloys Cleaning, Inc. is committed to the safety and well-being of its employees, suppliers customers, and the public. Its policy is to implement reasonable measures to prevent a release of hazardous material from occurring, to provide early detection of a release in the unlikely event that one would occur, and to have in place a contingency plan to respond promptly yet safely to such a release.\n\nb. The Risk Management Plan (RMP) has been prepared to address the hydrofluoric acid process at the Alloys Cleaning, Inc. facility located at 1929 E. 64th Street, Los Angeles, CA 90001.\n\nc. A prevention program is in place meeting the regulatory requirements for a Program 2 Risk Management Program. Physical safeguards to prevent a release include best industry practices for the design and construction of vessels, equipment, and piping, and various procedural safeguards.\n\nd. There have been no accidents involving hydrofluoric acid within the five (5) years prior to submission of this RMP.\n\ne. The hydrofluoric acid operations involve delivery of drums, unloading to a contained area protected by a scrubbing system, and use in dip tanks. Delivery and transfer is supervised and both delivery and facility personnel are trained and equipped to deal safely with spills. If it is determined that the situation requires emergency response per Cal-OSHA regulations, Title 8, Section 5192, Los Angeles County Fire Department will be summoned, neighbors notified and the facility will be promptly and safely evacuated.\n\nf. A comprehensive Hazard Review was performed during the design phase of the process. Since the design already incorporated numerous safeguards, no major changes need to be made to improve safety. Minor changes were incorporated directly in the design."
