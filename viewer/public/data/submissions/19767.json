In this way we promote overall plant, worker, and public safety.  These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\nOur safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities.  \nOur safety program prevents accidents because it focuses on the rules, procedures, training, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and are improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at this facility.\n\nRegulated substances utilized at Caulkins Indiantown Citrus covered under this regulation include the following:             1.  Anhydrous Ammonia\n                             2.  Peracetic Acid\n\nWorst-case scenario:\nThe worst-case scenario would be a failure of the high pressure receiver containing 17600 pounds of anhydrous ammonia releasing its entire contents over a 10 minute period.  Using the EPA accepted method (RMP Comp) for determining the distance ammonia could travel before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public would be 1.6 miles.\nThis scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:  industry standards for the manufacture and quality control of pressure vessels;  ammonia is not corrosive in this service; pressure safety valves limit operating pressure in the vessels; the a"
