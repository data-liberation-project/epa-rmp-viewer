      "SummaryText": "The Azle Processing Plant (Azle Plant) utilizes more than the threshold quantity of a ?regulated flammable substance (10,000 pounds)? in the processing of natural gas, where natural gas liquids (NGL) are extracted from the inlet gas using a propane refrigeration process and treated by an amine unit prior to being delivered to the pipeline for further market distribution. Therefore, this facility is subject to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 (40 CFR 68) administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n\nThe Azle Plant is also subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration?s (OSHA?s) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and public receptors are located within the worst-case release scenario for the plant. Therefore, the Azle Plant is subject to Program 3 requirements as stated in 40 CFR 68.10. OSHA?s PSM standard closely parallels requirements outlined in USEPA?s RMP Rule. All elements required by USEPA?s 40 CFR 68 ? Program 3 Prevention Program are also required by OSHA?s PSM. \n\nThe Azle Plant is a newly constructed facility; therefore, it has not had an accidental release of a regulated substance where exposure to the substance, its reaction products, overpressure generated by an explosion involving the substance, or radiant heat generated by a fire involving the substance led to any off-site death, injury, or response or restoration activities for an exposure of an environmental receptor. \n\nAt the initial stages of operation, the Azle Plant will employ four (4) full-time employees on-site who will ensure the proper operation and maintenance of the facility. \n\nThe following information serves as the 2006 RMP submission for the Azle Plant.  \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Azle Plant maintains a policy of safe NGL extraction operations, reducing to the greatest extent possible hazards associated with the extract"

NGL is a regulated flammable mixture that is an aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon mixture. The regulated flammable chemicals contained in the NGL mixture include methane, ethane, propane, isobutane, N-butane, isopentane, and N-pentane. The maximum inventory of NGL at the facility at any given time is 60,742 gallons (252,803 lbs). The Azle Plant also utilizes propane, a regulated flammable substance, as part of the process. The propane is handled in various aboveground vessels and associated piping and valves. The maximum inventory of propane at the facility at any given time is 7,453 gallons (31,348 lbs).\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Azle Plant maintains a consistent accidental release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases of NGL or propane. As previously indicated, the Prevention Program required under 40 CFR 68 is identical to the prevention program required under OSHA?s PSM. The Azle Plant?s Prevention Program 3 elements, as required under 40 CFR 68 Subpart D, are included in the facility?s PSM Plan, which is kept on-site as a separate document. Required elements include: \n\n?    Employee Participation\n?    Process Safety Information\n?    Process Hazard Analysis\n?    Operating Procedures\n?    Training\n?    Contractors\n?

Further safety information is also detailed in the ESSP. In addition, operating procedures and equipment design codes and standards associated with the operations at the facility are maintained. Furthermore, the facility has coordinated the emergency response plan with the Parker County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Parker County Sheriff?s Department. The Parker County Sheriff?s Department is designated as the first responder in the event of NGL and/or propane release.  For these reasons, the Azle Plant meets the exceptions listed in 40 CFR 68.90(b) and therefore the facility is not required to have the Emergency Response Program of 40 CFR 68.95. \n\nA site map, MSDSs, and a list of chemicals kept on-site are maintained at the facility. Complete details on the Emergency Response Program required under the PSM Rules are included in the Azle Plant?s PSM Plan, which is kept on-site as a separate document.  \n\nSAFETY IMPROVEMENTS\n\nMaintenance checks, compliance audits, management of change procedures, and incident investigations will identify changes to improve safety. The Azle Plant has a continued commitment to update equipment and improve safety pertaining to the covered process when necessary."
