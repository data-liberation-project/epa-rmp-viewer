Liquid chlorine is transferred by its own pressure from an on-line storage vessel in each storage bay to one or more evaporators in each evaporator room.\r\n\r\nEach evaporator uses an electrically heated water bath to vaporize the liquid chlorine.  The chlorinators regulate the flow of chlorine gas (under vacuum) through venturi eduction to the ejectors.

The Jensen Plant ensures effective operating and maintenance practices by combining them with operating and maintenance training programs.  Standard operating procedures (SOPs) provide system descriptions, specifications, equipment inspection requirements, and operating procedures for the chlorine system.  The operating procedures include connection/disconnection for chlorine storage vessel, start-up and shutdown for chlorine evaporators, after maintenance start-up for chlorine evaporators, maintenance shutdown for chlorine evaporators, start-up and shutdown for ejectors, start-up and shutdown for chlorinators, chlorine system emergency shutdown, start-up following an emergency shutdown, and temporary operations.

This system allows Jensen Plant staff to identify and review safety hazards or provide additional safety, process, or chemical information to existing data before the proposed change would either compromise system safety or need training to be completed.\r\n\r\nInternal Compliance Audits\r\n\r\nInternal compliance audits are conducted every 3 years to verify compliance with the programs and procedures contained in the RMP.  The Jensen Plant assembles an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the Risk Management Program rule and in the process.  This team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the Risk Management Program rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process.  The results of the audit are documented, and a plan is developed to resolve the recommendations and implement appropriate enhancements to the prevention program.  \r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nJensen Plant investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release (serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment) so that similar accidents can be prevented.  If required, an investigation team is assembled and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.  Information found during the investigation is reviewed by affected staff and added or used to revise operating and maintenance procedures.  There have been no such incidents involving the Jensen Plant chlorine system.\r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History Summary\r\n\r\nNo chlorine releases that caused or could have caused safety or health hazard (deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place)"

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\nThe Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD) distributes drinking water to member water agencies throughout Southern California.  MWD provides approximately 60 percent of the drinking water used by nearly 16 million people living on the southern California coastal plain between Ventura County and the Mexican border.\r\n\r\nDisinfection is a critical process used by MWD in the treatment of its drinking water.  Disinfection helps to protect public health by killing pathogens in the water and preventing the spread of waterborne diseases.  The use of chlorine as a disinfectant in the treatment of drinking water and wastewater has been the dominant disinfection method in the United States since it was introduced, around the beginning of the previous century.  MWD currently utilizes bulk chlorine for disinfection at all of its water treatment plants, including the Joseph Jensen Water Treatment Plant (Jensen Plant).\r\n\r\nAs one might expect from its superior disinfection properties, chlorine is a hazardous substance.  Thus, storing and handling chlorine can present a risk to employees and the public without proper precautions.  MWD regards safe practices in the storing and usage of chlorine to be of primary importance and has an excellent safety record with chlorine.  To further safe practices, MWD has constructed a Chlorine Containment and Handling Facility at Jensen Plant to contain all chlorine inside a building which is protected by vapor scrubbers.\r\n\r\nJensen Plant's chlorine storage and usage process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule (RMPR) and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program regulation.  Both of these regulations require submission of a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  An integral part of the RMP is a summary of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility, including a description of the possible consequences in case of an accident"

All applicable procedures of the State of California and EPA's RMP Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response.

The plant is situated south of the Golden State Freeway (I-5) and Antelope Valley Freeway (14) junction.  The facility was constructed in 1972 and covers 232 acres.  The plant is designed to treat drinking water, including disinfection with chlorine.  The facility currently stores and uses chlorine, a regulated toxic substance under the RMPR and CalARP Program rules, as well as the Federal and Cal"

      "SummaryText": "occurred at the Jensen Plant during the last five years.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program Summary\r\n\r\nJensen Plant is a non-responding facility and, as such, does not have an emergency response plan.  Jensen Plant has Technician Level HAZWOPER-trained plant employees who will respond only to incidental chlorine releases.  Jensen Plant also includes employees trained in Incident Command System.  Depending on the severity of the accidental release, external hazardous materials response agencies, such as the Los Angeles City Fire Department Hazardous Materials Response Team, will be called to handle a chlorine release.  Jensen Plant coordinates with local response agencies (Los Angeles City Fire Department) to help ensure that they are familiar with the Jensen Plant Chlorine System and its emergency requirements and that it is reflected in their Area Plans.  Specially trained Jensen Plant employees will be available during such a chlorine emergency to provide technical support to fire department responders.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nNumerous changes to improve safety (recommended actions) were previously identified for the chlorine process in 1991, 1994, 1995, 1998 and 2003, when Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) conducted under the California Risk Management and Prevention Program (RMPP) guidelines, Process Safety Management Program and Risk Management Program were prepared for the Jensen Plant.  These recommended actions have been evaluated and implemented as required. Of the changes proposed, most prominent among them was a Chlorine Containment and Handling Facility to contain all chlorine inside a building which is protected by vapor scrubbers - a significant additional safety enhancement and risk reduction measure. A PHA was conducted in January 2006 as part of the chlorine containment and scrubber modification project.  In November 2010 the PHA was reviewed and updated.  The recommended actions to further improve the chlorine safety developed in these two"
