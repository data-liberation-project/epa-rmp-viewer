      "SummaryText": "The City of Round Rock Water Treatment Plant takes water from Lake Georgetown and processes it so that is suitable for human consumption and meets drinking water standards. The water treatment plant uses chlorine to achieve primary disinfection of the city's water supply. In order to avoid disinfectant byproducts, the water treatment plant adds ammonia at the end of the disinfection process. Chlorine is delivered in 2000 pound containers and stored in the chlorine feed facility. Ammonia is delivery by tanker truck and is stored in two stationary above ground storage tanks. Each ammonia tank is filled to 4,200 pounds.\n\nThe City of Round Rock is committed to operating its facilities in a safe manner. On June 30, 1999, the City adopted a Health Safety and Environment Policy statement that states in part:  \"The City will plan for operations, establish safe practices and provide training in a manner consistent with the best applicable practices to minimize risks and potential hazards to employees, other persons, and our resources.\" In 2004, the city spent nearly twenty million dollars upgrading the water treatment facilities. Included in those upgrades were safety improvements to the ammonia feed facility and a new chlorine feed facility.The safeguards to prevent an accidental release of chlorine include a scrubber system, standard operating procedures, operator training, leak detection and system safety devices. The safeguards to prevent an accidental release of ammonia include standard operating procedures, operator training, leak detection and system safety devices. \n\nOperator training and standard operating procedures have permitted the water treatment plant to operate accident and incident free since 1999. While it is highly unlikely that a leak substantial enough to empty a one ton chlorine container could occur, the impact of such a release on the public and the environment would be minimal. On-site staff are trained to control releases and mitigate very minor eme"
