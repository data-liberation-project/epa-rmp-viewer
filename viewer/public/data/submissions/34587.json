It is the stated policy of GEAM to safely manage our site operations.  In addition, we have prepared contingency plans to be used in the unlikely event that a major accident should occur.  The efforts at our Washington, W.Va. facility have been recognized by the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), who oversees our programs, as among the best in the nation for worker safety. \n\nWe believe it is important for all interested parties to have access to information that can help them better understand our business and our facility.    \n\n0.2 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nOur company is committed to operating safe and environmentally sound chemical and plastics production facilities everywhere we do business. Protection of our neighbors and workers is the highest priority.  This ongoing commitment to worker and public safety is demonstrated through resources invested for safe design, operation, and maintenance of our facilities.  \n\nIn order to provide top quality products for our customers, the GEAM Washington W. Va. facility uses in its manufacturing process some raw materials that are classified as toxic or flammable.  We are committed to complying with governing laws, regulations, and engineering standards as well as systematic assessments to manage and maintain a safe operation.   Our operating practices and procedures ensure that numerous controls are implemented to prevent an accidental release of a chemical.  However, if a major release does occur, our trained on-site emergency response organization will be activated. This organization includes a fire brigade as well as medical and chemical emergency response teams.\n\nThe outstanding programs at the Washington facility "

This is OSHA's highest award for safety performance. \n\n0.3 DESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe GEAM plant is on a 600-acre tract along the Ohio River in Washington, W. Va., about eight miles south of Parkersburg.  It was built in 1957 and currently employs about 400 people in the Mid-Ohio Valley.  The plant manufactures thermoplastic resins and pellets.  Our products are used in automotive, medical, electronic, computer, and appliance industries to name a few.  \n\nThe site is also home to a Technology Center, where GEAM conducts advanced research in polymer technology.  \n\nThe Washington W. Va. plant uses two chemicals that are regulated under the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule.  These are: acrylonitrile, a regulated toxic substance; and, 1,3-Butadiene, a regulated flammable substance.  Acrylonitrile and 1,3-Butadiene are raw materials used to manufacture our products. \n\n0.4 GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM/ CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nGEAM has implemented a comprehensive Process Safety Management (or PSM) program to prevent accidental releases of highly hazardous chemicals.  PSM is an integral part of working safely at GEAM facilities.  PSM ensures that proper safety information is in place; operating procedures are followed; chemical hazards are identified; employees and contractors are trained; and critical equipment is properly inspected and maintained.  PSM satisfies the accidental release prevention program requirements of the RMP.\n\nSome of the many, specific safety features to prevent a chemical accident include:\n? Computer-controlled Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS) on the butadiene latex reactors to ensure that any deviations from the intended operating conditions are immediately identified and corrected;\n? Safety procedures that reduce the potential"

Butadiene and acrylonitrile gas sensors to detect and warn of a release;\n? Spill containment around acrylonitrile railcars at the unloading station to mitigate the impact of a leak;\n? Acrylonitrile railcar and butadiene barge and railcar unloading operations are continuously attended by US Department Of Transportation (DOT) trained operators;\n? Extensive safety information about the processes available to employees;\n? Written operating procedures that include emergency response actions;\n? Comprehensive employee and contractor training programs to promote consistently safe work-practices;\n? Maintenance programs to ensure ongoing equipment reliability - includes equipment testing and inspection;\n? Compliance auditing to ensure standards are being followed;\n? A safety procedure to review proposed plant modifications before they are implemented for possible hazards;\n? Safety pre-qualification for all contractors;\n? Safety reviews prior to startup of our processes; and,\n? Safety systems that control hazards during special operations such as welding. \n \n0.5 FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Washington W. Va. site has an outstanding record of accident prevention which demonstrates its commitment to public and worker safety.  Even minor incidents are investigated to identify what went wrong and to learn how to prevent future occurrences.\nThe RMP requires that all incidents involving regulated chemicals that resulted in any off-site impact or significant on-site impacts are reported in this document.  During the previous five-year period, there were no such accidents at the GEAM Washington site.  \n \n0.6 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Washington W. Va. site maintains a written emergency response program designed to protect workers, the public, and the environment in the event of a major accidental release.

Our trained fire brigade, medical and chemical response teams work closely with area hospitals, industries, and other response organizations in the Mid-Ohio Valley.  \n\nOngoing training exercises are important to the company's emergency response organization and help better prepare our partners in the community for emergency response necessary in the unlikely event of a major industrial incident. \n\nIn 1993, in partnership with DuPont and Shell Chemical (now Kraton Polymers), GEAM introduced the eleven-siren Industrial Alert System (IAS) in the Mid-Ohio Valley with coverage in Washington County in Ohio and Wood County in West Virginia.  Though we have never had to activate the IAS on an emergency basis at GEAM, the siren system is available to warn the public in the unlikely event of a major incident on site.   The system has been designed to enhance the area's emergency response services.  More information about how to shelter yourself and your family in the event of a chemical emergency can be found in the SBC/Ameritech telephone directory.  \n\nGEAM personnel have helped develop emergency preparedness plans for local communities.  In addition, they are members of local emergency planning and emergency preparedness groups, and are members of the Mid-Ohio Valley Industrial Neighbors Group (MOVING) and Central Ohio Valley Industrial Emergency Organization (COVIEO).  \n \n0.7 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nGEAM is committed to continuously improving the overall safety and environmental performance record at the Washington W. Va. facility.   Some of the specific planned changes aimed at improving safety are:  \n? Continuing development of best management practices under OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program (VPP); \n?
