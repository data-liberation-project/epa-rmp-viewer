The program covers a variety of regulatory requirements in addition to RMP including TIER II reports for EPCRA, emergency action plan, emergency response plan, SPCC plan, facility response plans, and process safety management program. \nAll employees are trained under OSHA's 24-Hour Hazardous Waste Operator Standard and go through firefighting training as well.  Emergency response courses are scheduled on a monthly basis throughout the year.   Sandersville Refinery also periodically coordinates with local emergency responders.  This includes conducting on-site tabletop and field drills.   \n\n1.7\tPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nSandersville Refinery is currently engineering a safety-instrumented system that will reduce the likelihood of releases of flammable materials to the atmosphere during certain upset operating conditions.  \n\n1.8\tREVIEW AND UPDATE\nThe offsite consequence analysis requirements of this plan shall be updated every 5 years, or when significant changes in the processes, quantities stored or handled occur.  Administrative updates, such as emergency response contact information, may be updated without resetting the five-year anniversary date."

Where a potential for catastrophic release is identified, causal factors are evaluated, and corrective actions implemented to reduce the likelihood of future releases.   \n\nA compliance audit as required by OSHA\u0092s PSM standard is conducted at least every three years and includes the light straight run process.  An action plan is generated to address any audit findings.   \n\n1.4\tCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS \nThe light straight run storage tank is in secondary containment.  It has an internal floating roof that is critical to minimizing flammable vapors in the tank.  The storage tank is also gauged every four hours.  During this gauging the tank is inspected for problems or weakened components.  The key element of release containment, control, and mitigation is the permanent foam chamber installed in the roof of the storage tank.  External monitors and other fire suppression equipment are stored near the tank.  Operators are trained to respond in the event of a small"

For example, employees are involved in writing and reviewing procedures, participate in process hazard analyses (PHA) and incident investigations, as well as on the plant emergency response team (PERT).  Safety suggestions are also collected on an informal basis and communicated with management.   \nProcess safety information for the light straight run process is compiled in the Sandersville Refinery PSI manual, which is maintained by site engineering personnel and made available to employees both in hardcopy and electronically.  In addition to typical hazard communication information, documents are also kept on key process parameters, piping and instrumentation diagrams, chemical mixture, technical manuals for key equipment, and industry guidelines for safe operations in petroleum refineries. \nAn initial process hazard analysis was conducted for the light straight run process and is revalidated at least every five years.  The primary methodology for this analysis is the \u0093what if\u0094 method, which is appropriate for bulk storage facilities.  Any recommendations from the PHA are reviewed by management and implemented as soon as practicable.   \nSandersville Refinery employees are also subject to extensive training for routine refinery operations and emergency operations.  Operators are trained initially on their operating procedures, safe work practices, and the hazards of the process and are required to refresh at least every three years.   \nSandersville Refinery relies on contract maintenance and construction employees on a routine basis.  Contract companies must meet specific safety and health criteria prior to selection and are subject to plant-specific orientation before working on plant process equipment.

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of its processes. HSRC\u0092s policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.  \n\n1.2\tDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\t\nHSRC\u0092s Sandersville Refinery located in Sandersville, Mississippi operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products, primarily asphalt related, from raw crude oil. Within the refining industry, the site is known as a topping operation in that its focus is on the 50% to 55% of the barrel of crude which is asphalt.  The remaining fractions of the crude barrel are primarily used as feedstock for Sandersville\u0092s sister refinery.   The Sandersville Refinery is considered small by industry standards with a maximum capacity of 12,500 barrels per day.  \nSandersville Refinery\u0092s light straight run, a mixture of flammable materials that contains regulated substances butane, n-pentane, and isopentane in quantities greater than 1%, is the stationary source\u0092s only process covered by EPA\u0092s Risk Management Plan (RMP) rule.  Light straight run is produced in the crude distillation process and stored in tanks on site before it is transferred offsite for further processing.     \n\n1.3\tGENERAL ACCIDENT PREVENTION STEPS\nSandersville Refinery has developed a process safety management (PSM) program for processes that represent the greatest risk to its employees and the public per OSHA's PSM regulations and the EPA\u0092s RMP rule.    \nSandersville Refinery has an Employee Participation plan that describes how employees are involved in an ongoing basis with implem"
