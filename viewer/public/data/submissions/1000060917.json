Standards codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration at 29 CFR 1910.119 are not applicable to the operations at this facility because the facility is operated as a retail operation and is exempt from the OSHA standards.  However, the OSHA standards at 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, are applicable and are included in the Risk Management Program (RMPr) document that is implemented by this Facility.\n\n\n\nThis electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the Shenandoah, IA Facility located at 303 Northwest Road, Shenandoah, IA 51601.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Shenandoah, IA Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Shenandoah, IA Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\n\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\n\n\nHelena is re-submitting this existing registration in response to the EPA Audit conducted on 9/14/2016 to reflect Nurse Tank Storage only.  The original EPA RMP Report (EPA RMP ID No. 1000 0001 2461) included the inventory of stationary storage tanks and nurse tanks at this location.  However, the stationary storage tanks are located at a remote location (4197 175th Street, Shenandoah, IA 51601).  A separate EPA registration has been prepared for that location.  To provide clarification, Helena is re-submitting this EPA RMP Report to reflect storage of nurse tanks only.  All relevant sections for a Program 2 RMP Facility have been reviewed and/or updated.  The updates are reflected in both the EPA RMP S"

Equipment included under this covered process includes (23) 1,450-gallon, (9) 1,430-gallon, (24) 1,000-gallon, and (7) 1,000-gallon double nurse tanks.  Helena personnel transport empty nurse tanks from the 303 Northwest Road location to the 4197 175th Street location for Nurse Tank filling, and then transports the full Nurse Tanks from the 4197 175th Street location to the 303 Northwest Road location for temporary storage until transported by or to the customer.  From the customer location, the empty Nurse Tanks are returned to the 303 Northwest Road location for storage. Helena performs the transport and storage operation in accordance with its RMPr accident prevention program.\n\n  \n\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nWorst case and alternative case consequence analyses were completed for the single covered process that is operated at this Facility.  The covered process includes Nurse Tank Storage and Handling.  The worst case scenario release for the Retail Facility assumes that all the contents in the largest single storage tank are released.  For this Facility, the largest vessel is a 1,450-gallon Nurse Tank.  The release was modeled as if the ammonia tank was punctured on the side at the ground level. The resulting release of ammonia was modeled as a ground level horizontal jet.\n\n\n\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario was completed for the Nurse Tank Storage and Handling covered process as well.  The alternative release for the Nurse Tank Storage and Handling assumes a 60-minute release from a Nurse Tank pressure relief valve while in storage.  \n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Branch Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Facility.  The Branch Manager is"

The Branch Manager is responsible for ensuring that Helena Staff are properly trained in the implementation of the Prevention Program which includes Safety Information, Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigations, and Emergency Contingency Plans.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nHelena's Shenandoah, IA Facility is a non-responding facility. Helena has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency response agency and local fire department.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place, in the past five (5) years because of the ammonia operations at the Shenandoah, IA Facility.\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\n\nThe Risk Management Plan implemented by Helena Chemical Company at the Shenandoah, IA Facility complies with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r). The RMP will be updated as the Shenandoah, IA Facility adds, deletes, or changes processes. The Emergency Response Program has been coordinated with the Page County LEPC and the Shenandoah Fire Department.  \n\n\n\nNOTE: Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 of the standard RMP produced by EPA's RMP Submit Program are not applicable to the Shenandoah, IA Facility.\n\n"
