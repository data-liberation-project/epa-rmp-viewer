      "SummaryText": "(a)  The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the facility:\nScott Specialty Gases, Northeast Region, is recipient of the Corporate Board of Director's Award and the Compressed Gas Association Safety Award.  Safety is our number one priority with an in-house emergency response team, a detailed computerized preventive maintenance program, written standard operating procedures, more than three years without a lost-time accident and over five years without an accidental release.  From the owner of the company, down through the regional Vice President, to the newest employee, Scott Specialty Gases is committed to safety as a neighbor and concerned member of the community.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     (b) The facility and regulated substances handled:                                                            \nScott is a regional manufacturer of specialty gases, inncluding gas mixtures and filling of pure gas products.  Our company purifies and transfills chlorine, hydrogen bromide and hydrogen chloride (the three regulated substances at the facility) into a variety of cylinder sizes to meet customer needs.  The purification and transfill manifolds for both systems are essentially identical, except for a few components due to the pressures and rating of the three chemicals.  The scrubber, monitoring, alarm and other systems are common to both processes.\n\n(c)  The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\nThe facility has highly trained operators, with many years of experience handling the regulated substances.  However, this does not replace the need for detailed operating procedu"

      "SummaryText": "res, following strict guidelines, in accordance with applicable Compressed Gas Association recommendations.  In addition, the facility has a comprehensive preventive maintenance program, an alarm system that is monitored continuously both internally and by an outside monitoring company and an extensive emergency response proram.  The scrubber system is also checked on a daily basis by the EHS operators and a two person \"buddy\" system is adhered to at all times in the plant.\n\n(d)  The five year accident history:\nThe facility has had no accidents in the past five years.\n\n(e)  The emergency response program:\nAlmost 40% of the personnel on site are part of the emergency response team.  The program is centered around the elements of public awareness and notification, personnel training, including facility drills and on-site hazmat courses, detailed evacuation and response procedures in the event of a release, proper first-aid treatment, emergency response equipment and periodic reviews.  A comprehensive written program is maintained on site, as well as provided to the local fire, police and emergency planning departments.\n\n(f)  Planned changes to improve safety:\nWhile the facility has the capability of handling 600 pound containers of hydrogen chloride, we have chosen not to handle them so the overall inventory of regulated substances is reduced.  In addition, it is a normal policy to empty one ton of chlorine before bringing a new ton to the facility, so inventory levels are maintained at the lowest level possible.  The facility plans on installing a new 16 point toxic gas monitoring system."
