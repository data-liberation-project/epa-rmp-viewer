      "SummaryText": "A Risk Management Plan has been implemented at the Ft. Worth, Texas facility for the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous materials. The facility is operated by Geodis, and located at 3501 Sandshell Drive, Ft. Worth, (Terrant County) Texas. The facility is a storage and distribution warehouse that houses consumer products packaged in aerosol cans for The Scotts Company, LLC, which is headquartered in Marysville, Ohio.  Based on the materials and the processes and results of the offsite consequence analysis discussed below, this plan meets the requirements of Program 1.\n\n\n\nThe aerosol cans are manufactured by Ortho&reg;, and consist of consumer product insecticides.  Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) propellant used in the aerosol products contains several components that are classified as flammable materials under EPA's RMP regulations.  Specifically, the propellants consist of propane, butane and isobutane blends.  The maximum potential quantities of aerosol products containing these substances were conservatively based on the maximum projected inventory for the facility (150,895, 18-oz cans) plus a 20% safety factor.  The maximum potential product propellant weights were used to estimate the maximum potential inventories of RMP-regulated chemicals in the warehouse storage process.  Although the actual amounts in the warehouse at any given time should be much lower, the estimated maximum potential amount of each substance is: \n\n\n\n?    Isobutane:    50,927 lbs\n\n?    Butane:            30,556 lbs\n\n?    Propane:     30,556 lbs\n\n\n\nA worst case scenario was performed using the EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance and provided software (RMP*Comp) for a vessel with the greatest amount of propellant mixture.  The maximum quantity of each substance in a single vessel is: 0.28 lbs isobutane, 0.17 lbs of butane, and 0.17 lbs of propane.  The software predicts that the maximum distance to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint for this mixture will not extend beyond facility property.  Th"

      "SummaryText": "e calculated radius of impact for the mixture is 26 feet.  Note that the RMP*eSubmit program requires that the quantity of each substance be rounded to the nearest pound (1 lbs), and that the impact radius be reported to two significant digits in miles (0.01 mi).  \n\n\n\nNo offsite receptors would be impacted under either scenario.  When not being handled for shipment, all aerosols are stored on pallets within dedicated aerosol cages equipped with additional sprinkler protection.  There have been no prior accidents at the facility associated with this process.\n\n\n\nThis process is being incorporated into the facility's emergency response plan which is provided to and coordinated with the Terrant County LEPC, Fort Worth Fire Department (Station #31 and #9).  The emergency response plan is reviewed annually and updated as needed.  Employees are also provided emergency response training annually.  \n\n\n\n"
