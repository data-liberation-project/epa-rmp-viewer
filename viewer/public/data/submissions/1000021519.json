The Occidental Permian Ltd's Antelope Gas Cap is committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes (especially regarding the use of hazardous substances) in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention safeguards and programs and emergency response programs to address the safety of our employees and the public, and the protection of the environment.  Our policy is to integrate process controls and administrative procedures that are designed to prevent the release of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, DUCRP personnel have been trained on the emergency action plan to control and contain the release.  This document provides a brief overview of the risk management activities we have designed and implemented.

Our plan considers all federal, state and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  The plan is designed to respond to a release of a regulated substance and provides first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, and notification of local emergency response agencies.  We have coordinated our emergency response activities with the Denver City, Texas emergency response agencies.

No additional measures and necessary to prevent offsite impact from accidental releases.  In the event of fire, explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the process (es), entry within the distance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to the public emergency responders.  Therefore, public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated in the RMP plan.  The undersigned certifies that, to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, and formed after resonable inquiry, the information submitted is true, accurate and complete."
