Strang Road Facility (SCT-SRF) is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for SCT workers, the public and the environment. As part of this commitment, SCT-SRF has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One part of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at SCT-SRF and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection AgencyA?s (EPA) regulation 40 CFR, part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements; Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at SCT-SRF.  This documents is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at SCT-SRF.\n\n    1.1    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \n\n    SCT-SRF is committed to the safety of their workers, the public and to the preservation of the environment through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. SCT-SRF implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  In the event of a significant accidental release, trained Emergency Response personnel and/or third-party emergency response contractors will respond to control and contain such releases. SCT-SRF evaluates each situation, evacuates workers as necessary, contacts the local fire department and and/or third-party emergency response personnel to control and contain the release and to prevent and/or reduce the consequences of the release.\n\n    1.2    SCT-SRF and Regulated Substances\n\n    SCT-SRF handles Toluene 2,4-diisocyanate (TDI), a listed RMP toxic chemical, in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP rule.\n\n    Toluene 2,4-diisocyanate is received by bu"

The 55-gallon drums are then loaded onto a truck and shipped off-site.\n\n    SCT-SRF handles two listed flammable materials in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP rule. SCT-SRF also receives bulk isopentane and pentane; both are listed RMP flammable materials.  Again, the materials are drummed as a service for customers.\n \n    As a result of the use of regulated substances at SCT-SRF, the following processes are covered by the RMP rule:\n\nProcess    ProgramLevel    Regulated Substances    Process Inventory\nDrumming operation    2    Isopentane    450,000 lbs.\n        Pentane    100,000 lbs.\n        Toluene 2,4-diisocynate    100,000 lbs.\n\n\n    \n    1.3    Off-Site Consequence Analysis\n\n    SCT-SRF performed an off-site consequence analysis (OCA) to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.  The OCA consists of evaluating both worst-case scenarios (WCSs) and alternative release scenarios (ARSs). SCT-SRF does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  An ARS represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility like SCT-SRF.  ARSs help the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) improve the community emergency response plan.  We have shared that information with the LEPC and other organizations involved in emergency response activities.  It is also available to the public.  If you are interested in this information, please contact Belinda Adame', our RMP coordinator at 713-672-2401, belinda@scterm.com.\n\nThe main objective of performing the OCA is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release, which is called the endpoint distance.  The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects should be greater; at distances greater than th"

NOTE:   As stated above, SCT-SRF does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  The computer modeling program used was RMP*Comp, Ver. 1.06.  The scenario is based on the following:  the product is a liquid with a temperature of 75A?F, and with no mitigation measures, urban surrounding (many obstacles A? this facility is in an industrial complex area), weather information was obtained by utilizing RMP*Comp defaults.  Although there are mitigation measures such as deluge systems, the model was done with no mitigation measures to determine a worst-case scenario that would include water service interruptions.  The result in a release of TDI was calculated to be an estimated distance to toxic endpoint of 0.2 miles.  Since this facility is located in an industrial area, the toxic cloud formed by the release would reach off-site public and/or environmental receptors of other industries nearby.  The closest operational facilities are Grief Brothers, Inc.

Employees have access to information created as part of the SCT-SRF accident prevention program.  In addition, SCT-SRF has a number of initiatives underway that addresses employee safety issues.  These initiatives include a Safety Committee to promote both process and personal safety.  The team typically has members from various areas and other SCT facility locations, including operations, maintenance, engineering, administration and facility management.\n\n    Process Safety Information\n\n    SCT-SRF keeps a variety of documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\n    Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).  For specific process areas, SCT-SRF has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters, e.g., temperature, filling rates, compatibility, etc., in PHA documentation. SCT-SRF ensures that the process is maintained within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel and protective instruments systems, e.g., automated and manual shutdown systems.\n\n        Process Hazard Analysis\n\n    SCT-SRF has established programs to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n    The PHA team findings and/or action items are forwarded to appropriate personnel.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are "

The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n    These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to appropriate personnel for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n        Operating Procedures\n\n    SCT-SRF maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit start-up, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown and (5) normal shutdown.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.\n\n        Training\n\n    To complement the written procedures for process operations, SCT-SRF has implemented a company-training program for employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in SCT-SRF operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate, e.g., through skill demonstration, having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and task in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.\n\n        Contractors\n\n    SCT-SRF uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, SCT-SRF has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and fol"

The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections, (4) correcting identified deficiencies and (5) applying quality assurance measures.\n\n    Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits.  If a deficiency is identified, employees or contractors, as appropriate, will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service, if possible.\n\n        Safe Work Practices\n\n    SCT-SRF has safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include: (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel; (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance; (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened; (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities, i.e., hot work; and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures, and others, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure the operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n        Incident Investigation\n\n    SCT-SRF investigates incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.
