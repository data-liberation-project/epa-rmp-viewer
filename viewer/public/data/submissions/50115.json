MWDSC provides approximately 60 percent of the drinking water used by nearly 16 million people living on the southern California coastal plain between Ventura County and the Mexican border.\n\nDisinfection is a critical process used by MWDSC in the treatment of its drinking water.  Disinfection helps to protect public health by killing pathogens in the water and preventing the spread of waterborne diseases.  The use of chlorine as a disinfectant in the treatment of drinking water and wastewater has been the dominant disinfection method in the United States since it was introduced, around the beginning of this century.  MWDSC currently utilizes bulk chlorine for disinfection at all of its water treatment plants, including the Henry J. Mills Water Treatment Plant (Mills Plant).\n\nAs one might expect from its superior disinfection properties, chlorine is a hazardous substance.  Thus, storing and handling chlorine can present a risk to employees and the public without proper precautions.  MWDSC regards safe practices in the storing and usage of chlorine to be of primary importance and has an excellent safety record with chlorine.\n\nMills Plant's chlorine storage and usage process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule (RMPR) and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program regulation.  Both of these regulations require submission of a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  An integral part of the RMP is a summary of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility, including a description of the possible consequences in case of an accident and the actions, which will be taken, by the facility in an emergency.\n\nThe following information is specifically required in the RMP Executive Summary: \n?

Five-year accident history summary.\n?    Emergency response program summary.\n?    Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nAn RMP for the Mills Plant Chlorination Facility was prepared and submitted to the EPA in June 2004, to comply with the five-year RMP update requirement.  As discussed in the Executive Summary of the June 2004 RMP submission under ?Planned Changes to Improve Safety,? MWDSC decided to modify the Mills Plant Chlorination Facility with a chlorine containment and scrubbing system to capture and neutralize an accidental chlorine release.  The decision to install the chlorine containment and scrubbing system was made to further enhance safety and mitigate offsite consequences of an accidental chlorine release.  The chlorine containment and scrubbing process modification is now in operation.\n\nThe information required in the RMP Executive Summary is provided below for the newly modified Chlorine System at the Mills Plant.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe MWDSC accidental release prevention policy for chlorine involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, trains staff in operation and maintenance practices, and uses tested and proven management system practices.  All applicable procedures of the State of California and EPA's RMP Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response.  The Mills Plant has an excellent safety record of chlorine use.\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\n\nThe Henry J. Mills Water Treatment Plant is located at 550 E. Alessandro Boulevard in Riverside, California.  The plant is situated west of Interstate Highway 215 and south of State Highway 60, covering approximately 256 acres.

The facility currently stores and uses chlorine, a regulated toxic substance under the RMPR and CalARP Program rules, as well as the Federal and California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standards.\n\nThe Chlorine System at the Mills Plant is composed of the following components: (1) a totally contained chlorine feed system to receive, store, and deliver liquid chlorine to the evaporators, chlorine expansion vessels, associated piping and valving, leak sensors and monitors, and instrumentation (2) totally contained evaporators to heat chlorine and convert it to gas for use in the chlorinators (evaporator units, associated piping and valving, instrumentation), (3) totally contained chlorinators to regulate flow of chlorine gas under vacuum to the ejectors (chlorinator units, associated piping and valving, instrumentation), (4) ejectors to mix the chlorine gas with service water and inject chlorine solution at application points throughout the plant, and (5) chlorine gas treatment system for capture and neutralization of an accidental chlorine release in the contained areas (scrubbers, caustic soda, fans, pumps, and associated piping and valving).\n\nThe chlorine storage vessels are totally contained in the chlorination facility storage bays.\n\nThe process flow for the Chlorine System begins at the liquid chlorine angle valves located on the storage vessels in each storage bay, connected by flexible metallic hose to the fixed piping system.  Liquid chlorine is transferred by its own vapor pressure from an on-line storage vessel in each storage bay to one or more evaporators in each evaporator room.\n\nEach evaporator uses an electrically heated water bath to vaporize the liquid chlorine.  The chlorinators regulate the flow of chlorine gas (under vacuum) through venturi eduction to the ejectors.  The ejectors are located at various points throughout the facility, and "

Chlorine leak sensors are provided in the storage bays, evaporator rooms, chlorinator room and pipe tunnels.  Based on the concentration and location of chlorine detected, the leak detection system will activate a succession of safety measures, beginning with visual and audible alarms, the start-up of the chlorine neutralization system and shut down of the normal ventilation system, and finally, automatically closing storage vessel liquid chlorine angle valve.  The alarms are annunciated at the chlorine alarm panel as well as at the operator?s console in the control room.  Once alerted, fully trained personnel will respond to assess the chlorine leak.  In addition, each storage vessel valve connecting to the process is provided with a remotely actuated (pneumatic) emergency shutoff system.  In case of a major chlorine leak, chlorine supply can be stopped almost instantaneously by closing the shutoff system, automatically or manually from any of three control panels: unloading platform, chlorine maintenance room, or control room.  Emergency showers and eyewash stations are also provided throughout the chlorination facility and beside the scrubber system.\n\nA packed-bed chlorine gas scrubber system, consisting of two parallel scrubber units, is provided to neutralize an accidental release of chlorine gas from either storage bay, evaporator room, or the chlorinator room.  Caustic soda (~20% concentration) is used as the scrubbing media.\n\nThe chlorine pressure reducing valves, leak detectors, and computer control system are connected to the uninterruptible power supply (UPS) system.

Each employee presently involved in operating the chlorine process has been trained to receive the required knowledge, skills, and abilities to safely carry out the duties and responsibilities, including chlorine emergency response, as provided in the operating procedures.  \n\nRefresher training is provided every three years or less to each employee operating the covered process to ensure that the employee understands and adheres to the current operating procedures.  In addition, the Mills Plant ensures that operators are trained in any updated or new procedures prior to startup of a process after a major change as indicated in their Management of Change and/or Pre Startup Safety Review procedures.  Such an update of chlorine operations training took place together with the update of chlorine operating procedures to incorporate changes in chlorine operations associated with the chlorine containment and scrubbing system modification.\n\nMills Plant prepares and retains records of initial and refresher training, which includes the identity of the employee, the date of training, and the signature of the person (s) administering the training.\n\nContractors\n\nMills Plant has procedures and policies in place that ensure that the contractors are properly informed of the hazards, access limitations to these process areas, and emergency response procedures, and are prepared to safely complete the work.  The contractors are informed, prior to the initiation of the work at the site, of the applicable provisions of the emergency response plan.  Mills Plant holds contractor safety briefings before allowing them near or in the process area; controls access to the process areas, and evaluates the contractor's safety performance.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review and Mechanical Integrity Program\n\nMills Plant ensures that a pre-startup safety review is completed for any new process covered by this regulation, or for significant modifications to "

Mills Plant maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment.  Mills Plant mechanical integrity program includes the following:\n\n?    Written procedures for maintaining mechanical integrity through inspection and testing of process equipment, based on instructions of equipment vendors, industry codes and practice, and prior operating experience.\n?    Implementation of the written procedures by performing inspections and tests on process equipment at specified intervals.\n?    Training of maintenance personnel in preventive maintenance program procedures; safe work practices such as lockout/tagout, line or equipment opening, and avoidance and correction of unsafe conditions; and safe use and application of special equipment and/or unique tools.\n\nHot Work Permits and Management of Change \n\nMills Plant requires employees and contractors to employ safe work practices when performing \"hot work\" in, on, or around the covered process.  Mills Plant uses a permitting and training program to ensure hot work is monitored and conducted safely on or near a process involving chlorine.\n\nMills Plant provides a system and approach to maintain and implement any management of change or modifications to equipment, procedures, chemicals, and processing conditions.  This system allows Mills Plant staff to identify and review safety hazards or provide additional safety, process, or chemical information to existing data before the proposed change would either compromise system safety or need training to be completed.\n\nInternal Compliance Audits\n\nInternal compliance audits will be conducted every 3 years to verify compliance with the programs and procedures contained in the RMP.  The Mills Plant will assemble an audit team that will include personnel knowledgeable in the Risk Management Program rule and in the proc"

This team will evaluate whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the Risk Management Program rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process.  The results of the audit will be documented, recommendations resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program will be implemented.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nMills Plant investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release (serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment) so that similar accidents can be prevented.  An investigation team is assembled and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.  Information found during the investigation is reviewed by affected staff and added or used to revise operating and maintenance procedures.  There have been no such incidents involving the Mills Plant chlorine system.\n\nFive-year Accident History Summary\n\nNo chlorine releases that could have caused safety or health hazard (deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place) occurred at the Mills Plant during the last five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program Summary\n\nMills Plant has Operational Level HAZWOPER-trained plant employees who will respond to emergency chlorine releases only to assess and secure equipment in case of incidental releases.  Mills Plant also includes employees trained in Incident Command System.  Depending on the severity of the accidental release, external hazardous materials response agencies, such as the City of Riverside Fire Department, will be called to handle a chlorine release.  Mills Plant coordinates with local response agencies (City of Riverside Fire Department) to help ensure that they are familiar with the Mills Plant Chlorine System and its emergency requirements and that it"

Specially trained Mills Plant employees will be available during such a chlorine emergency to provide technical support to fire department responders.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nNumerous changes to improve safety (recommended actions) were previously identified for the chlorine process in 1992, 1994, 1995, 1998, when Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) conducted under the California Risk Management and Prevention Program (RMPP) guidelines, Process Safety Management Program and Risk Management Program were prepared for the Mills Plant. These recommended actions have been evaluated and implemented as required.  Additional changes to improve chlorine safety were identified in February 2004, when the 1998 RMP process hazard analysis was reviewed and updated.  Further changes were identified in February 2006 and January 2007, when the process hazard and seismic risk analyses were updated to include the new chlorine containment and scrubbing system modification.  These recommended actions have been evaluated and will be resolved in a timely fashion."
