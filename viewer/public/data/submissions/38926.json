      "SummaryText": "Farmers Cooperative - Hemingford\n\nRisk Management Plan - Executive Summary\n\nThe accidental release prevention policy at Farmers Cooperative involves, but is not limited to, technologies, procedures, and management practices.  All applicable laws and regulations of the State of Nebraska are adhered to.  Our emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans that are tailored to our facility, and to the emergency response services available in our community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nThis facility is in the business of selling anhydrous ammonia to farm customers as a form of nitrogen fertilizer.  The facility has four (4) anhydrous ammonia storage tanks, one (1) with a capacity of 30,000 gallons water capacity, one (1) with a capacity of 26,000 gallons of water capacity, and two (2) with a capacity of 11,000 gallons of water capacity.  The storage tanks, several anhydrous ammonia nurse tanks, risers for filling nurse tanks, electrical panels, lighting, and safety equipment are all part of this facility's anhydrous ammonia operation.  The facility is manned during the season and is operational through normal business hours.\n\nThe off-site consequences analysis includes two anhydrous ammonia release scenarios, identified as \"worst-case\" release and \"alternative\" release scenario.  The first scenario is defined by EPA and shall assume the maximum quantity of one vessel is released as a gas in 10 minutes due to a catastrophic break.  The alternative release scenario is defined as a more likely accidental release of anhydrous ammonia caused by a transfer hose failure.\n\nThe \"worst-case\" release scenario involves a catastrophic failure of the largest tank, releasing the entire 131,325 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The off-site consequences were calculated using Degadis.  The worst-case scenario used EPA's recommended wind speed of 1.5 meters per second with a \"F\" atmospheric stability class.

      "SummaryText": "hy was selected as typical.  The distance to the endpoint was 2.60 miles.  It is estimated that 1,310 people would be affected by this release.\n\nThe \"alternative release\" scenario assumed a hose breaks and leaks 7,200 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The EPA recommended wind speed of 3.0 meters per second with a \"D\" atmospheric stability class was used in this scenario.  Using urban topography and Degadis, the toxic endpoint is .46 mile.  The population within that area is estimated to be 1,280 people.  The assumption is that the duration of the release is 2 minutes, because equipment, excess flow valves, and human intervention will stop the leak.\n\nFarmers Cooperative has several key elements in it's accident prevention plan:\n1.  The anhydrous ammonia system adheres to the laws and regulations of the State of Nebraska as \n     enforced by the State Fire Marshall.\n2.  Annual training is required of all personnel on handling, transferring, or transporting anhydrous \n     ammonia.  The training includes properties of ammonia, safe handling practices, first aid, and \n     emergency response.\n3.  Use of good management practices as specified by industry standards and training aids.\n4.  Frequent site inspections by management and safety consultants.\n5.  Annual inspections by Nebraska State Fire Marshall's inspectors include safety equipment, tanks, and\n     handling equipment.\n6.  Use of proper anhydrous ammonia personal protective equipment and safety equipment.\n\nChanges are made in the system when necessary, or when required by regulation change.  Periodic evaluations of the procedures help to determine whether or not a change in operations should be made to provide increased safety to the operators and to the community."
