We accept the responsibility for leadership of the safety & health program, and for its effectiveness and improvement, and for providing the safeguards required to ensure safe conditions.\n2. Our managers and supervisors are responsible for developing the proper attitudes toward safety, health and the environment in themselves and in those they supervise; and for ensuring that all operations are performed with the utmost regard for the safety and health of all personnel involved, including themselves.\n3. Our employees are responsible for wholehearted, genuine cooperation with all aspects of the safety and health program, including compliance with all rules and regulations, and for continuously practicing safety while performing their duties.\n\nOur environmental guidelines include the following:\n\n1. Environmental protection is a line responsibility and an important measure of employee performance. In addition, every employee is responsible for environmental protection in the same manner as for safety.\n2. Reducing or eliminating the generation of waste has been and continues to be a prime consideration in research, process design, and operations; and is viewed by management like safety, yield and loss prevention.\n3.

Revision of the Plan when necessary.\n\nOur Houston, TX chemical distributing facility has tank, tote, bag, and drum containers. It handles millions of pounds of chemicals / year. We have an Emergency Response Plan that assigns responsibilities for preventing hazardous releases.\n\nThe following chemicals are listed in program 2: Cyclohexylamine, and Hydrofluoric Acid (70%)\n\nIn regard to Hydrofluoric Acid safety, this material is stored in drums, outside, away from strong acids, strong alkalis, alkali metals, brass, hypochlorites, and other incompatible materials. We have available self-contained breathing apparatus in case of an emergency spill or other release of liquid and vapor.  The following considerations are taken in the the case of Hydrofluoric Acid.\n\n1a. In a Worst Case Scenario (such as the bursting of a drum and releasing its contents), emergency services (such as the fire department) would be informed. Unnecessary personnel would leave the area to a distance of 1.00 miles. Other facilities would be informed within this distance, and appropriate personal protective equipment (including self-contained breathing apparatus) would be put on trained personnel, the spill would be contained by diking the spill area, and put into a salvage container for disposal. See our document ER 002 (Brenntag Southwest, Inc Emergency Response Plan).\n\n1b. In an Alternate Case Scenario (such as a minor leak in drum, releasing some of its contents), emergency services (such as the fire department) would be informed. Unnecessary personnel would leave the area to a distance of 0.20 miles. Other facilities would be informed within this distance, and appropriate personal protective equipment (including self-contained breathing apparatus) would be put on trained personnel, the spill would be contained by diking the spill area, and put into a salvage container for disposal.
