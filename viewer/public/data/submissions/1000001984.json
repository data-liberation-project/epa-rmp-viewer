Thus, the total quantity of chlorine dioxide stored at the Mill is 20,098 lb.  The three chlorine dioxide tanks are partially located inside a building.  The worst case scenario for chlorine dioxide would be a liquid spill and vaporization from the 8,600 lb-tank (103,000 gallon tank).  An alternative release scenario would be defined as an indoor 1,000-gallon spill due to a leak in the 8-inch diameter piping connecting the largest chlorine dioxide tank to the process.\n\nChlorine is stored in up to twelve aboveground cylinder tanks, each with a design capacity of one ton.  The total quantity of chlorine stored at this facility is 24,000 lb.  The chlorine cylinders are kept inside a building.  Chlorine is a toxic gas liquefied by pressure in the cylinder and is used to treat process water.  The worst case scenario for chlorine would be a gas release from one of the tanks or 2,000 lbs.  An alternative release scenario would be defined as a failure (leak or rupture) of the 0.25-inch diameter tubing connecting the chlorine cylinder to the water chlorination process.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nAs part of its corporate environmental policy, NewPage will continue to protect the environment and the health and well-being of fellow employees and communities by monitoring existing facilities to ensure that they meet all legal requirements through the use of safe technologies and operating procedures.\n\nThe Mill complies with the prevention and emergency response procedures from all applicable regulations including certain applicable sections of RCRA and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR 1910.38).\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidents at the Mill in the past five years that"

The Incident Command System is designed to provide both public and private sector emergency response personnel with a logical building block system for managing hazardous material emergencies.\n\nThe system is designed to begin at the point where emergency response personnel recognize that they are in fact, dealing with a hazardous material emergency, even when the exact hazardous material has not be identified.\n\nThe local fire department is also trained to the Incident Command System and will join with the Mill team members and co-command on an incident.\n\nThe Incident Command System identifies a chain of command in response situations.  It also identifies specific responsibilities for the various levels in that chain.  The Mill has trained incident commanders, specialists, and technicians.\n\nAdditionally, NewPage has a spill reporting policy that addresses the notification requirements in the event of an accidental release.  The spill reporting policy also identifies contacts and notification responsibilities.\n\nThe Mill conducts incident investigations for all events, including minor situations that involve chlorine and/or chlorine dioxide.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES FOR SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS\n\nThis facility will undergo regular scheduled maintenance and update to meet any new or revised applicable regulation and industry standard to continue to operate safely."
