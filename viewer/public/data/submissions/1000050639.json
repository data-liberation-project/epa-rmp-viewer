(MOP) operates the Cross Oil Refinery in Smackover, AR (herein after referred to as the Facility or Site).  The facility handles substances considered hazardous by the U.S. EPA and has implemented a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility.\r\n\r\nIn addition to training and procedures, the facility has implemented a Mechanical Integrity Program, emergency shutdown systems and warning alarms.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Smackover Fire Department, and other interested authorities, to mitigate any release, inform all affected parties and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\nRegulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe facility handles naphtha, which has an NFPA flammability rating of 4. Naphtha at the facility may contain Pentane and Isopentane in quantities greater than 1%, therefore the entire mixture is regulated under the RMP program. The total quantity, rounded to 2 significant figures, of Naphtha on-site is 1,300,000 lbs. The maximum quantity of Pentane on-site, rounded to 2 significant figures is 18,000 lbs and the maximum quantity of Isopentane on-site, rounded to 2 significant figures is 15,000 lbs. Naphtha is produced within the main Crude Unit of the facility and transferred by pipe to 1 of 4 storage vessels. Naphtha is then transferred from storage to trucks for shipment off-site.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nNaphtha, containing the regulated compounds Pentante and Isopentane, are managed as required under RMP Program 3 (or Subpart D) and OSHA's PSM program.  Program 3 requires that the facility have the process safety information for the hazardou"

The audits are conducted by a team that consists of Martin Corporate EH&S personnel or an outside third party who are knowledgeable in the process.  The compliance audits are available on site for review.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigations\r\n\r\nMartin investigates each incident which results in or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  Incident investigations are conducted by both on site and Corporate EH&S personnel.  Once the investigation has been completed, a report is prepared and includes those items required in 40 CFR \u00a768.81(d).\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nEmployees are included in PHAs and have access to PHAs that have been completed.

The hot work permit is written to address the elements described in 40 CFR \u00a768.85(b).\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nMartin requires that contractors participate in the safety programs implemented by the facility.  Contractors are evaluated based on safety performance prior to being selected to perform work at the facility.

The process equipment described in 40 CFR \u00a768.73(a)(1)-(6) are inspected based on the written procedures developed by Martin or third party procedures (i.e. ASTM).  Any deficiencies found by the mechanical integrity group that are outside acceptable limits are corrected before further use or in a safe and timely manner, when necessary means are taken to assure safe operation.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\r\nWritten procedures have been developed to track and manage changes to operating procedures, process equipment, chemicals, technology, process safety information, and, changes to stationary sources that affect a covered process.  The procedures assure that the considerations found in 40 CFR \u00a768.75(b)(1)-(5) are addressed prior to any change.\r\n\r\nThose employees affected by the change are notified and trained on the change prior to start-up of the process or affected part of the process.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Review\r\n\r\nPre-startup safety reviews will be conducted prior to startup of affected new stationary sources or any modified stationary sources, when those modifications are significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.
