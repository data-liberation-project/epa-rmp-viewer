WE HAVE COORDINATED WITH THE THOMPSON FIRE DEPARTMENT IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY.  IF  AN EMERGENCY INVOLVING OUR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA PLANT WERE TO OCCUR,  IT IS OUR POLICY TO NOTIFY THE THOMPSON FIRE DEPARTMENT AND REQUEST THEY RESPOND TO THE EMERGENCY.  MEMBERS OF THE FIRE DEPARTMENT DO ROUTINE INSPECTIONS OF OUR ANHYDROUS SITE AND HAVE PRACTICED RESPONDING TO LIVE ANHYDROUS. OUR EMPLOYEES  ALSO DO REGULAR CHECKS OF THE PLANT AND ARE INVOLVED IN TRAINING FOR SAFETY.  THE WORST CASE SCENARIO WOULD BE A GAS RELEASE FROM ONE OF THE STORAGE TANKS WHEN FILLED TO THE GREATEST AMOUNT ALLOWED (85%).  ACCORDING TO THE EPA'S LOOK UP TABLE, THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT IS 4.4 MILES.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE ROUTINE CHECKS AND SAFETY TRAINING BY BOTH OUR EMPLOYEES AND THE THOMPSON FIRE DEPARTMENT MAKES ACCIDENTS UNLIKELY.  WE HAVE NEVER HAD AN ACCIDENT INVOLVING AMMONIA THAT CAUSED DEATHS, INJURIES, PROPERTY OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE, OR EVACUATIONS."
