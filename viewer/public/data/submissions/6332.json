      "SummaryText": "To ensure employee safety, and reduce the potential for exposure to the community, Wilkinsburg-Penn Joint Water Authority (WPJWA) Nadine Road Pump Station provides awareness training on the chemical hazards of chlorine and the safe handling of hazardous materials at the facility.  Personnel working with hazardous materials are trained in safe operating procedures, the proper utilization of safety equipment and safeguards, and maintenance techniques required to operate in a safe and efficient manner.\n\nWPJWA Nadine Road Pump Station is a water treatment facility located along the Allegheny River that utilizes chlorine in its' treatment process.  The chlorine is contained inside a brick structure (the chlorine feed building) in four one ton cylinders utilized for the pre-treatment process.  Up to ten one ton cylinders can be kept outside on the storage rack, which is next to the chlorine feed building.  The four cylinders that are inside are situated horizontally on two sets of hydraulic scales.  WPJWA Nadine Road Pump Station employs a dual high capacity vacuum regulator system with an automatic switchover.  Typically, the front scale and vacuum regulator are in service with the rear scale and regulator as backup.  Two cylinders are connected to a manifold and the valves are opened to activate one tank and put the other on standby.  The chlorine gas passes through the regulator and travels to the chlorinators located in an adjacent room.  The chlorinators regulate feed rates to produce an appropriate mixture of domestic water and chlorine relative to the raw water being treated.  The mixture travels through the solution line to the application point where it is injected into the raw water being pumped from the river.\n\nIn the case of a catastrophe affecting chlorine at the facility, the worst case scenario would involve the release of the contents of a one ton cylinder in a ten minute period.  According to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) RMP Guidance for Wa"

      "SummaryText": "ste Water Treatment Plants Reference Tables, the contents of the cylinder would be released at the rate of 200 pounds/minute.  If the cylinder was not enclosed, and there are no controls, the release would have an impact on the environment and population up to a distance of 1.3 miles in an urban setting.  The cylinders are in an enclosed area which would reduce the distance of impact of chlorine into the environment.\n\nA more likely occurance would involve a leak in the cylinder, valves, connectors, or piping involved in the process.  A vacuum system for distribution of chlorine has been installed at the facility to reduce the likelihood that a chlorine release offsite will occur.  If a chlorine gas leak occurs in the system and the vacuum is broken, the system automatically eliminates chlorine distribution between the regulator and the chlorinators inside the building.  Remote sensors and alarms alert operators of a chlorine discharge within the enclosure.  Using the RMP Guidance for Waste Water Treatment Plants, if damage was done to a cylinder during loading or unlaoding procedure, and a valve or puncture leak would occur creating a 1/2\" opening, the escaping gas would have an offsite impact of .1 mile.\n\nWPJWA Nadine Road Pump Station has implemented a prevention program to reduce the potential for an accidental release.  The process equipment is evaluated against best engineering practices and adheres to codes and standards regulating the water treatment industry.  Supplier manuals and maintenance instructions are used as a basis for scheduled maintenance activities and equipment changes.  Training on operating procedures, the safe handling of chlorine, and inspection and testing procedures, are in place to reduce the potential for an accidental release.  Operators monitor chlorine sensors from a remote control panel.  Personnel are trained in the use of Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) and the use of repair kits for one ton and 150 pound cylinders.\n\nThe"

In addition to Mark Lerch, Facility Emergency Response Coordinator, Jack Mautino may be contacted at 412/243-6254.  If an emergency exists the facility emergency coordinator will notify Penn Hills Fire Department, Penn Hills Police Department, Penn Hills Emergency Management Services, Local Emergency Management Agency, and the County Emergency Management Agency.  Employees have been trained in the use of safety equipment (SCBA's), evacuation procedures, and notification procedures.\n\nA more intensive training program is being adopted to focus on the chlorine process and the controls required to improve safety for employees and the public.  Employee initial training and retraining will be conducted and documented as required by SARA Title III.  Maintenance procedures with documented schedules have been implemented to ensure that potential equipment failures are reduced due to improved maintenance and inspection activities.  Procedures have been improved and a more accurate documentation system has been implemented.  A new chlorine detection system has been installed.  Additional training programs have been adopted to focus on the potential hazards of the system and methods to eliminate potential occurences."
