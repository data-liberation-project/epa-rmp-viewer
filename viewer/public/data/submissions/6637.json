Sewage is treated at the Union Springs WWTP from the nearby community of Union Springs, AL. The Union Springs WWTP consists of several wastewater treatment processes, including Chlorination, High Rate Trickling Filtration, Sedimentation and Biological oxidation. Treated water and sludge, following disinfecting with Chlorine, is then disposed of in accordance with State and Federal laws.\n     \n     Chlorine gas has been in use for nearly a century as the choice disinfectant in the treatment of both sewage for discharge and surface and ground water for drinking.  Currently the Union Springs WWTP maintains a maximum inventory of 4,000 pounds of Chlorine gas.  Under EPA's Risk Management Program, Clean Air Act 112(r), any industry utilizing Chlorine, a regulated gas, above its threshold quantity of 2,500, must develop a Risk Management Plan and implement a Risk Management Program.  \n\n     The Union Springs WWTP, in implementing their Risk Management Program (RMP), is currently undergoing changes in both process design and operations, as well as improving on their emergency response preparedness plans.  The Plant is currently prepared to respond to incidental leaks of Chlorine gas, and have on hand self-contained breathing equipment, a ton container repair kit, escape respirators, first aid stations, and fire extinguishers located throughout the facility.

Chlorine gas is used as the principal disinfectant  The Union Springs WWTP recognizes that Chlorine gas, if accidentally released into the environment, may cause severe injury and even death for a significant distance from the source.

For the next few months the Union Springs WWTP will continue to rely on emergency assistance from local volunteers and neighboring counties. \n\n     EPA requires each regulated facility to analyze a Worst-Case Scenario release for each of its regulated substances.  A Worst-Case Scenario is the release of the entire contents of a regulated substance container.  In addition EPA requires as well an Alternative-Case Scenario for each regulated substance in which the released regulated gases are brought under control at some point following uncontrolled release events.\n\n     In the Worst-Case Scenario for Chlorine, detailed within the facility's RMP, a scenario is considered in which the uncontrolled release of the entire contents of a ton container of gas occurs.  There are no mitigation features included in these Worst-Case Scenarios, such as enclosed buildings or other structures.  The release is assumed to take place outside the Chlorine Building during an unloading event.  The endpoint radius for such a release, in which injury to those exposed is potentially possible, was calculated using parameters which are facility specific as well as criteria provided by EPA.  The endpoint radius was calculated to be 3.0 miles for Chlorine following the loss of the entire contents of a one ton container gas.

One of the principal mechanical lines of defense are the vacuum regulator valves on the ton containers of Chlorine. These valves release gas from the ton container only when a vacuum is applied, hence, if a line should break in the process manifold piping system for Chlorine, the regulator valves on the source will automatically shut off.  Other physical devices in place include detectors capable of setting off alarms when the atmospheric concentrations of Chlorine rise above 1 ppm, approximately that level which is detectable by humans.\n\n     Although the potential for an entire ton container of the gas to escape the Plant's boundaries is unlikely, it can happen.  The EPA requires all responders to such a release to coordinate with the local Emergency Management Agency, the Fire Department, HazMat specialists and other local authorities such as the Police Department and Sheriff's office, in order to effectuate the best plan for evacuation efforts, if needed, and other requirements to assure the greatest protection for those who may be exposed to the gas.  As described below, recommendations have been submitted regarding improved maintenance and safety, the introduction of a community siren system, as well as initial response activities developed through coordinated efforts with the participating agencies and rescue organizations.\n\n     As part of the Worst-Case scenario Emergency Response Action the cooperating agencies considered, and is currently implementing, procedures for responding to sensitive receptors within the endpoint distance of the regulated gas.

USGS maps showing the effected areas within the endpoint distance are filed within the facility's RMP.  The estimated population within the 3.0 mile endpoint radius is 1,100 persons.\n\n    In the Alternative Release Scenario the Union Springs WWTP adopted conditions of uncontrolled release in which the failure of a check valve results in the release of the regulated gas for a period of  approximately 60 minutes.  At this time the gas leak is arrested and brought under control by emergency response personnel.  The endpoint radius for Chlorine was calculated to be 1.2 miles (Union Springs WWTP chose a scenario provided by the AWWA's Compliance Guidance and Model Risk Management Program for Water Treatment Plants).  Mitigation features which may impede the dispersal of the released gases, such as an enclosed building, were integrated into the Alternative Release Scenario calculations.  The population of Union Springs affected within the 1.2 radius is estimated at 170 persons.\n\n     Currently the regulated gases are connected to the Chlorine process in a fire proof, brick building located along US Hwy 82 East, approximately 2 miles east from the town of Union Springs.  A two ton hoist system removes the ton containers from delivery trucks and secures them inside this building for processing.  A Chlorine detector is in place, set to activate an alarm system at 1 parts per million concentration. This detector is tested everyday for responsiveness.  A new detector has been ordered following recommendations from the Plant's Hazard Review of the Chlorine process.
