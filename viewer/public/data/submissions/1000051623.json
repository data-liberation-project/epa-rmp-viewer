Our commitment to protect our employees and the communities that are home to our operations is an integral part of Haviland's way of doing business.

The regulated substance involved with this process is Hydrazine Hydrate 100%.\n\n\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n\n\nThe toxic worst-case scenario is the catastrophic failure of a 5,000 gallon portable Isotainer and the release of 40,000 lbs. of Hydrazine Hydrate 100%.  The evaporating Hydrazine Hydrate 100% could reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.\n\n\n\nThere is not a flammable worst-case scenario for the same catastrophic failure of the 5,000 gallon Isotainer due to the flashpoint of the regulated substance to be 165A?F.\n\n\n\nThe toxic alternative case scenario is a ruptured hose during the unloading process, which could result in the release of 4,700 lbs. of the regulated substance to containment.  The evaporating Hydrazine Hydrate 100% could reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.\n\n\n\nThere is not a flammable worst-case scenario for the same ruptured hose scenario due to the flashpoint of the regulated substance to be 165A?F.\n\n\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENT"
