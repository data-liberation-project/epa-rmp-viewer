If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizer for sale to farmers.  The maximum quantity stored would be 126947.5 pounds in 29-1000 gallon nurse tanks.  The worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of the largest nurse tank as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 4377.5 pounds, which represents the volume of the nurse tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .31 miles.  The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in the transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint is .22 miles.  Public receptors are in the area such as schools, residences, prisons, recreation areas, and commercial businesses supplying approximate 2000 people.\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia K-61.1\", published by American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".  \n\nThe facility has a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training informing them on the hazards, properties working with anhydrous ammonia.  Employees are trained on filling procedures and maintenance activities and proper first aid treatment in emergency approach.  They are informed on the Personal Protective Equipment that is also required in handlin"

Emergency response teams are given a tour of the facilities and also review the written response.\n\nThe KS DEPT OF AG perform an inspection of the facilities on the bulk plant as well as on the nurse tanks.  They bring to attention letting the problems that are wrong and that they have to be improved on annual basis.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. There are no reported accidents recorded at this time.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
