      "SummaryText": "The City of Fort Wayne Three Rivers Filtration Plant (TRFP) staff is committed to safety and is continually evaluating ways to improve safety programs.  Facility staff works closely with other city and county agencies to coordinate safety and emergency response training activities. The TRFP uses chlorine, a regulated substance, in 1-ton cylinders to purify drinking water for the City of Fort Wayne, Indiana.  A maximum of 14 ton cylinders can be maintained onsite, though this only occurs during peak demand. In 1998 the facility installed a state-of-the-art, chlorine containment system and has won a national award from the City-County Communications & Marketing Association for its computerized operating procedures.\r\n\r\nChlorine cylinders are used and stored inside the Chlorine Storage Building where chlorine sensors continuously monitor air in the building.  If sensors detect chlorine above 1 ppm, a blower is automatically turned on which exhausts building air through the emergency chlorine scrubber and an alarm is activated alerting plant personnel to a possible chlorine leak.  The emergency chlorine scrubber system contains CHLOROSORB&reg; II, a carbon-alumina based media that absorbs and neutralizes chlorine.  The scrubber system is capable of effectively removing over 1 ton of chlorine (the contents of one overfilled cylinder).  The scrubber system is also capable of handling air containing up to 100% chlorine gas and discharge on a continuous basis at less than 0.005 ppm chlorine concentration.  The TRFP regularly submits samples of the scrubber media to the supplier to monitor its depletion rate and replaces the media as recommended.\r\n\r\nIn the Chlorine Storage Building liquid chlorine is converted to chlorine gas.  Before leaving the Chlorine Storage Building to other TRFP buildings, chlorine gas is piped through a vacuum controlled valve, which controls the flow of chlorine gas throughout the rest of the chlorination process.  A loss of vacuum in the process lin"

      "SummaryText": "es due to a leak or other equipment malfunction automatically closes the vacuum controlled valve; thereby, preventing a  leak of chlorine gas inside other TRFP buildings.  When there is a loss of vacuum in the process lines, an alarm is also activated alerting plant personnel to the equipment malfunction.\r\n\r\nBecause the TRFP chlorine storage area and operating system are located indoors with a scrubber system to automatically neutralize any liquid chlorine leak, an off-site release of chlorine is not likely to occur.  To comply with EPA guidance, the building enclosure and scrubber were not considered as mitigating factors in the worst-case and alternate scenario modeling.  In both scenarios the leaks were assumed to occur outdoors during the receiving/unloading of full 1-ton cylinders.  The receiving/unloading of full 1-ton cylinders occurs infrequently and the outdoor leaks used in the worst-case and alternate scenario modeling are not likely to occur.  \r\n\r\nThe TRFP has safely chlorinated the City of Wayne water for decades without incident.  The facility continues evaluating ways to improve the safety of this chlorine system.\r\n\r\nThe TRFP maintains a Prevention Program in compliance with EPA's RMP Rule and OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard. \r\n\r\nThe facility is covered by the Fort Wayne - Allen County Office of Homeland Security community emergency response plan and has procedures for notifying local emergency responders in the event of an accidental release of chlorine.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nThe TRFP continuously attempts to improve the safety of our processes to protect our employees, the public and the environment.  The TRFP incident investigations, employee suggestions and improvements in technology are utilized to update the safety aspects of the processes."
