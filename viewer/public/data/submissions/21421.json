This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program.  The program in place at the Lordstown facility encompasses such areas as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility.  It is the policy of MarkWest to implement appropriate controls to prevent the possible release of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, MarkWest is completely coordinated with the Trumbull County Local Emergency Planning Committee which provides emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substance Handled\n\nThe primary function of the MarkWest facility encompasses propane storage and wholesale distribution.  The one substance present at the facility regulated by the Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations is propane, which is delivered to the facility by rail car.  The propane is stored in one 80,000-gallon capacity vessel.  The propane is then distributed to various customers by tank truck loading.\n \nThe total quantity of product stored in the 80,000-gallon capacity vessel is administratively controlled to ensure that the vessel is not filled above 90% of full capacity.  Additionally, pressure relief vessels provide added assurance that the vessel is not over-filled to pressures above 250 pounds per square inch (psi).  These controls are in place to prevent the potential for over-pressurization which could cause structural damage to the vessels and lead to a release.\n\nBased on the administrative controls described above, the maximum inventory present in the vessel would be equal to"

The worst case and alternative case radii of effect were determined utilizing RMP*Comp software provided by the EPA.  The following describes details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case scenario for Program 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from the 80,000-gallon capacity propane storage vessel.  The scenario involves the release of the entire quantity of the vessel, approximately 72,000 gallons (304,330 lbs) of propane.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Offsite receptors would be affected.\n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances involves a release from the 80,000-gallon capacity propane storage vessel.  The scenario involves the release of approximately 30,000 lbs of propane due to a loading hose ruture.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in the vapor cloud explosion. Off-site receptors would be affected.\n\n4.\tThe General Accident Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nMarkWest has taken all the necessary steps to comply with accidental release prevention requirements set forth under 40 CFR Part 68 of the RMP regulations.  The propane storage and distribution process at MarkWest is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Manag"

The HAZOP methodology is used to carry out these analyses.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at regular intervals.  Any findings related to the hazard analyses are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purpose of safely conducting activities within covered processes, MarkWest maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial start up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and startup after turn around.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the process.\n\nTraining\n\nMarkWest has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that the employees operating processes are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with the processes.  New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe integrity of mechanical operations at MarkWest is ensured through documented maintenance checks on process equipment.  Process equipment examined by these checks include among others: pressurized storage vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps."

Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at MarkWest to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and are trained on the specifics of the modification.\n\nPre-Startup Reviews\n\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as required.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nMarkWest conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the  provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out every three years as required by the RMP regulations (40 CFR 68.58) and any corrections required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and timely manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nMarkWest investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident, as well as any corrective actions needed to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a period of five years.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nMarkWest believes that successful RMP, PSM, and accident prevention programs require a team effort.  Company employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, MarkWest employees"

Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the safety performance of the contractor is undertaken.  MarkWest has a strict policy of informing contractors of known potential hazards relating to the contractor's work and the associated processes.  Contractors are also informed of all procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n\n5.\tFive Year Accident History\n\nMarkWest has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years.  Due to stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\n\n6.\tEmergency Action Plan\n\nA written emergency action plan to deal with accidental releases of regulated substances is retained at the MarkWest facility.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including medical treatment, evacuations, and notification of local emergency response agencies and the public,\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.
