Ethylene oxide is highly effective in killing bacteria, insects, and fungi.  It serves as an efficient means for sterilization in systems where heat cannot be used to kill such organisms.  The use of ethylene oxide as a sterilization has been the dominant disinfection method in the United States since it was introduced, around the beginning of this century. \n\nAs one might expect from its superior sterilization properties, ethylene oxide is a hazardous substance.  Thus, storing and handling ethylene oxide can present a risk to employees and the public without proper precautions.  The El Paso facility considers safe practices in storing and using ethylene oxide to be of primary importance and has an excellent safety record with ethylene oxide.\n\nThe El Paso facility ethylene oxide storage and usage process is subject to the Environmental Protection Agency Risk Management Program regulation.  This regulation requires submission of a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  An integral part of the RMP is a summary of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility, including a description of the possible consequences in case of an accident and the actions, which will be taken by the facility in an emergency.\n\nThe following information is specifically required in the RMP Executive Summary: \n\n* Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n* General facility and regulated substances information.\n* Summary of the accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n* Five-year accident history summary.\n* Emergency response program summary.\n* Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nThe above information for the El Paso facility ethylene oxide sterilization system is provided below.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe El Paso facility accidental release prevention"

The El Paso facility will assemble an audit team that will include personnel knowledgeable in the Risk Management Program rule and in the process.  This team will evaluate whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the Risk Management Program rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process.  The results of the audit will be documented, recommendations resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program will be implemented.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe El Paso facility investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release (serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment) so that similar accidents can be prevented.  An investigation team is assembled and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.  Information found during the investigation is reviewed by affected staff and added or used to revise operating and maintenance procedures.  There have been no such incidents invol"

      "SummaryText": "ving the El Paso facility ethylene oxide system.\n\nFive-Year Accident History Summary\n\nNo ethylene oxide releases that could have caused safety or health hazard (deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place) occurred at the El Paso facility during the last five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program Summary\n\nThe El Paso facility is a non-responding facility, which means that the facility employees will not respond to ethylene oxide accidental relaese.  Instead the facility has coordinated with the local response agency to respond to any ethylene oxide release that may occur at the facility.\n\nThe main elements of the emergency response plan are: (1) initial discovery equipment and procedure, (2) response to an emergency, including procedures for immediate action and internal notifications, and (3) procedures for external notifications, including coordination with local agencies. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nNumerous changes to improve safety (recommended actions) were identified for the ethylene oxide system equipment and procedures in November 2003, when a process hazard analysis was performed.  This PHA was again reviewed on May 26, 2005.  All the recommendations have been evaluated and documented."
