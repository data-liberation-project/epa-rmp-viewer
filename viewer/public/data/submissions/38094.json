Anhydrous ammonia (NH3), is a gas at ambient conditions.  The anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) refrigeration system is used to manufacture and store fluid milk, ice cream,  and related products.  It is a closed system that contains approximately 15,400 pounds of ammonia in various physical states (gas, liquid, and saturated vapor).  The largest vessel is the high stage accumulator that operates at approximately 25 psig and can contain as much as 15,200 pounds of liquid ammonia (at its maximum safe fill volume of 80%).  However, during typical operation, the vessel contains only 4,200 pounds of ammonia.  Most of the ammonia equipment is located indoors.  The condensing towers, receiver, ice chiller, silos, and some piping runs are located outdoors.\n\n\n\nAmmonia is the oldest and most common refrigerant in general industrial use throughout the world.  It is a high capacity refrigerant that operates at reasonable pressure.  Although exposure to ammonia is irritating and potentially toxic in large doses, personnel exposure to more than a small leak is rare because ammonia operates within a closed system of vessels, piping, and equipment.  In addition, ammonia can be easily detected by smell at levels well below its toxic endpoint.\n\n\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system at the Fayetteville plant  is a single-stage flooded system consisting of a discharge (high pressure) side and a suction side.  \n\n\n\nThe compressors draw suction from the high side suction accumulator at about 25 psig.  This accumulator receives suction from the ice builders, cooler units, chillers, and refrigerated tanks and silos.  Ammo"

      "SummaryText": "nia liquid which collects in the high side accumulator is transferred to the system by turbine pumps.\n\n\n\nThe major discharge from the high side compressors (hot gas), at 150 to 175 psig,  enters two roof-mounted condensers.  A portion of the hot gas is also used for defrosting of load units. \n\n\n\nThe condensed liquid is transferred to the high pressure receiver where it is fed to the refrigeration equipment, via the accumulator.\n\n\n\nVarious safety systems are part of the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.   These include pressure relief valves, engine room ventilation, and safety interlocks.  \n\n\n\nPressure relief valves protect the compressor discharge, condensers, and suction accumulators from overpressurization.\n\n\n\nSafety interlocks include high pressure and high temperature alarms and cut outs for the compressors as well as high level floats and sensors for the vessels.  The high pressure cut-outs for the compressors are set at 225 psig. The system also includes a solenoid-operated liquid (\"King\") valve which is controlled and shut down from the accumulator controls. A system high pressure alarm also turns off all compressors when the high side pressure exceeds 190 psig.\n\n\n\nThe accumulator has both high liquid level and low liquid level shut down switches.  The high level switch activates a slave relay that shuts down the compressors.  The low level switch activates a slave relay that shuts down both the compressors and the liquid pumps.  The liquid pumps are equipped with high temperature shut-offs.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is protected by the existence of specific safety systems/hardware, including safety relief valves, engine room ventilation, and system safety interlocks.  Safety relief valves protect the compressor discharge, condensers, suction accumulators, receiver, and chillers from the hazards associated with overpressure.  Safety interlocks include high pressure and high temperature alarms and cutouts for the compressors, as well as high l"

The high pressure cutouts for the compressors are set at 200 psig.\n\n\n\nThe refrigeration system is a totally closed system.  Historically, releases of ammonia from industrial refrigeration systems most often occur from leaking valves, malfunctioning pressure relief devices, or inadvertent releases during repair activities.  While these incidents can impact employees, they seldom lead to a release of a reportable quantity or represent an off-site impact.  Moreover, a release of ammonia that could affect the environment is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n\n\n* Many of the high pressure liquid lines are located in enclosed areas that could help to contain such a release, and the outside piping is elevated to promote dispersion;\n\n\n\n* Industrial standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of these lines;\n\n\n\n* Ammonia is not corrosive in this service;\n\n\n\n* Most of the lines are elevated to minimize potential damage from fork lifts;\n\n\n\n* The facility has a preventive maintenance program in place to maintain the ongoing integrity of the system;\n\n\n\n* The facility has a training program designed to ensure that the system is operated by qualified personnel; and\n\n\n\n* The facility has emergency response procedures which enable trained personnel to respond quickly to isolate any potential releases by closing valves in the liquid lines.\n\n\n\n2.0    PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe facility has carefully considered the potential for accidental releases of ammonia, such as the occurrence of the worst-case and alternative-release scenarios required by 40 CFR 68.  To help minimize the probability and severity of an ammonia release, a prevention program that satisfies the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals  standard (29 CFR 1910.119) has been implemented.
