All operators of the facility undergo Chemical Process Safety Management (PSM) training and operator training specific to the facility.  The Propane storage System complies with NFPA-58 requirements for LP-Gas storage, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Ascension Parish Fire and State Police Departments and request that they respond to the emergency.  We are a active member of the Geismar Area Mutual Aid (GAMA) Association which provide additional assistance in emergencies.  \r\n \r\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:  This facility produces Renewable Hydrocarbon Diesel Fuel.  LPG is a co-product for sale to retail propane outlets.  The facility has one 90,000-gallon LPG tank.\r\n \r\nThe worst-case and alternative release scenarios:  Our worst-case scenario is failure of the 90,000-gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (70% at ambient temperature), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint (0.1 miles) extends offsite, and public receptors (neighboring industrial facilities) are within the distance to the endpoint.  Our alternative release scenario is a BLEVE of the LPG tank and release of 387,000 lbs and explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint (0.12 miles) extends offsite, and public receptors (neighboring industrial facilities) are within the distance to the endpoint.\r\n\r\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:  This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule, the OSHA PSM standard, and all appli"

Five-year accident history will be documented in that time frame as the facility initial start up was on or about October 1, 2010.  \r\n\r\nThe emergency response program:  In the event of an emergency involving our propane system, it is our policy to notify the Ascension Parish Fire and State Police Departments and request that they help respond to the emergency.  The Geismar Area Mutual Aid (GAMA) Association will also be available to assist the facility.  Employees will be trained in CPR, Incipient Fire Brigade and Fire Extinguishers.  We have coordinated our response plans with the fire department; members of the fire department have inspected our propane system.  All Team members are taught in Hazard Communication to report any observed chemical leaks/spills and odors to their supervisor or lead person immediately.  Supervisors and Leads are taught to report the above to the Plant Manager, Environmental/Health & Safety Coordinator, and Operations Supervisor immediately for investigation and follow-up action.  SDS (Safety Data Sheets) are accessible to all team members for review."
