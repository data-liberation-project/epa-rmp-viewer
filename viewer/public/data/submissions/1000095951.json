NASA stores, handles, and uses monomethyl hydrazine (MMH) in excess of the 15,000-pounds (lbs) threshold quantity identified in 40 CFR \u00a7 68.3. A previous RMP revision was submitted on September 8, 2016, and in accordance with 40 CFR \u00a7 68.190(b)(1), NASA is required to submit an updated RMP at least once every five years from the date of its initial submission or most recent update to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Since the 2016 RMP submission, WSTF continued modifying covered processes to improve the safety of personnel by removing large quantities of propellant storage from the WSTF test areas. This resulted in the elimination of an RMP covered process in the 400 Area (2016 NASA WSTF RMP Process ID # 1000051778). This 2021 NASA WSTF RMP update includes a revised Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for the remaining covered process in the WSTF 500 Area Propellant Storage and Distribution location (2016 NASA WSTF RMP Process ID # 1000051779) and a revised hazard assessment with off-site consequence analyses for worst-case and alternative release scenarios. This document supplements the information provided in the required RMP electronic submission though the EPA's RMP*eSubmit application. An electronic copy of the EPA RMP submittal and certification page is provided in Appendix A.\r\n\r\n2.0\tAccidental Release Prevention \r\nNASA is committed to providing a safe place of employment by meeting or exceeding applicable health and safety requirements to assure personnel, community, and environmental safety and preservation of resources at WSTF. The WSTF Safety Program is described in WSTF Manual (WM)-SAF-0001, Chapter 1 General Safety & Health Program that is incorporated into the WSTF Integrated Management System (WIMS). The Safety Program emphasizes the concept that safety is the individual and personal responsibility of everyone at WSTF. Thi"

      "SummaryText": "s safety concept is reinforced by WSTF's Star status in the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Voluntary Protection Program (VPP). Embedded within the WIMS processes, procedures, and instructions are key safety controls to properly contain and maintain the hazardous substances used and stored at WSTF. The application of controls follows NASA's risk reduction hierarchy of controls. Embedded within the WIMS are emergency protocols to be followed in the event of an accidental release of a hazardous substance. WSTF's International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9001 registered management system also establishes a strong basis for conformance to NASA policies and procedures and compliance with applicable federal, state, and local regulations.\r\n\r\nNASA's efforts to prevent accidental releases at WSTF begin with sound engineering practices that incorporate lessons learned from past experiences. NASA has been conducting research and hazardous rocket engine testing with liquid propellants at WSTF since the early 1960s. This research and associated test experience over the past decades not only helped define hypergolic propellant hazards at WSTF, but also for the entire aerospace industry. NASA understands that awareness of hazards is the first step in being able to design, build, operate, and maintain safe, reliable systems. These safely designed, built, and maintained systems are key to preventing accidental releases during testing and operational activities. \r\n\r\n2.1\tAccidental Release Prevention Controls\r\nPrimary engineering controls focus on the safe design, build up, and operation of systems. Secondary controls, also embedded within the WIMS, include administrative controls such as the use of safety, caution, and warning devices; training; and personal protective equipment. Each type of control has one or more management system documents dedicated to its implementation. These controls are integral to Process Safety Management instructions (WM-SAF"

The design standards under this program are based on the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) code and other relevant national consensus standards. The WSTF Emergency Preparedness Plan (WSTF Standard Procedure [WSP] 25-0009) provides directions for activities which: eliminate or reduce the probability of disaster; prepare measures which protect life, the environment, and property; respond appropriately during emergencies; and establish a recovery system returning the facility to normal or improved operation following an emergency. WSTF also has chartered an Emergency Preparedness Planning Board which has the responsibility to continuously review the plan and assure its effective maintenance.\r\n\r\n3.0\tStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled \r\nSeveral hazardous chemicals are used at WSTF during rocket engine testing and research activities, but only the hypergolic propellant MMH is stored, handled, or used in a quantity above the Risk Management Program rule threshold for regulated toxic substances of 15,000 lbs. This propellant is used in several NASA, Department of Defense, and commercial aerospace propulsion subsystems. MMH storage containers (tanks, drums, cylinders, etc.) are present in the 300, 400, and 500 Areas and are stored at ambient temperature and pressures up to 60-80 pounds per square inch in gauge. Dump tanks were historically used to receive propellant from run tanks not consumed during an engine test or as an emergency dump location as needed. Propellants in dump tanks were typically transferred back to run tanks or to longer-term storage t"

Run tanks are present at the points of use (test stands) and are used to store propellant for immediate use in engine testing. Propellants contained in run tanks can be saturated with helium up to 600 pounds per square inch absolute and temperature conditioned between 40 and 120 \u00b0F. Propellants can be pressure transferred between storage, run, dump tanks, and the planned Reserve Tank Systems (RTSs) discussed in Section 8.0.\r\n\r\nIn the 2014 and 2016 WSTF RMP submittals, NASA indicated propellant storage and distribution systems would be removed from the 300 and 400 Areas, with the bulk of MMH storage transferred to the 500 Area Propellant Storage and Distribution location. In the 2016 RMP update, NASA highlighted the completion of this process in the 300 Area and reconfirmed its commitment to lower MMH storage capacity in the WSTF 400 Area. The Ready Storage Units (RSUs) were removed from the 400 Area and maximum intended inventory was reduced in the 400 Area to 1,900 gallons (gal; 13,794 lbs using the density of MMH unit 7.26 lbs/gal). This volume reduction reflects a change in NASA's testing and propellant management philosophy at WSTF, which includes relocating large quantities of propellant out of the 300 and 400 Areas to the dedicated propellant storage area in the WSTF 500 Area Propellant Storage and Distribution location. Smaller transport containers now provide the quantity of propellant required for propulsion testing.\r\n\r\nThe Process Hazard Analysis for Propulsion Test Areas General Hazards (Including Highly Hazardous Chemicals) (PTO-GEN-BSL-HAZA-008-PHA.E) identifies a maximum intended inventory of 1,900 gal (13,794 lbs) of MMH for the WSTF 300 Area and 400 Areas, which is below the 15,000 lbs threshold quantity for MMH. Instructions for monitoring and controlling propellant volumes are provided in the administrative WSTF Job Instruction (WJI) titled Propellant and Propane Accountability (WJI-PROP-GE"

The 500 Area Propellant Storage and Distribution location is used for long-term storage of MMH in drums or 4BW cylinders that meet Department of Transportation specification requirements (49 CFR \u00a7 178.61). The storage area is fenced separately, and access is controlled by lock and key. The Maximum Intended Inventory for MMH in the 500 Area Propellant Storage and Distribution location is 123,424 lbs (17,000 gal). This can include mixtures of fuels that contain non-regulated substances such as hydrazine and Aerozine-50 (50/50 mixture of hydrazine and unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine [UDMH]).

ALOHA input parameters and output results are provided in Appendix B. The toxic endpoint goes beyond the WSTF administrative boundary into the JER, but there are no Part 68 defined potential public or environmental receptors within the exceedance area (Figure 6.1). This statement is based on the fact that not all off-site areas contain potential public receptors. In this case, there are no areas within the exceedance area where members of the public are expected to routinely gather.\r\n\r\nThere are no residences, institutions (i.e., school, hospitals), buildings, parks, or recreation areas within the exceedance area. The JER is an access controlled ecological and agricultural research center owned by the United States Department of Agriculture that contains many inaccessible tracts of land that lack public facilities and do not get used routinely. Chapter 2 of the EPA's General Risk Management Program Guidance (April 2004) also acknowledges that in general, farmland is not considered a public receptor. The farm-like rangeland and ecological research being conducted at the JER would fit the RMP non-public farmland scenario, because the JER land in the exceedance area is not routinely occupied by farm workers or other members of the public. Figure 6.1 provides land ownership within and outside the WSTF administrative boundary. All land within the toxic endpoint is access restricted inside the WSTF administrative boundary or with the access-controlled JER.\r\n\r\nThe General RMP Guidance (April 2004) specifically limits environmental receptors that must be considered during RMP off-site consequence analysis to natural areas.

Because none of these areas are located within the exceedance area, no impacted environmental receptors were identified in the RMP off-site consequence worst-case release scenario.\r\n\r\n6.2\tAlternative Release Scenario\r\nAlternative Release Scenario Analysis is required by 40 CFR \u00a7 68.28(a) states that the facility shall identify and analyze at least one alternative release scenario for each regulated toxic substance held in a covered process(es) and at least one alternative release scenario to represent all flammable substances held in covered processes. Upon consideration of possible releases, a shipping container mishandling scenario was selected for the covered process. The Alternative Release Scenario chosen involves one 120-gal 4BW cylinder of MMH being transported from the 500 Area Propellant Storage and Distribution location Interim Storage Area to the 400 Test Area. Process Hazard Analysis for Propulsion Test Areas General Hazards (Including Highly Hazardous Chemicals) (PTO-GEN-BSL-HAZA-008-PHA.E) identifies the maximum rated capacity for this container as 110 gal when allowing for ullage. While unloading the 4BW cylinder of MMH from the transport trailer in the 400 Area, there is an accident that causes the cylinder to be physically dropped off the transport vehicle. This results in a rupture of the container and a release of MMH.\r\n \r\nThe Alternative Release Scenario is a liquid release of 100% MMH. The simulated release resulted in the 110 gal (~798.6 lbs) of MMH being released at ground level onto an unconfined soil area (not diked).

Meteorological conditions used for the Alternative Release Scenario were selected from data in the WSTF Facility Master Plan and available meteorological data from the adjacent JER facility. The shipping container mishandling scenario was modeled as a liquid stream released continuously at 62.5 \u00b0F at ground level, with 30% humidity, and with a wind speed of 15 mph. An atmospheric stability class of \"F\" (stable) was used. The topography was identified as rural for WSTF, using the open space ground roughness parameter in ALOHA. From the model output, the maximum evaporation rate from the released MMH was 13.3 lbs/minute with a total evaporation time of 60 minutes. The ALOHA results indicate a maximum MMH toxic endpoint distance of 0.71 miles. This area is within the WSTF administrative boundary, which is located 1.47 miles from the release point (Figure 6.2).

The WSTF Fire Department is responsible for the training and equipment of the team. The WSTF Fire Department coverage is provided full-time, 24-hours a day.\r\n\r\nWSTF has developed plans and procedures to protect life and property from the effects of hazardous events. The Emergency Preparedness Plan provides a Hazard/Threat Identification Analysis table that lists the possible hazards and the likelihood of occurrence. The priority for the Plan follows the likelihood of a hazard occurrence. This policy is based upon the concept that emergency functions for various organizations involved in emergency management will generally parallel normal day-to-day functions. Activities that do not contribute directly to resolving the emergency may be postponed or redirected for the duration of any emergency, making labor, materials, and equipment available for emergency use.\r\n\r\nWSTF utilizes the Incident Command System (ICS) in the handling of emergencies. Fire, medical, and chemical spills that exceed WSTF local area capabilities to handle safely are examples of emergencies that will be handled using the ICS.
