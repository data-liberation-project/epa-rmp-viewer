              "Description": "The Americold Logistics, LLC Prevention Program is built on the OSHA Process Safety\n\nManagement Standard for ammonia refrigeration systems. The first element in the safe\n\nfunction of ammonia refrigeration equipment is in the design itself. \n\n\n\nAll components in the system were designed and installed in compliance with ANSI, ASHRAE, ASME, Pressure\n\nVessel Codes and all other applicable design safety standards in effect at the time of\n\nconstruction. \n\n\n\nIn order for this system to function safely and effectively over a long period of time, it must be properly maintained and monitored for system integrity and functional efficiency. Maintenance and monitoring is accomplished by employees trained to follow safe procedures when operating the equipment from normal start-up to running and emergency shut-down. Also built into the system are automated and manual safeguards that monitor and maintain pressures, temperatures, liquid levels and warning systems that alert operators to respond early to operational deviations before they become emergencies.\n\n\n\nOperator training also includes participation in hazard analysis studies and emergency response procedures that permit hands-on practice in the use of personal protection equipment in an emergency scenario. The hazard analysis (\"what-if\") checklist helps operators and emergency responders understand how to evaluate and manage an emergency situation safety and effectively in order to mitigate the potential releases. Lockout/ tag-out, and line opening procedures are very important for preventing further hazards around malfunctioning equipment or when making even minor repairs on the system.\n\nGeneral employee training involves a knowledge of ammonia hazards, warning systems and\n\nevacuation procedures. \n\nCoordinated emergency response planning is established with the Marion County LEPC, and a written offsite emergency response plan is reviewed.\n\nannually.",

              "Description": "Building 4 Engine room system Release prevention program is managed along with the Buildings 1, 2, and 3 prevention system, since the same employees operate and maintain it.\n\n\n\nThe Americold Logistics, LLC Prevention Program is built on the OSHA Process Safety\n\nManagement Standard for ammonia refrigeration systems. The first element in the safe\n\nfunction of ammonia refrigeration equipment is in the design itself. \n\n\n\nAll components in the system were designed and installed in compliance with ANSI, ASHRAE, ASME, Pressure\n\nVessel Codes and all other applicable design safety standards in effect at the time of\n\nconstruction. \n\n\n\nIn order for this system to function safely and effectively over a long period of time, it must be properly maintained and monitored for system integrity and functional efficiency. Maintenance and monitoring is accomplished by employees trained to follow safe procedures when operating the equipment from normal start-up to running and emergency shut-down. Also built into the system are automated and manual safeguards that monitor and maintain pressures, temperatures, liquid levels and warning systems that alert operators to respond early to operational deviations before they become emergencies.\n\n\n\nOperator training also includes participation in hazard analysis studies and emergency response procedures that permit hands-on practice in the use of personal protection equipment in an emergency scenario. The hazard analysis (\"what-if\") checklist helps operators and emergency responders understand how to evaluate and manage an emergency situation safety and effectively in order to mitigate the potential releases. Lockout/ tag-out, and line opening procedures are very important for preventing further hazards around malfunctioning equipment or when making even minor repairs on the system.\n\nGeneral employee training involves a knowledge of ammonia hazards, warning systems and\n\nevacuation procedures. \n\nCoordinated emergency response planning is established with the Marion County LEPC, and a written offsite emergency response plan is reviewed.",

This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n    To save lives.\n\n    To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n    To protect the environment.\n\n    To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nAmericold maintains an emergency response (safety) committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes. \n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Americold Indianapolis (Plant #75140)facility chills and stores a variety of food products in their cold storage warehouse.  The refrigeration process, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold storage rooms.  Changes in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature.  For example, lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature.  Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat.  Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize.  Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid.  Typ"
