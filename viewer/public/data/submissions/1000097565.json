This facility includes processing tanks, piping, packaging equipment, raw materials warehousing, finished goods refrigerated storage, an Ammonia refrigeration engine room, boilers, and miscellaneous utilities.   \n\n\n\nThe refrigeration system required for our production process necessitates the submission of this Risk Management Plan.  The refrigeration system contains in excess of 23,700 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  This surpasses the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds outlined in Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program regulations.  \n\n\n\nGerber Products Company has implemented numerous policies and procedures to enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of Anhydrous Ammonia as well as other hazardous substances, fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid property and environmental damage.  \n\n\n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices that govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.

All processes that occur have to do with changes of state between liquid and vapor phases and their impact on heat transfer.\n\n\n\nThis refrigeration plant has a three temperature system for greater operating efficiency, the 1st temperature being +15?F, also referred to as high temperature, for general refrigeration, the 2nd temperature being 28?F, called low temperature, for the storage freezers and the 3rd temperature being -45?F, also called low temperature, for the low temperature Belt Freezer.  The High Temperature System, +15 system includes all equipment fed from the High Temperature Accumulator (V-15) which includes the ten Cooler Evaporators, along with the plate and frame heat exchanger.  The 28?F Low Temperature Systems is fed from the Low Temperature Accumulator (V-14).  This vessel provides for the eight Freezer Evaporators.  The 45?F Low Temperature Systems is fed from the Low temperature Accumulator (V-21).  This vessel provides for the two Belt Freezer Evaporators.  \n\n\n\nTo continue this description we will start at the screw compressors, there are seven total, three compressors are Low Stage or Boosters and four are High Stage.  \n\n\n\nThe three Low Stage Compressors (LS-1 - LS-3) draw low pressure gas (LSS) Low Stage Suction from either V-14 or V-21 Low Temperature Accumulators into the compressor where it is compressed by rotating screws.  This produces a medium pressure; medium temperature vapor designated Booster Discharge (BD), which flows to V-15, the High Temperature Accumulator for cooling.  \n\n\n\nThe"

This hot pressure gas which is also referred to High Stage Discharge or Hot Gas (HSD, HG) travels to the three Evaporative Condensers.  \n\n\n\nThe Evaporative Condensers, (EC-1 thru EC-3) are where all the heat picked up by the ammonia in the system is removed by the evaporation of water.  Once the heat is removed the ammonia vapor condensed inside the condenser coils becoming a high pressure liquid called Condensate Drain (CD), later referred to as HPL.  This liquid then flows by gravity to the Thermosyphon Vessel (V-17). \n\n\n\nThe Thermosyphon Vessel (V-17) serves two purposes; first it serves as a storage vessel for the high pressure liquid ammonia, at +95?F/181 psig of pressure.  But its' primary function is to provide liquid ammonia for the cooling of the compressors.  The compressors are cooled by circulating liquid ammonia Thermosyphon Supply (TSS) down to the compressor oil coolers/heat exchangers, where it flashes/boils off, cooling the oil that has absorbed the heat of compressing the ammonia gas.  This HP ammonia vapor, designated Thermosyphon Return (TSR), from the oil coolers then circulates by natural convection back up to the Vessel and the process is repeated.  CD/ammonia stored in the Thermosyphon Vessel also flows through one line to the Vertical Receiver (V-16), which is discussed shortly.  V-17 is connected by an equalization line to the evaporative condensers to balance, allowing liquid to freely flow down from them to the vessel.\n\n\n\nV-16, the Vertical Receiver stores CD from the Thermosyphon Vessel.  The Vertical Receiver I the main storage site for liquid ammonia used in the plant.  Liquid ammonia is stored at +95?F/181 psig of pressure and is designated as High pressure Liquid (HPL).  From this vessel the ammonia is transferred to the High Temperature Accumulator (V-15) for distribution throughout the system."

The first of these functions is separating the liquid from the gas in the High Temperature Recirculated Suction lines returning from the cooler evaporators.  This prevents damage to the High Stage Compressors.  The vessel is also used as storage for the liquid ammonia at the temperature and pressure above for circulation out to the cooler evaporators.  This circulation is accomplished by two Recirculator Pumps, RP-3 and RP-4.  An additional pump RP-5 is used to transfer liquid out to the compressors and the HSS travels back to the High Stage Compressors for recompression.  The vapor in this vessel is a result of the ammonia coming from the Booster Compressors.  \n\n\n\nThe V-21 Low Temperature Accumulator operates at -45?F/11.7\" HG of pressure and operates in the same manner as the V-14 vessel.

In the event that the chemical release would not pose an inhalation hazard, the area of the spill and an appropriate buffer zone will be evacuated until the spill can be cleaned up.  Should a site wide chemical emergency occur, the maintenance departments will shut down air handling systems, as needed.
