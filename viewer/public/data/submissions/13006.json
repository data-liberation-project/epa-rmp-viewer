This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidential release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely corrdinated with the Marion County Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Warren Township Fire Department which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to assist in the control and mitigation of the release.\n\n     2.  THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:  Ulrich's primary activities encompass chemical repackaging, warehousing and distribution.  Currently, there are 9 regulated substances present at this facility.  These substances are Chlorine, Sulfur Dioxide, Dimethylamine, Formaldehyde, Hydrofluoric Acid, Hydrogen Chloride, Methylamine, Phosphorous Oxychloride and Trimethylamine.  At this time, the following are maximum inventory's: Chlorine 114,550  lbs.; Sulfur Dioxide 34,350 lbs.; Dimethylamine 72,215 lbs.; Formaldehyde 16,397 lbs.; Hydrofluoric Acid 58,000 lbs.; Methylamine 96,785 lbs.; Phosphorous Oxychloride 17,400 lbs. and Trimethylamine 94,250 lbs..  However, due to the nature of our industry, maximum inventory volumes will fluctuate upon customer demand.\n\n     3.  WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO(s) & ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO(s): To perform the required offsite consequence analysis for this facility, we have used EPA's RMP*Comp program.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\n     The worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release of hydrogen chloride.

Under worst case weather conditions, namely Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 1.1 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.030 mg/l.\n\n     The alternative release scenario for hydrogen chloride involves a release from a storage container.  The scenario involves a gaseous release of 25 lbs. over 30 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.030 mg/l is <0.1 miles.\n\n     The alternative release scenario for chlorine involves a release from a storage container.  The scenario involves a gaseous release of 50 lbs. over 30 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls, such as storage within the warehouse, have been taken into account in calculating this scenario.  In addition, the release is also assumed to be controlled by active mitigation measures that include utilization of the chlorine salvage cylinder or emergency A or B kit to mitigate the release.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087mg/l is <0.1 miles.\n\n     The alternative release scenario for sulfur dioxide involves a release from a storage container.  The scenario involves a gaseous release of 50 lbs. over 30 minutes.   Passive mitigation controls, such as storage within the warehouse, have been taken into account in calculating this scenario.  In addition, the release is also assumed to be controlled by active mitigation measures that include utilization of sulfur dioxide gasket and the chlorine emergency A or B kit to mitigate the release.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0078mg/l is <0.1 miles.\n\n     The alternative release scenario for formaldehyde involves a release from a storage container.

Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0030 mg/l is 0.1 miles.\n\n     The worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release of trimethylamine.  The scenario involves a release of 47,633 lbs. from a bulk tank truck.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the maximum distance of 0.3 miles is obtained corresponding to a endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.\n\n     The alternative release scenario for trimethylmaine involves a release from a storag"
