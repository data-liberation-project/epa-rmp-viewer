This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and incorporating safety into the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the voestalpine Texas processes. The voestalpine Texas policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, facility personnel have been trained on how to respond to, control, and contain the release.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe voestalpine Texas facility, located in Portland, Texas, operates eight processes covered by\n\nthe Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation and\n\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard. The covered processes, delineated in the most recent Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), include the following: Natural Gas Station, Reformer Process Gas Loop/Cooling System (Burners excluded), Flue Gas System, Combustion System, Reduction Furnace and Top Gas System, Process Gas Compressors, Seal Gas System, an Utility Systems. The regulated flammable substances involved in the voestalpine Texas facility's covered processes include hydrogen, methane, and a flammable natural gas mixture. \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is an executive summary of the accidental release prevention program in place at the voestalpine Texas facility. This summary includes a brief description of the accidental release prevention program and the management systems associated with it. \n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nvoestalpine Texas encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemic"

Employees are given access to all information created as part of the accident prevention program that applies to the process in which they work via the voestalpine network server. The specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program is documented in the facility's Employee Participation procedure (PSM-002).\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nvoestalpine Texas maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure the safe operation of its covered processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Chemical-specific information, including toxicity information, permissible exposure limits, physical data, reactivity data, corrosivity data, thermal and chemical stability data, and hazardous effects of inadvertent mixing of different materials that could foreseeable occur are provided in the safety data sheets (SDSs) available on the voestalpine network server. voestalpine Texas also maintains numerous technical documents that pertain to the equipment used in the process, including: materials of construction documents, piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs), electrical classifications, ventilation system information, relief system designs and design basis, design codes employed, material and energy balances and safety systems, including interlocks and detection and suppression systems. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that the facility's safety features are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nvoestalpine Texas has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with its cover"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nvoestalpine Texas has used the HAZOP method for its most recent analysis.  HAZOP analysis, when performed by trained and knowledgeable personnel, is recognized by the Center for Chemical Process Safety (CCPS) as an acceptable hazard evaluation technique. Each analysis is conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. Each team identifies and evaluates the hazards of the process and accident prevention and mitigation measures. Each team then makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures whenever the team believes such measures are necessary.  Each PHA team's findings are forwarded to local management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until completion. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure process controls and/or process hazards do not deviate significantly from their original design features, voestalpine Texas periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results for each of its covered processes. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency for each process until a process is no longer operational. \n\nOnce again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nvoestalpine Texas will maintain operating procedures for each of its covered processes that address various modes of"

These procedures are used as a reference by experienced operators and the basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures will be periodically reviewed for completeness and accuracy. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures developed for each process, voestalpine Texas has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive training on their process' basic operations, if they are not already familiar with such operations.  The Head of SSE and/or the Safety Coordinator will confirm that personnel understand the initial and/or refresher training required by this procedure.  Verification is determined through written exams, hands-on training, field evaluations, and/or on-the-job training.  In the event that a voestalpine or contractor employee does not pass the verification process they will be prohibited from operating that process until a passing grade is achieved.  An Individual Training Record will be used to document personal training and the means used to verify that the training was understood. Refresher training will be conducted for all affected personnel at least every three years, during which training participants will be consulted about the appropriate frequency of the training.  \n\n\n\nContractors\n\nvoestalpine Texas uses contractors to supplement its workforce.

Any visitors (including vendors and consultants) on site for more than three days must undergo site orientation. Temporary basis badge owners must be escorted anywhere by anyone with an authorized long-term badge.  The Safety Coordinator will provide visitors with information regarding the known PSM hazards. \n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nvoestalpine Texas conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review verifies construction is in accordance with design specifications and all supporting systems are operationally ready. During each PSSR, personnel use checklists to verify all aspects of readiness and verify all accident prevention program requirements have been properly implemented.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nvoestalpine Texas has established practices and procedures related to the equipment used in its covered processes. The basic aspects of the facility's mechanical integrity program include: (1) conducting training, (2) written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) safe work practices.  Training will be provided to each maintenance and contract employee involved in maintaining the on-going integrity of process equipment.
