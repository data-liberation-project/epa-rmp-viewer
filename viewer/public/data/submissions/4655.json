Facility Accidental Release Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Souza's Enterprises, Inc. (herein referred to as the Facility) at 8148 E. Lacey Blvd., Hanford, CA  93230 are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n2.     Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the Facility is the storage, blending, and sale of fertilizers to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received by tanker truck and stored in one (1) above ground tank at the site.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled is 40,000 pounds.\n\n3.     The Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios:\nThe worst-case release scenario is failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would release 40,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by regulations.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.428 miles.  The alternative release scenario, based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a 1\" diameter hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 pm) is .4935 miles.  The distance to end points are based on an assumed temperature of 95 degrees F.\n\n4.

Five-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of near misses of anhydrous ammonia, in the past five years that:\n\nhave caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.     The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility's emergency response program was written in accordance with the following regulations:\n\nOSHA 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nOSHA 29 CFR 1910.120; and\n\nSection 25503, Division 6.95 of the California Health and Safety Code\n\n7.     Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific planned changes to the anhydrous ammonia processes at the facility."
