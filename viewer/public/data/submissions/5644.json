We stock several types of\n     fertilizers used in crop production.  One of these fertilizers is anhydrous\n     ammonia.\n\n          F & L stores anhydrous ammonia in a large pressurized storage tank and in\n     a rail car at our store on US 6 north side of Bradner.  Farmers transport the\n     ammonia to their fields using smaller tanks called nurse tanks.  The\n     ammonia is then transferred to their equipment and applied to the crops.\n\n          All equipment used at the store is inspected annually by the Ohio\n     Department of Agriculture Division of Plant Industry-Section of Feeds and\n     Fertilizer.  F & L personnel check it daily during peak usage season and at\n     frequent intervals during other times of the year.  All employees receive\n     thorough training.  F & L has not had any releases of ammonia in the past 5\n     years that have endangered the surrounding community or our employees. \n     Federal EPA requires F & L to describe two scenarios to emergency response\n     agencies and the public.  The first, \"worst-case\" is not likely to happen.  It\n     assumes that a full storage tank would fail along with all of the safety\n     systems.  157,000 lbs of anhydrous ammonia would be released in 10\n     minutes.  Assuming the worst weather conditions the endpoint distance\n     would be 1.68 miles.  A more likely \"alternative release\" scenario is the\n     failure of a transfer hose with the safety systems working.  The release could\n     last for 2 minutes and be as much as 11,900 lbs.  Under average weather\n     conditions the endpoint would be 0.6 miles.  The release scenario information\n     was compiled using model information from The Fertilizer Institute.  Our\n     Emergency Response Program is coordinated by the Wood County LEPC."
