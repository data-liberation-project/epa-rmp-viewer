The Chlorine Feed Room at  Parsons Avenue Water Plant can store up to nine one-ton containers of chlorine, five containers on trunnions on the floor and four on the weigh-scale banks in the Chlorine Feed Room.\nChlorine is fed as a gas and after the chlorinator diaphragm, the remaining system is totally under vacuum.  Two one-ton containers of chlorine are normally in operation at one time, one for the pre- and one for the post chlorine feed points.  Chlorine gas is reduced to a vacuum through the container mounted chlorinators.  There are four container mounted chlorinators and four injectors with associated piping.  At the injectors, the chlorine gas mixes with water, and the solution is distributed to various locations in the Water Plant. The same prevention program is implemented for various units in the chlorination system.",

This plan has been endorsed by the City staff responsible for the operation and maintenance of the Parsons Avenue Water Plant.  The Parsons Avenue Water Plant has procedures in place, including both onsite activities and coordination with offsite responders, that must be followed in the event of a chlorine leak.  All personnel involved in handling chlorine are trained with regard to chlorine safety and accident prevention.\n\n'68.155(b) Stationary Source and Substance Handled\n\nThe stationary source subject to 40 CFR Part 68 is the City of Columbus Parsons Avenue Water Plant Chlorination Facility.  The Parsons Avenue Water Plant has a design capacity of 50 million gallons per day (MGD) and treats ground water to drinking water standards.  Facilities are provided for the handling and utilization of chlorine in one-ton containers.  The Chlorination Facility is located in the Chemical Feed Room, which includes a loading and unloading area, as well as a storage area for the one-ton containers.  \n\nThe chlorine ton containers are stored inside the Chemical Feed Room.  The doors and windows in these rooms are normally kept shut. A monorail and hoist assembly is provided for the handling and transfer of the one-ton containers to the storage facilities from flat-bed delivery trucks or from storage to the scale assemblies for process use.   Provisions are made to house nine (9) one-ton containers of chlorine, five of these are on trunnions on the floor of the Chemical Feed Room and the remaining four (4) are on scales.  Therefore the maximum intended inventory of chlorine at the Parsons Avenue Water Plant is 9 full one-ton containers of chlorine or approximately 18,000 lbs of chlorine.\n\nThe Chlorine Feed Room is equipped with four weigh-scale banks that can hold one connected o"

Normally, all four containers are hooked up to container mounted chlorinators with  only two of the one-ton containers in operation at a time, one for the pre- and one for the post chlorine feed points. When the in service container approaches empty, as noted by a red indicator flag at the valve of the container mounted chlorinator, the container is shut off and the next full container in the bank is opened and put in service. \n\nThe plant is currently feeding chlorine as a gas.  The chlorine gas is converted to a vacuum at the container mounted chlorinator diaphragm, after which the remaining system is totally under vacuum. The facility has two pairs of chlorinators, one designated for pre-chlorination, and the other designated for post-chlorination.  Four water injectors are provided for solution chlorine feed at various process locations.  Vacuum chlorine feed reduces the likelihood of a release to the environment.\n \nThere is one chlorine leak detector located along the west wall of the Chlorine Feed Room to alert the plant staff quickly in the event of a chlorine leak.  The leak detector monitor in the Chlorine Feed Room is located in a floor trench.  The leak detector is set to alarm at 0.5 ppm. The alarm activates an outside horn and beacon.  The building ventilation system shuts down, a warning light in the control room activates, and the SCADA System pages the operator in responsible charge (IRC) notifying them in which room the leak was detected.  The leak detectors do not turn on the emergency exhaust automatically.  The emergency exhaust must be manually activated.  This was done to protect contractors who may be working near the exhaust point. \n\n'68.155(c) Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nAs a Program 3 Process with one toxic gas, one worst-case release scenario and one alternative release scenario will be addressed for the Chlorination Facility.

This guidance specifically addresses the chemicals commonly found at WWTPs.  The chlorination process for Water Plants is similar to the chlorination process at WWTPs.  Therefore, this guidance document is applicable to the Parsons Avenue Water Plant's chlorination process.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario was determined in accordance with the requirements provided in 40 CFR 68.22 and 40 CFR 68.25(b,c).  For the Parsons Avenue Water Plant facility the worst-case scenario is a total release from one of the one-ton containers of chlorine (greatest amount held in a single vessel) over 10 minutes.  This results in offsite impacts.  The facility is also required to complete at least one alternative release scenario that reaches an endpoint offsite.  The alternative release scenario was evaluated in accordance with the guidelines provided in 40 CFR 68.22 and 40 CFR 68.28. The most likely release scenario was identified based on the results of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  The alternative release scenario for chlorine that results in offsite impacts is a vapor release through a 5/16 inch opening in a leaking flexible tubing line, valve connection, process piping or equipment.\n\n'68.155(d) Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe Parsons Avenue Water Plant facility has a documented Prevention Program for the Chlorination facility that documents release prevention measures.  These prevention measures include elements such as Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractors, Pre-startup Review, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work Permits, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, and Compliance Audits.  \n\nAs mentioned previously, Parsons Avenue Water Plant is equipped with leak detection monitoring to decrease response time in the ev"

Also, Parsons Avenue Water Plant employees who are involved in chlorine operations are trained in specific procedures regarding handling and storage of chlorine at the facility.\n\n'68.155(e) Five-Year Accident History\n\nThe Parsons Avenue Water Plant facility has had no accidental releases of chlorine in the last five years that have resulted in on-site injuries or off-site injuries or other impacts. \n\n'68.155(f) Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Parsons Avenue Water Plant is a non-responding facility, as defined by OSHA and USEPA (29 CFR 1910.120 and 40 CFR part 311).  Therefore the Parsons Avenue Water Plant has developed an Emergency Action Plan to ensure employee safety instead of an Emergency Response Program, as allowed by 40 CFR 68.90(b).  The Parsons Avenue Water Plant facility Emergency Action Plan outlines actions required to respond to a chlorine emergency and has coordinated this plan with City of Columbus Fire Department - Haz Mat Station 4.  The Fire Department personnel are the designated first responders in the event of a chlorine emergency.   Parsons Avenue Water Plant employees are not designated responders to a chlorine release.  As specified in 40 CFR 68.90, Parsons Avenue Water Plant's Emergency Action Plan meets the exception listed in 40 CFR 68.90(b) and therefore, the facility is not required to have the Emergency Response Program of 40 CFR 68.95.\n\n'68.155(g) Safety Improvements\n\nRecommendations for safety improvements were identified in the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) which was completed per OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119(e) in November of 1999.  Recommended improvements were identified in four main categories: Standard Operating Procedures, Administrative, Engineering, and Training.  According to the Process Safety Management Plan, any safety improvements will be investigated concerning their impacts on other systems and/or procedures prior to implementation. Additional re"
