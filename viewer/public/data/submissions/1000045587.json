      "SummaryText": "The City of Jacksonville Beach (City) Water Treatment Plant Number Two (Facility) is a water facility (NAICS Code 22131) for the City of Jacksonville Beach, using one regulated substance, chlorine.\r\n\r\nLike the majority of municipal water treatment plants in the United States, gaseous chlorine is used at the facility as a disinfectant to destroy pathogenic organisms that could enter the water distributed by pipe to customers.  The popularity of chlorine as a water disinfectant is mainly due to its effectiveness, relatively low cost, and ability to produce a measurable residual in the finished water.  \r\n\r\nThe same properties that make chlorine valuable as a disinfectant also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling chlorine as a safeguard to our workers, our community, and the environment.  Chlorine is notably irritating to the eyes, nose, throat and lungs.  More serious human health effects could result from much higher chlorine exposure, such as intense coughing, chest pains, and in extreme cases, death.\r\n\r\nThe City's commitment at the facility is to store, handle and use chlorine in a manner that achieves the needed benefits of disinfection while minimizing both onsite and offsite risks.  This is accomplished by designing a safe process, maintaining the process in optimum working condition, operating safely through documented procedures and extensive training, and providing an emergency response capability to minimize the consequences of a chlorine release, should a process accident ever occur.  \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nIt is the City's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State of Florida and local rules and regulations.  This specifically includes compliance with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rules for chlorine accidental release prevention and emergency response.\r\n\r\nThe primary measures for accidental chlorine release prevention are contained in the document Process Safety"

This process safety management (PSM) document was prepared in conformance with the OSHA and EPA risk management rules, as well as industry-specific guidelines and best management practices relevant to release prevention.  The Public Works Director has the responsibility for ensuring that this program is implemented in the workplace as written.\r\n\r\nThe City water facility's emergency response program relies on the City's Fire Department and HAZMAT Team, located a little over one mile north of WTP #2, adjacent to WTP #1. The emergency response plans at the facility are based on the Incident Command system, where the local HAZMAT Team implements the City and regional response plans. Fire Department personnel receive chlorine emergency response training, and hands-on application of the chlorine cylinder repair kits kept at the Fire Station #1. Since both the Fire Station and the plants are manned 24 hours-per-day, 7 days-per-week, so, also the emergency response team is always available to respond immediately to a release. \r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nChlorine is received by the facility by truck and is stored in one-ton chlorine cylinders fabricated to Department of Transportation (DOT) specifications.  Upon arrival at the site, all chlorine cylinders are thoroughly inspected and if there is any doubt about the integrity of the cylinder, it is promptly refused.  Once accepted, the cylinders are stored inside a covered building equipped with a chlorine detector that immediately notifies the operators of a release should a leak occur.  Standby cylinders will automatically switch over when the in-use cylinder becomes empty, ensuring continuous disinfection.  \r\n\r\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\r\n\r\nThe distance to endpoint calculations were performed using EPA's RMP*Comp model.

The analysis was updated at the 5-year mark using more recent census data.        \r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe City's PSM document contains 13 essential release prevention elements.  Some of the key accidental release prevention elements of the PSM program are as follows:  \r\n\r\n* Process hazard analysis: This analysis was performed for each step in the chlorine process, to identify potential process failure scenarios and the appropriate prevention or response measures.  The process hazard analysis will be updated every 5 years.\r\n\r\n* Operating procedures review: The review was conducted to ensure that operators are given clear, written instructions for safely operating the chlorine process.\r\n\r\n* Training programs: Training is given to each employee assigned to the process with continuing operator training thereafter, with an emphasis on safe chlorine handling and emergency response.  \r\n\r\n* Contractors:   The City ensures through its contract provisions that contractors supplying or working with chlorine are held to a standard of safety performance consistent with the City's safety goals and objectives, and also meets relevant agency requirements.  \r\n\r\n* Mechanical integrity: The integrity and reliability of the process is maintained by implementing preventive maintenance and routine inspection and testing procedures.\r\n\r\n* Management of Change: The management of change procedures provide a systematic approach to evaluate and control the safety and health aspects of any significant change to the process chemicals, technology, equipment and operating procedures.\r\n\r\n* Incident Investigation: The City investigates within 48 hours any accidents or \"near misses\" that could have resulted in a chlorine release, in order to develop measures to prevent a recurrence.\r\n\r\nThe above elements are only part of the City's aggressive safety program.

These OSHA safety programs apply to both City and contractor employees. \r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere have been no accidents involving chlorine at the facility in the past five years.  \r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nPlant operators are provided with annual chlorine safety training that includes hands-on practice of assessing and repairing a chlorine leak.  The emergency response plan covers all aspects of emergency response including escape procedures and routes, procedures for post-evacuation employee accounting, notification procedures, and response procedures for spills or leaks.  If a major chlorine leak were to occur, the emergency plan requires immediate notification of the regional hazardous materials response teams (by calling 911 and State Warning Point) for assistance, including orderly evacuation or sheltering-in-place of the surrounding community.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nThe City is committed to continuously improving the safety of its operations for the benefit of its personnel, the citizens of Jacksonville Beach and the environment.  Future plans may include enclosing the chlorine storage room for additional consequence mitigation."
