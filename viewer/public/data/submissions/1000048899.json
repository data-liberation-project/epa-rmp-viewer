Under EPA guidelines, facilities that handle certain quantities of regulated chemicals must submit plans that show the consequences of hypothetical chemical releases.  Facilities must also outline their measures to reduce the risk of releases and minimize their effects.\r\n\r\nSeveral processes at the site are regulated by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements listed in 29 CFR Part 1910.119.  PSM and RMP complement each other in that PSM is concerned about the employee and RMP is concerned about the public and the environment.  The LANXESS Bushy Park site is in full compliance with the PSM requirements.  \r\n\r\nIII. RMP REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nLANXESS has only the Cyclohexylamine storage area that must meet the requirements for the Risk Management Program listed in 40 CFR Part 68.  Cyclohexylamine is regulated as a toxic substance.  The LANXESS site does not have any flammables that require inclusion in the Risk Management Plan.\r\n\r\nLANXESS uses cyclohexylamine primarily to manufacture an additive used in the rubber industry.  Cyclohexylamine is a colorless liquid with an ammonia-like odor.  Exposure to cyclohexylamine can cause irritation of the respiratory system.  Exposure to extremely high levels can result in a buildup of fluid in the lungs and can be life threatening.\r\n\r\nIV. RELEASE SCENARIOS\r\n\r\nA worst case and alternative case scenario (or more likely scenario) is included in the plan Cyclohexylamine.\r\n\r\nToxic end-point or Level of Concern (LOC)\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Response Planning Guideline 2 - Level of Concern (ERPG2-LOC) is the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals can be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or serious health effects, or symptoms which impair their ability to take protective action.  The release impact distance is the distance down wind to the ERPG2-LOC concentration.  The ER"

      "SummaryText": "PG2-LOC for Cyclohexylamine is 11 parts per  million (ppm). \r\n\r\nThe Extremely Hazardous Substance Level Of Concern (EHS-LOC) is the airborne concentration 10 times safer than the concentration (estimated from toxicity data) that is immediately dangerous to life and health.  The release impact distance is the distance down wind to the EHS-LOC concentration.  The EHS-LOC for cyclohexylamine is 39 parts per million (ppm).\r\n\r\nAll scenarios evaluated used EPA's published model, RMPComp, to provide toxic end-point determinations based on an EPA published level of concern (LOC).  Other models did not provide satisfactory estimates for use in evaluating the maximum end-point distance.  Public and environmental protection requires conservative results.  Both substances were evaluated for the alternate scenario and the information is included in the plan.  \r\n\r\nMore-Likely Scenarios\r\n\r\nThe alternative scenario is a hypothetical release that is more realistic than the worst-case scenario.  In this scenario, safety and emergency systems operate as expected, and plant personnel respond to take action to control and stop the release\r\n\r\nCyclohexylamine scenario assumptions:\r\n\r\n+ Partial failure of a pipe containing cyclohexylamine liquid at ambient temperature.\r\n+ Detection of the leak by personnel who monitor the area, shutdown of the cyclohexylamine supply equipment by remote control, and closure of valves by site personnel to stop the leak.\r\n+ Release during typical weather conditions experienced at the site.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nDuring the past five years, LANXESS has not experienced any release of cyclohexylamine that requires listing in the RMP information we are submitting.  \r\n\r\nVI. EMERGENCY RESPONSE\r\n\r\nIncident and Emergency Guidelines\r\n\r\nLANXESS has multiple safeguards in place to ensure safe handling of cyclohexylamine to prevent releases of these substance.
