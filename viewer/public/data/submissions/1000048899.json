FACILITY INFORMATION\n\n\n\nLANXESS Corporation is a chemicals manufacturing company, with its US Corporate Headquarters located in Pittsburgh, Pa.  LANXESS's Bushy Park Site manufactures  additives for the rubber industry.\n\n\n\nThe Bushy Park Site was established in 1970 and is located on 1650 acres on the Cooper River just a few miles east of Goose Creek, S C.  The site is owned by Cooper River Partners and is home to Lanxess, Kemira Chemicals, Sun Chemical, Symrise Corporation, and Agfa Corporation. The facility has approximately 658 employees, 67 of which are Lanxess employees.  \n\n\n\nDue to the many wildlife programs, the LANXESS Bushy Park Site is certified as a \"Wildlife Habitat Site\" by the Wildlife Habitat Council, a national non-profit organization founded to promote wildlife enhancement.\n\n\n\nII. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION & EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nLANXESS has a commitment to health, the environment, and safety, as follows:\n\n\n\nLANXESS considers its responsibility to protect the environment and the health and safety of its employees, customers and the communities of primary importance in the conduct of its business.

Under EPA guidelines, facilities that handle certain quantities of regulated chemicals must submit plans that show the consequences of hypothetical chemical releases.  Facilities must also outline their measures to reduce the risk of releases and minimize their effects.\n\n\n\nSeveral processes at the site are regulated by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements listed in 29 CFR Part 1910.119.  PSM and RMP complement each other in that PSM is concerned about the employee and RMP is concerned about the public and the environment.  The LANXESS Bushy Park site is in full compliance with the PSM requirements.  \n\n\n\nIII. RMP REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nLANXESS has only the Cyclohexylamine storage area that must meet the requirements for the Risk Management Program listed in 40 CFR Part 68.  Cyclohexylamine is regulated as a toxic substance.  The LANXESS site does not have any flammables that require inclusion in the Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n\nLANXESS uses cyclohexylamine primarily to manufacture an additive used in the rubber industry.  Cyclohexylamine is a colorless liquid with an ammonia-like odor.  Exposure to cyclohexylamine can cause irritation of the respiratory system.  Exposure to extremely high levels can result in a buildup of fluid in the lungs and can be life threatening.\n\n\n\nIV.

      "SummaryText": "PG2-LOC for Cyclohexylamine is 11 parts per  million (ppm). \n\n\n\nThe Extremely Hazardous Substance Level Of Concern (EHS-LOC) is the airborne concentration 10 times safer than the concentration (estimated from toxicity data) that is immediately dangerous to life and health.  The release impact distance is the distance down wind to the EHS-LOC concentration.  The EHS-LOC for cyclohexylamine is 39 parts per million (ppm).\n\n\n\nAll scenarios evaluated used EPA's published model, RMPComp, to provide toxic end-point determinations based on an EPA published level of concern (LOC).  Other models did not provide satisfactory estimates for use in evaluating the maximum end-point distance.  Public and environmental protection requires conservative results.  Both substances were evaluated for the alternate scenario and the information is included in the plan.  \n\n\n\nMore-Likely Scenarios\n\n\n\nThe alternative scenario is a hypothetical release that is more realistic than the worst-case scenario.  In this scenario, safety and emergency systems operate as expected, and plant personnel respond to take action to control and stop the release\n\n\n\nCyclohexylamine scenario assumptions:\n\n\n\n+ Partial failure of a pipe containing cyclohexylamine liquid at ambient temperature.\n\n+ Detection of the leak by personnel who monitor the area, shutdown of the cyclohexylamine supply equipment by remote control, and closure of valves by site personnel to stop the leak.\n\n+ Release during typical weather conditions experienced at the site.\n\n\n\n\n\nV.

If a release occurs:\n\n\n\n+ Equipment that supplies the regulated substance would be shut down quickly by remote control.\n\n+ The plant alarm would be sounded and the emergency communicated to plant personnel over the emergency alert system.\n\n+ Trained on-site emergency response teams would be activated and take prompt action to control and stop the release. \n\n+ Emergency response personnel would evaluate the extent and impact of the release\n\n+ If the release would have potential off-site impact, or outside assistance needed, local and county emergency response personnel would be notified and activated.\n\n+ Neighbors in the immediate area that might be affected would be notified and advised to take appropriate action.\n\n+ If necessary, LANXESS specialists would be activated to perform computer modeling to estimate the area affected by the release. \n\n+ If needed, the site has immediate access to emergency resources and assistance from its corporate headquarters in Pittsburgh, Pa.\n\n\n\nTraining and Preparation\n\n\n\nLANXESS trains employees on the safe handling of cyclohexylamine and how to respond appropriately, should a release occur.  Some examples of our preparation and training include:\n\n\n\n+ Written procedures to handle all types of emergencies.\n\n+ Regularly scheduled safety training for operators and maintenance personnel responsible for the regulated substance system.\n\n+ Trained and experienced on-site emergency response teams ( Fire & Rescue, EMT's, and Hazmat ).\n\n+ Emergency planning with the local fire department and county emergency preparedness personnel.\n\n+ Planning and training with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and participation in annual drills.\n\n+ Routine testing of plant emergency response, alerting, and communications systems.\n\n+ Fully equipped emergency response vehicles (fire truck, ambul"

RELEASE PREVENTION AND CHEMICAL - SPECIFIC PREVENTION \n\n\n\nAssuring Safe Operations\n\n\n\nLANXESS has established programs and activities to ensure safe operation of its cyclohexylamine system.  Some examples include:\n\n\n\n+ Production and maintenance personnel are trained in the safe operation and repair of the system.\n\n+ Written operating and maintenance procedures are in place and updated regularly.\n\n+ Full in-depth hazard and operability studies are conducted by qualified personnel at least every 5 years.\n\n+ Complete safety reviews are conducted prior to making any changes to the operation or equipment.\n\n+ Health, environmental, and safety audits are conducted at least every 3 years to ensure compliance with regulations.\n\n+ Maintenance work is planned ahead of time and work permits issued to assure work is performed safely.\n\n+ Regular inspections of equipment, instruments, and piping are conducted to assure integrity of the system.\n\n+ Scheduled preventive maintenance work is performed to assure equipment is safe, reliable, and efficient.\n\n+ All incidents are investigated and actions are taken to prevent recurrence.\n\n\n\nDesigning for Safety\n\n\n\nLANXESS has installed multiple safeguards and systems to reduce the likelihood of cyclohexylamine incidents, including:\n\n\n\n+ Equipment is designed and built to national standards for each regulated substance service.\n\n+ Piping systems are all welded construction outside of containment areas.\n\n+ The systems are equipped with instrumentation that controls each operation within safe limits.\n\n+ Emergency shutdown systems are installed to immediately isolate each system and minimize upsets.\n\n+ Cyclohexylamine unloading and transfer systems are diked to collect any spills and reduce the rate of a release to the outside air.\n\n+ Operat"
