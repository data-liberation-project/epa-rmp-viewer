THE FACILITY IS EQUIPPED WITH AMMONIA DETECTORS IN CRITICAL AREAS OF THE PLANT THAT IN THE EVENT OF AN AMMONIA LEAK WILL SOUND ALARMS AND AUTOMATICALLY START EXHAUST FANS. THE COMPRESSORROOM IS EQUIPPED WITH AN AMMONIA ABSORBTION TANK THAT IN THE EVENT OF A SAFETY VALVE RELEASE OR FAILURE THE AMMONIA WILL NOT REACH ANY OFF SITE RECEPTORS AND BE CONTAINED WITHIN THE WATER TANK. THE OTTAWA COUNTY EMERGENCY SERVICES DEPARTMENT IS COODINATED WITH THE SAFETY DEPARTMENT AND IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY SITUATION, THEY WILL IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE HOLLAND FIRE AND POLICE DEPARTMENTS, ALERT THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY AS TO THE EXTENT OF THE RELEASE.

We routinely train all of the staff on process safety as well as lockout tagout hazcom and food safety. We have located ammonia detectors in all areas where there is a risk for an ammonia leak, we have engineered in controls and a water absorbtion system in the event of a multiple system failure, will contain any ammonia that would be discharged through the relief valve vent lines. The training that we utilize for the operators of our ammonia refrigeration system consists of hands on, books and computer assisted training. We continuously monitor and audit our PSM system in order to prevent mechanical or operational failures of our system."
