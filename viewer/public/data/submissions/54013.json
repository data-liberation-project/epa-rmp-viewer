In order to meet Carpenter Co.'s goals all management and hourly employees are held responsible for our Safety and Health Program.  To empower our people communicating policies and procedures along with training are two important elements of our program.  Auditing, investigating incidents and taking corrective measures to prevent future mishaps are the tools used to maintain our programs.  Our Chairman of the Board and CEO has set the standard for Carpenter Co. in the corporate safety and health policy which he signed.                                                                                                                                                            THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES                                                      To control accidental releases our company has a PM system in place to check all equipment that could cause a release or other problems.  These PMs are monitored annually by our corporate Engineering Department.  In addition to the monitoring of the PM's, Corporate annually have the Health, Safety and Environmental departments conduct audits.  These audits are in addition to departmental monthly audits.                                                                                                                            Prior to start-up a pre-start check of equipment is conducted by the employees and during a pour the computer system monitors chemical flow and if a flow problem is detected the system shuts down.  In addition to the hardware monitoring the pouring team monitors the process closely and if a problem arises then they can take the appropriate action to prevent a release.  When a railcar or tanker is being unloaded it is being monitored by the Chemical Unloader and Pouring Clerk via TV the computerized pumping system monitors valve openings and the storage "

This team recieves annual eight hour refresher training, first aid training and DOT training.  The team conducts an annual drills with realistic problems.  The drills are critiqued and the necessary adjustment are made to improve the team's skill level.  In addition to the full blown drills, minor drills are conducted in the form of table top drills and dress out drills.                                                                                                    It is the policy of Carpenter Co. - Tupelo Division in the case of a spill to first evacuate the department and secure the perimeter than plan the task and assign duties.  Our HazMat team will only control and stop the release if it is minor.  When the conditions exceed our capabilities we call the Tupelo Fire Department - HazMat Unit and if necessary an approved outside environmental emergency response contractor will be call to clean up.  The HazMat team has people assigned to make the necessary calls to the proper agencies for reporting reasons, emergency response, supplies, financing, etc.,. These jobs would be conduct as directed by the Incident commander.

The main ingredient of foam is TDI, which is regulated and requires us to have a risk management plan (RMP) in place.  This facility can have around 2,000,000 lbs of TDI on site at one time.                                                                                            GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE P"

In addition to the RMP we have developed an Integrated Contingency Plan, which handles fire, chemcial spills, threats against the company or employees, severe weather, personal injury emergencies to comply with:  Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), the Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act (SARA), the Risk Management Program regulations, the Clean Water Act (CWA), the Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) requirements, Spill Prevention Countermeasures and Control (SPCC) regulations, the Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (Hazwoper) standard, the OSHA Emergency Action Plan standard, and the Mississippi Comprehensive Waste Minimization Program (CWMP).
