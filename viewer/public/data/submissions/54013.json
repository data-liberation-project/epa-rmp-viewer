In addition to the RMP we have developed an Integrated Contingency Plan, which handles fire, chemcial spills, threats against the company or employees, severe weather, personal injury emergencies to comply with:  Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), the Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act (SARA), the Risk Management Program regulations, the Clean Water Act (CWA), the Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) requirements, Spill Prevention Countermeasures and Control (SPCC) regulations, the Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (Hazwoper) standard, the OSHA Emergency Action Plan standard, and the Mississippi Comprehensive Waste Minimization Program (CWMP).                                                                                                                                                                           In addition to our emergency response systems there are physical barriers to contain the TDI and maintain the substance on site where it can be neutralized and removed.  If all else fails our employees are trained to handle releases safety and to involve the community agencies to protect the general population.                                                                                                                                                                 Carpenter Co. feels that a proactive approach to prevent a release is better for all;  therefore we maintain a PM system to catch problems before they can happen and look at alternative s"
