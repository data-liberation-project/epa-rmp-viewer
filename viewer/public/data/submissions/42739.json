Avenal provides potable water to their service area, the City of Avenal.\n2.0  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\nAvenal is committed to protecting the health and safety of its employees, the surrounding community, and the environment; therefore, it is Avenal's policy to manage a safe and healthy workplace, protect the environment and maintain compliance with safety, health, and environmental regulations: Federal Risk Management Plan (RMP), 40 CFR 68; OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM), 29 CFR Part 1910.119; and California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program, 29 CCR, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5.  This commitment is demonstrated by the comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility.  It is the policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n2.1  Stationary Sources and Regulated Substances\nAvenal is subject to the Federal Risk Management Plan (RMP) program because chlorine, a regulated substance, is present at the facility in amounts greater than 2,500 pounds.  Avenal is required to treat the water supply so that it meets or exceeds the drinking water quality standards of the California Department of Health Services (DHS).  Avenal uses chlorine to disinfect the water.  Avenal's chlorine disinfectio"

Refresher training is provided regularly as needed.  A recommendation was made during the Process Hazard Analysis to have quarterly training in unloading/loading procedures.  This training would occur when Operation Technicians rotate jobs every three months.\n3.5  Mechanical Integrity\nAvenal Water Treatment Plant carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others: one-ton chlorine cylinders, piping systems, relief and ventilation systems, leak detectors, and controls.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.  Mechanical Integrity checks are conducted during chlorine change-out and one-ton chlorine delivery.\n3.6  Management of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Avenal Water Treatment Plant to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel, and any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n3.7  Pre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Avenal Water Treatment Plant.
