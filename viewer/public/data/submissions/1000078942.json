Madison, Nebraska facility management to implement the requirements of this Risk Management Program (RMP) in accordance with the USEPA regulations under 40 CFR Part 68 and with the corresponding regulations under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material and if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to Tyson employees, the public and the environment.  This objective will be accomplished by utilizing general good operating procedures, providing appropriate training to all employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary, with the local emergency response providers.  This plan covers all Tyson owned activities at this facility.  Tyson's management is committed to providing the resources necessary to implement this policy. \n\n  2. Facility Description\n\nTyson operates a hog slaughter and processing facility at this location.  Hogs are trucked to the facility, slaughtered and fabricated.  Tyson operates rendering systems for grease and lard.  Support operations include small cold storage operations and administrative offices.  Refrigerated Processed Meats (RPM), a subsidiary of Tyson Foods, inc., is located adjacent to the slaughter and process facility.  RPM operates a food processing and smoking operation at this location.\n\nOne chemical is utilized at the facility in sufficient quantities to be subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.  This chemical is ammonia and is used as a refrigerant throughout the facility.\n\n  3.  General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Madison, Nebraska facility is governed by a set of OSHA and USEPA regulations that require planning and facility activities intended to prevent a release of hazardous material, or if a release inadvertently occurs, to "

Tyson has developed and documented these elements in their process safety management plan (PSM).  The PSM plan is incorporated with this document by reference.\n\nEmployee participation in the release prevention program is encouraged and supported by Tyson management.  Key personnel are responsible for conducting and implementing the findings from the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for the ammonia system.  Tyson employees are also members of the facility emergency response team.\n\nTyson policy is to construct all new equipment, systems, and facilities to ensure the appropriate safety and release prevention systems are included from the beginning of each project.  Tyson maintains a computerized program of maintenance activities to ensure that key systems are maintained appropriately to minimize the risk of a release.\n\nTyson is committed to providing appropriate training to all employees regarding safety procedures.  Each new employee is provided comprehensive safety training during their initial orientation for the facility.  In addition, Tyson conducts regularly scheduled safety training for all employees each year.  Additional training is provided to maintenance personnel for the systems they are responsible for.  Members of Tyson's emergency response team receive semiannual training to ensure that response actions are promptly and safely completed.\n\n  4.  Five Year Accident "
