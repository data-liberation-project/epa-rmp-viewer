ENTRANCE TO THE PLANT IS ABATED BY FENCING AND LOCKED GATES. THE PLANT IS IN A REMOTE AREA AWAY FROM THE POPULACE. THE PLANT SETS DOWN HILL FROM TOWN WITH THE TERRAIN CONTINUING TO FALL AWAY FROM TOWN. THE CITY UTILIZES CHLORINE GAS AND SULFUR DIOXIDE GAS IN ITS TREATMENT PROCESS. THE ONE TON CONTAINERS THESE GASES ARE CONTAINED IN ARE ASME CODED VESSELS. DURING THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF THIS PLANT THE ENGINEERS USED GUIDELINES SET FORTH BY THE NATIONAL CHLORINE INSTITUTE. ALL EXTERNAL PIPING IS PROTECTED FROM ACCIDENTAL DAMAGE BY CHANNEL IRON. THE FEED EQUIPMENT IS INSPECTED DAILY. ALL PERSONEL THAT WORK INSIDE THE PLANT HAVE RECEIVED INSTRUCTIONS AND TRAINING IN THE SAFE HANDLING OF CHLORINE AND SULFUR DIOXIDE AS WELL AS THE USE OF SELF CONTAINED BREATHING APPARATUS. EACH EMPLOYEE IS REQUIRED TO ATTEND A CLASS ON HOW TO READ AND INTERPRET A MSDS SHEET WITHIN THEIR FIRST SIX MONTHS OF SERVICE. AS A FIRST RESPONDER EACH HAS BEEN TRAINED IN THE PROPER PROCEDURE TO SHUT DOWN THE CHEMICAL FEED SYSTEMS, OR REPORT TO THE EMERGENGY RESPONSE PERSONEL. THE ATHENS FIRE DEPARTMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR WRITING ALL EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROCEDURES, AND COORDINATES ALL EMERGENCY RESPONSES. A COPY OF THE CITIES EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM HAS BEEN FILED WITH THE HENDERSON COUNTY EMERGENCY RESPONSE COORDINATORS OFFICE. ALL THOUGH APORTION OF TOWN  WOULD BE AFFECTED IF THE WORST CASE SCENSRIO AS DECRIBED BY THE EPA WERE  TO OCCUR, THE PROBABILITY OF SUCH AN OCCURRENCE IS HIGHLY IMPROBABLE. DUE TO THE SAFEGUARDS BUILT INTO THE SYSTEM, THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES  OF CHLORINE AND SULFUR DIOXIDE GAS, THE GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION AND TERRIAN AROUND THE PLANTS LOCATION ANY RELEASE OF ANY AMOUNTS OF GAS CAPABLE OF HAVING ANY OFF SITE CONSEQUENCE IS UNLIKELY. THERE HAS NOT BEEN ANY OFF SITE INCIDENT IN THE HISTORY OF THIS PLANT. THE CLOSEST"
