We react steam and methane (natural gas) to form the hydrogen, which we then purify and liquefy.  The final cryogenic liquid hydrogen product is stored in our insulated storage tank, and is shipped by truck and pipeline to customers throughout the west.  \n\n\n\n\n\nRegulated Substances\n\n\n\nThis facility uses, manufactures, or stores a chemical listed in part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, beyond a threshold quantity, as established by the EPA; \n\n\n\nLiquid and gaseous Hydrogen - Manufactured on-site and shipped to customer by truck and railcar.\n\n.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Policy\n\n\n\nPraxair is dedicated to being the best performing industrial gas company in all aspects of our business, including safety, health, and environmental affairs. Our safety, health, and environmental policy call for a commitment to protecting the health and safety of our employees, neighbors, and the surrounding environment. This policy is the basis for engineering and construction programs that produce equipment and process systems that minimize the possibility of accidental chemical releases and operational safety programs that ensure safe operation of our facilities. Praxair is committed to the continuous improvement of these programs.\n\n\n\nPraxair is an active member of the American Chemistry Council and subscribes to the council's program of Responsible Care&trade; Employee Health and Safety Code of Management Practices.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nIn accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and EPA's Risk Management Program rule, the Ontario, CA Hydrogen Production facility has a comprehensive accident prevention program in place. This program is built around process safety concepts such as:\n\n- Technical documentation of Process Safety Information, describing the physical properties of the hazardous substances, the safety systems in place to control thes"
