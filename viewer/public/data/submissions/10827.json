      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary for Williams Alaska Petroleum, Inc. North Pole Refinery\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\nThe Williams Alaska Petroleum, Inc. North Pole Refinery has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention; such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the refinery processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent releases of regulated substances.  This policy has resulted in no offsite affects for the life of the facility. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.  \n\nDescription of Williams Alaska Petroleum, Inc. North Pole Refinery \nThe refinery is located in North Pole, Alaska.  It has three crude units (Crude Unit 1, Crude Unit 2, Crude Unit 3), an Extraction Unit, a Tank Farm and Utilities.  Crude Unit 1 processes about 50,000 B/D Alaskan Crude, Crude Unit 2 about 70,000 B/D and Crude Unit 3 about 70,000 B/D.  The Extraction Unit processes about 15,000 B/D of naphtha and 10,000 B/D of kerosene.  The primary products  produced are motor gasoline, jet fuel and diesel.  These products are made from the naturally occurring hydrocarbon compounds in crude oil. The refinery does not modify the compounds as most refineries do, it distills and extracts desired compounds from the crude and blends them appropriately to make the desired products. \n\nThe result of the Williams Alaska Petroleum, Inc. North Pole Refinery processing scheme, when compared to a typical refinery, is an easier to operate and safer plant.  It does not have any process units that are specifically designed to modify the hydrocarbon compounds in crude oil  such as cracking units (FCC's, Hydrocrackers, etc.) or reformer units.  It does not have any units that operate at high pressure and/or temperature, which is typically required to modify hyd"

This results in significantly less flammable (light hydrocarbons like propane, butane and pentanes) and toxic materials (like hydrogen sulfide, H2S) being produced and fewer chemicals and catalyst being used. \n\nEven though the North Pole Refinery processing scheme is different than most refineries, each crude unit, the extraction unit and the tank farm does contain regulated flammables such as propane, butane and pentanes above the threshold quantity.\n\nHazard Assessment Results\nThe refinery does not contain any toxic materials above the threshold quantity; therefore, no hazard assessment for toxics was completed.\n\nWorst Case Scenarios associated with the release of flammable substances from each crude unit, extraction unit and the tank farm were analyzed.  The vessel in each unit that could potentially contain the most regulated flammables was assumed to be liquid full, the vessel inventory released instantaneously, completely vaporized and ignited resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.   The possibility of any of these scenarios occurring is extremely remote.  We have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences but no credit for any control measures was taken into account in evaluating these worst case scenarios.  If these unlikely scenarios did ever occur, the only worst case scenario that could affect the general public would be the release of the hydrocarbon in Crude Unit 3 overhead receiver vessel when it was liquid full.  The maximum distance to a 1 psi endpoint for this worst case scenario is about 1200 feet.  This scenario would affect 4 homes East of the refinery along Old Richardson Highway.  These homes are 840 feet to 1050 feet from Crude Unit 3 overhead receiver. \n\nThe Worst Case Scenario for Crude Unit 2 assumes the instantaneous release of all the contents of the overhead receiver when it is liquid full and results in a vapor cloud explosion. This scenario would have an affect on the Petrostar Refine"

      "SummaryText": "ry South of the Williams Alaska Petroleum, Inc. North Pole Refinery.   The 1 psi endpoint is near the North boundary of the Petrostar Refinery. \n\nWorst Case Scenarios for Crude Unit 1, Extraction Unit and the Tank Farm were also analyzed.  None of these scenarios had any impact on any public receptors.    \n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario for flammables at the refinery is a vapor cloud explosion resulting from the rupture of Crude Unit 3 overhead receiver vessel while containing a normal liquid level (one-half full).  This scenario would also affect the four homes East of the refinery along Old Richardson Highway.  With the controls and accident prevention program in place it is highly unlikely that this scenario would ever occur.  \n\nA more practical scenario for the Alternative Release Scenario is the release of hydrocarbon from a section of pipe that does not have flow through it (dead leg), freezes, cracks and then thaws out releasing hydrocarbon through the crack.  If this occurred in a 3\" line, the resulting crack was 1 foot long and the leak continued for 30 minutes the distance to a 1 psi endpoint would be 364 feet.  No public receptors would be affected.  It is unlikely the crack would be one foot long and the leak would continue for 30 minutes.  These are very conservative estimates used to indicate the type of leak that could occur without affecting any public receptors.    \n\nFive Year Accident History\nThe Williams Alaska Petroleum, Inc. North Pole Refinery has an outstanding record of accident prevention.  Over the past five years there has been only one release from an RMP covered process that resulted in a minor injury to a contractor.  The individual did not lose any work as a result of the injury.  There have been no on site deaths, major injuries or significant property damage on any RMP covered process.  \n\nThere was an injury in Utilities, a non-RMP covered process, in 1998.

HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating, maintenance and safety experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked on a computerized system until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, tracked on the computerized system until they are complete and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\nThe Williams Alaska Petroleum, Inc.
