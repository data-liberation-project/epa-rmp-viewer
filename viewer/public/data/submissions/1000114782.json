The Emergency Response Plan\n\nThe facility meets the Emergency Action Plan requirements and addresses them in the site Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP). Actions that are taken by facility personnel and addressed in the ICP include activation of the local emergency notification system and calling 911 from a safe location [29 CFR 1910.38(c)(1)] and directing an evacuation, including exit route assignments [29 CFR 1910.38(c)(2)]. All employees are trained to assist other employees in a safe and orderly evacuation [29 CFR 1910.38(c)(2)]. Should the scope of any incident exceed the capability of our staff, such as a large release, the employee discovering emergency shall follow the protocol provided in the ICP to notify facility personnel, isolate the covered process if safe to do so, evacuate the facility and perform headcount at the designated muster point, and contact emergency responders. We maintain an ICP, which consolidates the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning. Our program provides essential planning and training to effectively protect workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations. As our LEPC and SEPC are one and the same, we have coordinated our program with the local fire department. A representative group from the fire department routinely visits this plant to discuss how to respond to a release of TDI. We have also given local hospitals information regarding medical treatment for exposure to TDI.\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAt this time, we continue to maintain our current safety management systems. We continually\nevaluate training and operational procedures."

Upon exiting the oven, the foam pads are removed from the mold, vacuum or mechanically crushed, trimmed, and prepared for shipment to customers.\n\nToluene Diisocyanate (TDI), which is regulated by EPA's risk management program rule, is one of the reactants required to manufacture polyurethane foam. TDI is received at the plant by railcar and tanker truck and is stored in 2 tanks located in the contained bulk storage tank room. The TDI is then transferred to the process utilizing a computer-controlled system.\n\nAccess to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, management personnel, and\ncontractors. The maximum amount of TDI that can be stored at this facility is 210,000 pounds.\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of chemicals. Our\nmanagement systems for our TDI process address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\nContractor Awareness\nHot Work Permitting\nMonthly Workplace Inspection by members of the JHS&E Team\nSafety Information\nHazard Reviews of our Processes\nOperating Procedures\nTraining\nEquipment Maintenance Programs\nRMP Compliance Audits\nAccident/Incident Investigation\n\nIn addition, we have an established Isocyanate Control Program that outlines both the hazards of handling toluene diisocyanate and the controls that are in place to reduce those hazards. Controls are in place to reduce exposure to employees, the community, and the environment.\n\nThese listed individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases. Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems are setup for the way we conduct business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\n4.
