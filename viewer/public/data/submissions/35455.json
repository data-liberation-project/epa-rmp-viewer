      "SummaryText": "a.  Hutchinson Technology Incorporated's (HTI) accidental release prevention program involves policies and procedures that integrate technology, engineering, written procedures, and management practices to allow safe operation of the chlorine system.  HTI follows all applicable requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection (USEPA) Prevention Program.  These are summarized in Part (d) below.  HTI's emergency response program includes response plans that are coordinated with emergency response activities available in the community.  The emergency response program, summarized in Part (f) below, is in compliance with the USEPA's Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nb. HTI uses a chemical process for etching stainless steel and stainless steel/polyimide/copper clad (also called metal clad) sheets.  These sheets are eventually processed into computer suspension assemblies used in the hard disk drive industry.  HTI's Hutchinson, Minnesota facility uses only one chemical included in the regulations: chlorine.  It is used in the following process:  etchers use chlorine for oxidation purposes to improve the performance of its etchant.\n\nChlorine is supplied to the etching process to maintain the etchant solution (iron chloride) in optimal etching condition. The chlorine is received as a liquid in DOT specified metal tanks which are stored in two specially-engineered totally enclosed holding bunkers (half submerged below ground).  These bunkers can hold a total of eight 1-ton chlorine tanks (four in each bunker), but only one tank in each bunker feeds the system at a time.  The liquid chlorine flows from the tanks to a system that converts the liquid to a gas (vaporizer).  The chlorine gas then flows to the mixing/holding etchant tanks (called sumps) where it enters the solution to chemically maintain the etchant.  Chlorine is fed into the sumps in a controlled manner by sensors that determine the feed rate.  The storage bunkers, vaporizer, and delivery system contain "

An emergency response team is on call 24 hours a day to respond should there be a leak.\n\nc.  The off-site consequences analysis includes consideration of two chemical release scenarios called \"worst case release\" and \"alternative release\".  The worst case scenario is defined by the USEPA as a scenario where the \"owner or operator shall assume that the... maximum quantity is the largest vessel... Is released as a gas over 10 minutes: due to an unspecified accident or failure.  The scenario does not depend on how or why it occurred and does not depend on whether it has ever been observed to have happened anywhere.  The requirements do not allow for any control of chlorine to be assumed except for a control that is passive (not human, electrical, or otherwise actively activated).  The alternative scenario is defined as \"more like to occur than the worst-case scenario,\" but there are no other requirements pertaining to defining the quantity released, except that active controls can be included thereby reducing the likelihood of a release occurring or reducing the quantity that could be potentially released.  Consequently, HTI determined the alternative release scenario for chlorine would be one that could reasonably occur (even if it had not been observed) and would be one where a chlorine release could be controlled.\n\nHTI's worst case scenario for chlorine is the release of a portion of one chlorine tank.  HTI's alternative chlorine release scenario is a valve failure in the storage bunker releasing one pound of chlorine of which 0.75 pound is captured and controlled by the scrubber and 0.25 pound is released to the environment.\n\nd.  The HTI accidental release prevention program is part of a long-established operating management system.  The prevention program contains the following key components:\n--  High level of training for per"

The HTI emergency response program is part of a long-established Emergency Management System.  This program includes an emergency response team, decision process, response procedures, and notification plan.  The emergency response program has been coordinated with the Hutchinson Fire Department who is the key component of the Local Emergency Response Planning Committee (LEPC), known in Minnesota as the Community Awareness and Emergency Response (CAER) Committee.
