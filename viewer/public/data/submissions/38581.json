Facility Accidental Release Policy\nThe owners, management, and employees of (Buttonwillow Warehouse Co.) facility at 14762 Pieri Rd. are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of restricted pesticides. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n2.    Facility Information\nThe primary activity at the (Buttonwillow Warehouse Co.) (Warehouse) facility is the storage, blending, and sale of fertilizers to farmers.\nThe regulated substance(s) anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application. \nAnhydrous ammonia) is received by tanker truck and stored in 1 above ground tank(s) at the site. The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled at (Warehouse) is 131,325 pounds.\n3.    The Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\nThe Worst-Case Release Scenario. Failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would release 131,325 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 5.6 miles.\nAlternative Release Scenario. The alternate release scenario, based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from pipe/hose. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .8 miles.\n4.    Accidental Release Prevention Program\nAnhydrous Ammonia and Ammonium Hydroxide: The facility has implemented the provisions of the \"Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1 \", published by the American National Standards Institute, In"

Five-year Accident History\n        a.    There have been no accidental releases or near misses of anhydrous ammonia and/or restricted pesticides in the past five years that:\nhave caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\nhave resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility's emergency response program was written in accordance with the following regulations: OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38; OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120; and Section 25503, Division 6.95 of the California Health and Safety Code.\n\n\n7.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific planned changes to the anhydrous ammonia process at the facility."
