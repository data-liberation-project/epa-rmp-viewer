The C&D facility consists of administrative offices, warehouse storage, shipping areas and laundry detergent and fabric softener production.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\n\nThe operations affected by the Risk Management Plan (RMP) involve the receipt and storage of aerosol product in consumer  containers. Product is moved within the facility by forklift trucks.\n\nVarious hydrocarbons are used as propellants in the aerosol product. The hydrocarbon propellants are defined by the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) as hazardous materials. The USEPA enforces regulations designed to minimize the potential for an accidental release associated with handling hazardous materials. Additionally, the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) enforces accident prevention regulations to protect employees. The aerosol product propellants are listed as hazardous due to flammability.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe York facility has no history of accidental releases associated with the regulated hazardous materials.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nIn accordance with the USEPA regulation and results of the hazard assessment, the North Brunswick facility is classified as a Program 1 facility. Program 1 facilities are considered by the USEPA to present a minimal risk to the community.\n\nC&D has developed programs to comply with required environmental, health, and safety standards. C&D takes a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals through process management systems and programs that include:\n\u00c2\u00bf\tEmployee Participation\n\u00c2\u00bf\tProcess Safety Information\n\u00c2\u00bf\tProcess Hazard Analysis\n\u00c2\u00bf\tOperating Procedures\n\u00c2\u00bf\tOperator Training\n\u00c2\u00bf\tMechanical Integrity\n\u00c2\u00bf\tManagement of Change\n\u00c2\u00bf\tPre-startup Review\n\u00c2\u00bf\tContractor Safety\n\u00c2\u00bf\tAccident Investigation\n\u00c2\u00bf\tCompliance Audits\n\nIn addition to C&D's management programs, specially desi"

      "SummaryText": "gned systems to control, prevent, detect, and mitigate potential accidental releases are also in place. These include an early suppression, fast response sprinkler system installed throughout the warehouse. Aerosol storage racks are equipped with in-rack sprinkler systems. All of C&D's forklift truck operators are trained and certified. The sprinkler systems are inspected annually by an outside independent company.\n\nEMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE\n\nC&D has an emergency response plan detailing procedures to respond to accidental releases and other emergencies.  In the event of an emergency affecting the local community, C&D will work closely with local, county, and state agencies to help ensure public safety. These agencies take the lead in informing the public on appropriate actions in the event of an emergency.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nC&D strives for continuous improvement of its safety program. C&D trains our employees to safely perform their assigned tasks. C&D encourages its employees to suggest changes or improvements that will help minimize the potential for unanticipated failure of operating equipment including forklift trucks. The systems and programs are routinely auditied, typically by an outside company, to evaluate their effectiveness and identify areas for improvement."
