Local agencies\ndetermine if the public needs to be notified. If it is determined that the public needs to be notified, the local agencies perform the notification task.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nAnheuser-Busch's Merrimack brewery ammonia refrigeration system is periodically modified to\nimprove safety. In Merrimack,  a continuous ammonia monitoring/detection system was installed in the machine room (Powerhouse). Upon detection of a high ammonia concentration, the system will alarm and automatically shut down all boilers, ammonia compressors, and other electrical equipment in addition to activating the exhaust ventilation fans in the machine room. This system is tested on an annual basis to confirm proper function.\n\u00a0\nAdditionally, the brewery has recently conducted a minimum system safety evaluation in accordance with Chapter 8 of the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) 9 - Standard for Minimum System Safety Requirements for Existing Closed Circuit Ammonia Refrigeration System and is actively working to address any opportunities to improve the system through that evaluation.\n\nConclusion\nAnheuser-Busch is pleased to share its record of safe operations with the citizens of Merrimack. We believe the Risk Management Plan under which we are providing this information is an important tool for encouraging communications with our neighbors. Although we are confident the worst case and alternative scenarios presented in this report are highly unlikely, we want you, our neighbors, to know we are prepared to respond quickly and effectively should one ever occur. Anheuser-Busch has worked hard over the years to ensure the highest standard of safety. Our goal is to continue the excellent and safe track record."

There are administrative controls which limit the amount of ammonia in the receiver, so an 80% full level was used.  As the vessel is located outdoors, no mitigating measures apply when modeling using RMP*Comp.  Ammonia could travel 1.7 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a threat to the public.\n\nThis scenario is unlikely to occur at the Merrimack brewery for a number of reasons:\nBrewery piping and vessels that contain ammonia meet or exceed industry manufacturing and\nquality control standards;\nAmmonia is not corrosive in the form in which it is used at the brewery;\nPressure relief safety valves limit operating pressures so the chance of a large-scale release is\nminimal;\nOperating level of the vessel is well below full capacity with routine monitoring and high level safety interlocks; \nManual safety valves allow the immediate shut-off of the ammonia system;\nEquipment is inspected and kept in proper working order and replaced when necessary;\nThe brewery has an emergency response plan and equipment in place (see description below).\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\nWe have also identified an alternative release scenario involving the release of 1750 pounds of anhydrous ammonia due to the opening of a pressure safety relief valve, which itself is a system\nsafety device designed to relieve pressure to avoid a more serious release. This release scenario is based upon historical release data for Anheuser-Busch breweries.
