Security is specifically addressed through a security and vulnerability assessment (SVA)  performed under the the ACC guidelines.  The SVA was verified by the Phoenix Police Department to ensure effectiveness.   \r\n\r\n1.1  \tAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\r\n\r\nThe containers are unloaded from a delivery vehicle for various periods of time, and then are loaded and delivered to the final user.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Rinchem Company Inc. manages the safety of the regulated processes as identified in Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) with engineering controls, aministrative controls and industry best practices.\r\n\r\n1.2  \tThe stationary source and regulated substances handled:\r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of this facility is the storage and the redelivery of a variety of compressed gases and chemicals to the end user. The regulated substances are delivered to this facility in portable, DOT approved, shipping and storage containers. They are stored here until needed by the final user, at which time they are inspected prior to shipment and loaded onto a transport vehicle and delivered to the final user location.  There is no chemical reaction involved, and neither is there any transfer of product from one container to another.  \r\n\r\n1.3  \tThe worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), include administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario:\r\n\r\nRinchem Company, Inc. employs a number of administrative controls to limit the potential and magnitude of releases.  Foremost has been the decision to limit regulated substances to storage only.  Further, Versum Materials segregates ma"

Segregation is accomplished through a combination of distance and/or masonry barriers.  Rinchem Company consciously controls the on-site inventory of gases to limit the potential magnitude of a site release.  \r\n\r\n1.4  \tThe general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\r\n\r\nThe facility developed prevention program elements based on the Federal EPA Accidental Release Prevention Plan.  This facility was designed and constructed to comply with applicable state and industry codes.\r\n\r\nChemical specific prevention steps begin with the decision that all three regulated substances would be on-site for storage only.  Products are segregated by compatible hazards to minimize any potential reactions should an accident occur.\r\n\r\n1.5  \tFive-year accident history:\r\n\r\nThere have been no accidents involving or accidental releases of any of the covered chemicals that resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\r\n\r\n1.6  \tThe emergency response program:\r\n\r\nThe emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authority and Hazardous Materials unit so that appropriate measures can be taken by local emergency responders to control accidental releases.  The facility maintains an Site Emergency Action Plan (SEAP) that contains specific procedures for employees to take in the event of an emergency or accidental release. This information also contains the names and numbers of responding outside agencies.  Emergency actions and response activities have been reviewed with the Fire Department.  \r\n\r\n1.7  \tPlanned changes to improve safety:\r\n\r\nThe facility resolves recommendations from PHAs and incident investigations, some of which may result in modifications to the plant design and operating procedures"
