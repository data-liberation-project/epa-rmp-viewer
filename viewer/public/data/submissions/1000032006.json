Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the Clemens Terminal's Accidental Release Prevention Program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the Accidental Release Prevention Program are documented in the Employee Participation Element of the Clemens Terminal Process Safety Management System. In addition, Clemens Terminal has a number of teams to promote both process safety and personal safety.

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training and consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous chemicals. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain release.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\nClemens Terminal consists of a terminal and storage facility, along with the pipelines that connect this facility to the main plant and its markets. The terminal stores simple olefins, including ethylene and propylene, some C6 products, butadiene, and Natural Gas Liquids (NGL) that are produced by the Sweeny Facility. These products are primarily intermediates which our customers use to produce finished consumer products such as plastics and packaging, biodegradable detergents, synthetic lubricants, and hydraulic fluids, and waxes. In our process, we use the following chemicals the EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\r\n\r\nFlammables: Normal Butane, Ethylene, Propane, Ethane, 2-Butene-trans, 1-Butene, 2Butene-cis, Butene, Isobutane, 2-Butene, Hydrogen, Isopentane, Methane, Pentane, 1,3-Butadiene, Propylene, Isoprene, 1-Pentene.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program Steps\r\nThe following is a summary of the General Accidental Release Prevention Program in place at the Clemens Terminal.

The teams verify the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\n\r\nClemens Terminal also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to confirm the safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nClemens Terminal has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and verify that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nClemens Terminal primarily uses the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. The team employs a Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA) to assist with this task.\r\n\r\nThe PHA Team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.

This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA Team findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTo confirm that process controls and/or process hazards do not deviate significantly from the original design features Clemens Terminal periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nClemens Terminal maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as: (1) Unit startup, (2) Normal operations, (3) Temporary operations, (4) Emergency shutdown, (5) Normal shutdown, and (6) Initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the Management of Change process.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Clemens Terminal maintains a Process Safety Information document that provides guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.

Training for process operators is managed by the plant Training Department and includes rigorous initial hire or job transfer training with classroom and on-the-job elements. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) that they have adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to confirm their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\nClemens Terminal uses contractors as part of its regular work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to verify that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a Process Overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) Emergency Response Plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.

The purpose of the PSSR is to confirm that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make certain construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that Accidental Release Prevention Program requirements are properly implemented.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nClemens Terminal has well established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, control, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) Equipment Identification and categorization, (2) conducting training, (3) developing written procedures, (4) performing inspections, tests and preventive maintenance, (5) correcting identified deficiencies, and (6) applying quality assurance measures.
