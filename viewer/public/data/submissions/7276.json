Chlorine is used  in  the\npotable water treatment process for disinfection.\n\nThe existing chlorination system utilizes gaseous chlorine and is\ncomprised  of  equipment  in  the Administration  Building.   The\nchlorine system consists of four one ton containers; two  digital\nscales;  one  3,000  lb/day  combination  vacuum  regulator   and\nautomatic  changeover  valve;  three  500  lb/day  wall   mounted\nchlorinators and injectors and one distribution panel.\n\nThe  average  chlorine dosage at the facility is  4.86  mg/l  and\nmaximum dosage of 8.82 mg/l.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe  City  of Lima WTP's approach to chemical safety  focuses  on\ntraining  and  safety  awareness.  Plant operators  are  annually\ntrained  on  operational  and safety  practices  associated  with\nchlorine  and  chlorine  feed equipment.   The  training  program\ncurrently utilizes presentations in addition to presentations  by\nlocal chlorine supply professionals.  These programs are used  to\nroutinely refresh operators' understanding and knowledge  on  the\nsafe  handling procedures and accident prevention procedures  for\nchlorine.   The Lima WTP is a secure facility and only authorized\nplant personnel maintain and handle chlorine containers and  feed\nequipment.\n\nBecause of the City's commitment to safety and implementation  of\nsafe  procedures  for  the  chlorine  facilities,  new  policies,\nprocedures  and  instructional programs have  been  developed  in\nconjunction with the development of this Risk Management Plan.  A\nnew, updated Emergency Response Plan has also been prepared.  The\nCity  will continue to coordinate with the Allen County Emergency\nManagement  Agency  in this"

A new  management\nprogram,  training program and Operations and Maintenance  Manual\nhave  also been developed and shall be utilized by the WTP  staff\nto safely manage and operate the chlorine facilities.\n\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe  City  of  Lima receives chlorine in one ton containers.  The\ncontainers are currently stored outside, so no passive mitigation\nwas used.\n\nThe  endpoint  distance  was  determined  using  US  EPA's  Risk\nManagement Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants.\n\nThe  distance  to  the  endpoint is 1.3 miles,  assuming  a  full\ncontainer release in 10 minutes.\n\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe alternative release scenario assumes a feed line leak from  a\none ton container in service.\n\nThe containers in service are located in the Chlorination Room of\nthe  Administration  Building.  A passive mitigation  factor  was\nused for the alternative release scenario.\n\nThe  distance to the endpoint is 0.1 mile with a release duration\nof 60 minutes.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL  RELEASE  PREVENTION  PROGRAM  AND  CHEMICAL  SPECIFIC\nPREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe  Lima  WTP complies with the OSHA Rules and Regulations  with\nrespect  to the Accidental Release Prevention Program.   Chemical\nspecific  prevention steps include compliance with all  Ohio  EPA\nrequirements , Recommended Standards for Water Works,  1997  (Ten\nState Standards) and Chlorine Institute Standards and Regulations\nConcerning Chlorination Equipment and Facilities for Public Water\nSupplies.\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe  City  of Lima WTP has had no accidental releases of chlorine\nin  the  past five years.  There have been no accidental chlorine\nreleases  in  the  known history of the plant which  resulted  in\ninjury to off-site personnel or evacuations.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe  key element of the Emergency Response Program is the written\nEmergency  Response Plan on file at the WTP and at  City  of"
