The station can be reached by automobile from South Canal Road.  Erickson Station houses one steam electric generating unit.  This unit is nominally a 165-megawatt generating unit, 1800-psi throttle pressure, and 1,100,000 lb. of steam per hour.  Cooling water is supplied to the plant from a closed cooling tower circuit.\n\nThe circulating water/cooling water system is the primary cooling system for all plant equipment, including the hydrogen heat exchanger and condenser heat exchanger.  Chlorine gas is used as a biocide for cooling water treatment.  The plant cannot operate without this system.  The primary water source is the Grand River, supplying approximately 1.5 million gallons per day, with Lake Delta serving as an alternate water source.  The water is chemically treated on site and recirculated while maintaining  specific water quality parameters with a continuous discharge of water to the Grand River via Outfall 001.  Water is also lost from the system through evaporation at the cooling tower.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst case scenario was based on a total release of the entire contents of a one ton chlorine cylinder in 10 minutes.  A total release of the entire contents is highly unlikely.  As chlorine is released from the tank, the contents will \"freeze\", forming a temporary plug that blocks release.  The plug will eventually thaw, causing a new release that will again freeze to form a plug.  This freeze-thaw cycle takes time to occur, providing the opportunity for e"

If a release is verified, procedures call for a trained response team from the Delta Township and City of Lansing Fire Departments to respond.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nNo changes are planned.  The program has ensured no chlorine gas releases since installation in 1984.  Reviews of the prevention and response plans are conducted annually or as-needed, and will ensure that we continue to meet our safety goals."
