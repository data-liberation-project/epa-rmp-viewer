It is an example of a partnership for the common good.  The SMMWSC was formed in 1948 to supply unfiltered Lake Huron water it these two cities as high quality raw water for their public drinking water supplies.  Service subsequently has been expanded to add six wholesale customers along the pipelines. The only treatment given the water as it is taken from Lake Huron and pumped at the SMMWSC's Whitestone Pumping Facility is the addition of chlorine.  Chlorine is a regulated substance.  The purpose of the chlorination is for disinfection of the water prior to transmission.\n\nThe SMMWSC has adopted a strong commitment to safety and particularly to the safe handling of chlorine.\n\nAn Emergency Action Plan has been developed which will bring accidental chemical releases under control in the shortest time possible and with the least risk to facility personnel or the community.\n\nCompany policies and procedures have been adopted to assure safety at every step in the chlorination process.  Company-wide safety meetings are conducted quarterly to stress safety.  Operating and maintenance personnel are trained and retrained at regular intervals to ensure that safety procedures are followed.\n\n\n\nTHE FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nThe Whitestone Pumping Facility is remotely located on Michigan's northeastern shoreline of Lake Huron on a large parcel of land.  It is situated eight miles north of the nearest town, AuGres, Michigan (population 872).  The facility operates continuously with a total of 8 full time shift operators, maintenance, and supervisory employees working at the facility.  The maximum inventory of liquid chlorine at the facility is thirteen (13) one-ton "

It has operated continuously for more than 60 years without a serious chemical release incident.  The facility has had no reportable off-site chemical releases in the past five years.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\n  As part of the SMMWSC's Prevention Program, a new Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was conducted in accordance with the policy.  In addition, Operating Procedures (OP), Maintenance Procedures (MP) and the facility's Emergency Action Plan (EAP) were reviewed.\n\nThe RMP guidance manual published by the American Water Works Association Research Foundation was used as a primary reference.  Other informational materials and manuals from USEPA and the Chlorine Institute supplemented it.  Since the process was already regulated be PSM (OSHA), SMMWSC/s management determined that the chlorination process came under Program 3 of the regulation.\n\n\n\nSpecific prevention steps taken are as follows:\n\n\n\nTo minimize worst or alternant case scenarios, automatic air activated shut-off valves are installed at multiple locations in the plant piping that limit the amount of chlorine that could be accidently released by automatically closing if a chlorine leak is detected.  In addition,     each chlorine 1-ton container in use is equipped with an air driven motor that is connected to the tank valve stem and automatically closes the valve if a chlorine leak is detected.  Chlorine leaks are detected by using sensors that are located at multiple locations.\n\n\n\nThe SMMWSC follows and periodically reviews PSM (OSHA) per the stated requirements.\n\n\n\nReview the RMP Operation Procedures (OP) and Emergency Action Plan (EAP) annually with the entire SMMWSC staff at a safety meeting. \n\n\n\nMaintenance procedures and practices are reviewed and documented periodically and changes are made if deemed necessary.\n\n\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe facil"

      "SummaryText": "ity is unable to provide adequate Emergency Response from its very limited staff.  Local responders (voluntary fire department) do not have the training or equipment to safely respond to a chlorine release.  However, arrangements have been made for a CHEMTREC team from Midland, Michigan to respond to that need, when called.  An Emergency Action Plan has been adopted and implemented which provides for facility staff to be \"sheltered in place\" in the main pumping building, which is a separate building from the chlorination process building.  The plan includes the necessary emergency notification and contact numbers.  It provides that local responders will provide public notification.  A warning siren has been installed which will aid in notification of the public in a chemical release emergency.  The facility is equipped with both land line and cell phones to communicate with local responders and law enforcement units.\n\n\n\nThe SMMWSC management is a member of and attends meetings with the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act Arenac County Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Department of Homeland Security Local Planning Team to help coordinate local response for notification and evacuation, should it ever be necessary. \n\n\n\nCHANGES SINCE 2010 TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n SMMWSC has been diligent in continuing maintenance of leak prevention and detection devices.\n\n\n\nPUBLIC COMMUNICATION\n\n\n\n A public meeting was held in October 1999 to communicate the Risk Management Program with the local residents in the vicinity of the plant site.  A large percentage of local residences are seasonal summer cottages.  They consider SMMWSA a good neighbor.\n\n\n\nPROGRAM REVIEWS AND UPDATES\n\n\n\nSince the implementation of the RMProgram in 1999, all of the RMP policies and procedures have been reviewed and/or revised at required intervals.  All have been reviewed as required in the past five years.\n\n\n\nAll requirements have been complied with.  Chlorine as SMMWSC has been and continues to"
