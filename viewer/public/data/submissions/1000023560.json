The \u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bfdegreening\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bf refrigeration system is located in the southeast corner of the building and provides process cooling for the facility\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bfs twenty degreening rooms.  The \u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bfcold storage\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bf refrigeration system in the northwest corner of the building provides process cooling for cold storage rooms and the loading dock area.   Since the cold storage refrigeration system handles more than 10,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, the Maricopa Packing House has developed and implemented a process safety management (PSM) program for the refrigeration system.  \n\nAs part of the PSM program, Sun Pacific completed process hazard analyses, developed written operating procedures, trained employees on the refrigeration systems, conducted a pre-startup safety review, and developed a mechanical integrity program for the ammonia equipment.  In addition to plant personnel monitoring the operation of the refrigeration systems on a daily basis, Sun Pacific has implemented a preventative maintenance program to ensure that the refrigeration equipment is maintained in good operating condition.  Properly maintained equipment reduces the risk of an accidental release.\n\nAdditionally, Sun Pacific emphasizes safe and environmentally sound operating practices and procedures through their employee training programs.  In addition to job specific and process specific training, operators and maintenance personnel receive training in fire prevention, fire control, accident prevention, safety, and first aid.  \n\nWhile it is Sun Pacific\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bfs objective to be a responsible citizen of the community in all of its business activities, the limited staff at the Maricopa Packing House precludes emergency response operations.

At least every three years, Sun Pacific audits these programs and any findings of noncompliance are documented and responded to and the deficiencies are corrected.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \n\nSun Pacific owns and operates the Maricopa Packing House located at 31452 Old River Road (approximately one mile north of Highway 166).  The closest population center to the packing house/cold storage facility is the community of Mettler, which is approximately 10 miles east of the facility.\n\nSun Pacific\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bfs Maricopa Packing House was constructed during 2003 and began handling fruit in November 2003.  Anhydrous ammonia is used as the refrigerant in two separate refrigeration systems that provide process cooling for the degreening rooms and the cold storage facilities.  The \u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bfdegreening\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bf refrigeration system consists of three rotary screw compressors, an evaporative condenser, a high pressure receiver, a medium temperature recirculation accumulator equipped with redundant liquid ammonia pumps, and twenty degreening room evaporators.  The degreening refrigeration system is located in the southeast portion of the building.\n\nThe \u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bfcold storage\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bf refrigeration system consists of a suction accumulator with a liquid transfer system, three rotary screw compressors, two evaporative condensers, a high pressure receiver, eight cold storage rooms, and the associated hallway, staging and shipping areas.  The cold storage refrigeration system is located in the northwest portion of the building with the cold storage operations occupying the west side of the facility.\n\nDuring normal operation, the anhydrous ammonia is distributed throughout the refrigeration systems.

The cold storage refrigeration system contains the largest quantity of ammonia at the Maricopa Packing House.  The maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored in the cold storage refrigeration system high pressure receiver is approximately 15,900 pounds (85% receiver capacity).  \n\nFor purposes of the offsite consequence analyses, the RMP regulations (40 CFR Part 68) define the toxic endpoint for anhydrous ammonia as 0.14 mg/l (200 ppm).  \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nA PSM program, which meets the requirements of the general accidental release prevention program, has been developed for the Maricopa Packing House to address the anhydrous ammonia system.  The PSM program includes the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bf Written process safety information, including information pertaining to the hazards of ammonia, the technology of the process, and the equipment in the process has been compiled.\n\n\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bf An initial Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was performed and will be updated and revalidated at least every five years.\n\n\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bf Written operating procedures have been developed and implemented, and are reviewed at least annually.\n\n\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bf Safe work practices, such as lockout/tagout, confined space entry, opening process equipment or piping, and control over entrance into the facility have been developed and implemented.\n\n\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bf Each employee involved in operating the ammonia system has received initial training and refresher training at least every three years.\n\n\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bf Written mechanical integrity procedures have been established and implemented.\n\n\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bf A Management of Change (MOC) program has been developed and implemented to address all proposed changes to the ammonia system.\n\n\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bf Pre-startup safety reviews are perfor"
