No public facilities (schools, hospitals, etc.) are affected by this release scenario.\nThe Alternative Scenario for Anhydrous Ammonia allows the consideration of the plant\u00c2\u00bfs safety systems as well as operator training and emergency response procedures.  CYANCO\u00c2\u00bfs Alternative Scenario involves the failure of an offload gasket on an ammonia railcar.  Within 60 minutes, operators are able to respond, reduce the pressure in the system and close the valve, stopping the release.  The release of 20,000 pounds of ammonia over a 60-minute period is considered in this scenario.  The resulting vapor plume extends 0.2 miles downwind of the release.  No residence or public facilities lie within the affected area.  \nThe Risk Management Program is just another building block in CYANCO\u00c2\u00bfs safe operations.  As a participant in OSHA\u00c2\u00bfs Process Safety Management (PSM) program, CYANCO already has a solid foundation for safe operations.  The PSM program requires the formal evaluation of specific design and operational hazards before the startup of any new process.  CYANCO has performed extensive Process Hazard Analysis on each area of the facility.  These exercises allowed the scrutiny of every operation performed at the plant.  Areas where hazards were identified have been promptly addressed.  The PSM program requires written operating procedures on each critical or hazardous task.  Operation and maintenance personnel are properly trained on their jobs and the hazards involved with the process.  CYANCO has a program to insure that each piece of equipment is designed and functioning according to its design.  The Mechanical Integrity program includes periodic testing and inspection of vessels, safety devices and instruments to insure the safe operation of each.  \nCYANCO\u00c2\u00bfs facility is designed and operated using state-of-the-art process control equipment.

In the event that the process deviates from design conditions, the entire operation is shutdown within seconds without endangering personnel or releasing hazardous chemicals to the environment.  Process instrumentation and control equipment has been designed to protect both personnel and the public in the event of a process upset.  CYANCO has also made use of Intranet technology to improve the availability and accuracy of plant policies and procedures.  Every computer at the facility has access to the most current documents at the plant through this electronic document control system.  Every effort has been made to insure the continued safe operation of every aspect of CYANCO\u00c2\u00bfs facility.\nCYANCO has an excellent safety record.  No releases of anhydrous ammonia resulting in serious onsite or offsite consequences have occurred in the 20-year history of the plant.  This safe record is a credit to the design of the facility and the training and dedication of plant personnel.\nPersonnel have been trained to recognize and respond to any potential accident at the facility.  CYANCO\u00c2\u00bfs Emergency Response program uses simple step-by-step forms to guide personnel through the appropriate response to such incidents such as a chemical release, natural disaster, fire or explosion. CYANCO has a well trained Emergency Response Team with each member trained at least to medical first responder level and HAZWOPER technician level. In the event of an emergency, personnel are trained to alert the entire staff to the problem using the plant alarm and paging system.  All onsite personnel, including contractors, will be accounted for and given directions for evacuation, if necessary.

This philosophy is more than just a slogan; it is build into every aspect of CYANCO\u00c2\u00bfs operations.  As the first liquid sodium cyanide facility in the U.S., CYANCO has strived to set the standard for safe operation and delivery of product to its customers.  OSHA\u00c2\u00bfs Process Safety Management program has been implemented by CYANCO and adds another level of protection for the operation.  CYANCO\u00c2\u00bfs goal is to provide a quality product to its customers in a safe and efficient manner.\nThe production facility, located in Winnemucca, Nevada produces sodium cyanide, which is used by the regional gold mining industry.  CYANCO is required to submit a report on its Risk Management Program due of the use of anhydrous ammonia at the facility.\nAs part of the EPA\u00c2\u00bfs Risk Management Program, chemical manufacturers are required to develop Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios involving the hazardous chemicals used at the facility.  The Worst Case Scenario is narrowly defined by EPA as the complete release and vaporization of the largest chemical inventory over a period of 10 minutes.  The EPA also requires the scenario to occur in weather conditions that will create a release cloud or plume that extends as far as possible.  Additionally, for the Worst Case Scenario, it is assumed that none of the facility\u00c2\u00bfs automatic of safety controls function and that no action is taken by trained personnel.  \nThe Worst Case Scenario for CYANCO involves a rail car containing 158,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  In the scenario, as defined by the EPA, it is assumed that all 158,000 pounds of ammonia is released over a 10-minute period, is completely vaporized and remains airborne.  Computer modeling shows that the resulting vapor plume extends to a maximum distance of 3.5 miles from its point of release.
