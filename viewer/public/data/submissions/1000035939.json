It is the policy of CFC to adhere to all applicable federal and state safety and environmental regulations.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used on-site.  Ammonia considered hazardous by EPA and is listed on the Extremely Hazardous Substance List (CAS #7664-41-7).\n\n\n\nCFC refrigeration personnel do not respond to ammonia releases, but have received training in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120, in addition to training specifically for ammonia.  An emergency plan has been developed covering notification to public safety agencies and the public.  An evacuation plan for the plant has also been developed and all employees receive training on this plan. In the case of a large release of ammonia, Okanogan County Fire Department #8 would be called.  The fire dept would be responsible for providing Hazmat trained professionals.  CFC's refrigeration department receives on-going training on their responsibilities in response to a release of ammonia.  They will immediately exit the facility, bringing along any personnel they come in contact with, and report to the appropriate evacuation area. They will not re-enter the facility for any reason until the Hazmat team has given the all clear notice.\n\n\n\nThere is approximately 21,611 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in the Okanogan facility. The largest vessel is located in Engine Room C and potentially could release 4,772 pounds of product.   \n\n\n\nCFC uses other hazardous substances on-site, however they do not meet or exceed the threshold limits established in 40 CFR 68.130.  \n\n\n\nCFC complies with:\n\n\n\n* OSHA's and Washington State's process safety management rules.\n\n* Washington State's safety regulations.\n\n* IIAR (International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration) standards for good work practices.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system was installed to standar"

Procedures are kept in the refrigeration office.  These procedures include: \n\n\n\n* Pre-start up procedures\n\n* Routine operations\n\n* Maintenance\n\n* Response to major and minor releases\n\n* emergency action plan\n\n\n\nAt CFC, the ammonia is used in a closed system, so the threat of ammonia mixing with an incompatible material is minimal.  It is important to keep potential incompatible materials away from areas that have the highest potential of a release, such as pressure relief devices.   Ammonia is stable and hazardous polymerization will not occur.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
