If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department or other authorities to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to people and the environment\n\n2 Facility information: Anhydrous ammonia may be stored in 10 nurse tanks of 1,000 gallons each for retail sale to local farmers or for custom application. The maximum amount stored would be 43,350 pounds\n\n3 Worst Case and Alternate Case Scenarios: A) The Worst Case Scenario would be the release of the total contents of the largest storage tank. This would be 4,300 pounds to a distance of 0.4 miles to the endpoint of dispersion of 200 parts per million (ppm) B)The Alternate Case Scenario would be a release from a transfer hose failure. This would be 4,300 pounds to a distance of 0.2 miles to the endpopint of 200 ppm                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   "
