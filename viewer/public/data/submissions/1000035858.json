      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary, Brewster Dairy, Inc. Warehouse System\n\n\n\n    This is to inform all interested persons, including employees that Brewster Dairy, Inc. is complying with OSHA?s Process Safety Management Standard (called Process Safety Management or PSM), Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, and EPA?s Risk Management Program regulations (called RM Program), Title 40 CFR Part 68, also Brewster Dairy, Inc. Corporate Safety Policies, to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and processing of hazardous chemicals. In this way we promote overall plant, worker, and public safety. These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\n    Our safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities. Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.\n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment. These rules are detailed and improved as necessary. They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\n    Brewster Dairy, Inc. has two systems that are separated by state route 93. Our Westside system is used for process. We use this to cool product and dehumidify air.  The engine rooms are about the same.                                  \n\nThe Eastside (Warehouse) is used to finish the process of making cheese, mostly Swiss. We use this system to operate the "

The system uses 17561 lbs of NH3. \n\n\n\n    Failure of a pipe on top of our cooler #1 containing a full 11/4? schedule 80 pipe of NH3 would release worst case 3200 pounds of ammonia in ten minutes. Under worst case weather conditions, the ammonia could travel 1.0 miles before it?s no longer a hazard to the public.   . This scenario is unlikely for the following reasons: worst-case weather conditions are uncommon; the pipe is under our non- destructive testing ; we do our bulletin 109 yearly; ammonia is not corrosive in this service; pressure safety valves limit operating pressure in this vessel; the accident prevention program in place at the facility including the mechanical integrity program for regular maintenance, inspection and testing, and replacement of equipment, if necessary; installed ammonia sensors in the system to warn of leaks; alarms system in place to warn operating personnel of process upsets; and the emergency response plan and equipment in place at the facility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFailure of a transfer hose during unloading resulting in a release of 100 pounds of ammonia over a time period of 10 minutes.

Transfer hose failure was chosen as the alternative release scenario because it is a temporary connection and constructed of materials other than steel. This scenario is unlikely for the following reasons: emergency equipment such as an excess flow valve on the tank truck and valves to isolate the transfer hose; the facility accident prevention program in place at the facility including operating procedures to have personnel present at all times during unloading, and the mechanical integrity program for regular maintenance, inspection and testing, and replacem"

Ammonia falls under the RMP Program 3 prevention program, which is identical to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program.    EPA has said that if the process is in compliance with OSHA PSM, then it is compliance with RMP Program 3.  Thus, the Brewster facility?s ammonia PSM should meet the requirements for the RMP document.  \n\nThere are several aspects of the prevention program that are key: \n\na.)    Since most of the pipe work is out of the way of people and the machinery, there is less of a                    chance of an ammonia release.\n\nb.)    The plant maintains good training, certification and employee awareness of operating procedures.\n\nc.)    The plant has developed a strong preventive maintenance and inspection program.\n\n\n\n                    This facility?s emergency response program is based on the OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120). We have trained employees for emergency response and maintain a written emergency response plan. This plan is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the local fire department. We conduct annual drills for implementation of the emergency response plan at the facility with the participation of the LEPC and the fire department. The facility has communication with the community to warn if there is an emergency.\n\n\n\n8.)  Safety Improvements     \n\na.)  We have installed NH3 detection in our vent lines and raised them 15 feet above working platforms. \n\nb.)  We have 21 people trained in hazmat.\n\nc.)

We had a table top drill with Stark County LEPC and other agencies in the county to improve response.\n\nE.) We have replaced old Ammonia sensors and contr"
