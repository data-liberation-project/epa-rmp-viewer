      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW OF THE 75TH St. WWTP AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\nThe US EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation promulgated on 6/20/96 under the Clean Water Act, required facilities that have a regulated substance above the listed threshold quantities to develop a formal Risk Management Program and to register and submit a Risk Management Plan.  The City of Boulder's 75th St. Wastewater Treatment Plant uses chlorine above the 2,500 pound threshold quantity and sulfur dioxide above the 5,000 pound threshold quantity, thus the City developed and submitted a Risk Management Plan.\n\nThe chlorine room is equipped to store fifteen, one-ton containers.  Six chlorine cylinders are on scales (three per manifold) and hooked up to feed, and the remainder are on the floor on permanent trunnions.  The maximum chlorine inventory is 30,000 pounds.  Each manifold is equipped with a regulator and connected to an automatic switch-over valve.  The storage room is equipped with an evaporator, however, it is not in use.\n\nThe sulfur dioxide room is equipped to feed, two, one-ton containers.  Furthermore, up to seven additional sulfur dioxide containers are stored outdoors.  A fence was installed around the cylinders stored outside to the public can not see the containers.  Both of the sulfur dioxide cylinders in the feed room are on scales and hooked up to feed.  The maximum sulfur dioxide inventory is 18,000 pounds.  The two cylinders on the scales are each equipped with regulators and heat traced trap legs and are connected to an automatic switch-over valve.  The storage room is equipped with an evaporator, however, it is not used.\n\nBelow is a brief summary of the 75th St. WWTP Risk Management Program:\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\nThe 75th St. WWTP Emergency Response Plan and notebook were revised and updated during the second half of 2003.  The general date for completion of this update activity was 12/15/04, however, the plan is"

      "SummaryText": " considered dynamic, and further changes may occur.  All operators at the WWTP are trained in operating the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes, and follow all appropriate safety procedures.  Both management and staff are committed to ensuring safety at the WWTP.  Safety training classes are provided monthly, and the plant ER Team meets and/or trainings on a monthly basis.  Hazard Communication classes were held in late 2003, and classes planned for 2004 include: Slips, Trips, and Falls; Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide Repair Kits; Lock Out/Tag Out; Lightening; Mower Safety; Fall Protection; PPE; Fire Prevention; Confined Space Entry; Workplace Hazards; Personal Safety; and Safety Awareness.  In addition, two Cl2/SO2 ER response drills are planned for 2004.\n\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS:\n\nA site-specific model, The Computer Assisted Protective Action Recommendation System (CAPERS), was used to estsimate the chlorine and sulfur dioxide release distances to toxic endpoint.  This work was accomplished for the intial RMP submittal and, due to the thoroughness of the analyses, no update was considered necessary.  However, the affected population was increased as per the most recent census and Boulder Wastewater Utility Plan data.  \n\nThe atmosphere in and around the mountainous terrain adjacent to Boulder, Colorado is complex and changeable.  Plume path and impact projections must reflect the non-linear flow and dispersion conditions in the region if they are to be useful in emergency planning and emergency response.  As a result of this complexity, the Boulder WWTP used CAPERS and a specialized atmospheric dispersion model for complex systems called Terrain-Responsive Atmospheric Code (TRAC).  This computer program has been used for emergency plume predictions for more then 9 years at the Department of Energy's Rocky Flats Environmental technology Site.\n\nTo address this complexity, historical meteorological records for multiple stations in and around Boulde"

Six atmospheric flow/dispersion regines were identified as dominant patterns for the area (corresponding initial wind speed used in the CAPERS model for each of these meteorological scenarios are shown in parentheses):\n\n    Stable nighttime downslope flow (3.0 m/s)\n    Unstable daytime upslope flow (2.0 m/s)  \n    Stable, near-calm/variable flow (0.0 m/s) \n    High wind (Chinook) flow (18.0 m/s)\n    Morning transition from downslope to upslope flow (1.0 m/s)\n    Evening transition from upslope to downslope flow (1.0 m/s)\n\nThe six flow regimes cover the spectrum of poor to good flow and dispersion conditions expected to occur in the Boulder area.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nThe 75th Street WWTP had no reportable accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide in the past five years.\n\nFUTURE PLANS RELATED TO THE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM:\n\nA design/construction project to improve wastewater treatment quality (additional nitrification and partial denitrification) is currently underway.  In addition to effluent water quality improvements, Boulder will design and construct one of two different alternatives for disinfection/dechlorination.  One design option would do away with the use of chlorine and sulfur dioxide and replace it with ultra-violet disinfection.   The second alternative would replace gaseous chlorine and sulfur dioxide with a bleach or liquid feed system utilizing sodium hypochlorite and sodium bisulfite.  The chemicals used in this second alternative would not pose an offsite risk to neighbors as the liquid chemical can be contained within the building in case of a spill.  The ultra-violet disinfection alternative has been recommended by the Utility staff and our design consultant, Brown and Caldwell.  The plan is to construct one of these two alternatives to gaseous chemical feed by early 2008.  When the new system is on line, the City will will complete the necessary steps to decertify the current RMP required as a result of our curr"
