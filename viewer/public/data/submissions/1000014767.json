      "SummaryText": "Fresh Frozen Foods, LLC is committed to the safety of its employees, the community, and the environment.  Several programs, such as written standard operating procedures,  monthly safety training meetings, emergency response procedures, spill prevention and countermeasure plans, reporting procedures to the coporate office, local community, state, and federal agencies in the event of a release and an OSHA PSM are in place in order to help Fresh Frozen Foods achieve its commitment.  The Fresh Frozen Foods Processing and Distribution Center in Thomasville, Georgia processes,freezes and stores various food items.  Ammonia is utilized as a refrigerant in its freezing and cold storage operations in a quantity which exceeds the threshold of 10,000 pounds.  The local fire department has been notified as to the presence of ammonia at this site.  They have been invited to join our personnel for one of our emergency training refresher sessions.  Electronic alarms have been installed to warn or notify Fresh Frozen Foods personnel in the event of an ammonia release.  The electronic alarm is connected by modem to maintenance and management personnel's home phones and mobile phone. The source of the malfunction can be electronically located and procedures are provided in order to isolate the problem, perform emergency response measures, if necessary, and make repairs.  The refrigeration system is inspected five times per week.  There have been no releases of ammonia from this facility which have resulted in death, injury, or environmental impacts since Fresh Frozen Foods commenced operation February 1, 2009.  The RMP and PSM will be reviewed annually with employees in order to refresh them as to the operating procedures and safety precautions which must be followed when working on or in the vicinity of an ammonia refrigeration system."
