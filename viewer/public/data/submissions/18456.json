      "SummaryText": "Cameron Parish Sewer District No. 1 is supported both by tax and customer revenues.  The location of the (3) Cell Oxidation Pond was chosen because to isolation from the town of Cameron.  Due to recent years construction on Davis Road, we have several facilities to the Northeast of the pond.  We have (2) 1 ton Chlorine cylinders.  The cylinders are inspected daily (Twice) and we have manual shut off valves.  The only problems to arise that could cause a leak would be in delivery process, which is safeguarded by vendor personnel and our (2) employees.  The chlorine lines or valve could malfunction, but due to daily inspections unless something hit the lines, our facility is fenced and only company personnel have keys.  Even our vendors and service company personnel are not allowed on the property with sewer personnel there.  A sign is posted (Keep Out) The gate is chained & locked.\n\nCOMPANY VEHICLE'S HAVE DATA MATERIAL SHEETS IN THE TRUCK AT ALL TIMES. WE HAVE COMPLIED WITH LA. STATE STANDARD CODE. DUE TO THE FACT THE CHLORINE GAS IS BOTH CORROSIVE AND POISONOUS, WE SCHEDULE REFRESHER COURSES ON CONNECTING AND DISCONNECTING AND CHLORINE HANDLING AND STORAGE.  WAYS USE G MASK AND WE REQUIRE (2) EMPLOYEES AT ALL TIMES WHEN CHLORINE IS BEING HANDLED. THEY MUST MAINTAIN VOICE CONTACT WITH THE OFFICE AT ALL TIMES WHICH REQUIRES TO NOTIFY THE OFFICE PRIOR TO BEGINNING PROCEDURE AND UPON COMPLETION. HAVE ONSIGHT CLASSES GIVEN BY C & L UTILITIES. EACH COMPANY IN  THE AREA WHERE A POSSIBLE LEAK COULD OCCUR HAS BEEN PROVIDED WITH PROCEDURE, DATA SHEETS, AND CORRECT PHONE NUMBERS TO CALL DURING AND AFTER WORKING HOURS AND THE PROCEDURE THAT THEIR COMPANY SHOULD TAKE UNTIL THE ARRIVAL OF OUR PERSONNEL.
