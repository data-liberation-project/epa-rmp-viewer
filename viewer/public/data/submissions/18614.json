This means that the worst-case and alternative-case analyses also need to be addressed for these substances. \n\nThe worst-case scenario for flammable substances is focused on a release consisting of the entire contents of all five pressurized storage tanks located in the same area, and the contents from the large storage tank located on the other side of the facility (a total of six tanks).  The alternative-case scenario, however, focuses on a release that would consist of the contents from one of the five storage tanks and the large storage tank located on the other side of the facility.\n\nFlammable Substance\nWorst Case:\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for a flammable substance consists of an instantaneous release of NGL from six storage tanks and a vapor cloud explosion.  This scenario is based on the assumption that the entire quantity of the flammable substance will form a vapor cloud and no liquids will be released due to inadequate pressure.  Therefore, the use of passive mitigation systems, such as storage tank containment dikes, will not be applicable due to the nature of the substance released.

The practices employed at this facility which are most important to the PSM accident prevention program are described in more detail below.  This accident prevention program is also applied to all RMP covered processes at the McKamie Gas Plant.  \n\nEmployee Participation\nActive employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the McKamie Gas Plant's PSM program will be an important step toward achieving the objective of preventing or minimizing the effects of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals.  Employee involvement will ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas will be implemented.  Open communication will be encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues.\n\nThe McKamie Gas Plant will strive to promote employee involvement in developing and implementing safety and accident prevention standards.  Safety meetings, special training programs for emergency response and first aid, and hazard communication training will be scheduled on a regular basis to ensure that employees are properly trained in health and safety issues and have the opportunity to voice their concerns regarding such issues.

Passive mitigation measures, such as the use of storage tank containment dikes, will contain the liquids, if present.  However, in this case, it is assumed that the NGL will vaporize due to the absence of adequate pressure and the vapors will ignite in a vapor cloud fire.

FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nWhen operational, the McKamie Gas Plant processes gas from the following production fields:\n\n7 Low-pressure sour gas and liquids from the McKamie-Patton Unit; and,\n\n7 High-pressure sweet gas and liquids from the Dorcheat-Macedonia Field.\n\nLow-pressure sour gas from the McKamie-Patton Unit enters an inlet separator where gas and condensate are separated.  High-pressure sweet gas from the Dorcheat-Macedonia Field enters the high-pressure inlet separator where the gas and condensate are separated.  Condensate from both separators is directed to the condensate stabilization unit where light ends are volatilized.  Condensate from the stabilization unit is blended with liquids from the de-propanizer.  This blend is sent to the de-butanizer where butane is removed and sent to pressurized storage.  The remaining liquids (natural gasoline, pentanes and heavier) are also sent to pressurized storage.\n\nLow-pressure sour gas from the low-pressure inlet separator and the volatilized light ends from the condensate stabilization unit are compressed and combined with the high-pressure sweet gas stream.  This combined stream is sent to the amine contactor where Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S) and Carbon Dioxide (CO2) are removed by the lean amine solution in the contactor.  Heat from the sulfur recovery unit (SRU) waste stream is used to regenerate the rich amine solution.  Acid gas produced during th"

The remaining liquid, consisting of pentanes and heavier components, is also sent to pressurized storage.  Propane, butane and natural gasoline are periodically loaded into trucks and sold.  A direct-fired heater provides the process heat for the de-ethanizer, de-propanizer and de-butanizer.\n\nLongview plans to reactivate an existing nitrogen rejection unit (NRU) for the removal of nitrogen in the sales gas stream.  The NRU will add one additional process vent. \n\nThe current air permit calls for the emergency flare to be disconnected, but not dismantled. However, the facility can not be operated safely without the availability of a flare.  Consequently, Longview has submitted a permit modification application to allow for the emergency use of the flare.  The flare will only be used to safely vent the gas that would be blown down in an emergency, unless otherwise authorized by the appropriate regulatory agencies.  The flare will not be used to burn acid gas in the event that the SRU is not operating, unless otherwise authorized.  \n\nNatural gas liquids (NGL) (propane, butane, pentane, ethane, natural gasoline, and condensate) and Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S) are the regulated substances that are processed and stored at the facility in amounts above the threshold limit.  \n\n3.

Liquid molten sulfur is loaded into trucks and transported from the Plant.  H2S not converted into elemental sulfur is converted to SO2 in the SRU incinerator.\n\nThe sweetened natural gas flows from the amine contactor to the Triethylene Glycol (TEG) contactor for dehydration.  Natural gas encounters a counter-flowing stream of lean TEG in the contactor where water vapor is absorbed from the gas stream.  The dehydrated natural gas exits the contactor and the rich TEG (water laden) is sent to the TEG reboiler for regeneration.  A natural gas fired reboiler heats the rich TEG to approximately 375: F.  This heating produces a gas stream consisting mostly of water and TEG vapor, with entrained Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs).  This gas stream is sent to a reflux condenser where the gas is cooled, allowing the TEG to condense.  The lean TEG is then routed back to the contactor.  The cooled gas stream, now consisting mostly of water vapor and entrained VOCs, exits the reflux condenser vent and is further cooled in a secondary condenser where water and condensable VOCs (mostly benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene - (BTEX)) are removed and sent to storage.

The facility was constructed in the early 1940s by the predecessors of Arco and Exxon, and was designed to process sweet and sour natural gas.  Phillips Petroleum acquired the Plant in 1969.  In December 1998, MKP Production Company, L.L.C. (MKP), who owned and operated the facility at that time, and affiliated entities filed voluntary Chapter 11 petitions under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  Energy Income Fund, L.P. (EIF), the primary secured creditor of the McKamie Gas Plant assets, filed a Plan of Liquidation with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court  to protect EIF's security interest in those assets. Under the plan of liquidation approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Longview Gas Company, an EIF affiliate will become the owner of the facility.\n\nThe Plant has been temporarily shut down since April 1999.  It is anticipated that the Plant will be re-activated in February 2000.\n\nWhen in operation, the Plant produces butane liquids, propane liquids, and natural gasoline from gas feed.  The Plant will consist of two residual compressor engines, a steam boiler, a sulfur recovery unit, an emergency flare, two refrigerant compressor engines, two overhead compressor engines, a glycol reconcentrator, a regeneration gas heater, a heat medium heater, and a nitrogen rejection unit.\n\nThe Plant is capable of processing up to 15 million standard cubic feet per day (mmscf/d) of natural gas when operational; however, it had only been processing 9 to 10 mmscf/d of natural gas before it was shut down.  \n\nThe following is a summary of the facility's risk management program, which has been developed in preparation for the re-activation of the facility.\n\n\n1.

The orientation session will also include a review of process operations, safety and health hazards, emergency response plan requirements, and safe work practices.\n\nPre-startup Safety Review\nThe McKamie Gas Plant will conduct a pre-startup safety review (PSSR) of any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.

This incident occurred in December 1997 and was caused by the failure of a seal in the poly pipeline, which caused a gas leak. The responder was immediately notified when the incident happened. There were no on-site or off-site deaths or injuries caused by the incident. The faulty seal was replaced immediately after the incident was discovered. \n\n\n6.
