This document has been prepared to satisfy multiple regulations and is governed by the following agencies:\n\n\n\n?    Federal EPA's, Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40, Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs Under Clean Air Act Section 112(r), Program 3 requirements (RMP).\n\n\n\n?    OSHA's Code of Federal Regulations, Title 29, Section 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals (PSM).\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this document is to:\n\n\n\n?    Increase the protection of public health, the environment, and facility employees by ensuring proper emergency response and mitigation procedures when handling regulated substances.\n\n\n\n?    Assist Bongards Premium Cheese and local government agencies in their communication and coordination efforts to improve facility safety while handling regulated substances.\n\n\n\nThis document addresses Bongards Premium Cheese administrative and operational programs to prevent accidents related to regulated substances and to reduce potential risks. The regulated substance of concern and focus of this document is anhydrous ammonia. The facility utilizes an ammonia system to provide refrigeration for the processing and storage of dairy products.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nBongards Premium Cheese is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is reflected in a comprehensive accidental release prevention program. This program addresses the design, installation, operation, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process equipment at the facility.\n\n\n\nBongards Premium Cheese senior management is not only committed to offering superior service, but al"

Bongards Premium Cheese safety and environmental policies as they relate to the ammonia refrigeration system are administered by the EHS Manager, Plant Manager, and Refrigeration Operator who conduct inspections of the facility to ensure compliance.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Bongards Premium Cheese facility is located at 3001 Highway 45 West Bypass in Humboldt, Tennessee, which is approximately 0.1 miles north of Highway 45 and 0.2 miles west of Highway 187.\n\n\n\nThe primary business of Bongards Premium Cheese is to provide refrigeration for the processing and storage of dairy products. In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains 2 refrigeration system containing approximately (New) 15,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia and (Old) 12,100 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance. The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for processing and storage of dairy products. Typical operating conditions range from 15 psig on the low pressure side of the system to 150-170 psig on the high side.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Bongards Premium Cheese ammonia refrigeration systems has many safety features. Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system. For example, the facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation. The facility conducts preventative maintenance and any necessary minor repairs and major repairs in house, but an outside contractor is hired for major repairs or maintenance as needed.\n\n\n\nThe facility, in"

These safety features include ammonia sensors in the Engine Room. In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine rooms and just outside of the engine room. All pressure vessels are for the new system are located in the new engine room. The pressure vessels for the old system is located in the old engine room and just outside the old engine room\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nBongards Premium Cheese has an emergency action plan in effect. The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document. This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.)  To save lives.\n\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries. \n\n3.)  To protect the environment.\n\n4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nBongards Premium Cheese maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility. This Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations.\n\n\n\nIn case of an ammonia emergency, the facility plans to evacuate all employees and contractors and activate the facility's action plan to respond to the situation.
