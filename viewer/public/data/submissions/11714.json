      "SummaryText": "\nSchwan's has historically placed a high priority on chemical \nsafety. The corporate environmental compliance manager has been \nassigned overall responsibility for chemical safety in general and \nfor ammonia refrigeration safety in particular since 1991. \nSchwan's maintains 3 - shift coverage at all facilities with \nammonia refrigeration systems covered by this rule. One designated \nperson is on call on weekends.\n\nThe Fargo, ND facility manufactures frozen dough. Anhydrous \nammonia is used in the refrigeration system at this facility. \nAmmonia is the most efficient and environmentally compatible \nrefrigerant available. Although it is toxic at high concentration \nand is an irritating gas, it is not a cumulative metabolic poison, \ndoes not cause cancer or other dread diseases and does not cause \nlasting environmental damage. The refrigeration system at this \nfacility contains about 13,100 pounds of ammonia.\n\nSchwan's calculates ammonia worst case release scenarios using the \nModel RMP for Ammonia Refrigeration, May 1996. All Schwan's \nmanufacturing facilities are located in areas that meet the \ndefinition of \"urban\". Schwan's has chosen to calculate worst case \nrelease poundage for the largest high-pressure receiver in the \nsystem, filled to full calculated hydraulic capacity. Reduced \nvolume for administrative controls was not used, since the \ndescribed scenario would probably occur only as a result of a \ncatastrophic vessel rupture caused by a total filling of the \nvessel, closure of all vessel block valves, failure of all \npressure relief valves, with a simultaneous increase in liquid \ntemperature sufficient to overpressure the vessel to the point of \nfailure.\n\nIt is the professional judgement of Schwans Environmental Health \nand Safety Department that a release rate of 400 lb./min. should \nbe used as an alternate case scenario in lieu of the 100 lb./min. \nrate suggested in the Model RMP.\n\nThe \"urban\" site condition will be used.\n\nBased on the above, the worst-cas"

      "SummaryText": "e ammonia release scenario for \nthe Fargo, ND facility will be 6,700 pounds released over a 10-\nminute period. The alternate case will be a release rate of 400 \npounds per minute.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is covered by the OSHA Process \nSafety Management (PSM) rule, 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\nThe Fargo, ND facility is currently organizing and training a 3-\nshift emergency response team, trained at the 24-hour technician \nlevel. The training will be conducted by the Corporate \nEnvironmental Compliance Manager. The training will be designed \nwith a heavy emphasis on ammonia safety, mechanical isolation, \npersonal protective equipment up to use of Level `A' suits and \ninteraction with an incident command system (ICS). Copies of \nemergency plans will be filed with the Fire Department and annual \nfacility walkthroughs will be conducted with Fire Officers. \nPreplanned command posts and staging areas will be designated and \nIncident Command transfer and liaison functions will be \nestablished. A post-incident debriefing will be conducted after \neach incident.\n\nSince a continuous improvement philosophy is deeply imbedded in \nthe Schwan's corporate culture, improvements in system safety are \nimplemented as a result of employee-based teams, a designated PSM \nteam and as a result of system engineering modifications and \nextensions. Post incident debriefings and incident investigations \nare used to identify additional improvements to system safety.\n"
