This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in safety throughout facility design, construction, operation and maintenance. MCS has developed detailed programs and procedures to effectively implement this commitment. The programs and procedures systematically integrate safety, health, environmental protection and quality assurance into all levels of management and work practices. \r\n\r\n2.0          Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nMCS operates a Depleted Uranium Hexafluoride (DUF6) Conversion Facility for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) at Kevil, Kentucky to disposition DUF6 into a safer, more manageable product. The facility employs a dry conversion process that converts DUF6 to uranium oxide powder that is collected and packaged for reuse or disposal. The process also utilizes steam and hydrogen as reaction gases, which produce hydrofluoric acid (HF) as a saleable end product.  \r\n\r\nThe maximum HF acid concentration produced is approximately 55 wt% HF acid solution, per the MCS Safety Data Sheet (SDS).  However, the typical concentration is less than 50%.  A total maximum quantity of 460,000 pounds of HF acid is temporarily stored on-site in several tanks before transfer to tanker trucks or rail cars for offsite shipment. This amount exceeds the threshold quantity specified in 40 CFR 68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions.  Further evaluation indicates that the Conversion Facility is subject to Program 1 requirements of 40 CFR 68. HF acid is the only chemical associated with the DUF6 Conversion Facility that exceeds the threshold quantities specified in 40 CFR 68.\r\n\r\n3.0          General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Preven"

MCS has implemented the required controls through an extensive set of programs and procedures. These programs and procedures also apply to the management of structures, systems, components and programs that pertain to Risk Management Plan (RMP) covered process and related activities.\r\n\r\nAs part of the DSAs, process safety analyses have been conducted to identify potential hazards in the process and associated controls to prevent and mitigate releases. These controls include passive barriers, active features, and operator actions.\r\n\r\nThe primary controls associated with the storage of HF acid are the HF storage tanks. These tanks are designed to contain the HF acid under conditions such as credible natural phenomena events. A dike around each tank provides secondary containment for potential tank leaks. HF vapor detectors and tank level sensors provide indications should a leak occur, and automatically actuate valves to isolate the HF storage tanks. Operators are required to monitor transfers from the HF storage tanks to the rail cars or tanker trucks and manually stop the transfer should a leak occur. Installed pumps and piping can be used to pump any leaked material back into the HF storage tanks for sampling and reprocessing.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the aforementioned controls, MCS also has programs to ensure safe and effective operations. These programs include but are not limited to the following: Radioactive and Hazardous Waste Management; Industrial Safety, Initial Testing, In-Service Surveillance and Maintenance; Fire Protection; Procedures and Training; Emergency Management; Configuration Management; Conduct of Operations; Unreviewed Safety Question; and Quality Assurance.\r\n\r\nOperating and maintenance procedures have been established and operators h"

The D&R Contractor is the lead organization responsible for managing the overall direction and control of emergency responses at the Paducah site.

Upon notification of an event, the field Emergency Response Organization (ERO) is activated for response to the scene and mitigation of the incident.  Emergencies are classified through a site-wide standardized system that uses Emergency Action Levels (EALs) as criteria for equating an incident to a specific emergency classification level. Using the specific criteria outlined in the EALs, the D&R Contractor Plant Shift Superintendent (PSS) determines the level of response and protective actions required and determines if the event meets the proper criteria to classify the event as an Alert or a Site Area Emergency (SAE). Upon determination of event classification, the Incident Commander (IC) makes notifications to off-site agencies and activates the EOC Cadre. \r\n\r\nEmergency response facilities have been pre-designated and equipped for use in an emergency. The Central Control Facility is continuously staffed, performing \"routine\" response-related activities, such as handling requests for ambulances or dispatching protective force personnel. Dedicated facilities, such as the EOC, are immediately available to support emergency operations upon arrival of staff. \r\n\r\nPrompt notification of on-site personnel, emergency responders, and off-site organizations and agencies is critical during an emergency event. The D&R Contractor PSS is responsible for notifying the ERO using the plant radio system, pagers, Public Address (PA) system and/or the plant telephone system.\r\n\r\nThe severity of some emergencies on-site may warrant the use of off-site response personnel, organizations, and agencies. As a result, agreements with off-site support agencies have been developed and are maintained by the D&R Contractor.
