Dukes Jr. Water Treatment Plant in Charlotte, North Carolina.  This program continues The City of Charlotte's commitment to the protection of its employees and the surrounding community and the control of the potential for such a release.  There have not been any accidental releases at the facility in the past five years. \n\nThe Lee S. Dukes Jr.  WTP currently uses chlorine (delivered in one ton cylinders) as a disinfection agent to meet Safe Drinking Water Act requirements.  As a portion of the RMP/PSM program, the City of Charlotte has developed the following accidental release prevention and emergency response policies for the use of chlorine as a disinfectant:\n\n1) Protection of public health and our employees is the City of Charlotte's highest priority.\n\n2) Preventing the release of extremely hazardous substances is a key element of that protection.\n\n3) Every appropriate step will be taken to prevent releases, including management commitment to:\n\n    a) Make all important information readily available.\n\n    B) Routinely administer training to employees\n\n    c) Clearly define roles and responsibilities.\n\n4 Fulfilling his or her role in prevention of these releases is a condition of employment for every employee.\n\nIn order to reduce the likelihood of a potential release, the City of Charlott has incorporated the following general accidental release prevention program and chlorine-specific prevention steps:\n\n1) The City of Charlotte's plant maintenance staff shall conduct routine preventative maintenance of key process components.\n\n2) The City of Charlotte's employees shall conduct all work according to any applicable Lockout/Tagout procedures.\n\n3) The City of Charlotte's employees shall conduct all work according to any applicable Hot Work Permits.\n\n4) The City of Charlotte mainta"

The Pre-Qualification process identifies contractors that can perform site activities without compromising the safety or health of the City of Charlotte's personnel.\n\n6) Frequent employee training on the operation and maintenance of all the chlorine facilities.\n\n7) Detailed Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for all chlorine operations and maintenance have been developed and shall be adhered to.\n\n8) Pipelines that contain chlorine or chlorine solution shall bear a yellow \"Chlorine\" label as well as green tape with white arrows to indicate direction of flow.\n\n9) All work on chlorine-labeled or chlorine-containing equipment must follow the SOPs and will proceed only after notification of the Maintenance Supervisor, Plant Supervisor, and the inside operator.\n\n10) Only those persons trained in chlorine safety shall be present during any work that could produce a release.\n\nThe City of Charlotte's emergency response program uses an external emergency response team and focuses on keeping employees away from dangerous areas, while the mechanical equipment and contract emergency services control the chemical release. When an employee observes a release he/she shall secure the area, if possible, immediately notify the inside plant operator, make sure the inside operator notifies one of the emergency coordinators, and leave the area.\n\n11)  Lee S. Dukes had no accidents during the last 5 years.\n\n12)  Additional Chlorine Storage (2 tanks) was added since the date of the last RMP. We have no planned changes to improve safety, but our program is under constant review for ways to improve safety and any changes that come out of said reviews will be reflected in MOC documentation and RMP update as required."
