      "SummaryText": "Regulated Substance and Stationary Source\n\nThe Milner Milling Company facility in Barnesville, GA is in the business of milling grains into various flours to be used in baking food products.  Wheat, by its nature, can carry a variety of bacteria and spores on its surface.  This flora can produce undesirable or harmful qualities in finished products.  Controlled introduction of chlorine gas into the flour during milling reduces the flora to acceptable levels.  Further, chlorine produces reactions in the raw flour which can be advantageous in the baking process.\n\nPressurized chlorine is stored as liquid in one ton cylinders at the mill. Chlorine is introduced into the milling system via multiple tank connections to a common manifold sized to the demand rate required by the particular mill.  Chlorine is drawn through a Gas Pressure Reducing Valve and a Vacuum Regulator ? Pressure Check unit, and enters the chlorinators under vacuum rather than under pressure.  This greatly reduces the probability of a leak of chlorine from the chlorine delivery piping.  \n\nThe maximum intended inventory of chlorine at this site is 16,000 pounds, which exceeds the EPA?s threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds.  Milner Milling is therefore subject to RMP requirements under CAA 112 (r).\n\n\nPrevention of Chlorine Release\n\nThe process is designed and maintained in compliance with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices as shown in the Process Safety information that is incorporated within the Process Safety Management (PSM) document on file at the facility.  It is Milner Milling?s policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends on the manner in which we operate and maintain the chlorine storage and dispensing system.  We have retained American Ingredients Company, a nationally recognized expert firm, to perform all periodic and preventive maintenance, and to provide frequent and thorough training to our personnel.

      "SummaryText": "ance procedures outlined in the PSM are followed, and will minimize the potential of a release of chlorine to the environment.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nNo accidental releases have occurred in the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nRelease prevention is provided by Program 3 as defined by 40 CFR Part 68.  Program 3 includes Process Safety Management (PSM) with the following elements:\n\n-Employee Participation\n-Process Safety Information\n-Process Hazard Analysis\n-Operating Procedures\n-Training\n-Contractors\n-Pre-Startup Safety Review\n-Mechanical Integrity\n-Hot Work Permits\n-Management of Change\n-Incident Investigation\n-Compliance Audits\n\nDespite the Prevention Program noted above, incidents may still occur.  Milner Milling works with emergency responders, the Lamar County EPC, who are trained to respond to a release.  Further, in the case of a qualifying release (> 10 pounds), facility personnel are instructed to notify the National Response Center at (800) 424-8802, and the Georgia Reporting Center at (800) 241-4113."
