      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nCostco Wholesale is committed to safety.  This commitment is enforced through the corporate safety group.  This group monitors the on-site implementation of the Process Safety Management programs through periodic meetings at each regulated facility.  In addition, the corporate safety group in conjunction with the local Depot Manager are responsible for maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all employees and the surrounding communities.  This policy is administered through Costco Wholesale's safety and environmental programs.  These programs include forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout / tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers' documentation, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\nThe Costco Wholesale facility has an emergency action plan in effect.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document which is maintained at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n - To save lives.\n - To minimize and avoid injuries.\n - To protect the environment.\n - To minimize property damage.\n\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nConstruction of the ammonia refrigeration system at Costco Wholesale was completed in July 2000.  The facility serves as a distribution point for chilled goods that are shipped to Costco Wholesale retail outlets.  The facility is located at 8400 Sherman Street in Tolleson, Arizona, about 1.5 miles south of the Interstate 10 freeway.  The immediate area is a mixture of agricultural, residential, light industrial and light commercial.  The ammonia s"

      "SummaryText": "ystem was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the Uniform Fire and Mechanical Codes.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses approximately 18,000 pounds of ammonia for cross dock operations, warehouse cold storage, and freezer storage.  The majority of the system is located in the machine room including vessels, compressors, and associated piping.  The condensers are mounted on the engine room roof, and all of the evaporators are located in their respective cold storage rooms/areas.\n\nThe refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of high pressure liquid ammonia from the high pressure receiver to the high temperature pump accumulator.  The high pressure receiver also supplies liquid ammonia to the compressors for oil cooling.  As the ammonia enters the high temperature pump accumulator, it is expanded through a hand expansion valve, reducing the pressure (and hence the temperature) in order to maintain a predetermined internal pressure.  The high temperature pump accumulator feeds a similar vessel that maintains an intermediate pressure, the medium temperature pump accumulator.  The pressure is further reduced between the medium temperature accumulator and the low temperature pump accumulator.  Each accumulator vessel supplies pumped liquid ammonia to a distinct set of evaporators.  The high temperature accumulator serves sixteen (16) cross dock/cold storage evaporators.  The medium temperature accumulator typically serves eight (8) +28A?F meat cooler evaporators (that can also be supplied by the high temperature accumulator as needed), and the low temperature accumulator serves six (6) -10A?F freezer evaporators.  Fans in each evaporator are used to blow air across and through the coils which partially vaporizes the liquid ammonia as heat from the room is transferred to the ammonia.\n\nThe resulting two-phased (liquid/vapor) ammonia from each set of evaporators is returned to each accumulator respectively in w"

The vapor from the accumulators is then drawn to seven (7) compressors where the pressure and temperature of the gas is increased.  All seven compressors work in combination to compress the vapor pulled from the three accumulator vessels.  Compressor discharge (high pressure ammonia vapor, or hot gas) is routed to three (3) condensers where it is condensed to a high pressure liquid and drained back to the high pressure receiver.  Hot gas is also used  for defrost of the freezer and meat evaporators.  An auto purger periodically purges the system of non-condensibles collected in the condensers.  Dual pressure relief valve assemblies are installed on each vessel to relieve high pressure ammonia to a water diffusion tank through a common header in case of a high pressure event. \n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Costco Wholesale ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the Costco Wholesale facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.  Refrigeration contractors, experts in the ammonia refrigeration industry, are contracted at the facility to maintain the system.\n\nThe Costco Wholesale facility including the ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety features include a water diffusion tank, ammonia leak detectors in the machine room and the cold storage warehouse, and automatic shut down systems.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the machine room and just outside of the machine room (condensers).  All pressure vessels are equipped with pr"

      "SummaryText": "essure relief valves that are commonly piped to the water diffusion tank.\n\nAmmonia refrigeration systems do not experience any chemical reactions or internal corrosion.  The only composition change that occurs within the systems are phase changes, as ammonia is cycled through various stages of liquid and vapor, similar to a household refrigerator.  The refrigeration system is a closed-loop system without any regular emissions or releases.  Any leaks are noted and repaired immediately.\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, Costco Wholesale has developed a preventive maintenance program that utilizes the services of a professional refrigeration contractor to complete regularly scheduled inspections and tests of the ammonia refrigeration system as well as repairs as needed to process equipment.  This program is implemented throughout the company.\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Costco Wholesale facility has not had any reportable ammonia releases during the past 5 years (July 2005 - July 2010).  No injuries have occurred at the facility due to the operation of the ammonia refrigeration process.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nCostco Wholesale has an emergency action plan in effect at the facility.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document, which is maintained at the facility.  Emergency response activities are coordinated with the local Tolleson Fire Department.  In case of a major ammonia emergency, the facility will first call 9-1-1 to alert the local Police and Fire Departments.  Other responders will be called as needed, including the county Hazardous Materials Response Team.  If a release exceeds the federal reporting quantity of 100 pounds for ammonia, the National Response Center will be called.\n\nThe Costco Wholesale facility has an Emergency Command System in place.  The Depot Manager will assume command in an emergency situation with backup personnel appointed to serve if he/she "

The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  The facility holds evacuation drills at least once per year.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe facility has worked to address safety issues as they arise in a continued effort to ensure a safe work environment.  A Compliance Audit was completed in Septebmer 2009 and a PHA Revalidation was completed in July 2010 that generated recommendations to improve safety at the facility.  These include reviewing and updating P&IDs, implement safety evaluation policies for contractors and to continue improving the preventive maintenance procedures.  Costco Wholesale is proceeding with the few remaining mitigation measures associated with these studies.  \n\nThe corporate safety group has also implemented an annual program to review the PSM and RMP programs at each of the facilities to ensure on-going compliance with the Process Safety Management and Risk Management Programs."
