      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\n\n\n\nThe Trinity River Authority of Texas (TRA) is a political subdivision charged by legislative mandate with three functions.  These include the maintenance of a Master Plan for basin-wide development, serving as a local sponsor for federal water projects, and providing services authorized by the Texas Legislature within TRA's defined territory that includes all or part of seventeen counties encompassing approximately 17,500 square miles. \n\n\n\nTRA's greatest impact to the general public is ownership and operation of several large water and wastewater treatment facilities.  TRA provides essential services to a significant portion of the public in the Dallas/Fort Worth metropolitan area and to several cities around Lake Livingston.  As the operator of these facilities, it is TRA's duty to inform the public about efforts to prevent and, if necessary, respond if a hazardous substance were inadvertently released from one of our treatment facilities.  \n\n\n\nTRA's Tarrant County Water Supply Project (TCWSP) began operation in 1974.  At that time, this facility was providing treated surface water to the cities of Bedford and Euless with a combined population of approximately 35,000 people.  The Tarrant County plant provided the two cities with six million gallons of surface water each day.  Since construction in 1974, the plant has been expanded six times and currently has a treatment capacity of 87,000,000 gallons per day and serves the cities of Bedford, Euless, North Richland Hills, Colleyville and Grapevine.  The facility is located on Trinity Blvd. south of the City of Euless.  The quality of treated water leaving TCWSP meets or exceeds all established standards.\n\n\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\n\n\n\nAs a result of federal requirements, 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Program (ARPP), the TCWSP is required to develop and implement a Risk Management Program (RMP) due to the quantity of chlorine and ammonia that it uses in its treatment process.
