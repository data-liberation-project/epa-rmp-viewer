Berry Petroleum Cogeneration Facility 18 is extremely diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community. Berry Petroleum Cogeneration 18 staff is highly trained and utilize modern equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while effectively and safely using ammonia for controlling NOx emissions. \n\nBerry Petroleum Cogeneration Facility 18 has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Ammonia Injection System. Berry Petroleum Cogeneration Facility 18A?s policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\nThe Berry Petroleum Cogeneration Facility 18 is located in Kern County, California, approximately 3.2 miles southwest pf Coty of Taft and 3.2 miles northwest of the City of Maricopa. The facility is adjacent to the State Route 33 Highway, approximately one mile west of Route #33. The site occupies 1.8 acres. The site is adjacent to the Berry Petroleum Company Production Facilities. The area around the facility is basically uninhabited. \n\nBerry Cogeneration-18 Facility owned by Berry Petroleum Company. Steam and electricity are produced and sold to the local power utility company. The Cogeneration facility began commercial operation in December 1986.  The facility consists of two Solar Mars 90 gas turbine generator sets for the production of electrical energy and two heat recovery steam generators (HRSG) for the production of thermal energy in the form of Steam.

Electrical power is consumed by surrounding Berry Production facilities supplying the electrical needs of the facilities up to 1000 Kilowatts.  Exhaust heat from the gas turbine is recovered in the heat recovery steam generation system. All steam produced is delivered to the Berry Petroleum Company for injection into the oil formation for enhanced oil recovery. \nThe site is currently operated by Solar Assets Management Services and is manned 15 hrs a day and monitored 24 hrs a day. There are three personnel assigned to the facility - (1) Lead Technician and (2) Technician II personnel. \n\nThe regulated substance managed at the Facility is anhydrous ammonia.  The maximum intended inventory is 94,050 lbs of anhydrous ammonia and it is stored in a pressurized horizontal storage tank at ambient temperature in liquid form.  When ambient conditions do not significantly promote the vaporization of liquid ammonia, a vaporizer is utilized to heat the liquid to its boiling point to produce vapor. The vapor ammonia is sent to a mixing chamber where it is mixed with air. The resulting vapor ammonia / air stream is then injected into the HRSG. This, in conjunction with the catalyst within the HRSG, allow for the reduction of NOx and other unwanted materials being sent to the environment. The exhaust gas containing a lower concentration of NOx is then sent from the HRSG to an exhaust stack. \n\nHazard Assessment Summary/Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\nScenario Description: Per the EPA RMP Regulations, one worst-case analysis has been defined and modeled for the ammonia injection system.

In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event (e.g., In the event of a release, sudden rupture and flashing of ammonia would be highly turbulent. Turbulence causes entrainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly than is shown in the model).\n\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an ammonia release:\n\nA?Automatic/Manual Shutdown\nA?Well designed Relief System.\n\nThe history of the Berry Petroleum Cogeneration Facility 18 (i.e., no CalARP-applicable ammonia releases) reflects the adequacy of the design and diligence of the plant staff in safely operating the Ammonia Injection System.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program \nAs part of the implementation of this RMP Program, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by Berry Petroleum Cogeneration Facility 18 to manage process safety issues associated with the use of ammonia for the NOx abatement system.  In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.\n\nThe facilityA?s maximum intended inventory of anhydrous ammonia"
