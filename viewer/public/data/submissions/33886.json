The fertilizer product, anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in tanks designed for this purpose.\n\n3.     The Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\n        An analysis of the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical worst-case and alternative-case accidental releases have been addressed in our Hazard Assessment and information is in our Risk Management Program.\n\n4.     Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n         The facility is in compliance with the provisions of the U.S. Occupational Satety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111.  Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia and our state regulations covering anhydrous ammonia.  The OSHA standard is referenced in this RMP Registration see Form; see Section 8.3 (b).\n\n5.      Five-Year Accident History.\n\n         There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have \ncaused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, has THERE BEEN ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES that resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.       Energency Action Plan.\n\n          The facility has:\n\n          a"
