Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nAt the Ausimont USA Orange Plant, we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.\n\nWe are a member of the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA) Responsible Care Program.  The CMA Responsible Care Program goes beyond the boundaries of regulatory compliance and strives for continuous improvement in industry operations and processes by incorporating health, safety, and environmental protection into all stages of a products life - design, manufacture, marketing, distribution, use, recycling, and disposal.\n\nThe Orange plant participates in the Orange Community Advisory Panel of local citizens who meet regularly with plant management to discuss various issues, especially those related to environmental, safety, and health.  This mechanism was established to better understand and address the needs and concerns of the local community.\n\nAusimont has been proactive in communicating our risk management program with the community.  A RMP Community Awareness event was in public meetings during April of 1998 and included participation by local industry and the local emergency response community.  The Community Advisory Panel toured our plant and employees and management were available to answer questions.  Information was distributed that explains our plant's safety programs, release scenarios, and emergency response program.  The presentation to the general public was repeated during the community's annual Gumbo Cook-Off Festival on May 2,1998.\n\nThe following is taken from Ausimont's Corporate Safety Policy:\n\nAusimont USA, Inc.

It is also the policy of Ausimont that all our operations are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.  Additionally, it is Ausimont's policy to supply all available information pertaining to safe handling and use of its materials to customers.\n\nThe following specific points are included in Ausimont policy.\n\n-Ausimont, in all its operations, is committed to achieving excellence in safety.  All other activities should be consistent with this goal.\n\n-Compliance with safety and environmental laws and regulations is our top priority.  No other operations will take priority over this objective.\n\n-It is Ausimont's premise that all accidents and injuries are preventable.  Therefore, every reasonable and practical effort will be made in the interest of preventing accidents that cause personal injury or property damage, both inside the corporation and outside.\n\n-Safety is the direct responsibility of all levels of line management and is an important measure of managerial performance.\n\nThe Orange Plant recognizes and is concerned that every employee shall be furnished a safe and healthful place to work, free from recognized hazards that might cause serious injuries and illness.  Every effort will be made in the interest of accident prevention, health preservation, and fire protection.\n\n\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nAusimont USA has developed and currently markets a family of fluorine based products that are noted for their exceptional resistance to chemical agents and environments which attack and degrade other materials.

      "SummaryText": "Ausimont USA in 1986.\n\nThe regulated substance at the Orange plant is trifluorochloroethylene, a flammable substance which is the primary raw material used in the manufacture of HALAR.. Trifluorochloroethylene is also known as chlorotrifluoroethylene, or CTFE. \n\n\n3. Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios:\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario \n\nThe worst case release scenario for CTFE assumes the loss of the entire contents of the storage tank with the maximum possible amount (150,000 lbs.) in the tank at the time of its failure.  Based upon the original EPA Guidance, the distance from the source of the vapor cloud explosion to its endpoint would include offsite endpoints but no nearby public receptors. \n\nAlternative Release Scenario \n\nThe alternative release scenario for CTFE is a Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapor Explosion (BLEVE) of the tank with 75,000 pounds of CTFE. Based upon the original EPA Guidance, the distance from the source of the BLEVE to its endpoint would include offsite endpoints but no nearby public receptors.\n\n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility is regulated under the OSHA Process Safety Management rules which regulates the management of process safety.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\nProcess Safety Information: A variety of technical documents are kept that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.\nProcess Hazard Analysis:  A c"

Within this program, each process or process change is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  This is performed by a team which identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when deemed necessary.\nStandard Operating Procedures:  Operating procedures  provide clear daily instructions for safely conducting activities involved in each process, consistent with the process safety information.  The written procedures address steps for each operating phase, operating limits, emergency shutdown procedures, and safety and health considerations.\nTraining:   We have established a comprehensive training program to certify operators in both unit operations and emergency response procedures.  This requires operators to demonstrate (through written testing and hands-on examinations) that they have adequate knowledge before they can work independently.  This training includes emphasis on the specific safety and health hazards, emergency operations including shutdown, and safe work practices applicable to the employee's job tasks.  There is annual refresher training for all operators on the operating procedures and chemical hazards of the process.\nMechanical Integrity:  An established preventive maintenance and equipment integrity program promotes that all process equipment is operating within approved limits.  The initial and on-going integrity of process equipment is ensured by determining that the equipment is designed, installed and maintained properly.  This includes testing and inspection of equipment and quality assurance checks of equipment, spare parts and maintenance materials.

Changes are reviewed to confirm that adequate controls are in place to manage the change and that existing controls have not been compromised by the modification.  All changes are verified with a pre-startup safety review, all relevant process safety information is updated, and all affected employees are notified of the change.\nPre-startup Safety Review:  A pre-startup safety review is performed for all modifications which resulted in a change in the process safety information.  This review ensures that all construction and equipment is in accordance with the design specifications,  that the safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are current and adequate, that a process hazard analysis has been performed if required and that all recommendations have been addressed; and that employees have been trained on the change.\nCompliance Safety Audits: Audits are performed to verify that all procedures and practices developed under the process safety standard are adequate and are being followed.  This is performed by an audit team of both hourly and management personnel.  All findings of the audit are promptly addressed and are tracked to ensure they have been corrected.\nIncident Investigation: All incidents are investigated and appropriate corrective actions are made to prevent recurrence.  The investigations are conducted  to determine the facts and develop recommendations which are tracked to completion.  These are reviewed with all employees during monthly safety meetings, as well as any recommendations from our employee safety committee.\nEmployee Participation: Employees are encouraged to participate in all areas of process safety management, including the conduct and development of process haza"
