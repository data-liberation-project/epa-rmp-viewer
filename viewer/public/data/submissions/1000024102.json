      "SummaryText": "The Airgas facility in Albany, Georgia is owned and operated by Airgas South, Inc. The facility is a chemical distribution plant which stores, sells and repackages industrial gases.\n\nThe Facility operates from 0630 hours to 1930 hours, Monday through Friday and is staffed with approximately 30 full time employees.  The Facility is secured with chain link fencing, locking gate, security cameras, and yard lights.\n\nIn accordance with the EPA RMP regulations (40 CFR Part 68), the facility's inventory of chemicals was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances were found to be stored in quantities above the EPA threshold quantities. Based on the facility inventory, the following listed flammable substance is stored by the facility in regulated quantities:\n\nAcetylene gas (CAS # 74-86-2)\n\nAcetylene is packaged in a variety of cylinders, including 24 pound, 12 pound, 5 pound, 1 pound and smaller.  Gas can be released through a valve on the top of the cylinder.  The valve itself is protected by a cylinder cap that screws into the cylinder, except smaller cylinders that do not accommodate cylinder caps, i.e. NB's and Mc's. The maximum amount of acetylene stored at the facility is 20,000 pounds.\n\nIn the last five years, there have been no major accidents associated with acetylene. Accidential release prevention and emergency response procedures for the stationary source include safe operating procedures and a well trained workforce along with an emergency response plan and hazardous materials response team.\n\nAt this time, there are no specific planned changes intended to improve the safety of the acetylene process. However, although the\nmaximum amount of acetylene stored at the facility is 20,000 pounds, this will likely only occur one or two days per year. To minimize the risks associated with acetlyene storage, cylinders are separated in different inventory process areas that maintain inventory for each area below the PSM/RMP quantities, 8,000 lb. "

      "SummaryText": "maximum with adequate distance, barriers and with sprinkler system in main inventory area.\n\nA worst-case release, as defined in the RMP regulations, is a release of the entire contents of the largest vessel in the process, followed by a vapor cloud explosion.  The single largest vessel of acetylene contains a maximum of 24 pounds.  Because of this, the worst-case release amount for the Albany plant is therefore 24 pounds of acetylene.  EPA's RMP*Comp was used to calculate the distance to 1 psi overpressure for a vapor cloud explosion involving 24 pounds of acetylene.  This scenario represents all flammable substances on site.\n\nIn consultation with Albany plant personnel and Airgas' Safety Director, a leak in a 24 pound acetylene cylinder resulting from the age and fatigue of the valve apparatus was chosen as the most likely alternative-case scenario.  For determination of the endpoint distance, it was assumed that the released acetylene would detonate in a vapor cloud explosion.  Similar to the worst-case scenario, EPA's RMP*Comp was used to determine the release rate based on vessel parameters, and the release duration was assumed to be approximately one (1) minute.  This scenario also represents all flammable substances on site.\n\nThe results of the worst-case and alternative case scenarios are as follows:\n\nA?    Worst-case Scenario: RMP*Comp calculated endpoint distance 0.02 miles;\nA?    Alternative-case Scenario: RMP*Comp calculated endpoint distance 0.02 miles.\n\nThe RMP rule requires that an RMP include an estimate of the residential populations within the geographical areas that could be affected by the hypothetical worst-case or alternative releases analyzed.  The geographical area is the area within the circle defined by the endpoint for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios (i.e., the center of the circle is the point of release and the radius is the distance to the endpoint).  In addition, certain types of public receptors and environmental receptors w"

There were no residents within the radius for either the worst-case or alternative-case scenarios.\n\nBecause the off-site consequence radius includes a public road, plus the facility is subject to OSHA PSM, the facility is Program 3 under the Risk Management Rule."
