Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nCoca-Cola North America - Paw Paw (CCNA) is committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to our to our accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance and employee training associated with our regulated processes. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible accidental releases of regulated substances. However, if such an accidental release does occur, CCNA has coordinated with the Paw Paw Fire Department and the Van Buren County LEPC for emergency response support.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThis facility is used for the packaging of fruit juice and juice-based drink products. Ammonia is the only RMP regulated substance present at the facility in excess of a threshold quantity. It is utilized as the refrigerant in the facility's closed-loop refrigeration systems. The systems provide process and warehouse cooling for the raw materials and the facility's chilled juice packaging operation. The facility has two (2) separate ammonia refrigeration systems. The systems are treated as one process due to their proximity to each other and contain a total inventory of 22,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. Due to the size and proximity of the refrigeration systems, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, this facility is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR part 68. CCNA is also subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119, as well as the EPCRA Section 302 and 311/312 notific"

Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in applicable maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered special training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at CCNA to manage changes in ammonia refrigeration system technology, equipment and procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by an ammonia refrigeration system modification are promptly made aware of, and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews\n\nPre-startup safety reviews are conducted any time the ammonia refrigeration systems, or any of its components, are opened up for repairs, tie-ins or modifications. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating procedures and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nCCNA will conduct audits on a regular basis to ensure that the provisions set out under the RMP regulation are being properly implemented. These audits will be carried out at least every three (3) years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits shall be undertaken in a safe and prompt manner. The latest audit was performed in 2009.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nCCNA promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in an accidental release of ammonia. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions implemented to prevent the release from reoccurring. All incident investigation reports will be retained for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nCCNA believes that accident prevention is a team effort. Employees are strongl"

In addition, all employees have access to all information related to RMP implementation, including process hazard analysis (PHA) information.\n\nContractors\n\nCCNA hires experienced contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and/or construction activities related to the ammonia refrigeration systems. Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation is made of the contractor\u00c2\u00bfs safety performance. CCNA has a policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor\u00c2\u00bfs work with the ammonia refrigeration systems. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of ammonia occur.\n\n4. Five-year Accident History\n\nThe facility has had no reportable releases over the past five years.\n\n5. Emergency Response Plan\n\nThe CCNA Emergency Response Plan focuses on evacuation of the facility in the event of an ammonia emergency. Containment and mitigation of a release will be accomplished by qualified, offsite contract personnel. Local emergency response agencies will perform rescue, firefighting, first-aid, medical treatment and other response functions only after a release has been stopped and it is safe to enter the premises. CCNA maintains a written Emergency Action Plan to document specific procedures to be implemented in the event of various emergencies, including an ammonia release. The Emergency Response Plan includes procedures for facility evacuation and notification of the local emergency response agencies, which are responsible for notifying the public. The plan is regularly reviewed and updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within the facility that require modified procedures.\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan is coordinated with the Van Buren County LEPC.

The changes include consolidation from three (3) separate systems to two (2) systems. The system that was eliminated was small and included aging equipment that spare parts were no longer available for. In addition ammonia detection and ventilation systems associated with the systems were upgraded.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety in the future include addressing audit and PHA findings in a timely manner and sharing of best practices with other Coca-Cola North America facilites to introduce consistency between facilities in terms of maintenance, mechanical integrity and standard operating procedures."

These studies, using What If scenarios, are repeated every 5 years by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in refrigeration engineering and process operations. Any findings related to the process hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. The latest revalidation was performed in 2004.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purpose of safely conducting activities related to our ammonia refrigeration system, CCNA maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation including startup, normal operations, emergency operations, normal shutdown and emergency shutdown. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to all operators and contractors who work with the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nTraining\n\nCCNA has a training program in place to ensure that employees who are working with the ammonia refrigeration system are competent in all relevant operating procedures. Refresher training is provided at least three (3) years or more frequently as needed. In addition, all operators are at least RETA Level 1 certified operators.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nCCNA carries out and documents maintenance checks on ammonia refrigeration system equipment to ensure proper operation.
