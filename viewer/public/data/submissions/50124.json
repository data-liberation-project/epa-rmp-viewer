This program is organized into the following elements : 1) Employees participate in the elements of this safety and release prevention program wherever possible; 2) Training is provided for operators and maintenance personnel; 3) Process Safety Information (PSI) is maintained on ammonia hazards and the refrigeration system; 4) A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) of the refrigeration system is conducted and is periodically reviewed to ensure adequacy of controls; 5) The Mechanical Integrity program ensures the system continues to operate as designed; 6) Operating and Maintenance procedures provide operators and maintenance staff the information necessary to safely operate and maintain the system; 7) Contractors working on or near the refrigeration system are selected for safety performance, and are briefed on the hazards and safety requirements of the job; 8) Hot Work Permits are required whenever welding, cutting, grinding or other activities are conducted that could generate sparks and start a fire; 9) The Management of Change (MOC) program requires that the impact of changes to the refrigeration system be evaluated and approved prior to the work being conducted; 10) Pre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSR) are conducted prior to restart of the system after modifications to ensure that impacts of the change are addressed; 11) Incident investigations are conducted for incidents involving ammonia releases and near misses that endanger employees or the public; 12) Compliance Audits are conducted every three years to ensure that the prevention program is meeting its objectives; 13) Emergency Planning and Response ensures that employees and emergency personnel are prepared to respond to an ammonia release in accordance with the plant's emergency plan and that notifications are made to designated points of contact at local, state and federal levels depending on the extent of the release.",

      "SummaryText": "Borton & Sons, Inc., based in Yakima, WA packs and warehouses fresh fruit products obtained from multiple orchards in the Pacific Northwest. Ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the cooling and storage process. Ammonia is a colorless gas with a pungent odor that is an irritant to the eyes, nose and throat. It is normally shipped as a liquefied compressed gas and is present in portions of the refrigeration system as a liquid under pressure. Please refer to onsite data for ammonia quantities.\n\n\n\nThe Borton & Sons covered refrigeration processes are located in separate buildings located approximately 60 ft. apart.  This separation is reflected in this RMP submission document.  The data in Section 7 of this submission; however, reflects a consolidated approach to RMP management as a single prevention program has been implemented.\n\n\n\nIn order to protect its employees, the public and the environment, Borton & Sons, Inc. has an integrated safety management program to prevent ammonia releases and mitigate the consequences of a release, should one occur. This program is designed to comply with the OSHA PSM (29 CFR 1910.119) regulations, WISHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standards found in WAC 296-67 and EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations found in 40 CFR Part 68.\n\n\n\nOff Site Consequence (OCA) data is available for review onsite at the Borton & Sons, Inc. processing plant.\n\n\n\nThe Yakima facility has an emergency plan that addresses the response necessary for a release of ammonia from the refrigeration system. Because of the pungent odor of ammonia, any leak is easily detected. The compressor rooms are provided with ammonia detectors that sound an alarm if ammonia is detected. The plant maintains a group of trained refrigeration operators and maintenance personnel who are trained and qualified to respond to leaks of ammonia. The refrigeration system is designed so that major components can be isolated by closing selected valves. In case of a release that could tr"

      "SummaryText": "avel off the plant property, calls would be made to the Yakima Fire Department and the Yakima County Office of Emergency Management to assist in the response. Other state and federal notifications would be made as required.\n\n\n\nThis facility has had no significant ammonia releases either within the facility or beyond the plant boundaries. There is no five year history of reportable releases of ammonia.\n\n\n\nAmmonia sensing equipment is installed in key areas of the processing facility and auto alarms to refrigeration operators. Windsocks are installed at various locations so that they can be seen from any outdoor location at the plant. If a release should occur, this will enable employees to quickly determine the wind direction during the release and to assemble in a pre-designated assembly location. It will also provide a quick indication of whether the toxic cloud is traveling towards the area of local receptors (residential areas)."
