Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nSeadrift Operations of the Union Carbide Corporation (a wholly owned subsidiary of The Dow Chemical Company) is committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We have implemented a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as to protect the environment.  These programs include both internal Responsible Care  requirements and governmental requirements, such as the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.\n\n\n\n2.Description of the Facility and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nUnion Carbide Seadrift Operations is a manufacturing facility that annually produces plastic and other chemical products in its various operating plants.  Most are intermediates used in other Union Carbide and Dow processes, or sold to customers who convert them into finished products.  The RMP rule requires that if a facility, such as the Seadrift Site, has a specific amount (threshold) or more of any one of 140 toxic and/or flammable chemicals, the facility must follow the RMP rule requirements for that chemical.\n\n\n\n Union Carbide Seadrift  Operations has the following RMP-regulated toxic and flammable substances in quantities above the threshold: \n\n\n\nRMP Toxic Chemicals:  Ethylene Oxide, Ammonia, Vinyl Acetate, Propylene Oxide, Titanium Tetrachloride\n\nRMP Flammable Chemicals:  Butene-1, Ethylene, Isopentane, Methane, Propylene\n\n\n\n3.Key Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\n\n\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenario(s) and alternative relea"
