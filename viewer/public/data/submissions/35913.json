      "SummaryText": "Sargento Foods, Inc., in Kiel, Wisconsin is a dairy processing plant with modern capabilities.\nThis recently constructed facility (1993) occupies about 175,000 square feet, and is situated on a \n40-acre parcel of land. The property is located in a predominantly rural area, on the northern \noutskirts of the City of Kiel. Adjacent properties to the northwest, north, northeast, east, and \nsoutheast are farmland or undeveloped land. Commercial-type properties are located to the south, \nsouthwest, and west. Residential properties are located to the southwest beyond the commercial \nproperties. A few residences are located to the north.\n\nSargento Foods is committed to protecting the health and well being of their employees, the \nenvironment, and the community. Employee training programs are in place, including ammonia \nawareness training for all employees, annual emergency response training for the response teams \nand ammonia system training for the maintenance personnel.  Training and maintenance \nschedules are handled promptly and efficiently through the use of computer software.  The \nfacility has a chemical labeling program and a spill prevention plan. Outside contractors must \nfollow written contractor policies. Hot work permits are required. \n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system was designed and installed in accordance with Wisconsin \nAdministrative Code COMM Chapter 43 and ASTM standards. The system is a basic two-stage \nmechanical refrigeration system utilizing ammonia as the refrigerant. The total maximum \nintended inventory of ammonia within the refrigeration system at any time is approximately \n22,100 pounds. The facility is equipped with alarm and ammonia detection systems, which \ncontinually monitor the refrigeration system. Also, Sargento maintenance employees make daily \ninspections 365 days per year.\n\nSargento Foods has never had an accident involving the ammonia system that caused deaths, \ninjuries, property damage, environmental damage or sheltering in place"

      "SummaryText": ". If an emergency were to \noccur, the local fire and hazardous response team would be notified and the emergency response \nprocedures would be followed. The facility has an Emergency Action Plan, and employees have \nbeen trained how to use the plan. Emergency drills are conducted each year. The \nManitowoc County Local Emergency Planning Committee has developed an offsite plan for the \nammonia system and is aware of the procedures in case of a release or emergency situation. The \nlocal response teams are invited to visit the facility on a regular basis. Qualified trainers are \nretained from Lakeshore Technical College to conduct annual 8-hr Emergency Response refresher \ntraining.  The facility has several Facility Emergency Coordinators on each shift, who have been \ntrained in Emergency Action Plan procedures and in coordination with outside response \npersonnel.\n\nThe ammonia system at Sargento Foods?Kiel facility is covered by the Occupational Safety and \nHealth Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Plan (PSM) which requires the \nfacility to manage system operations and develop emergency response and accident prevention \nprograms. Sargento Foods has developed and implemented a PSM program for the Kiel facility. \nThe PSM was audited in May 2001. A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was conducted in June 2004.  The PHA showed a great \nimprovement in safety measures had been achieved as a result of addressing the concerns of the \nprevious PHA."
