      "SummaryText": "Sud Chemie Inc is a manufacturer of inorganic metallic catalysts for use in the chemical industry.  We maintain <45,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia liquified under pressure in a horizontal storage tank adjacent to the production unit in which it is used.\nThe worst case release would involve the entire contents of a recently filled tank over a ten minute period.  The resulting cloud would reach offsite public receptors including schools, prisons and office buildings.\nThe alternative case scenerio involves a broken transfer line from the tank to the process building.  A release of up to 1000 pounds perminute could occur before the automatic excess flow valves would shut down the system at the tank.  This rate of release would stay in the area of the plant and impact minimal receptors.\nThe Sud-Chemie Inc accident prevention program was developed in order to minimize the risk of unintentional releases.  Key components of the plan are:\n*  Detailed operation procedures for all aspects of production and maintenance in the area.\n*  Personnel training.\n*  Process hazards analysis on the process.\n*  Routine maintenance and inspections of the equipment.\n*  A Management Of Change system to follow all changes and prevent the unintentional introduction of hazards into the process.\n*  Contractor drug screening and training before they are allowed on the site.\n*  Incident Investigation with root cause analysis to determine the causes and correct hazards.\n\nEmergency Response\nIn the event of an on site emergency in the anhydrous ammonia system SCI has an Energency Response Plan developed together with the LEPC.  Trained operators will stop the flow of ammonia remotely using existing shut off valves.  At the same time emergency response will be summoned by calling 911.  In the worst case the 911 call would activate the local community warning sirens."
