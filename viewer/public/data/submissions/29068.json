Founded in 1924, Univar USA Inc. supplies the food industry, chemical compounders, pharmaceuticals, mining, forest products, oil and gas producers, electronics, coatings and many other key industries with the chemical raw materials required to produce or refine products used in numerous end-use markets.\n\nUnivar USA Inc. is a member of the National Association of Chemical distributors (NACD) and complies with the Responsible Distribution Process (RDP), an environmental, health and safety improvement initiative.\n\nSome of the products stored and handled by Univar USA Inc. are subject to EPA's Risk Management Program rule (40 CFR Part 68).  A key requirement of this rule is the preparation and submission of an RMP Plan, contained herein.  EPA, including this Executive Summary, prescribes the contents of the RMP Plan.\n\nCORPORATE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE APPROACH\n\n1. Prevention Program\n\nProcesses that are subject to OSHA's Process Safety management (PSM) standard AND are regulated under EPA's RMP rule are subject to the Program 3 Prevention program.  Univar USA Inc. has documented the Prevention Program in its Process Safety Management Manual.  Briefly, this program includes provisions and requirements for:\n\n* Process Safety Information\n* Process Hazard Analysis\n* Operating Procedures\n* Training\n* Mechanical Integrity\n* Management of Change\n* Pre-Startup Review\n* Compliance Audits\n* Incident Investigation\n* Employee Participation\n* Hot Work permits\n* Contractors\n\n\n\n2. Emergency Response Approach\n\nUnivar USA Inc. has an Emergency Contingency Plan in place.  This Plan is shared with local emergency responders who have access to Univar USA inc. facility personnel.  Univar USA Inc. responds to minor incidents but will call in professional emergency responders in the event of all other incidents.\n\nUnivar USA"

Joint emergency exercises are conducted when possible.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE\n\nThe Salem Massachusetts site stores, handles and delivers a variety of hazardous and non-hazardous chemical products to wholesale customers in New England. Prepackaged containers of 37% formaldehyde solution are handled at inventory levels above the threshold planning quantity of 15,000 lbs. The typical inventory level for formaldehyde is 25,000 lbs. in drums or intermediate bulk containers. Prepackaged containers of an isopropyl chloride containing solution are handled at inventory levels above the threshold planning quantity of 10,000 lbs. The typical inventory level for isopropyl chloride is 25,000 lbs. in drums. Prepackaged containers of toluene diisocyanate are handled at inventory levels above the threshold planning quantity of 10,000 lbs. The typical inventory level for isopropyl chloride is 100,000 lbs. in intermediate bulk containers and drums Prepackaged containers of ethylenediamine are handled at inventory levels above the threshold planning quantity of 20,000 lbs. The typical inventory level for ethylenediamine is 50,000 lbs. in drums. Prepackaged containers of 70 % hydrofluoric acid solution may be are handled at levels above the threshold planning quantity of 1000 lbs.  The typical inventory level for 70 % hydrofluoric acid solution is 2,000 lbs in drums\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe Worst-Case Toxic Release Scenario for the site would involve a total container failure with a release of 55 gallons of formaldehyde solution according to the EPA proscribed release protocol. This would result in a release of 180 pounds of formaldehyde in a 10 minute time period.

Air dispersion modeling projects an affected area and distance to endpoint of up to 530 feet or .1 mile. \nThe Alternate Case Release Scenario for flammables would involve a partial container breach of isopropyl chloride solution resulting in a release of 110 pounds of isopropyl chloride in a 5 minute time period. Air dispersion modeling projects and affected area and distance to endpoint of 30 feet or .006 miles, resulting in no offsite impact. \n\n\nGENERAL PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nAs outlined previously, Univar USA Inc. is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation and utilizes this program to meet the prevention program requirements under RMP.\n\nChemical-specific prevention steps include the following:\n1.The maintenance of minimal practical inventories.\n2. Employee training and operating procedures.\n3. Employee release detection and mitigation activities.\n4. Equipment and containers designed to meet appropriate regulatory guidelines  \n\nACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe site has experienced no accidents as specified in 40 CFR Part 68 related to the containerized storage of ethylenediamine, isopropyl chloride, formaldehyde solution, toluene diisocyanate and hydrofluoric acid solution in the previous 5 years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nAn emergency contingency plan has been prepared and made available to local emergency response agencies.
