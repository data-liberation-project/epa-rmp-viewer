This facility, Tuckahoe Road Low Service Corrosion Control Facility, is the central storage facility for the 150 lb. cylinders of chlorine gas that are used at three water treatment facilities.  All chlorine deliveries from the supplier are made to the Tuckahoe Road Low Service Corrosion Control storage facility.\n\nThe City of Yonkers is committed to providing clean drinking water to the community while also focusing on employee and community safety. The City of Yonkers' Risk Management Program also complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulations and we are constantly striving to operate as safely as possible. At least two employees are present at the facility to oversee the delivery and safe handling of the chlorine cylinders. The employees ensure that all cylinders are thoroughly inspected for damage or potential leaks and that all cylinders are fitted with a valve cap that is undamaged and have hazmat tags.  The storage facility consists of a number of metal storage cages. Generally, 2-4 cylinders are strapped together and fastened against the sides of the storage cage so that they cannot fall. The cages are each individually locked and the fencing surrounding the cages is also locked. The facility is inspected by employees at least 8 times a day and is monitored by 24 hour cameras and is equipped with 2 chlorine leak detectors and alarm. The chlorine detector alarms are tested by the Bureau of Water on a monthly basis.\n\nSpecific operating personnel are trained to respond to accidental releases. A chlorine cylinder containment coffin,  which can be used in the event of punctured and/or leaking cylinder, is stored on site at Tuckahoe Road Low Service Corrosion Control Facility and the cylinder transport truck is also equipped with a Chlorine A Kit. \n\nThe the Bure"
