Our mission statement reads as follows: \"The ASHTA Team operates proactively to protect our employees, the public, and the environment, and to conform with mutually agreed upon requirements for product and services with customers, fellow employees, and our shareholders.\"  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks involved with having hazardous substances at our facility and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit an executive summaryin the risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at ASHTA Chemicals.  This document is intended to satisfy the executive summary requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of our risk management program.\n\nOur risk management program consists of three elements:\n\n1.  A hazard assessment designed to help us understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last 5 years associated with the substances regulated by the RMP rule  see Sections 3 and 5\n\n2.

In fact, we have a comprehensive safety program that establishes many levels of safeguards against accidental releases and against the injuries and damage that could occur.\n\nLimiting the use of hazardous substances.  Before using a hazardous substance, we always consider less hazardous alternatives.  When we must use a hazardous substance, we consider the potential for this substance to adversely affect our workers, the public, and the environment and take steps to prevent any such effects.\n\nPreventing releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  When a hazardous substance is used, the equipment used to contain it is carefully designed, built, maintained and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\n\nLimiting damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  We work daily to prevent accidental releases from occurring.  However, we also train our workforce to recognize accidental releases, quickly assess the severity of a release, and respond to mitigate and stop the release. We work closely with the Ashtabula Township Fire Department and the Ashtabula County Local Emergency Planning Committee to ensure appropriate plans are in place to minimize the impact of the release on our workers and the community.  Our safety program consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule.  This RMPlan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program required by the RMP rule.\n\n1.

We provide emergency response training to our personnel so that they are well prepared to handle emergency situations and execute emergency response actions.\n\n2.  Regulated Substances We Produce\n\nIn one of our manufacturing processes we produce chlorine in sufficient quantity to be covered by the RMP rule.  Chlorine is covered as a toxic material by the RMP rule.\n\n3.  Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nWe performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of chlorine to affect the public or the environment. We evaluated one worst-case release scenario and one more reasonable (but still highly unlikely) alternative release scenario.\n\nWe do not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  This scenario is designed to estimate the maximum possible area that could be affected by a release at our facility, but it is not a realistic scenario. An alternative release scenario was analyzed to provide emergency responders with information that should help them to improve the community emergency response plan.  The alternative release scenario represents a release that might occur at a facility like ASHTA Chemicals.\n\nThe main objective for performing the offsite consequence analysis was to determine the distance at which certain effects on the public might occur because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance). For exposures to chlorine, most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any lon"

Some people who are particularly susceptible could experience more serious effects.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be more severe; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less severe.\n\nThe following information summarizes the offsite consequence analysis. \n\n3.1  Worst-case Release Scenario \n\nThe worst-case release scenario is a failure of a storage tank that can hold up to 270,000 lbs of chlorine.  When we assume that (1) the storage tank is full and (2) all the chlorine is released and vaporized over a 10-minute time period, the predicted distance to the toxic endpoint (3 ppm) extends off site 17 miles, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.\n\n3.2  Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine is a malfunction of the chlorine scrubber system.  In this scenario, an ASHTA Chemicals employee will stop chlorine production within 10 minutes.  During this time, an estimated 500-lb of chlorine will be released through the scrubber vent. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends less than one-quarter mile off-site; however, there are no residences within the distance to the endpoint.\n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nWe have always believed that safety is the highest priority.  Beginning in 1992, we incorporated this belief into a prevention program that complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) regulation.  For ASHTA Chemicals, the prevention program requirements of EPA's RMP rule are nearly identical to the PSM regulation.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of our prevention program that address the RMP rule requirements.\n \n4.1  Prevention Program\n\nOur accident prevention program consists of the following"

We maintain a variety of technical documents, including an Emergency Preparedness Plan, to help ensure that our employees and local emergency responders know about the hazards associated with our facility.  These documents address (a) physical properties of the hazardous substances we handle, (b) operating parameters for our equipment, and (c) design basis and configuration for our equipment.  We ensure that this process safety information is available to all our employees.\n\n4.1.2.  Process hazard analysis.  We perform and periodically update process hazard analyses of our processes to help identify process hazards and make recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the processes.  To perform a process hazard analysis, a multidisciplinary team is assembled to analyze the hazards of our processes.  Each team includes personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a leader with process hazard analysis experience. The teams systematically address the hazards associated with operation of the equipment in the process areas. Each team then prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations.  Responsibility for resolving the recommendations is assigned to area personnel, and, when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the processes are implemented.  Each analysis is revisited at least every 5 years to ensure it is current.\n\n4.1.3.  Operating procedures.  Our process engineers, operators, and managers work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safely performed.  The operating procedures are used to train employees and serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.

Our training program includes both initial and refresher training that covers (a) a general overview of the processes (b) the properties and hazards of the substances in the processes, and (c) a detailed review of applicable operating procedures and safe work practices.  Both written and oral reviews are used to verify that employees understand the training material.\n\n4.1.5.  Mechanical integrity.  We maintain our process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment.  Our mechanical integrity (preventive maintenance) program includes (a) an inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before the equipment fails and (b) a quality assurance function to help ensure that new and replacement equipment meet the strict design standards required for service in our processes.\n\n4.1.6.  Management of change.  We evaluate and specifically approve all proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, technology, and procedures to help ensure that changes do not negatively affect safe operations. All changes other than replacement-in-kind (e.g., replacing a valve with an identical valve) must be approved through the full management of change program.  This helps ensure that inadvertent consequences of process changes are prevented, safety consequences of changes are addressed, affected process safety information and procedures are updated, and affected employees are notified of the changes.\n\n4.1.7.

Compliance audit.  One of the cornerstones of an effective prevention program is performing thorough assessments on a regular basis.  We audit our processes every 3 years to be certain our prevention program is effectively addressing the safety issues of our operations.  To conduct an audit, we assemble a team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the PSM and RMP regulations and in our process designs.  The team evaluates whether our prevention program satisfies the requirements of these two regulations and whether it is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the processes.  The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.\n\n4.1.9.  Incident investigation.  We investigate all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so that similar accidents can be prevented in the future.  We train our employees to identify and report any incident requiring investigation.  When an incident occurs, we assemble an investigation team and initiate the investigation within 48 hours of the incident.

Emergency generators will automatically provide electricity to critical systems to prevent the release of chlorine in the event of a power loss.  These are just some of the measures which help ASHTA Chemicals safeguard our employees, the public, and the environment.\n\n5.  Five-year Accident History\n\nOur accident history demonstrates the continuous safe operation of our chemical processes over the last 5 years.  Six accidental releases of chlorine have occurred over that time.  Five of these were brief leaks that exposed employees to chlorine in sufficient concentration to require medical attention. None of the employees suffered long-term health effects due to their exposure.  The sixth was a release that was detected at a neighboring facility. No injuries occurred and neither the community nor the environment was affected in any way.  All of the releases were less than the EPA reportable quantity of ten pounds.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Programs\n\nWe have established a written emergency response program to help ensure the safety of personnel who respond to accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for:\n7 Informing the Ashtabula Township Fire Department, the Ohio EPA, the Local Emergency Planning Committee, and the National Spill Response Center about accidental releases that could reasonably result in offsite consequences\n7 Providing proper first aid and emergency medical treatment for accidental human exposure to hazardous substances\n7 Obtaining outside assistance to control and contain accidenta"
