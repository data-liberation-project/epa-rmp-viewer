The Village is committed to achieving this goal.\n\nFacility and Chemicals Description\n\nThe Village of Mundelein is charged with the responsibility for wastewater collection and treatment services for its 28,500 residents.  The Village of Mundelein is located within Lake County, Illinois. \nThe Village of Mundelein currently operates one Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP), which treats an average of 3.1 million gallons per day (mgd) of wastewater.  The Village also maintains 95 miles of gravity sanitary sewer lines, 1.05 miles of force main sanitary sewer lines, and 57 miles of storm sewer lines.  \nThe Village of Mundelein's RMP applies to the chlorination process.  The covered processes at the Village meet the RMP Program 3 eligibility requirements, because more than 2,500 pounds of chlorine are stored on-site. \n\nThe WWTP uses chlorine primarily for disinfection, sand filter cleaning, and activated sludge filamentous control.  \n\nWorst-case Release Scenario\n\nRMP*Comp software was used to determine the worst-case and alternative release scenarios at the WWTP.  An EPA document, Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants (40 CFR Part 68), was also used.\n\nThe worst-case scenario is the failure of one 2,000 lb cylinder of chlorine.   The chlorine would be released into the storage building, which has the effect of mitigating the released gas.  Since this facility is located ina populated area, the chlorine gas released in this scenario would reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.\n\nAt the Village of Mundelein WWTP, the following systems and procedures make a worst-case release u"

      "SummaryText": "nlikely:\n* Inspection of chlorine containers prior to accepting delivery.\n* Rigorous inspections twice a day of chlorination container room and chlorination system.\n* Daily tests of the chlorine gas detector alarm.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios\n\nFrom review of the Village's operations and history, a possible release scenario for chlorine would be if a valve broke off of a ton cylinder, resulting in a hole in the vapor space of a cylinder.  The chlorine would be released into the storage building, which mitigates the release.  The toxic endpoint for this alternative case scenario reaches off-site, and reaches a off-site public receptor.\n\nGeneral Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nIn addition to the EPA's RMP rule, the Village of Mundelein also complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management Program.  \n\nAt the WWTP, several practices are important to the prevention program.  These practices are:\n* Thorough training of all employees\n* Inspection of chlorine containers prior to accepting delivery.\n* Rigorous inspections twice a day of the chlorine container rooms.\n* Daily tests of the chlorine gas detector alarms. \n \nFive-year Accident History\n\nIn the five years prior to June 21, 1999, no accidental releases from covered processes have occurred.  No deaths, injuries, or property damage have occurred either on or off-site.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe Village of Mundelein's wastewater treatment facility will rely on community emergency responders in the case of an accidental release of chlorine. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAn emergency action training program is being developed and implemented at the WWTP.  The training program for emergency action will provide employees with guidance on what to do in case of a medical, fire, and/or chemical discharge emergency.  This plan has been created with the purpose of protecting public health and the environment.  The Village of Mundelein shall use it when training and preparing for a medical,"
