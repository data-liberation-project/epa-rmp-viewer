Emergency Response Plan\nRobindale Wastewater Treatment Plant follows a written emergency response plan to deal with\naccidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and\nserviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place\nwithin our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n7.   Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various\nelements of our accidental release prevention program.  Additional training to employees is one\nof the major steps we want to take to improve safety at our facility."

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Robindale Wastewater Treatment Plant are strongly committed to employee, public and\nenvironmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental\nrelease prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.   The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activity is sewage wastewater treatment.  We have 2 regulated substances\npresent at our facility.  These substances include chlorine and sulfur dioxide (anhydrous). \nChlorine is used as a disinfectant.  Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) is used for declorination.\n\n\n3.   The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, including\nadministrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's\nOffsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance Reference Tables and Equations.  The following\nparagraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 (chlorine toxic substance) involves a\ncatastrophic release from our chlorine injection process.  In this scenario 2000 lb. of chlorine is\nreleased.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1-cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  A passive mitigation system such as an enclosure is also taken into account to calculate the scenario.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance of 3.5 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoin"

The scenario involves the release of 2000 lb. of chorine.  Toxic gas is assumed to be\nreleased from a pipe leak.  The estimated time for the pipe to leak all of the cylinder's content is\n60.28 minutes.  A passive mitigation control such as an enclosure is taken into account to\ncalculate the scenario.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic\nendpoint of 0.0087 mg/L of chlorine is 0.30 miles.\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario for sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) involves a release from our sulfur\ndioxide storage area.  The scenario involves the release of 2000 lb. of sulfur dioxide.  Toxic gas\nis assumed to be released from a pipe leak.  The estimated time for the pipe to leak all of the\ncylinder's content is 64.75 minutes.  A passive mitigation control such as an enclosure is taken\ninto account to calculate the scenario.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance\nto the toxic endpoint of 0.0078 mg/L of sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) is 0.30 miles.\n\n4.   The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific\nPrevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention\nrequirements.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with TNRCC 317\nDesign Criteria for Sewerage System.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of\nthe release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nRobindale Wastewater Treatment Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that\ndescribes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Robindale\nWastewater Treatment Plant maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address var"

The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nRobindale Wastewater Treatment Plant has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every year and more frequently as needed.\n\nMaintenance\nRobindale Wastewater Treatment Plant carries out highly documented maintenance checks on\nprocess equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks\nincludes among others; one ton chlorine cylinder, one ton sulfur dioxide cylinder, piping\nsystems, relief and vent systems, and controls.  Qualified personnel carry out maintenance\noperations with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are\noffered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the\nmaintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\nRobindale Wastewater Treatment Plant conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether\nthe provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  The most recent compliance\naudit was conducted on 03/31/1999.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any\ncorrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nRobindale Wastewater Treatment Plant promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or\ncould reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a"
