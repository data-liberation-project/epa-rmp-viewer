      "SummaryText": "Phillips 66 - Mt Vernon Terminal is a refined petroleum product distributor.  The Mt. Vernon Terminal is an on-shore, light products, bulk petroleum storage facility used in the storage and distribution of petroleum products to retail or commercial end-users.  The Terminal handles and stores various grades of unleaded gasoline, Transmix, diesel fuel, jet fuel, butane, propane, and various other petroleum-based additives. \n\n\n\nThis Risk Management Program (RMP) covers the Propane / Butane Storage Process at the Terminal (herein also referred to as \"the Facility\").  This document complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Accidental Release Prevention Provisions (40 CFR Part 68) and includes by reference the Process Safety Management Program elements in 29 CFR Part 1910.119. The process is classified as Program Level 3 under the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation.  \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\n\n\nThe primary function of the Facility is to act as a refined petroleum storage and distribution facility.  By virtue of the flammable effects associated with liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling Butane and Propane to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to employee health, and to minimize the threat and impact to nearby members of the community.  Phillips 66 - Mt. Vernon Terminal is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety and health.  Safety at the Facility depends upon the manner in which LPG is handled as well as the various safety devices incorporated into the design of the process.  Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees and contractors, which reinforces the safety policies and procedures of the Facility.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the presence of appropriate controls to prevent or minimize possible releases of Butane and Propane, if a release does occur, an emergency response plan is in pla"

The maximum amount of Butane that can be stored at this facility is approximately 393,700 pounds.\n\nThe maximum amount of Propane that can be stored at this facility is approximately 17,800,000 pounds - most of which is stored underground in the Mined Cavern.\n\n\n\nButane is stored as a Propane/Butane Mixture in the B/K Transmix Storage Tank. The Propane/Butane mixture is received from DOT covered pipelines, stored in the tank, and is pumped to truck loading.\n\n\n\nPropane is received from DOT covered pipelines, and is stored underground in the Mined Cavern. Propane pumped from the cavern to a series of Knock-Out Tanks, Coalescers, and Dehydrators to remove the water content. The dried Propane is stored in eleven vessels and is pumped to truck loading.\n\n&#8195;\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\n\n\nThe Facility complies with 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA and with all applicable State codes and regulations. The Facility's covered process complies with 29 CFR Part 1910.119 (Process Safety Management for Highly Hazardous Chemicals). The Facility conducts regular Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) for the process to identify potential hazards as well as controls, systems, and recommendations to mitigate those hazards. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. The Facility maintains Operating Procedures and Process Safety Information that describes the chemical hazards associated with regulated substances at the Facility. The Facility also has processes in place for Training, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigations, Management of Change (MOC), Employee Participation, Hot Work"

      "SummaryText": " Permitting, and Contractor Safety Performance in order to ensure continual commitment to safety.  Access to the Facility is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, and authorized contractors/visitors.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\n\n\nThere have been no reportable accidents/incidents related to or the operation of the covered system that has caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place during the past five years..\n\n\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\n\n\nResponse actions are coordinated with Lawrence County LEPC and the local fire and police departments. The Facility has a written Emergency Response Program in the event of an accidental release which includes emergency health care and steps to inform the public.  A plan is in place to inform employees what to do in case of a release, fire, medical emergency, etc., and to notify emergency responders when there is a need for a response. \n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\n\n\nThe Facility is constantly re-evaluating the current safety systems through the use of prevention programs such as MOC and the PHA program. As a result of these programs, and other safety and risk reduction initiatives, improvements to the safety of the workers and the surrounding community continue to occur. All hazardous consequence mitigation recommendations from PHAs relating to safety and environment are prioritized by a risk matrix designed to address highest risk scenarios first.  All hazardous consequence mitigation recommendations are resolved in a timely manner."
