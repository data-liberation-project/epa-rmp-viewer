The DWTP has a hazard review process is to determine, identify, and evaluate the types of hazards or potential failures associated with the chlorination process.  A Hazard Analysis The chlorination process is carefully managed and consistently conducted in a safe manner.\r\n\r\nWritten operating procedures developed for the DWTP provide safe and appropriate step-by-step method for conducting safe operations.  The written operating procedures give operators clear instructions for safely conducting activities involving the chlorination process.  These operating procedures include guidance from manufacturers, suppliers, and vendors of the chlorination process equipment. \r\n\r\nIn addition, the DWTP has implemented a maintenance procedures program that includes written procedures and schedules for maintenance and equipment inspections and tests to ensure that maintenance operations are conducted in a safe manner and implemented to maintain the mechanical integrity of the chlorination equipment.  Preventative maintenance and inspection of equipment is critical to safe operations. \r\n\r\nThe DWTP's training program is in-place to ensure that its operators understand how to safely operate the chlorination equipment and to understand why safe operations are necessary.  The objective of this training is to train operators so that fewer accidents occur, equipment damage is minimized, and operational efficiency is improved.  The City of Alice believes that its training program is the key to ensuring that the rest of the Prevention Program is effective.\r\n\r\nEvery employee working with the chlorine will be adequately trained to ensure safe handling, storage, and use of the chlorine.

Incident investigation procedures are used to assist in understanding the obvious incident causes, as well as the underlying causes, which provides valuable information identifying and solving the problem and preventing similar incidents from occurring.\r\n\r\nThe DWTP has implemented a compliance audit program to periodically assess compliance with its risk management program, monitor the risk management program and respond promptly to any deviations.  The DWTP uses the compliance audit program to verify that the practices and procedures developed are adequate and are being followed.\r\n\r\nThe City of Alice's DWTP has an Emergency Action Plan to ensure that system for notifying employees, the surrounding community, and the proper response authorities of in the event of an accidental release of hazardous chemicals is effective and in-place.  The DWTP operators are not trained nor equipped to respond, other than an incidental response, to a hazardous chemical release.  However, in the event that a release occurs that requires any response other than an incidental response, which can be safely performed by the City of Alice operators, the trained emergency response crews will be contacted. \r\n\r\nThe DWTP has implemented a management program, which describes the management responsibilities for implementing the risk management program.

To ensure efficient and effective management of our operations, we have developed a risk management program.  Our risk management program manual, in its entirety, describes the specific responsibilities and activities for implementing the risk management program.\r\n\r\nThe DWTP stores and uses chlorine to disinfect the community water supply.  The DWTP maintains approximately 12,000 pounds (six 1-ton containers) of chlorine on-site for use in its chlorination process.  This process is considered a single process.\r\n\r\nThe DWTP has not had any accidental releases of chlorine since it began operation.  The DWTP regularly conducts safety meetings to review and reinforce the proper management of our chlorine and chlorination system.\r\n\r\nWorst-case release scenarios and alternate release scenarios were evaluated and distances to endpoints were determined, public and environmental receptors were identified, and potentially affect populations were estimated.  The DWTP used the EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance to determine the distances to endpoints. \r\n\r\nThe City of Alice believes that a comprehensive prevention program is essential to the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  The DWTP includes seven basic elements in its prevention program: a safety program, a hazard review program, written operating and maintenance procedures, a training program, incident investigation procedures, and a compliance audit program to ensure effectiveness of the risk management program.\r\n\r\nThe DWTP maintains complete and accurate written information concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment, which is essential to an effective RMP.
