Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\r\n\r\nIn this cogeneration facility ammonia, considered by EPA to be a toxic substance, is handled and used.  It is mandatory to observe safety precautions in handling ammonia to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to personal health as well as co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is Rio Bravo's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which ammonia is handled.  It is also dependent upon the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility combined with the safe handling procedures that are used and the training of our personnel.\r\n\r\nRio Bravo's emergency response program includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority.\r\n\r\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\r\n\r\nA\u00a7 The primary purpose of this facility is to generate electricity.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\r\nA\u00a7 The regulated substance handled at this facility is ammonia.\r\nA\u00a7 The maximum amount of ammonia stored at this plant is 52,734 lbs.\r\n\r\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps.\r\n\r\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA - 58.  All of the ammonia delivery drivers have been thoroughly trained using the NFPA's Certified Employee Training Program (CETP).\r\n\r\n5. Five year accident history\r\n\r\nThere have been no accidental releases of ammonia.  No on or off-site injuries or damage has occurr"
