This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe NuStar Laredo Products Terminal adheres to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  NuStar carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials. NuStar personnel are trained to respond to minor incidents; however, if response is unsafe for NuStar personnel or the event is a major incident/emergency, the City of Laredo Fire Department is notified and asked to respond.  \n\n\nFacility Description\nOur facility?s primary activities encompass the storage and sale of motor fuel.  The facility includes 2 butane/gasoline mix bullet tanks and one ethyl mercaptan bullet tank.  Butane, which is used as a buffer between gasoline and propane pipeline shipments, is present at the facility above the threshold quantity.  Ethyl mercaptan, which is added to the pipeline to odorize propane before it reaches the next terminal, is also held above the threshold quantity.\n\n\nWorst-case and Alternative Worst Case Scenarios\nTo evaluate the worst-case and alternative worst-case scenarios, we have used the EPA?s RMT*Comp program.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario involves a catastrophic release from one butane/gasoline bullet tank.  In this scenario the flammable mixture is released from a bullet tank without consideration for emergency shutdown valves or operator action.  The tank is assumed to be 80% fu"

The vapor then finds an ignition source, with ten percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Using RMP*comp, the calculated distance to the 1 psi endpoint would have offsite impacts.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the flammable mixture due to a damaged pipe leading to truck loading.  This release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Explosion.  The release is controlled by active mitigation measures that include Emergency Shutoff Valves.  After comparing the effects of fire and overpressure, the vapor cloud explosion scenario was chosen as the worst scenario.  Using RMP*comp, the calculated distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 psi overpressure would involve offsite impacts. \n\n\nThe General Accident Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps \nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the OSHA PSM standard as well as the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  \n\n\nFive-year Accident History\nNuStar Laredo Products Terminal has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\nNuStar Laredo Products Terminal carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking pla"

Monthly safety training, operator training and certification are some of the major programs we use to improve safety at our facility.  These programs are currently implemented and changes are continuous."
