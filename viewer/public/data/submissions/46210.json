The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rule are required by the Clean Air Act Amendments and are outline in Federal Regulation 40 CFR Part 68, and DOL Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) guideline 1910.119 Appendix C.  This PSM/RMP is intended to aid American Water Services (AWS) in our efforts to prevent or mitigate episodic chemical releases that could lead to catastrophe in the workplace and possibly to the surrounding community.  This Program will ensure full compliance with Regulations 40 CFR Part 68 and 1910.119 Appendix C. and should serve to enhance AWS relationship with our neighbors in Peoria and New River.\r\n\r\nThe major objective of the PSM/RMP for highly hazardous chemicals is to prevent unwanted releases of hazardous chemicals especially into locations that could expose employees and others to serious hazards.  An effective PSM/RMP plan requires a systematic approach to evaluating the whole process.  Using this approach-the process design, process technology, operational and maintenance activities and procedures, no-routine activities and procedures, emergency preparedness plans and procedures, training programs, and other elements that impact the unit processes-were all considered in our evaluation.  The various lines of defense that were incorporated into Black & Veatch/McCarthy design and AWS operation of the new Lake Pleasant Treatment Facility to prevent or mitigate the release of hazardous chemicals were reevaluated and enhanced to assure their effectiveness.\r\n\r\n\r\nChemicals stored at the Lake Pleasant Treatment Facility that are targeted by the PSM and/or the RMP are chlorine and ozone.\r\n\r\nChlorine-stored in quantities above the 40 CFR Part 68 threshold limit of 2500 pounds.\r\n\r\nOzone-no regulation limit.\r\n\r\nTherefore, chlorine is the chemical"

The Lake Pleasant Water Treatment Facility will store up to 26 tons of chlorine gas in one-ton containers.  Containers will be stored in an enclosed building with a chlorine scrubber and gas containment provided by the building.  The facility is equipped with gas detectors that will activate the scrubber system in the event of a chlorine release.  The facility will be staffed 24 hours a day by one licensed Water Treatment Operator.  During normal business hours there may be other employees, contractors, and/or consultants engaged in work at the facility.  The chlorine storage area at the facility will be a secured zone and all access doors will be locked at all times unless authorized personnel are present.\r\n\r\nAWS is committed to protecting employees, the public, and the environment from the release of chlorine gas.\r\n\r\nThe worst-case release scenario, as specified by EPA , involved the release of the entire contents of a on-ton container in a ten-minute period with no passive mitigation.  The alternative-case release scenario involved the potential rupture of a 5/16 valve or transfer line.  This scenario estimated the impacts of the release of approximately 610 pounds of chlorine over a 60-minute period.  Both scenarios were modeled using the latest version of RMP*COMP.  The distance to the endpoint for the worst-case release was found to be 1.3 miles.  The distance to the endpoint for the alternate-case release scenario was found to be 0.10 miles.\r\n\r\nAWS personnel will not be responding to Chlorine emergencies at the Lake Pleasant Treatment Facility.
