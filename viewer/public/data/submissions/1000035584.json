In 2013 the plant is new and the  will result in having more that 10,000 lbs ammonia in the process.  The primary purpose of this facility is to process raw meat into food products for distribution.   \r\n\r\nAmmonia is contained in equipment in the facility and is compressed, condensed and evaporated to remove heat from within the facility to maintain safe storage areas and remove heat from the products being handled.\r\n\r\nAmmonia is classified by EPA as a toxic chemical and it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling it to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the health threat to our own workers, and reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ammonia,  safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\r\n\r\nAn accidental release prevention program has been prepared and will be in place when the facility increases the ammonia on site above the 10,000 lb threshold. The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines, and is in compliance with State codes.  This food processing facility intension is to comply with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable State codes and regulations.\r\n\r\nAll of our ammonia refrigeration operators are trained using a formal training program. This program consists of having an effective preventive maintenance program and  comprehensive employee training to insure equipment integrity. \r\n\r\nThe process has numerous safeguards including:  \r\n\r\n\u00bf\tAmmonia is not corrosive in this service.    \r\n\r\n\u00bf\tMost of the lines are elevated to minimize potential damage from fork lifts.  \r\n\r\n\u00bf\tThe Plant has an overall safety prog"

A team with expertise in engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety evaluated the existing refrigeration system in depth and developed recommendations to improve the safety and operability of the system.  The PHA addressed:  (1) process hazards; (2) previous incidents; (3) engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards; (4) the consequence of control failure; (5) facility siting; (6) human factors; and (7) a qualitative evaluation of possible safety and health effects of control system failures.  \r\n\r\n\u00bf\tWritten Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) were prepared to provide the basis for proper and safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  The SOPs include procedures for normal operations, startup, shutdown, emergency operations, and emergency shutdown.  \r\n\r\n\u00bf\tFor projects, a management of change procedure and a pre-startup safety review are in place to ensure that system changes or expansions are safe and that the changes are consistent with the engineering design and in condition to be operated prior to startup.  \r\n\r\n\u00bf\tContractors that are used to work on, or adjacent to, the refrigeration system are pre-qualified based upon their knowledge of ammonia refrigeration, understanding of applicable codes and standards, and their demonstrated ability to work safely.  Each of these contractors is evaluated from a safety perspective.  \r\n\r\n\u00bf\tThe Plant has a program for replacement of all Safety Relief Valves on a 5 year interval as recommended by IIAR.\r\n\r\nOur emergency response program is based upon federal guidelines as they apply to this facility.
