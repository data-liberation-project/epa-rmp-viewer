The toluene diisocyanate (TDI) used in the process is the chemical covered by the Risk Management Plan requirements of 40 CFR 68.\n\nSenior Management is fully committed to the safety of its employees and the community.  An accidental release and emergency response program has been developed and approved by the State of Wisconsin Emergency Response Board, the Jefferson County Local Emergency Planning Committee, and the local fire department.  \n\nThe highly unlikely worst-case release scenario would be the complete rupture of one of the two 45,000-gallon TDI/MDI bulk storage tanks which are located inside of and at the lowest point of the plant.  Should the rupture occur, the extremely low volatility TDI would form within the 2857 square foot dike surrounding the tanks (all within the building) and would evaporate the TDI at the rate of 0.02 pounds per minute within the building.  Considering the passive mitigation the building provides, the release rate to the atmosphere would be 0.002 pounds per minute.  Atmospheric dispersion modeling using EPA SCREEN 3 Version 96403 model predicts that the distance to the toxic endpoint would not be reached within 1 meter of the source.  (Please note that 0.01miles entered in Section 2 (2.11) was the lowest possible number that could be entered in this field, the actual toxic endpoint is much lower than 0.01 miles).  This distance is well within the Reiss Industries property boundaries.  Therefore, no public or environmental receptors would be within the endpoint distance. \n\nAll Reiss Industries employees are trained regarding the health hazards of TDI and the appropriate respnse measures should a TDI spil occur.  Emergency response training for employees occurs at regular intervals; no less than once per year.\n\nReiss Industries has not had an accidental release of any quantity of TDI within t"
