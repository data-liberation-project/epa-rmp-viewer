There are safety procedures, standard operation emergency procedures, accident investigations, hot work and line opening permits, extensive training programs, on-site emergency response teams, vessel inspection programs, and experienced personnel both in the salaried and hourly workforce.  Covestro is an active member of the ACC Ethylene Oxide Safety Panel that deals with ethylene oxide safety issues on an industry-wide basis.\n\n6.  Five Year Accident History\nThere have been no releases in the past five years that had injuries or off-site consequences.  At the New Martinsville facility, there has never been any offsite impact resulting from the release of chemicals listed in the rule. \n\n7.  Facility Emergency Response Program\nThe New Martinsville facility Emergency Response System consists of employee emergency response teams scheduled on each rotating shift.  There are approximately 100 emergency response team members.  They receive 16 to 80 hours of on-site training annually with some disciplines receiving off-site training as well in specialized subjects, such as firefighting, rescue, incident command and Hazmat.  An Incident Command organization provides secondary support and is staffed by Technical and Managerial Personnel.  The Incident Command Team's main function is to assist and advise the Emergency Response Teams and communicate with outside agencies.  The plant belongs to an industrial mutual aid group coordinated between the various industries, government agencies, and service organizations in the area.  Community warning sirens are placed in residential areas within 2 miles of the plant and have been in operation, as part of the CAER program, for more than twenty years."

      "SummaryText": "he primary activities at the New Martinsville facility are the manufacture of polyurethane intermediates, coatings intermediates and thermoplastics.  Products include polyethers, prepolymers, polyesters and thermoplastic urethanes.  In addition, aromatic isocyanates, and hydrochloric acid are received for reprocessing and repackaging.  The New Martinsville facility uses or stores four of the RMP listed chemicals on the site as of December 1, 2022.  Of the four chemicals covered, three are raw materials and one is a finished product.  All four chemicals were modeled using worst case release parameters as a screening exercise to determine the worst-case scenario for the facility.    The worst-case scenario chemical for the New Martinsville site is ethylene oxide.  \n3.  Worst Case Scenario for the Facility\nThe worst case release scenario for the New Martinsville facility is the rupture of the ethylene oxide storage tank into a dike that is 1100 square feet and 12 feet deep.  Because of the low storage temperature, the release to the atmosphere occurs through evaporation from a pool.   Through use of dispersion modeling (RMP*Comp), the endpoint distance is calculated to be 1.8 miles and reaches offsite receptors.  This release assumes no mitigation other than containment in a dike.\n\n4.  Alternative Release Scenarios\nAlternative scenarios were developed for all of the RMP chemicals. The alternative scenario for ethylene oxide has the largest potential impact distance of the group. In this scenario it is assumed that a leak develops during the unloading of a rail car.  Under typical weather conditions the distance to the endpoint is 1.0 miles and reaches offsite receptors.  The other alternative scenarios in order of potential off-site impact are propylene oxide and ethylene diamine and toluene diisocyanate.\n\n5.  Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe New Martinsville Plant complies with all elements of the OSHA PSM Rule and the E"
