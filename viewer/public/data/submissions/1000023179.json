As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Blanc Vineyards Plant 2 has elected to use PSMWriter&copy;, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n1.1    BLANC VINEYARDS PLANT 2, RISK & PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM \n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Blanc Vineyards Plant 2 has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program.

The facility has an ammonia refrigeration system that provides refrigeration capacity to four (4) cold storage rooms and three (3) precoolers.  The rooms are equipped with bare pipe aluminum coils containing chilled liquid ammonia.\n \nThe system operates as follows: High pressure liquid from the high pressure receivers is piped to the liquid recirculator through a liquid feed solenoid valve and expansion valve.  From there, low pressure liquid is pumped to the bare pipe coils in each cold room. Low temperature liquid circulates through the bare pipe coils.  Low pressure and temperature gas and overfeed liquid passes through is returned to the pumped liquid recirculator located in the engine room.  The residual liquid is separated from the gas in the accumulator and the suction gas is piped to the screw compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas.  The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquified and returned to the high pressure receiver. \n\nThe system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and safety relief valves which vent ammonia gas to the atmosphere if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point.  \n\nThe system was built in the mid-20th century according to codes and standards that are no longer being used.\n\nThe ammo"

      "SummaryText": "nia system at this facility consists of vessels which are interconnected, or which are co-located such that a release of ammonia could impact the ability to operate vessels that are not directly connected.  Therefore, the system is treated as a single process.\n\n1.3    GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE & CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n1.3.1    GENERAL \n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\nBlanc Vineyards Plant 2 has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in the body of the program. \n\n1.3.2    ANHYDROUS AMMONIA\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Blanc Vineyards Plant 2 facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n1.4    FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nBlanc Vineyards Plant 2 has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n1.5    EMERGENCY ACTION AND RESPONSE PLAN\n\nBlanc Vineyards Plant 2's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n\nA?

Federal \"Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response\" (HAZWOPER) - Title 29 CFR A?1910.120(q)\n\nStrategically, we will respond \"minimally\" to a release. Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \n\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\n\n1.6    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nOur company has an outstanding safety record, one that we are quite proud of. Many policies and procedures have been implemented to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, Blanc Vineyards Plant 2 continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter&copy; software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Blanc Vineyards Plant 2's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter&copy; tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Blanc Vineyards Plant 2's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\nBlanc Vineyards Plant 2 has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter&copy;, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter&copy; as well.

A copy of California Controlled Atmosphere's service agreement has been included in this program with the support material.\n\nFor the future, Blanc Vineyards Plant 2 now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Blanc Vineyards Plant 2 employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Blanc Vineyards Plant 2 will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety. \n"
