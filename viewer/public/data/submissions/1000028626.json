The plant is designed to process natural gas and recover liquid products from natural gas by physical separation and cryogenic means.  Both petroleum condensates and natural gas liquids are recovered from the inlet pipeline gas in this process for off-site sales.  \n\n\n\nThe Atlas Pipeline Mid-Continent LLC Velma Gas Plant has a long-standing commitment to workers and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel, quality assurance, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE    \n\n\n\nThe Atlas Velma plant is located one mile west of Velma, Oklahoma, on old Highway 7 and operates a variety of processes to produce the following petroleum products:\n\n\n\n1. Y grade mixture from natural gas\n\n \n\n2. Regulated flammable products:\n\n\n\na. Methane\n\nb. Ethane\n\nc. Propane\n\nd. Butane\n\ne. Isobutane\n\nf. Pentane\n\ng. Isopentane\n\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances at Velma Gas Plant is a vapor cloud explosion involving  229,361 pounds (60,000 gallons) of a flammable mixture contained in one of two vessels. This flammable mixture would be in a High Pressure or Low Pressure Surge Tank. The entire inventory is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. Since the facility is located in a populated area, the WCS could affect of"

Although we have numerous controls to prevent such release and to manage their consequences, Passive mitigation measures include an automated plant shutdown system to shut down all engines, plant utilities and actuated valves to their fail-safe position, diverting all incoming gas to the emergency flare.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for the flammable substances at Velma Gas Plant is a vapor cloud fire resulting from the release of the flammable mixture from a 2 inch hole at the bottom of the High Pressure Surge Tank (13,190 lb/min).  The release is expected to be isolated by plant operation personnel within 15 minutes or by automated plant shutdown system to shutdown all engines, plant utilities and actuated valves to their fail-safe position, diverting all incoming gas to the emergency flare.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nA.Employee Participation\n\n\n\nAtlas encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention as follows:\n\n\n\n1. Updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information\n\n2. Performing necessary calculations for PSM and RMP\n\n3. Maintaining good engineering practices\n\n4.

For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters such as temperatures, level and composition  in the operators? procedures manual. The facility maintains the process within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel and protective instrument systems such as automated shutdown systems.\n\n\n\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of the process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressures, temperature and electrical ratings. This information, in combination with procedures and equipment operating history, provides a basis for inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nC.Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nVelma Plant has a comprehensive program to identify and control hazards associated with the RMP covered process. This program systematically exams examines and explores for potential hazards putspotential hazards, then establishes  controls to put in place too manage the potential hazards. The Process Hazard Analysis is conducted using checklists with a team consisting of Velma?s Atlas employees who have operationsing, and maintenance, engineering and safety experience and  as well as engineering expertise.

The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.\n\n\n\nD.Operating Procedures\n\n\n\nAtlas Pipeline's Velma Gas Plant maintains written Operating Procedures of the covered process that address primary operations mandated by OSHA, EPA, Good Engineering Practice and manufacturers. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current accurate by management. The procedures are maintained current and accurate revising them as necessary by employee?s suggestion, compliance audit, PHA?s, Good Engineering practice, Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) and implemented through Management of Change.  \n\nCovered Process Operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job task and maintain the covered process unit operating within its safe limits.\n\n\n\nE.Training\n\n\n\nVelma Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the covered process. New employees receive basic training in process operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.
