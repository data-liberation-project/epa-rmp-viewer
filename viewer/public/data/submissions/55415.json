The Risk Management Program identifies the equipment, procedures, maintenance, inspection, and training associated with Regulated Substances (RS's) handled at this facility in excess of California and Federal threshold quantities; describes the structured assessment of hazards which was conducted to assess possible effects on employees and offsite public and environmental receptors; provides the results of an offsite consequences analysis; defines a prevention program, emergency response program, and mitigation measures to reduce the probability and magnitude of accidental releases of RS's; and establishes a schedule and responsibilities for implementation of mitigation measures and auditing of program elements.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) is being filed as required by ARP and CalARP regulations in order to report the elements of the current Risk Management Program and to describe further measures planned to mitigate or prevent accidental releases of RS's.  \n\nThis submittal is a complete revision and re-certification of the RMP. It is being filed with USEPA and with the local Administering Agency, Nevada County Department of Environmental Health.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nNevada Irrigation District provides water service to a large portion of western Nevada County and a small area of Placer County near the City of Auburn.  It operates several water treatment plants and reservoirs.  Its Banner-Taylor Chlorination Station is located near Nevada City, CA in Nevada County, and uses chlorine, an RS, f"

There are no full-time employees at this site.  Operators visit the site daily.  Chlorine is received in ton containers by truck, handled with an electric hoist, and stored strapped to ton container scales inside the building.  The chlorine is used to treat the water from the Banner-Taylor Reservoir to maintain adequate chlorine residual in the distribution system.  Pressurized chlorine gas within a ton container is withdrawn through a flexible copper pigtail, and reduced to vacuum at a vacuum regulator valve installed on header piping adjacent to the container.  The chlorine under vacuum is metered through a rate valve and rotameter in a chlorinator, and drawn into water solution by the passage of pressurized water through an injector.  Chlorine in ton containers has been used at this site for many years.  \n\nUntil recently, an administrative practice was followed at this site to assure that the inventory of chlorine was always less than the Federal threshold quantity; however, the District has since elected to treat this site the same as all of its other sites using chlorine in ton containers for the purpose of inventory reporting.  No changes in chlorine storage or handling practices have been made.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIt is the policy of Nevada Irrigation District that the receipt, storage and handling of chlorine at its facility be done in a manner which meets regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of accidental releases of chlorine to the atmosphere, in order to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public, and the environment.  In order to accomplish this goal, Nevada Irrigation District has gathered safety information on chlorine and on the process, equipment and procedures involving chlorine; performed a st"

Nevada Irrigation District has instituted a Process Safety Management (PSM) Program meeting Federal OSHA requirements at 29 CFR 1910.119 and Cal/OSHA requirements at 8 CCR Sec. 5189 covering its disinfection process.  This constitutes the general accidental release prevention program for Nevada Irrigation District's operations involving chlorine. Nevada Irrigation District has established formalized program and document management procedures used as the management system for the PSM and RMP.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC RELEASE PREVENTION STEPS\n\nRelease prevention steps specific to chlorine have been identified and implemented at this facility.  These include, among other things, eliminating most of the chlorine pressure piping and mounting automatic-closing valve operators directly on the container gas valves, and lowering the housekeeping pad for the ton containers for better access.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidents involving chlorine at this facility within the past five years resulting in injuries or offsite consequences.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nNevada Irrigation District's Emergency Response Program applicable to chlorine has been coordinated with Nevada County Department of Environmental Health, the local agency responsible for hazardous materials inventory reporting and release response coordination.

Any other measures identified by employees during workplace hazard surveys, or as a result of audit activities, will be thoroughly reviewed and considered for implementation."
