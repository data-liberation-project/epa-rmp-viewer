      "SummaryText": "The Ankeny Perishable Warehouse is a grocery products storage and distribution facility that contains refrigerated areas.  The refrigerated areas are cooled by an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.  Anhydrous ammonia, a substance regulated by EPA, is one of the most economical refrigerants available.  However, the properties of ammonia makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions while operating the refrigeration system to prevent employee exposure, and to reduce the threat of exposure to nearby members of the community.\n\nThe Ankeny Perishable Warehouse chose to follow the EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Rule, Program Level 3, to prevent a release of ammonia from the refrigeration system.\n\nThe Ankeny Perishable Warehouse complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, and applicable state codes and regulations to prevent a catastrophic release of ammonia.  The ammonia refrigeration system has been constructed according to the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration guidelines (IIAR).  The operators of the systems are required to complete a training and certification program to operate the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nThe Ankeny Perishable Warehouse has an established Emergency Action Plan to respond to emergencies.  The plan was developed in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.38 Emergency Action Plan.  The plan requires most employees to exit the facility during a fire or ammonia release to designated safe areas.  An OSHA HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120) Technician-level ammonia emergency response team is trained to respond to releases of ammonia for the purpose of attempting to stop the release and/or mitigate or minimize the effects of such a release.  Emergency agencies will be notified of the emergency.  The emergency agencies will notify any potentially affected neighbors.  Maintenance personnel will be available as a resource during an ammonia release emergency.  The plan also addresses natural hazard emergencies, fires, bomb threats,"

Every five years a Process Hazard Analysis is completed to review changes to safety systems, and changes in the industry.  The guidelines from the International Institute of All-Natural Refrigeration (IIAR) will be followed where applicable, to manage the refrigeration system."
