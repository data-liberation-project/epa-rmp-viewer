      "SummaryText": "Axiall Aberdeen PVC plant has a long history of safe operation in the Aberdeen community.  Our employees work hard every hour, every day to provide a safe workplace for themselves while protecting the environment inside and outside our fences.      \r\n\r\nPLANT INFORMATION\r\nThe Aberdeen plant produces polyvinyl chlorine (PVC or vinyl) resins and compounds.  These materials are used in downstream operations to produce wire and cable insulation, vinyl siding, pipe, packaging, and numerous other similar products .  The resins and compounds are produced by the polymerization of vinyl chloride monomer (VCM).  After the polymerization, the resin is dried and stored for shipping.  Most of the VCM used in the process is shipped by rail from Georgia Gulf's Louisiana operations.  The VCM is a gas at normal conditions, but is kept under pressure and handled as a liquid, in a similar manner to propane.  At certain concentrations the VCM is flammable, therefore the plant has many safety systems in place.  Both the Flammable Chemical Vinyl Chlorine Monomer and the Toxic Chemical Chlorine, which isused as a water treatment additive, have been addressed in the RMP Plan preparation.\r\n\r\nWORST-CASE SCENARIO\r\nIn calculating the worst-case scenario for flammable chemicals, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), requires the following assumptions be made:\r\nCatastrophic (complete) failure of the largest storage vessel\r\nComplete loss of the contents of the vessel and vaporization of the liquid in ten minutes\r\nMixing of sufficient air with the vapors to generate an explosion with a 10 percent yield-the worst seen for mixture of flammable vapors with air\r\nNone of the plant's procedures or emergency systems work\r\nIgnition of the vapor cloud as soon as all the material vaporizes\r\n\r\nThe impact of these worst-case events decreases as you move away from the facility.  It is important to understand the standard measure of impact for determining the impacted zones.  These limits are developed"

Many changes, both operational and procedural, have been made since, in an attempt to decrease the likelihood of events such as this occurring.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE\r\nAxiall strives to be able to respond to any situation.  To accomplish this goal, our emergency preparedness efforts focus on four areas:\r\n\r\nPersonnel - The most important part of any response plan is well trained, qualified people such as Axiall Aberdeen's Emergency Response Team (ERT).  The team consists of employees from various departments within the plant.  They train annually at places such as the Mississippi State Fire Academy.  On-site training is conducted regularly to test and refine the skills acquired at those facilities.  The ERT members have specialized training in fire fighting, hazardous materials handling, confined-space rescue and medical training.\r\n\r\nResources - The proper equipment is a necessary requirement for any job.  In the field of emergency response, it is necessary that equipment, materials, and labor be available immediately as needed.  The Aberdeen facility is equipped with such items as chemical transportation response equipment, automatically activated fire water systems, portable fire water monitors, fire fighting gear, fire extinguishers and other necessary equipment.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is hoped they will never be necessary, Axiall Aberdeen has provided sirens to alert the community to off-site emergencies.  These sirens are located i"
