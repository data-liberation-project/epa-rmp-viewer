      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nThis Risk Management Plan (RMP) is prepared for North Central Ag facility which is regulated under risk management program to comply with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Accidental Release Prevention requirements: Risk Management Programs under Clean Air Act Section 112(r).  The goal of our risk management program is to prevent serious chemical accidents that could cause harm to our employees, the general public, and the environment and to reduce the potential impact of the accidental release.\n\n1.  Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies \nThis distribution facility handles Anhydrous Ammonia, fertilizers, and other agricultural chemicals.  The volume of anhydrous ammonia stored at this site is above the specified threshold quantity that requires facilities to comply with the Risk Management Program Rule (40-CFR 68) and to develop and implement a Risk Management Plan (RMP). The properties that make anhydrous ammonia valuable fertilizer as a commodity also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions during handling to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to worker health and to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle anhydrous ammonia combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, and the safe handling procedures that we use.\n\nOur emergency response program is based on OSHA, NIOSHA and industry standards.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of local fire authorities, emergency response teams, and potentially affected neighbors.  \n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled\nThe primary operation of this facility is to distribute bulk anhydrous ammonia to agricultural customers.  Anhydrous ammonia is used as a fertilizer for agricultural commodities by our agricultural customers.  Anhydrous amm"

Anhydrous ammonia is distributed to our customers by truck (bobtail) and certified tanks (fertilizer applicators).  This facility has equipment to unload transports and bobtails.  Access to the site and hazardous material is limited to authorized employees and authorized management Personnel.                                                                                                                                                                     \n\nThe regulated substance handled at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.  The capacity of the tank is 30,000 gallons.  The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored at this plant is 25,500 gallons (132,600 lbs @ 52 F) since the industry standard and company policy limits the maximum filling to 85% capacity of the tank.\n\n3. Release scenarios (including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario) \nWorst-case release scenario: Industry standard and company policy limits the maximum filling capacity of the tank to 85%.  Failure of the largest storage tank when filled to maximum filling capacity would release 25,500 gallons or 132,600 lbs of anhydrous ammonia within a 10-minute time frame.  It is assumed that the entire contents of the storage tank are released as a buoyant vapor cloud.  The ERPG-2 (anhydrous ammonia is 0.14 mg/L [~200 ppm]) toxic endpoint was predicted to be 4.4 miles downwind of the facility.  The EPA model RMP*Comp (version 1.07) was used to estimate the toxic endpoint distance assuming worst-case meteorology of 1.5 m/s stability class F, no mitigation measures, and that the material is stored as liquid under pressure. \n\nAlternative release scenario:  A 3? transfer pipe/hose connected to the storage tank falls over and shears off the valve releasing 831 lbs of anhydrous ammonia per minutes and the emergency response team responded and stopped the leak within 60 minut"

The ERPG-2 (anhydrous ammonia is 0.14 mg/L [~200 ppm]) toxic endpoint was predicted to be 0.2 miles downwind of the facility.  The EPA model RMP*Comp was used to estimate the toxic endpoint distance assuming average meteorology of 3.0 m/s stability class D, no mitigation measures, and that the material is stored as liquid under pressure.\n\nThe North Central Ag facility installed the excess flow valve and/or manual emergency shut-off valve which will stop the release quicker to minimize the release of tank contents.\n\n4. The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps\nThis retail distribution facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and local regulations. The stationary storage vessel is inspected and complies with the State of Oregon Building Codes.  All of our drivers and employees have been thoroughly trained using UNOCAL \"Anhydrous Ammonia Safety\" training as well as UAP/AGRATEAM \"Training for Safe Transportation of Hazardous Materials\" certification. \n\n5. Five year accidental release history\nThis facility has not had any accidental releases in the past five years.\n\n6. The emergency response program\nThe facility's emergency response program is based upon OSHA, NIOSHA, and industry standards.  This facilities emergency response/contingency plan has been discussed with Wasco county emergency response personnel, Dufur fire department, The Dalles fire department, and Wasco County Sheriffs Office. \n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety\nThis facility's storage and transfer equipment is updated and maintained in accordance with industry safety standards.  Plans include adequate maintenance of storage and transfer equipment to ensure safety to all employees, users, and potentially affected neighbors."
