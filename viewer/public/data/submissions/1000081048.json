There are three storage bays for HCl thus the maximum storage will be 63,000 pounds.  The maximum quantity in this \"process\" is greater than EPA's RMP threshold quantity of 5,000 pounds listed in Appendix 1 of 40 CFR 68.130 and OSHA's PSM threshold quantity of 5,000 pounds listed in Appendix A of 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\n\n\n?    Trichlorosilane, CAS Number 10025-78-2 \n\nThe Trichlorosilane distribution systems consists of a 40,000 pound tube trailer provided by the chemical manufacturer, and associated gas cabinets, valve manifold boxes, piping, valves, and controls.  There are two storage bays for TCS thus the maximum storage will be 80,000 pounds.  The maximum quantity in this \"process\" is greater than EPA's RMP threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds listed in Appendix 1 of 40 CFR 68.130 and OSHA's PSM threshold quantity of 5,000 pounds listed in Appendix A of 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\n\n\n?    Anhydrous Ammonia, CAS Number 7664-41-7\n\nThe Anhydrous Ammonia distribution system consists of one 12,000 gallon storage tank, two redundant 30-kilowatt vaporizers, a tanker slip with fill stand, NH4OH generator in the Caustic Room, and all associated piping and controls.

The maximum quantity in this \"process\" is greater than EPA's RMP threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds listed in Appendix 1 of 40 CFR 68.130 and OSHA's PSM threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds listed in Appendix A of 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\n\n\nSince Hydrogen chloride (anhydrous), Trichlorosilane, Anhydrous Ammonia, and Hydrogen are also regulated under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, TI has completed a Program 3 Prevention Program to comply with the RMP rule. \n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps --\n\nYou may wish to mention the rules and regulations with which your facility complies, such as the OSHA PSM rule. You should also highlight practices that you believe are important to your prevention program. The steps you list may be either technological (e.g., backup systems) or procedural/managerial (e.g., improved maintenance or training). \n\n\n\nTI is committed to preventing accidental releases of Hydrogen Chloride (anhydrous), Trichlorosilane, Anhydrous Ammonia, and Hydrogen.  These systems are designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with all applicable regulations. TI employees and contractors having duties related to the bulk systems are thoroughly trained on applicable tasks and procedures.  Additionally, TI maintains a written emergency response program and has trained emergency responders on-site to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment.    \n\n\n\nThe prevention program focuses on hazard analysis, operating procedures, employee training, and maintenance"
