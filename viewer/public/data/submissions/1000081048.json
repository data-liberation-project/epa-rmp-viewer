We design and make semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. Additionally, we sell calculators and related products. \r\n\r\nOur analog, embedded processing and wireless technologies permeate daily life in many different ways, from digital communications and entertainment to medical services, automotive systems and wide-ranging applications in-between. By providing semiconductor technologies that promote greater power efficiency, enable more features, enhance performance, and deliver more value, TI expands the possibilities every day for how we learn, connect, grow and discover.\r\n\r\nRFAB, the world's first 300-mm analog wafer fab, located in Richardson, Texas is the world's first green, LEED-certified (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) semiconductor manufacturing facility. The LEED Green Building Rating System is a voluntary, consensus-based national rating system for developing high-performance, sustainable buildings. TI RFAB's administration and wafer fab buildings both achieved LEED Gold certification in 2008. The system, developed by the U.S. Green Building Council, assesses building practices in five areas - site development, water efficiency, energy and atmosphere, materials and resources, and indoor environmental quality. \r\n\r\nTI manufactures billions of integrated circuits (semiconductor chips) annually, which involves using large amounts of water, energy and chemicals. Every year, RFAB produces thousands of analog chips. \r\n\r\nProducing world-class semiconductors involves the use of hazardous and nonhazardous chemicals and gases, which is why TI has stringent controls in place to manage them"

We also continuously assess potential environmental, safety and health impacts of these materials as new scientific information becomes available and regulations are adopted. \r\n\r\nChemical selection and screening --\r\nWe screen all incoming chemicals before incorporating them into our semiconductor manufacturing processes. Screening includes a review of customer concerns and regulatory standards, in addition to any environmental, safety and health controls required for their use. TI also has restrictions and standards related to chemicals incorporated into supplier contracts. \r\n\r\nIf concerns about a chemical or other material arise during review, the matter is elevated to a chemical and material review board staffed by company experts. If a chemical or material is thought to be necessary for manufacturing but still raises concerns, the company's manufacturing leaders review the issue; where appropriate, they authorize additional time and resources to seek a safer alternative, or implement more stringent use controls. \r\n\r\nChemical-use policy and practices --\r\nTI is committed to complying with all applicable laws and regulations for chemical use. For example, we:\r\n\u00bf\tProhibit the use of Class I and Class II ozone-depleting substances in manufacturing. \r\n\u00bf\tProhibit the use of persistent organic pollutants as defined by the United Nations Environmental Program. \r\n\u00bf\tProhibit chemicals on the Prior Informed Consent list under the Rotterdam Convention. \r\n\u00bf\tSupport the mission and objectives of the Basel Convention (Annex I, II, III and VIII), which addresses environmental protection through the proper management of used chemicals and materials. \r\n\u00bf\tDo not manufacture products that contain radioactive substances. \r\n\u00bf\tSelect the lowest risk chemicals for use whenever possible. \r\n\r\nChemical handling --\r\nAfter we approve chemicals for use, we carefully manage their transport, distribution and disposal.

We work closely with our chemical supply chain to ensure that employees and contractors have up-to-date usage and handling information. \r\n2.\tEngineering controls and personal protective equipment. We provide engineering controls such as safety interlocks and ventilation to prevent employee exposure to chemicals. Employees who work with or near hazardous chemicals or gases in areas without built-in engineering controls are required to wear personal protective equipment and understand how to properly use it. \r\n3.\tChemical dock operations. We tightly control and protect chemical deliveries and storage by asking chemical professionals to handle all chemicals at one central location per site. \r\n4.\tJust-in-time purchasing. We implement inventory controls to reduce potential chemical storage risks while maintaining an appropriate supply. \r\n5.\tClosed chemical delivery system. Our chemicals are automatically fed to work locations through a series of carefully constructed distribution systems with appropriate leak detection, ventilation and abatement controls. We use double-walled piping and additional containment systems where needed. \r\n6.\tUsed chemical management. We minimize any amount of discharged chemicals through several protective measures, including wastewater treatment, wet scrubbers, thermal oxidizers and absorbers.
