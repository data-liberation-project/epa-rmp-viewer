The Executive Summary provides a discussion of the various Risk Management Program elements as follows:\n\n\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies 2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled 3. Off-site Consequence Analysis Results Summary 4. Prevention Program Summary 5. Five Year Accident History 6. Emergency Response Program 7. Planned Changes To Improve Safety 8. Summary\n\n\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe Covanta Mendota, L.P. facility handles anhydrous ammonia in a single 20,000 gallon tank.  Anhydrous ammonia is a hazardous material subject to the United States EPA's Risk Management Plan and OSHA Process Safety Management.  The properties of anhydrous ammonia make it necessary to ensure mechanical integrity of the tank, piping, and associated equipment; and to observe safety precautions in handling anhydrous ammonia to prevent human exposure, and to reduce the threat to the facility's workers and nearby members of the community.  It is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State of California rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the safe procedures used to handle anhydrous ammonia, the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility, and the training of the pertinent personnel.\n\n\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe Covanta Mendota, L.P. facility is a 28 megawatt (MW), biomass-fired, electrical power generating facility.  The plant burns agricultural wood fuels and other crop wastes in a fluidized bed boiler to generate high pressure steam which drives a turbine generator.  Anhydrous Ammonia vapor is used at the plant to control nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions in the boiler flu"

There is a daily maximum of 87,550 lbs of anhydrous ammonia at the facility.\n\n\n\n3. Offsite Consequence Analysis Results Summary\n\n\n\nIn developing the OCA, the approach followed the overall guidance provided by the EPA in the RMP OCA Guidance (EPA Guidance) document (April, 1999). \n\n\n\n3a. Worst Case Release Scenario\n\n\n\nThe worst case release was modeled May 31, 2002 and was reviewed in May 2004, January 2009, and October 2014.  For anhydrous ammonia, the worst-case scenario was defined to be the release of the entire vessel's contents over ten minutes in the absence of passive mitigation. This gave rise to a worst-case release rate of 8,755 lbs/minute and a corresponding endpoint distance of 3.4 miles relative to an urban topography. There is an approximated population of 11,518 within the worst-case distance to endpoint about the facility.\n\n\n\n3b. Alternative Release Scenario\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario was modeled May 31, 2002 and was reviewed in May 2004, January 2009, and October 2014.  For anhydrous ammonia, the alternative release scenario was defined to be the release of anhydrous ammonia from a 1/8\" diameter valve packing leak.  This would result in an average release rate of 40.65 lbs/minute over the course of 60 minutes resulting in a total release of 2,439 lbs of anhydrous ammonia. The corresponding endpoint distance is 0.1 miles in urban topography and there is an estimated population of 0 within the alternative release scenario distance to endpoint.\n\n\n\n3c. Administrative Controls\n\n\n\nAdministrative control to limit the distances for each reported scenario exists to restrict the amount of anhydrous ammonia released to a minimum, if a release were to occur; and preferably to not have a release occur.  This administrative control is inherent in the operational procedures for the anhydrous ammonia system and the train"

Mitigation Measures\n\n\n\nMitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario exists to restrict the amount of anhydrous ammonia released to a minimum, if a release were to occur; and preferably to not have a release occur.  The mitigation measures are based upon the design, inspection, testing,  and maintenance of the anhydrous ammonia system and its related equipment and components. Two windsocks are used to indicate wind direction and employees are trained to meet in an upwind area in the event of emergency.\n\n\n\n4. Prevention Program Summary\n\n\n\nImplementation of the Covanta Mendota, L.P. facility Prevention Program is another important consideration that helps to prevent a release or minimize the impacts of a release that may occur. The prevention program is described in more detail in the facility's RMP/CalARP Manual Prevention Program section.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information. A comprehensive set of process safety information has been compiled for the anhydrous ammonia system. The PSI includes data on the chemicals, the equipment, and the technology of the process.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazards Analysis. A PHA study was conducted on the anhydrous ammonia system to evaluate potential hazards with the system as designed.  Recommendations were made by the PHA team to improve the safety of the system. All safety recommendations are currently being implemented and records are being kept.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures. An Operations and Maintenance Manual provides detailed written operating procedures for the anhydrous ammonia system.\n\n\n\nTraining. Training is provided to each operator and maintenance person before they are certified to operate the system.\n\n\n\nMaintenance. All anhydrous ammonia systems are included in the facility's maintenance program. Equipment inspections, testing and preventive maintenance activities are performed following a structured schedule.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits. A compliance audit proce"

Covanta Mendota, L.P. routinely investigates any incident or accident that occurs at the facility.\n\n\n\nExternal Events Analysis. External events were considered in the PHA. Each external event with the potential to initiate a release was investigated in detail.\n\n\n\n5. Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no reportable near misses, minor accidents, or anhydrous ammonia releases at the facility in the past five (5) years.\n\n\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is based upon the alerting of personnel at the facility to evacuate the facility and await the arrival of responders from the local Fire Department and other agency emergency response teams at the evacuation assembly location if a release occurs that causes the evacuation to be initiated.  Fresno County can incorporate this response into the County Area Plan for the Region 5 Local Emergency Planning Committee.  \n\n\n\n7. Planned Changes To Improve Safety\n\n\n\nCommitments made under the State of California's Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program and  related activities will continue to be implemented.  Current applicable codes and regulations are  reviewed on a periodic basis to determine if other commitments need to be made to achieve increased operational safety for the ammonia system.\n\n\n\n8. Summary\n\n\n\nThe design of the Covanta Mendota, L.P. anhydrous ammonia system and the implementation of the Federal RMP and California Accidental Release Prevention Program provide a high level of assurance that the hazards and risks associated with the use of anhydrous ammonia at the facility are being managed in an appropriate manner."
