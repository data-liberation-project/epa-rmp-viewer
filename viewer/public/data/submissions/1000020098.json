All technicians are certified Class 4 Water Treatment Operators, or work under the direct supervision of a Class 4 operator.  Additionally, there are chlorine detectors with alarms placed in the chlorine feed room and the chlorine storage areas.  The Fort Riley Fire Department is prepared to deal with virtually any hazardous material (HAZMAT) situation.  The fire department maintains a 92-person staff, the largest in the local area.  All fire department personnel undergo a minimum of 80 hours of HAZMAT training (many undergo more, some as many as 240 hours of training) and also undergo 24 hours of annual recertification training.  The department also has mutual aid agreements with all local fire departments and maintains contingency spill plans for potentially hazardous sites.  Finally, in addition to the Fire Department, Fort Riley has a Crisis Management Plan to respond to various emergency situations, which includes unintentional chlorine discharges. \n\nc. Planned Safety Improvements.\n\nThe Fort Riley Directorate of Public Works is currently in the construction planning phase of replacing the chlorine disinfection at the WTP with sodium hypochlorite.  A contract is tentatively set to be awarded in the summer of 2011, with removal of the one ton-chlorine cylinders taking place in early FY2012.   \n\n5.  CONCLUSIONS.\n\na.  The dangers presented by Fort Riley's WTP to the local population are minimal.  Water treatment facilities for drinking water are commonplace throughout society and procedures used on Fort Riley are similar to those in use nation-wide.\n\nb.  Fort Riley's RMP is designed to help ensure that catastrophic releases of chlorine gases do not occur.  This is done via the development and implementation of a comprehensive program to manage chemical process risk.  Key participants in this program include:  Fort Riley's Environmental"

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\nFOR FORT RILEY\n\n1.  BACKGROUND.  Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA-90) is entitled Accidental Release Prevention.  This section, commonly referred to as the Risk Management Plan (RMP), is designed to both prevent and prepare for releases of chemicals or flammable substances that could have an impact on the surrounding public.  Under the regulation, certain facilities are required to submit a RMP that summarizes their Risk Management Program to the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  Army installations that store/use toxic chemicals and flammable substances in quantities meeting the rule's thresholds are required to develop a risk management program and also submit a risk management plan to the EPA.  \n\n2.  PURPOSE.  Fort Riley's Risk Management Plan meets the requirements of CAAA-90.  It describes elements of the program, assigns responsibilities for implementation, and clearly communicates Fort Riley's commitment to its workers and surrounding communities to minimize the risk of catastrophic releases of chlorine.  The electronic submission is a summary of Fort Riley's program.\n\n3.  REPORTABLE HAZARDS.  The only toxic chemical in use on Fort Riley meeting the requirements under CAAA-90 for submission of a RMP is chlorine used at the Water Treatment Plant (WTP).\n\n4.  DISCUSSION. \n\t\na. Fort Riley Water Treatment Plant (WTP). \n \nThe WTP at Fort Riley employs a conventional treatment process of purification that is in common use throughout the United States.  The WTP has an average daily flow rate of 2.5 million gallons, and serves approximately 49,400 people.  This process normally requires the use of 140-200 pounds of chlorine daily.  The chlorine is stored in four one-ton cylinders.  One of these containers is exhausted every 10-15 days.  The WTP has been operating since December 1992 and has had no chlorine release incidents in the past 5 years.\n\nb. Accidental Release Prevention and Emerg"
