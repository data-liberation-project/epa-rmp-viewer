      "SummaryText": "FACILITY OVERVIEW: Holloman Air Force Base (AFB) is owned and operated by the United States Air Force, Air Combat Command.  Holloman AFB is located in south-central New Mexico in Otero County, adjacent to the City of Alamogordo.  Holloman AFB is home of the 49th Fighter Wing, whose primary mission is to support the F-117A Stealth aircraft.  In order to complete their mission, the Holloman AFB utilizes a Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) which uses chlorine for chlorinating the plant effluent, the plant influent, and the return activated sludge stream.  The WWTP has the capacity to handle chlorine in quantities up to 8,000 pounds (four 1-ton containers) at one time.  However, normally only two containers (4,000 pounds) are in use at one time.  HAZARD ASSESSMENT: A hazard assessment has been completed to determine the endpoint distance during worst-case and alternate accidental release scenarios of chlorine. The worst-case scenario was considered to be a complete rupture of a single 1-ton container.  The scenario shows a vulnerability radius of approximately 3540 meters (m).  The worst-case scenario could effect approximately 10,730 persons located at family housing, base schools, and recreational areas, mostly within Holloman AFB.  Limited public receptors beyond the Holloman AFB boundary could be effected.  Environmental receptors would also be effected.  The alternative scenario was considered to be a crack or hole in a single 1-ton container.  The alternative scenario shows a vulnerability radius of approximately 320 m.  The alternative scenario could effect only transient population on a nearby bike path within Holloman AFB.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES: Holloman AFB is committed to performing work safely and ensuring the protection of employees, the public, and the environment.  This is accomplished through a variety of programs including Air Force Technical Directives, OSHA Process Safety Management, EPA Risk Management, and em"

      "SummaryText": "ergency response capabilities.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM: The chlorine usage at the WWTP is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management rule.  As a means to this end, Holloman AFB has developed a prevention program intended to minimize accidental releases of regulated substances and to provide prompt emergency response.  Representatives from Holloman AFB Civil Engineer Environmental and Fire Protection Flights, Bioenvironmental Engineering Flight, and the WWTP Contract Manager have produced a comprehensive program to provide operational safety and coordinated emergency response.  The chlorine is stored in a dedicated room within the chlorination building. The room is strictly dedicated for chlorine service and the walls are sealed from the adjacent pump room.  The chlorine storage room is equipped with a gas recovery system in case of a container gas leak.  The gas is recovered by a vacuum system located at the emergency scrubber unit.  The scrubber system is rated to a control efficiency of 99.9917 percent (based on manufacturer data) of the chlorine during an accidental release.  This room is equipped with a dedicated ventilation system, which is activated when the door is opened and is shutoff manually.  Leak detectors with alarms for chlorine gas are located at the WWTP.  The detectors are sensitive to one                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              "
