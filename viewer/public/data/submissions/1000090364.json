The Director of Warehouse and Logistics will contact the Maintenance Manager and servicing refrigeration contractor to evaluate and ascertain the significance of the leak.  An outside refrigeration contractor is contracted to further assist in the potential repairs to the equipment pertaining to the ammonia system.  For major ammonia leaks, emergency agencies will also be notified as necessary as outlined in the Emergency Action Plan.  Action is promptly taken to mitigate the leak so normal operations can resume.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nA Process Hazard Analysis was performed in 2015 and 2020 at the ALDI facility.  These studies generate mitigation measures (recommendations) to improve safety at the ALDI facility located in Riverside, California. The mitigation measures include additional training, key maintenance-related tests/inspection, and enhanced emergency response policies and procedures.

It is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.\n\nEngineering Measures:\nOther safety features of the ammonia refrigeration system include: \n\u00bf\tEmergency shutdown switch(es) that shut down all electrical components in the engine room.\n\u00bf\tEmergency Exhaust Ventilation System.\n\u00bf\tAmmonia Detection System integrated with an off-site alarm company.\n\u00bf\tRelief Valves with common discharge to a water diffusion tank.\n\u00bf\tEmergency Pressure Control System.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThis is a new installation; therefore, there is no accident history.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe facility has an Emergency Action Plan (plan) in effect.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \n\n\u00bf\tsave lives;\n\u00bf\tminimize and avoid injuries;\n\u00bf\tprotect the environment; and\n\u00bf\tminimize property damage.\n\nALDI  maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility. The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated periodically. \n\nALDI personnel circulate throughout the plant, taking note of unusual conditions in any portion of the system.

As stated on the company's website, At ALDI, we do everything possible from our carts to checkout to energy-saving stores to give you incredibly high quality at impossibly low prices.\n\nALDI management is not only committed to offer superior service, but to also maintain a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  ALDI's safety and environmental policies are administered by the Director of Warehouse. Periodic inspections of the facility are conducted by the facility's Director of Warehouse to ensure compliance, and oversees the entire safety and environmental programs.    These programs include forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturer's documentation, Emergency Action Plan, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe ALDI facility is located at 12661 ALDI Place, Moreno Valley, immediately south of Interstate 60 and approximately twelve miles east of Interstate 215. The area immediately surrounding the facility is urban with a mixture of light commercial and industrial areas. The facility was originally constructed in 2015. The ammonia refrigeration system was brought on line in 2015. \n\nThe primary business of ALDI is to provide storage and distribution of frozen food products, and produce. In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains a refrigeration system containing approximately 25,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance.  The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrige"
