Employees are trained to understand the risks and hazards involved in operations and to actively contribute to procedures and methods for managing and controlling these risks.  Employees who are involved in job assignments in processes where hazardous materials are handled receive the most rigorous training, however; employees who can or will provide support are also trained and contribute to the risk management program.\r\nPolicies at Resource Innovations are supported by written procedures and provide the basis for training operations in conjunction with supplementary data and materials.  Programs currently in place include Process Safety Management, Hazard Communication, Hot Work Permitting, Confined Space Entry and Process Hazard Assessment.  In order that we define our manufacturing operations and detail the exact operations included for the safe production of high quality materials, every product and operation will have its own detailed Operating Procedure.  Each of these will, at least annually, be critically reviewed and modified to assure that it adequately addresses the hazards and risks involved in our operations.\r\nAt our facility in Cartersville, we will manufacture a line of specialty products that are useful as curatives for rubber and other polymers.  The final manufactured materials will be manufactured and sold both in liquid and solid forms.  Liquid forms will generally be packaged in steel or polyethylene drums and the powder variations will be packaged and shipped in valve type paper bags or drums.  The common and most critical raw material used for the production of these products is carbon disulfide, a regulated material that is listed in 40 CFR Table 1 to 68.130 (List of Regulated Toxic Substances and Threshold Quantities for Accidental Release Prevention).\r\nCarb"

For our process, we will limit the total quantity on site to a maximum of 48,400 pounds.  The storage vessel is of a special closed design such that no normal emissions are planned or foreseen.  The tank itself will be blanketed with inert nitrogen and is enclosed in its own concrete dike to contain any leakage or spills.  In the design phase of planning for the tank, PPG Industries, one of the suppliers of carbon disulfide, provided safety and handling, as well as system design information for the system.  PPG has also visited our site and made specific recommendations for changes that were made well before the introduction of carbon disulfide into the system.  Representatives of PPG will also be on site for inspection prior to the unloading of the first tank truck as well as during the unloading of the truck.\r\nIn our assessment of the hazards posed to our community by the presence of carbon disulfide at our facility, we considered both a worst-case and an alternate case scenario.  In determining the worst-case scenario, several scenarios were considered and based on results of modeling done using RMP *Comp, Version 1.07, modeling software developed by the US EPAs Office of Chemical Emergency Preparedness and Prevention, NOAA's Hazardous Materials Response Division in conjunction with the Bureau of Census, US Department of Commerce.  Considering a failure of the tank or a fitting at a time when the maximum quantity of material was present under the atmospheric conditions required by 40 CFR 68.22, a total of 48,400 pounds would escape at a rate of 23.3 pounds per minute for a period of 2,080 minutes or 34 hours and 40 minutes.  Using this data, RMP *Comp calculated the Estimated Distance to the Toxic Endpoint to be 1.0 miles.  The area within the 1.0 mile radius was plotted using Marplot (also available from the US EPA) to determine the"

According to the estimation, there are 378 housing units with a total population of 990 people in census block points located within or touching the circle defined by the radius of the Toxic Endpoint.\r\nThe alternate release scenario was calculated similarly to the worst-case scenario but considering that a leak occurred but was limited by corrective measures (i.e., a leak occurred at a flange or fitting that could be isolated or tightened).  In this scenario 1,400 pounds escaped at a maximum rate of 23.3 pounds per minute.  The Estimated Distance to the Toxic Endpoint was calculated using RMP* Comp resulting in a radius of 0.2 miles.  Again this area was plotted to determine the risks posed to the community.\r\nThe population within this radius was also estimated as in the Worst Case scenario.  The population that would potentially be exposed in a release of this nature would be 0 housing units with a total population of 0 people.\r\nSeveral design considerations were included in the construction of the tank for storage of carbon disulfide.  The tank is surrounded by a concrete dike of a size sufficient to contain the maximum inventory at its highest level.  All piping is routed over diked areas in case of leakage.  The tank is sprinkled such that if a leak occurs, water could be used to provide a layer on top of the carbon disulfide liquid serving to limit evaporation considerably.  The pump used for unloading tank trucks delivering carbon disulfide uses a double mechanical seal, pressurized with nitrogen to eliminate leakage.  The level, temperature, and pressure of the tank are continuously monitored.  Electronic level indicators are redundant and all instruments are backed up using non-electronic instruments.  The electronic instruments are powered by an"

Tank trucks delivering carbon disulfide will be electrically bonded to the grounding system and the bonding and grounding will be confirmed by instrumentation for that purpose.  All electrical equipment in the processing areas is classified as Class 1, Division 1, and Explosion Proof.\r\nResource Innovations complies with the OSHA Process Safety Management rules and regulations as well as the EPA rules and regulations for Chemical Accident Prevention.  Routine inspection and testing of equipment and systems is augmented by regular review of work safety practices, operating procedures, and refresher training.\r\nSince the Cartersville operation is new, there is no history of accidents, however; any incident will be investigated thoroughly in order to remove risks and hazards to the extent possible.\r\nThe Emergency Response Plan at Resource Innovations has been developed in conjunction with the Bartow County Emergency Management Authority (BCEMA).  Prior to start-up of the facility, exercises will be conducted with members of the BCEMA and representatives from the area responders including the City of Cartersville Fire Department, Police and Bartow County Sheriffs Office.  Employees have been trained to respond to emergency situations including reporting emergencies and evacuation procedures.  The alarm system used consists of a central alarm system that can be activated automatically or manually.  Local receptors have been identified and provisions have been made for notification in the event of an emergency.\r\nOverall risk management at the Cartersville facility will be proactive and ongoing.  As with any new facility, as many details as possible have been incorporated into the design and construction of the facility.
