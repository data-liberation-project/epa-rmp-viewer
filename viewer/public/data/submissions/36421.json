The Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Lake Charles Facility\n\nIt is the policy of the Lyondell Lake Charles facility to operate in a safe manner, with minimum risk to all workers and visitors and to the surrounding community.  While every effort is made to operate the facility safely, it is recognized that accidents can happen.  In order to provide for a coordinated, effective, and timely response to emergency incidents, the Lake Charles facility has developed and implemented the Lake Charles Plant Emergency Plan.\n\n The Lake Charles facility has implemented a program to consolidate and streamline the Compliance Audit requirements as defined in OSHA's Process Safety Management Program (29 CFR 1910.119(o) and the Risk Management Program, 40 CFR 68.79 for various regulated on-site process units.  The consolidation of Compliance Audit Programs is based on minimizing duplication, redundancy, and inconsistency attributed from overlapping state and federal programs. The Lyondell-Lake Charles facility will demonstrate compliance with the two audit programs on an 'overall most stringent compliance audit program' approach.   The 'most stringent overall program' for the regulated process units on-site is defined in the provisions defined in 29 CFR 1910.119(o) - OSHA's Process Safety Management Compliance Audit provisions.\n\n \nII. Lake Charles Facility and the Regulated Substance Handled\n\nThe Lake Charles Plant is a 235-acre site located to the south west of Westlake, and to the west of Lake Charles, Louisiana.

Established in 1991and adopted at the Lake Charles facility in 1997 after the purchase from Olin, Operational Excellence includes standards that cover specific areas of chemical manufacturing including safety and environmental performance, product quality, manufacturing reliability, and efficiency. Through Operational Excellence, the Lake Charles facility has installed the processes, systems, and technology to identify problems, analyze their causes and define and implement solutions.\n\nLyondell's Operational Excellence standards complement one another, improve safety and environmental performance, while also leading to gains in efficiency and reliability. For example, by finding ways to reduce or eliminate waste from our manufacturing operations, we're able to improve raw material yields, an attractive bottom-line benefit. \n\nA major emphasis has been improving reliability and the percentage of time our plants are up and running. Besides reducing the chance for safety and environmental problems that occur during process upsets, shutdowns, and startups, improving reliability also reduces production costs. Our goal is a 99 percent reliability rate for our continuous process plants. Toward this end, we've strengthened preventive and predictive maintenance systems and have put in place resources focused on reliability at our manufacturing plants. Rigorous auditing process tracks how well our facility is meeting Operational Excellence's high standards. Audit teams composed of experts from different Lyondell facilities and the corporate auditing group examines performance and documentation to make sure our standards are met. \n\nProcess Safety:\n\nProcess safety at the Lyondell - Lake Charles facility includes strong inspection and maintenance programs to minimize the risk of a material release or other process upset.

The PHA studies all factors that contribute to a plant's safety performance -- from plant design to its employee experience -- identifies potential hazards, and verifies that systems are in place to address the hazards. In addition, risk-screening studies at each of our plants have searched for hazards that have the potential to cause major accidents. Following these studies, a set of safety-critical variables were implemented for each location, covering such factors as reactor temperature, unwanted side reactions, or caustic solution flow to scrubbers which neutralize process toxic off-gases. These variables are continuously monitored to ensure that they are within a safe range.\n \nContractor Safety:\n\n Lyondell - Lake Charles contractor safety management systems require our contractors to accept the same safety responsibilities and standards that apply to our employees. We have rigorous standards for evaluating their past performance and their safety management systems before they are hired. Once selected, every contractor must go through the appropriate training program for the job. Employees also monitor the contractor's safety performance and conduct unannounced audits to check compliance with safety policies and work procedures. Contractors are also evaluated at the end of a job or on a regular basis for those on-site for longer periods.\n\nProduct Stewardship:\n\nLyondell's product stewardship effort requires commitment from people inside and outside of the Lyondell organization.

Lyondell has undertaken a worldwide campaign to educate customers, distributors, and contracted transportation companies on the safe use of this product.\n\n\nIV. The Five Year Accident History\n\nThe EPA requires that a 5-year history of certain releases be reported. A release must be from a process involving a regulated substance and have caused at least one of the following.\n\n? On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or\n? Known off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place.\n\nThe incidents listed below meet USEPA's criteria for reporting.\n\n? October 14, 1999 - A gate valve in phosgene service developed a leak as it was manually closed.  Less than one pound of phosgene was released and the operator exposed during the operation was treated for the exposure and hospitalized for observation.  The use of gate valves in lethal and toxic services was re-evalutated facility-wide.\n\n? July 11, 2003 - During a plant shut down, a pump in phosgene and monochlorobenzene service failed and released nine (9) pounds of phosgene.  The release caused the facility's fence-line phosgene monitors to alarm and as a resulted we recommended a precautionary shelter-in-place for the downwind community.  There were no injuries or illnesses reported on or off-site.  As a result of this incident, the operation of this type of pump in shutdown conditions has been modified.\n\n \nV.

The act was signed into law October 17, 1986, as key legislation to help communities protect public health, safety, and the environment from chemical hazards. To implement this Act, Congress required each state to create a State Emergency Response Commission (SERC). The SERCs were required to divide their states into Emergency Planning Districts and name a Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) for each district.\n\nThe Calcasieu Parish Local Emergency Planning Committee was started in 1988. It was made up of mayors, public health officials, government, media representatives, environmentalists, and industry and union representatives. The Calcasieu Parish LEPC is the focal point for community emergency-response planning, evacuation studies, hazardous material transportation studies and public awareness campaigns, and has the responsibility to collect, manage and provide public access to information on hazardous substances within Calcasieu Parish. The Calcasieu Parish LEPC has been recognized for community emergency planning by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nCommunity Awareness Emergency Response (CAER) - The CAER organization is a voluntary group of industrial safety representatives and municipal emergency responders.
