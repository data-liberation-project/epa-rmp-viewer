The facility is in the Vineland Industrial Park adjacent to New Jersey Route 55 at Exit 35, on the north side of Vineland.  The only chemical of concern for off-site consequences is ammonia.  The ammonia, in both liquid and gaseous form,  will be the in the freezer/refrigeration system.  It is the policy of Bridor USA, Inc to operate the system in the safest possible manner.\n\nThe facilty was built by Pastridor USA as a replica of a facilty in Europe.  Pastridor had built three other facilities all with excellent safety records.  The best of the European and American practices have been used to construct this facility.  This facility has been operating for over one year and has had an excellent safety record.  In accordance with the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (29 CFR 1910.119), Environmental Protection Agency (40 CFR 68) and New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJAC 7:31) Regulations this facility has prepared a Process Safety Management Program, as well as performing air dispersion modeling and off-site consequence analysis.\n\nRecognizing the limitations imposed by low staffing levels at a highly automated facility, Bridor has adopted a three level response system based upon the level of release.  The three levels are Maintenance, Moderate, and Major.  The maintenance staff will function in a proactive manner to prevent releases, but react to control and end larger accidental releases consistant with their training and equipment.\n\nAll employees will be trained in the hazards of ammonia and their actions in the unlikely event of a release.  Personnel not having a maintenance function will be internally evacuated to a safe haven within the building until the situation is declared safe.  In the event of an accidental release to the outside of the building all staff will remain inside.  The maintneance"
