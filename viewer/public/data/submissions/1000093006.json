The same properties that make propane valuable as a fuel also make it necessary to practice certain safety\n\nprecautions in handling to prevent leaks, spills and accidents. First and foremost in our operations are the efforts undertaken to\n\nensure employee and contractor safety while on site as well as minimize the risk exposure for the surrounding communities. It is\n\nour company policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations.\n\n\n\nAs a corporation, AmeriGas staffs a professional Safety Department at our Corporate Headquarters in King of Prussia,\n\nPennsylvania. AmeriGas also has seven Regional Logistics Managers, a Terminal Operations Manager, a Safety and Technology\n\nManager and a Supply and Logistics Safety Manager strategically located throughout the United States. These safety professionals\n\nare able to immediately respond to a serious incident and provide technical expertise to emergency response agencies as needed\n\nat the scene of the incident. AmeriGas also maintains an around the clock Emergency Communications Center, which handles all\n\nafter-hours and emergency calls from around the country. Located in Rocklin, California, the ECC has the ability to contact\n\nAmeriGas field personnel as well as Chemtrec on any type of incident encountered at any AmeriGas location or by AmeriGas\n\ncustomers.\n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of the facility is to store and distribute propane to retail and wholesale customers. Propane is received via\n\nrailcar or transport truck and distributed to customers via transport truck. The facility is equipped to unload railcars and load or\n\nunload transport trucks as needed. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, management personnel and\n\ncontractors.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Polici"

Primary elements of this continuous improvement effort include making capital improvements to the facility\n\nas required, maintaining up to date procedures and continual training of personnel in both regulatory and job specific subject matter.\n\nThe integrity and reliability of major equipment, including pumps, compressors, pipelines and storage tanks is assured through\n\nperiodic inspection and preventive maintenance practices. The chemicals handled do not present significant internal corrosion\n\nhazards and corrosion to external surfaces of pipelines and storage tanks is minimized via inspection and painting programs.\n\nAs important as those previously mentioned items are, shutdown systems are also installed on site. Shutdown systems include\n\nremotely controlled, positive shutoff valves designed to shutdown affected equipment and isolate a problem once detected.\n\nPortable fire extinguishers are also available on site for employee use.\n\n\n\nThis distribution and storage facility is subject to and abides by OSHAA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) rule for sites\n\nhandling hazardous chemicals. In addition, the site complies with EPAA?s Accidental Release Prevention Rule and all other\n\napplicable federal, state and local codes and regulations.\n\n\n\nAll of our AmeriGas transport drivers have been thoroughly trained in the terminalA?s loading and Emergency Action Plan\n\nprocedures and many have also been trained using the National Propane Gas AssociationA?s (NPGA) Certified Employee Training\n\nProgram (CETP).\n\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario \n\n\n\nWorst case Scenario is based on one 30,000 gallon tank losing total maximum capacity 108,120 lbs (85%).
