      "SummaryText": "The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source [40 CFR 68.155(a)]:\nThe facility is committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our accidental release prevention program that encompasses design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training. Engineering controls are in place to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. This site is a non-responding facility for releases of the RMP-listed chemicals, so the site utilizes an Emergency Action Plan.\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\nThe Dominion Energy Orange Facility (DE Orange Propane) is a propane storage and distribution facility. Propane is transported to the site via tanker trucks and is unloaded into a large propane storage tank.  Propane from the storage tank is unloaded into smaller tanker trucks and transported offsite for distribution.  Due to the presence of propane, the potential exists for flammable mixtures to be present at the site in quantities above Risk Management Program (RMP) threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds. There are no regulated toxic chemicals stored on site above PSM/RMP threshold quantities. There are no RMP-regulated toxic chemicals stored above threshold quantities on site.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps [40 CFR 68.155(c)]:\nThe facility has a program in place to comply with the provisions of the accidental release prevention regulations under 40 CFR Part 68. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the existing release prevention program.\n\nProcess Safety Information [40 CFR Part 68.65]\nThe facility maintains a record of process safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis [40 CFR Part 68.67]\nAnalyses ensure that hazards associated with our proce"

The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of at least 5 years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nWritten Operating Procedures [40 CFR Part 68.69]\nTo ensure safe operations, the facility maintains detailed written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations and normal shutdown. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nEmployee Training [40 CFR Part 68.71]\nThe facility has a training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating plant processes are competent in the applicable operating procedures. Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity [40 CFR Part 68.73]\nThe facility carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Inspected process equipment includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, pressure relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change [MOC] [40 CFR Part 68.75]\nWritten procedures are in place at the site to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures. Facility operators or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered tra"

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits [40 CFR Part 68.79]\nThe facility conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the US EPA RMP and OSHA PSM regulations are being implemented. These audits are conducted at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation [40 CFR Part 68.81]\nThe facility promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum period of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation [40 CFR Part 68.83]\nThe facility believes that Process Safety Management and accident prevention is a team effort. Employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP and PSM rules, including information resulting from Process Hazard Analyses in particular.\n\nHot Work Permit [40 CFR Part 68.85]\nThe facility has a hot work program that requires issuance of a hot work permit for hot work operations conducted on or near the covered process. \n\nContractor Safety Program [40 CFR Part 68.87] \nThe facility occasionally hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.

The site has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards associated with the contractor's work and the corresponding processes. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response in the event of an accidental release of a regulated substance.\n\nThe five-year accident history [40 CFR 68.155(d)]:\nThe facility is a new process and has therefore had no accidents.\n\nThe emergency response program [40 CFR 68.155(e)]:\nIn the event of an incident, the facility has systems in place to respond quickly. Processes can be shut down on an emergency basis and the facility has a plan in place for evacuations, adequate first aid, and medical treatment and notification of local emergency response agencies. The facility is a non-responding facility and relies on Orange County Fire & EMS to respond to chemical releases.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety [40 CFR 68.155(f)]:\nSince the site is a new process, it is continually ensuring the implementation of the prevention program, including the closure of the most recent PHA recommendations.\n\nThe facility has completed this report to provide the public with information about our activities at this facility.  We believe that, due to the many controls instituted to maintain a safe operation and our commitment to continuous improvement, an incident affecting our employees or the surrounding area is unlikely to occur."
