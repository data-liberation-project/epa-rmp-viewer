There are two (2) 30,000 gallon propane tanks, one (1) 30,000 gallon propylene tank, one (1) 6,000 gallon propylene tank, and a maximum of two (2) 30,000 gallon propylene rail cars located on-site. Propane and propylene are listed as flammable substances under the Risk Management Plan regulations found at 40 CFR 68 and are managed as a Program Level 3 facility.  The storage quantities of propane is in excess of the threshold quantity of 10,0000 pounds.  \n\n\n\nWorthington manufactures small, flammable-gas filled, steel canisters.  The canisters are normally utilized as propylene or propane gas-operated, homeowner torches.  Bulk delivery, of the gases, occurs by either commercial truck or tanker rail car. The gases are transferred to bulk storage prior to the manufacturing bottle filling process.  Packaged bulk storage (after bottling, before shipping) occurs within an on-site warehouse.  \n\n\n\nIt is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling propane to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to the personal health of Worthington employees as well as to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is Worthington's policy to adhere to applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Worthington handles propane and propylene in a safe manner utilizing;\n\n1.  Facility design,\n\n2.  Safety equipment and devices,\n\n3.  Safe handling procedures, and\n\n4.  Personnel training.\n\n\n\nIn the previous five years, there have been no propane or propylene releases that have resulted in any on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damabe; or that resulted in any offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evaculations, or shelterings in place. \n\n\n\nAn Emergency Response Plan (ECP) has been developed for this facility.  The plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and "
