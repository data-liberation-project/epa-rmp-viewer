      "SummaryText": "1.  Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nAmmonia is one of the most prevalent extremely hazardous substances.  Ammonia is one of the ten hazardous chemicals most commonly involved in a release. To prevent and mitigate an ammonia release and to improve facility safety, and benefit the community and the environment, Sierra Cold Storage has developed policies and programs to prevent accidental release.  They include management commitment to safety, risk management plans, standard operating procedures, safety programs, preventative maintenance programs, contractor safety, and training. The most common causes of an ammonia release are related to Operations and Maintenance failures, Equipment Failures and/or Process Failures; consequently, Sierra Cold Storage has emphasized preventative maintenance, scheduling of replacement of parts, such as valves and gaskets, and training of maintenance employees in safe operations.\n\nAll employees have been trained on relevant response procedures.  There are written procedures for the use, inspection, maintenance and testing of emergency response equipment.  The plan also includes evacuation routes, protective actions for uninvolved employees, a method of accounting for employees, and a list of personal protective equipment for response and mitigation equipment. The Emergency Action Plan also includes a procedure for informing the public and emergency response agencies in case of a release.   \n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n\nThe Sierra Cold Storage is located at 424 North 7th Street, Sacramento, CA 95814. Ammonia is used as a refrigerant at the Warehouse facility. The Refrigeration process requires 36,000 lb. ammonia in the system. Anhydrous ammonia is contained within refrigeration piping and equipment associated with flash freezing and cold storage.\n         \nThe regulated substance handled at this distribution facility is ammonia.  There is approximately 38,000 lbs. of ammon"

Ammonia is considered an Acutely Hazardous Material and the amount maintained on site by Sierra Cold Storage exceeds the Threshold Planning Quantity (TPQ) of 10000 lbs. \n\n3.The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\n Worst-Case Scenario - The worst case scenario selected at the Hazard and Operability Study for Sierra Cold Storage, is a release of liquid ammonia from the main receiver in the engine room.  This receiver has a maximum capacity of  711 gallons of liquid ammonia.  In addition, the release would also include a 0.73 gallon release from a two-foot section of three inch pipe. Therefore, the total release of anhydrous ammonia for the Worst Case scenario is 711.7 gallons of liquid anhydrous ammonia. The distance to the endpoint of 200 ppm ERPG-2 Type for the worst-case scenario is 0.99 miles. The release would extend beyond the property boundary.\n\nAlternative Scenario -Alternate release scenario selected involves a 0.5 inch diameter liquid ammonia line being severed in a cold storage room due to a forklift accident.  The resulting release of liquid ammonia from the line and associated accumulator was determined to be 368 pounds.  The duration of the release, determined through computer dispersion modeling, was for five minutes.The distance to the endpoint at 200 ppm (ERPG-2) is 0.21 miles. This release would extend beyond the facility boundary. All employees have been trained on relevant response procedures.  There are written procedures for the use, inspection, maintenance and testing of emergency response equipment.

All maintenance employees will be trained in ammonia refrigeration systems.  Sierra Cold Storage has developed a prevention program that includes safety information, a Hazard and Operability Study, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits and incident investigations.\n\n5.Five-year accidental history.\n\nThere has  been no accidents involving Ammonia during the last 5 years at this facility.\n\n6.The emergency response program.\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan has been developed and implemented for the purpose of protecting public health and the environment.  The written plan is available for review in the administrative offices of  Sierra Cold Storage.  The plan complies with local, state and federal regulations and includes evacuation routes and protective actions for employees not directly involved in emergency response, reporting procedures in case of an accidental release, documentation of proper first-aid and emergency medical treatment and procedures, and measures for emergency response.  Other elements include procedures for the use of emergency response equipment and for its inspection, testing and maintenance, employee training, and procedures to update changes and inform employees of changes or modifications. Reference the RMPP, Appendix F for Emergency Response Procedures. Reference Appendix L, Compliance Audit and Checklist for the Emergency Response Plan Elements of the PSM manual.\n\nThis emergency response program was established in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.38(a) and includes procedures for handling small releases. \n\n\n7.Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nThis facility will be conducting an independent audit by Eco-Safe Technologies in May, 1999 to ensure that all elements of the program are being met as required and documented."
