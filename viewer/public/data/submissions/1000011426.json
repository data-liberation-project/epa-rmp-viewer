It is our policy to adhere to applicable Federal, State, and local regulations. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately notify the Gretna Fire Department (via 911 call) and request that it respond to the emergency. Incidental to the notification to the fire department, a call to the Sarpy County, Nebraska Emergency Management Agency and the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality will be made. If there is a reportable quantity (RQ) release a call will also be made to the National Emergency Response Center.\n\nWhile we have planned for an emergency it is acknowledged that a real emergency will be unexpected and may very well be much different and cannot be ensured to duplicate what may have been planned. In reality the situation that develops may not happen in the manner in which it was planned. In that event what may have been planned will serve only as a guideline to follow.\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility describes certain procedures that are intended to minimize hazards associated with human health and the environment from fires, explosions, the sudden and unexpected release of chemicals (i.e., anhydrous ammonia), tornadoes, bomb threats, or other accident or acts of God which might occur on our premises.\n\nThe primary emergency coordinator for Gretna Farmers Union Co-op Association is DarylPost, assistnat manager.

The anhydrous ammonia that is stored at this facility is distributed to agricultural producers in the surrounding area who utilize the anhydrous ammonia for crop nutrient purposes.\n\nThe system consists of two (2) storage tanks with associated piping, valves, liquid pump, and other miscellaneous equipment. From time-to-time throughout the year numerous portable nurse tanks may also be present at the site. The anhydrous ammonia plant is only operated on a seasonal basis (Spring and Fall). Full-time equivalent employee numbers were computed on this basis. At a maximum, the plant operates a total of three months (1/4 of the year). The FTEs for this company location is one (1).\n\nTHE WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS:\n\nThe worst case scenario is the failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), resulting in the release of the total volume in a gaseous (hazardous ammonia vapor cloud) form. According to EPAA\u00c2\u00bfs RMP*Comp Program (Version 1.07), the distance to endpoint is 2.6 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the transport delivery vehicle pulling away from the intake lines into the storage tank without disconnecting the transfer hoses. The resulting release, according to EPAA\u00c2\u00bfs RMP*Comp Program has a distance to endpoint of 0.1 mile.\n\nThe system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shut-off valves, and remote emergency shut-off valves. The loadout risers used in filling nurse tanks are protected by breakaway couplers designed to imme"

All of the main storage tank valves are locked when not in use.\n\nSince this facility is located in relatively close proximity to Gretna provisions have been designed to notify all affected persons. An evacuation plan is in place.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\nThis facility complies with EPAA\u00c2\u00bfs accident prevention rule and applicable State and local codes and regulations. The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with ANSI Standard K61.1-1989 and state law.\n\nIn addition the company has specific operating procedures in place intended to minimize the potential for an accidental (and potentially catastrophic) release of anhydrous ammonia. Finally, Gretna Farmers Union Co-Op Association has extended to the Gretna Fire Department the opportunity to visit our anhydrous ammonia facilities, to participate in mock emergency simulation training, and to avail themselves of specific anhydrous ammonia health hazard information and training provided by the company.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nGretna Farmers Union Co-Op Association has never had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering-in-place. However, on or about April 10, 2006 an employee for Gretna Farmers Cooperative Union Association was involved in a traffic accident while transporting a portable anhydrous ammonia nurse tank. As a result of another individual failing to yield at an intersection STOP sign, approximately 3,880 pounds of anhydrous ammonia were released to the atmosphere. It was alledged that emergency responders were unaware of the hazardous chemical release and were, therefore, at risk of exposure. To the knowledge of Farmers Cooperative Union Association there were no injuries resulting from the alledged exposure to anhydrous ammonia. This incident is included"

      "SummaryText": "in the Executive Summary for reference only and does not appear to met the criteria for \"an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage.\"\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving anhydrous ammonia, it is the policy of Gretna Farmers Union Co-Op Association to immediately notify the Gretna Fire Department and the Sarpy County Emergency Management  Agency to request that they respond to the emergency. In the unlikely event that the Gretna Fire Department is unable to adequately respond to the emergency, the fire department(s) with whom Gretna Fire Department has mutual aid agreements will be summoned. We have discussed this policy with the fire department and the Sarpy County Emergency Management Agency. Members of the fire department and EMA have inspected our anhydrous ammonia plant. In addition, copies of photographs taken of our plant have been provided (for reference) to those entities.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nThe plan is to minimize those hazards to human health and to the environment that are associated with accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. Employees working at the bulk storage plant make routine observations prior to and during transfer operations of the anhydrous ammonia from the storage vessel to the nurse tanks. In so doing they are able to detect problems that are readily visible and easily identifiable before they arise.
