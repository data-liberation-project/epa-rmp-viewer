Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nPD Glycol is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at PD Glycol.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  The Plant's Emergency Response Team is reinforced with Personnel from the Beaumont Fire Department if needed.  We are also coordinated with The Sabine Neches Chiefs Association Mutual Aid which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled.\nPD Glycol's primary activities encompass ethylene oxide which is converted into ethylene glycol.  We manufacture or utilize four (4) regulated substances at PD Glycol; ethylene oxide, ethylene, chlorine, and methane.\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps.\nPD Glycol has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, (1967 Edition).  Two processes at PD Glycol are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the rellease prevention program in place at PD Glycol.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nPD Glycol maintains a record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.  This information is readily available to all em"

The methodology used to carry out these analysis is referred to as a unit PHA.  A complete, in-depth process hazard analysis is completed every five years by qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations as specified by OSHA's PSM standard.  Any finding related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting operations activities, PD Glycol maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\nTraining\nPD Glycol has a training program in place to ensure that employees that are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided at lease every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Intregrity\nPD Glycol carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipmet to ensure proper functions.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance is carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at PD"

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at PD Glycol.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nPD Glycol conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at lease every 3 years and corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nPD Glycol investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in, an employee injury or a catastropic release of a hazardous material.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  Investigation reports are retained for aminimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nPD Glycol believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.   All employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.

Contractors are also informed of the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n4.

During this time period there have been no incidents that meet the reporting criteria under this program.\n\n5. Emergency Response\nPD Glycol carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes many aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public.  Our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified with the Jefferson County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.
