This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.  We also work closely with our public emergency responders providing them with training and equipment so that they can respond safely and efficiently to emergencies that might occur at our facility.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Brookeland Gas Plant, located approximately 9.5 miles North of Jasper, TX; East of Hwy 96 on RR255, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane, condensate) from oil and gas wells.  The Brookeland Gas Plant handles methane, ethane, propane and butane, which are regulated flammables.  It processes approximately 50 million cubic feet a day of raw natural gas and natural gas liquids.  The Brookeland Gas Plant does not use, process or store a reportable quantity of toxic regulated substances.\r\n\r\nHazard Assessment Results\r\n\r\nThe Worst Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable materials in processes at the gas plant is a vapor cloud (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest process vessel containing 189,542 pounds of a ethane, propane plus mix.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.50 miles.  No passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nWithin the past five years the processes have had no accidental release that caused offsite impacts provided in the risk management progra"

Because processes at the Brookeland Gas Plant that are regulated by the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nThe Brookeland Gas Plant provides for and encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the Brookeland Gas Plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the Brookeland Gas Plant and addresses each accident prevention program element.   In addition, the Brookeland Gas Plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include a safety committee to promote both process and personal safety.  The committee typically has members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, and local plant management.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe Brookeland Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.

The Brookeland Gas Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.  Pre-startup safety reviews are also used to support the quality assurance program.\r\n\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices\r\n\r\nThe Brookeland Gas Plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment tHat is being worked on, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\r\nThe Brookeland Gas Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes that affect any covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Change are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorpo"

In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nThe Brookeland Gas Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to Brookeland Gas Plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Brookeland Gas Plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Personnel from other gas plants compose the Audit Team.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Brookeland Gas Plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are traced until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\r\n\r\nSummary of Process Hazards, Safety Features, and Hazard Analysis Findings\r\n\r\nTh"

The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination procedures.  In addition the Brookeland Gas Plant has procedures that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated as necessary.   Any significant changes to the emergency response program are administered through the management of change (MOC) process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response program for the Brookeland Gas Plant is coordinated with the Jasper Fire Department.  This coordination includes periodic meetings with the Jasper Fire Department, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The gas plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic meetings, the gas plant conducts periodic emergency drills that involve emergency response organizations.  The Brookeland Gas Plant provides training and equipment to local emergency responders so that they are familiar with any unique hazards that they may encounter when responding to emergencies at our facilities.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nAlthough Brookeland Gas Plant management does not believe additional safety measures are necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accident releases, it does resolve all findings from the Process Hazards Analysis and the Compliance Audits.
