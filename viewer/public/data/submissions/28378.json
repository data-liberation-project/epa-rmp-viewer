Among the products we supply you will find anhydrous ammonia.  The anhydrous ammonia is used as a fertilizer for efficiently growing quality corn crops.\nThe U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) considers this product \u00bfhazardous\u00bf and requires us to develop a risk management plan to deal with possible releases.  The nature of the product requires us to handle it with respect.  Our goal is to provide this valuable product as safely as possible.  In our plan we outline ways to protect the health and property of our surrounding neighbors.  We all share the air, water, and soil around us, and we strive to do our part to protect the environment by responsible use of our products. \nAs a guide to safely handling the product we rely on a number of sources.  Primarily, we follow the federal, state and local regulations governing the storage and delivery of the product.  However, we also stress a strong safety training program and close supervision of employees handling the product.  We also use information on equipment and training from trade associations and vendors.  Lastly, our insurance companies are exposed to the real life accident experience.  Through their loss control specialists they forward the lessons they learned to us.  \n\tThe data plate on the largest ammonia tank for the Readfield facility shows a maximum  of 30,000 gallons capacity.  However, the tank is only filled to a maximum of 85 %.  This tank is located outside and is subject to weather conditions.  Therefore, by rule, the tank is never filled to capacity.  \n\tAlso, this tank only serves as a storage tank to fill small nurse tanks for delivery to area farms..  Often the ammonia storage tank is drawn down to less than 50% capacity during the fertilizer application season.  In \u00bfoff season\u00bf times the tanks is usually drawn down"

According to EPA guidelines we developed two scenarios for the tank.  One was a \u00bfworse case\u00bf analysis which was determined not by actual events but by EPA definition.  In this scenario the entire contents of a full tank would be released over a ten minute period.  The alternative scenario analysis is more realistic.  However, the scenario must still meet EPA definitions. \n\tOur worse case scenario analysis was calculated from EPA formulas in their RMP Comp. software and showed an endpoint of 2  miles.  This calculation means that everyone with in that distance from our storage tank could possibly be exposed to ammonia at the endpoint concentration.  The endpoint concentration is the maximum airborne concentration for which a person can be exposed for up to one hour without serious adverse health effects.  All persons within this area should be able to take protective actions without impairment.  Protective measures include remaining indoors with all doors and windows closed.  Ammonia is a colorless gas with a very pungent odor whose chemical composition allows it to rise because it is lighter than air.  Based on data from the 2000 United States census, 758 people may live with in the above mentions area.  \n\tThe alternative case scenario again is defined by EPA guidelines that maximize the endpoint concentration distance.  Our alternative scenario involves a break in the piping or hose connections.  Again using EPA calculations, the endpoint concentration is two tenths of a mile.  Data from the 2000 U.S. Census indicates there are 3  people within the area.  \n\tLarsen Cooperative Co. prides itself in a strong safety record and has no reportable records of an ammonia release since the system was installed.

Refresher training takes place before every ammonia application season.  \n\tOur system is inspected regularly for defects and is maintained by professionals who install and repair the equipment.  \n\tIn summary ammonia is an efficient farm fertilizer that provides many agronomic advantages over other forms of nitrogen fertilizer.  Often ammonia is the best choice for farmers trying to grow quality corn efficiently.  The product immediately attaches to soil particles and provides mineral nutrition for farm crops.\n\tOur employees often live in the vicinity of our plant and care about the safety of their neighbors.  We do our best to protect our customers our neighbors and ourselves when working with this product."
