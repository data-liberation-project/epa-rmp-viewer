This Plan is shared with local emergency responders who have access to UNIVAR  facility personnel (and up-to-date phone numbers). UNIVAR responds to minor incidents but will call in professional emergency responders in the event of all other incidents.\n\nUNIVAR invites and encourages local emergency responders such as the fire department to visit and familiarize themselves with UNIVAR products and facilities.  Joint emergency exercises are conducted when possible.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Chemical Repackaging,Storage & Distribution.  We have three RMP regulated substances present above the TPQ at our facility.  The substances are Sulfur Dioxide and Chlorine and Ethylenediamine. Listed below is the way the RMP regulated substance is stored/handled on site and the maximum inventory present at any one time.\n\n1. Chlorine is received in 180000 pound tank cars which is used to make Sodium Hypochlorite. Chlorine is also received in 2000 and 150 pound cylinders which are stored at the Suffolk facility for distribution to end use customers. The estimated maximum inventory of Chlorine onsite at any one time will be 1,965000 pounds.\n\n2.
