      "SummaryText": "1.0 Burley Facility Risk Management Plan:  Executive Summary\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nThe Burley Facility (Facility) has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility's processes.  The Tessenderlo Kerley, Inc. (TKI)  policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nTKI owns and operates a facility located in Burley, Idaho.  The facility produces sodium methyldithiocarbamate (metam sodium) solution, a soil fumigant. \r\n\r\nThe Facility was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Based on process knowledge, TKI identified one listed flammable substance (methylamine) and one toxic regulated substance (carbon disulfide) kept on site above the threshold quantities.  \r\n\r\nMethylamine  is stored in pressurized horizontal steel tanks.  The tanks contain pressure relief valves, but no vents to the atmosphere.  Carbon disulfide is stored in pressurized horizontal steel tanks.  The tanks are located in concrete containment equiped with a water deluge system.  Pressure relief valves protect  the tanks.  In the event of a tank rupture, the carbon disulfide, which is heavier than water, would sink to the bottom of the containment and would be covered with water.  The carbon disulfide could then be recovered back into a tank.\r\n\r\nThe Facility is subject to OSHA PSM.  Therefore, the Burley Facility contains a Program 3 process under the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) program.  The facility has been awarded Star status under the OSHA VPP program.\r\n\r\nRESPONSIBILITIES"

The appropriate frequency of training is to be based on management in consultation with the employees involved in operating the particular process.  All of this training is documented for each operator including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe Burley Facility uses contractors during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, there are to be procedures in place to ensure that contractors do as follows: \r\n\r\n1. perform their work in a safe manner;\r\n2. have appropriate knowledge and skills;\r\n3. are aware of the hazards of their workplace;\r\n4. understand what they should do in the event of an emergency;\r\n5. understand and follow site specific safety rules;\r\n6. inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work period.\r\n\r\nThis is accomplished by providing contractors with an orientation session that covers the following:\r\n\r\n1. a process overview;\r\n2. information about safety and health hazards including known or potential fire,   explosion, or toxic release hazards;\r\n3. emergency response plan requirements; \r\n4. safe work practices must be developed and implemented regarding control of entrance, presence and exit of contract personnel prior to beginning their  work.\r\n\r\nIn addition, contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor are evaluated.  Contract employee injury and illness log should be maintained.  Plant personnel periodically monitor contract performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Safety Review (PSSR)\r\n\r\nA PSSR should be conducted on any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.

The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  PHA team members include the process/project engineer responsible for the process/project; plant manager or knowledgeable plant person; person knowledgeable in methods of hazard analysis; and others with particular expertise (operators).  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk matrix assigned by the PHA team.  The matrix is based on severity (criticality) and probability (frequency).  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the PHA team periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The recommended order of analysis will be based upon the following criteria: \r\n\r\n1. age of process; \r\n2. extent of process hazards; \r\n3. number of affected employees; and \r\n4. operating history of the process.  \r\n\r\nThe results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.
