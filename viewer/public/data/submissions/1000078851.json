This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility's processes.  The Tessenderlo Kerley, Inc. (TKI)  policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nTKI owns and operates a facility located in Burley, Idaho.  The facility produces sodium methyldithiocarbamate (metam sodium) solution, a soil fumigant. \n\n\n\nThe Facility was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Based on process knowledge, TKI identified one listed flammable substance (methylamine) and one toxic regulated substance (carbon disulfide) kept on site above the threshold quantities.  \n\n\n\nMethylamine  is stored in pressurized horizontal steel tanks.  The tanks contain pressure relief valves, but no vents to the atmosphere.  Carbon disulfide is stored in pressurized horizontal steel tanks.  The tanks are located in concrete containment equiped with a water deluge system.  Pressure relief valves protect  the tanks.  In the event of a tank rupture, the carbon disulfide, which is heavier than water, would sink to the bottom of the containment and would be covered with water.  The carbon disulfide could then be recovered back into a tank.\n\n\n\nThe Facility is subject to OSHA PSM.  Therefore, the Burley Facility contains a Program 3 process under the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) program.  The facility has been awarded Star status under the OSHA VPP program.\n\n\n\nRESPONSIBILITIES\n\n\n\n"

Employee involvement will help to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are implemented.  Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues.\n\n\n\nThe Facility strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs.  These programs include regularly scheduled safety meetings, tail-gate safety meetings, Hazard Communication, Safety Suggestion Forms, \"near-miss\" reporting, and special training programs (emergency response training, first aid, etc.). \n\n\n\nThe Burley Facility actively seeks employee involvement in the development and conduct of all accident prevention activities through the appropriate existing safety programs.

The PSI will be useful to the operators; the team performing the PHA; those in charge of training; contractors; those conducting pre-startup safety reviews; and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.  Process Safety Information is to be readily available to all employees.\n\n\n\nA variety of technical documents are to be kept that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Safety Data Sheets (SDS).  \n\n\n\nNumerous technical documents are to be maintained that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nThere is a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.

The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  PHA team members include the process/project engineer responsible for the process/project; plant manager or knowledgeable plant person; person knowledgeable in methods of hazard analysis; and others with particular expertise (operators).  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk matrix assigned by the PHA team.  The matrix is based on severity (criticality) and probability (frequency).  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.

The review is to assure that the procedures reflect current operating practice, include changes from process technology changes, chemical changes, equipment changes, and changes to facilities.  The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.\n\n\n\nThe intent of the operating procedures is to provide workable, useful, and clearly written instructions for conducting operating activities.  To have effective operating procedures, the task and procedures directly and indirectly related to the covered process must be appropriate, clear, consistent, and most importantly, communicated to employees.  Operating procedures are specific instructions or details on what steps are taken or followed in completing the stated procedures.  The specific instructions include the applicable safety precautions and appropriate information on safety implications.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nIn addition to training on operating procedures, there is a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process.
