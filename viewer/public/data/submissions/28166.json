As a terminal, the facility provides a vital link in the chain of KNC inputs.  Ammonia, produced at KNC\u00bfs nitrogen manufacturing facilities and obtained elsewhere, is shipped to the Sergeant Bluff terminal where it is stored until needed by local farmers for their fields.\n\nImpact on the community\n\nKNC is a solid, reliable member of the Sergeant. Bluff community.  Its employees are committed to customer service and the facility is available to service farmers as needed throughout the year.  KNC's Sergeant Bluff employees know their customers are also their neighbors and strive to always be there if someone needs us.\n\nEmployee snapshot\n\nKNC has five full-time and one part-time employee with nearly 40 years of combined operating experience at its Sergeant Bluff terminal.  Although few in number, these employees have a large impact on the community in which they live.  They are involved in the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and in local area youth programs including financial support of the local Future Farmers of America (FFA).\n\nKNC employees recognize community involvement and volunteerism as the most effective way to improve the communities they live in.\n\nPollution Prevention Po"

By preventing pollution at the source, we strive to achieve cost savings, increase operational efficiencies, improve the quality of our products and services, maintain a safe and healthful workplace and improve the environment.\n\nRisk Management Program\n\nThis facility is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u00bfs (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.  The RMP Rule requires facilities handling threshold amounts of certain substances to develop a RMP and submit a Risk Management Plan.

The impact of these potential releases must be quantified in accordance with release criteria dictated in the rule.  The projected impact distance is determined using EPA-defined atmospheric conditions and is intended to provide a conservative estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected.  According to the EPA, the \u00bfworst-case\u00bf scenario is intended to ensure that no potential risks to public health are overlooked, but the distance to an endpoint estimated under \u00bfworst-case\u00bf should not be considered a \u00bfpublic danger zone.\u00bf Possible causes or the extreme improbability that such releases may occur are not considered.\n\nThe alternative release scenario definition is a release that is more likely to occur than the \u00bfworst-case\u00bf release; however, as with the \u00bfworst-case\u00bf, the alternative release improbability is not taken into consideration.\n\nWorst-Case Toxic Release - Ammonia\n\nAmmonia is a colorless gas with a strong pungent odor, and is one of the most widely used industrial chemicals.

Ammonia is also frequently used as a refrigerant for the storage of perishable foods.\n\nAmmonia vapors can be irritating to the nose, throat, eyes and skin.  Direct liquid contact to the skin can cause severe burns.\n\nKNC has considered potential worst-case releases from the refrigerated atmospheric storage tank, which is passively mitigated by a secondary containment dike and the bullet tank, the two largest vessels onsite.\n\nKNC\u00bfs hypothetical \u00bfworst-case\u00bf scenario involves an ammonia release from the terminal\u00bfs 30,000-gallon atmospheric storage tank.  As required by the rule, the \u00bfworst-case\u00bf release assumes that this entire quantity is released in ten minutes as a result of a catastrophic failure of the tank.  This unlikely event was modeled with a publicly available model (DEGADIS) which has been demonstrated to provide reasonable estimates of concentrations and distances associated with this type of release event.  The impact of this release scenario is predicted to extend beyond the facility boundary and impact public receptors.\n\nThis scenario, we believe, is a hypothetical \u00bfworst-case\u00bf event dictated by the rule and extremely unlikely to occur for many reasons.  In addition to the stringent design controls for this type of pressurized vessel, facility maintenance and inspection programs address the integrity of process and storage vessels, including this one, and substantially reduce the probability of such massive and unlikely failures.\n\nAlternative Toxic Release - Ammonia\n\nMore likely release events than the hypothetical \u00bfworst-case\u00bf, tend to concentrate in areas where the ammonia product is handled such as loading and other transport activities.  Generally, significantly lower quantities are involved, due to numerous shutdown safeguards present, as they are through out the terminal, and"
