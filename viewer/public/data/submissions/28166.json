The impact of these potential releases must be quantified in accordance with release criteria dictated in the rule.  The projected impact distance is determined using EPA-defined atmospheric conditions and is intended to provide a conservative estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected.  According to the EPA, the ?worst-case? scenario is intended to ensure that no potential risks to public health are overlooked, but the distance to an endpoint estimated under ?worst-case? should not be considered a ?public danger zone.? Possible causes or the extreme improbability that such releases may occur are not considered.\n\nThe alternative release scenario definition is a release that is more likely to occur than the ?worst-case? release; however, as with the ?worst-case?, the alternative release improbability is not taken into consideration.\n\nWorst-Case Toxic Release - Ammonia\n\nAmmonia is a colorless gas with a strong pungent odor, and is one of the most widely used industrial chemicals.  It is prepared industrially from natural gas, steam and air.  Some of this ammonia is used for direct injection i"

Ammonia is also frequently used as a refrigerant for the storage of perishable foods.\n\nAmmonia vapors can be irritating to the nose, throat, eyes and skin.  Direct liquid contact to the skin can cause severe burns.\n\nKNC has considered potential worst-case releases from the refrigerated atmospheric storage tank, which is passively mitigated by a secondary containment dike and the bullet tank, the two largest vessels onsite.\n\nKNC?s hypothetical ?worst-case? scenario involves an ammonia release from the terminal?s 30,000-gallon atmospheric storage tank.  As required by the rule, the ?worst-case? release assumes that this entire quantity is released in ten minutes as a result of a catastrophic failure of the tank.  This unlikely event was modeled with a publicly available model (DEGADIS) which has been demonstrated to provide reasonable estimates of concentrations and distances associated with this type of release event.  The impact of this release scenario is predicted to extend beyond the facility boundary and impact public receptors.\n\nThis scenario, we believe, is a hypothetical ?worst-case? event dictated by the rule and extremely unlikely to occur for many reasons.  In addition to the stringent design controls for this type of pressurized vessel, facility maintenance and inspection programs address the integrity of process and storage vessels, including this one, and substantially reduce the probability of such massive and unlikely failures.\n\nAlternative Toxic Release - Ammonia\n\nMore likely release events than the hypothetical ?worst-case?, tend to concentrate in areas where the ammonia product is handled such as loading and other transport activities.  Generally, significantly lower quantities are involved, due to numerous shutdown safeguards present, as they are through out the terminal, and "

The pipe is assumed to fail and release ammonia for 2.15 minutes before employee intervention stops the release.  The impact of such a release was modeled with the DEGADIS model, which shows that, under typical ambient conditions, the impact of the release would extend off-site.\n\n\nPlanned Changes for Safety Improvements\n\nSafety improvements are a continual and ongoing process at the facility, which is facilitated by the Prevention Program/PSM Program.  Formal process hazard analysis is conducted at least every five years, but review is constant through management of change procedures, operator training, incident investigation and mechanical integrity programs.  As a result, changes relevant to safety occur continuously as needs are identified through these procedures and policies."
