This commitment is a critical element of the facility's RMP/PSM Plan. It will extend not only through the initial development of the plan, but will endeavor to incorporate the practices and procedures established by this plan into the facility's normal way of conducting day-to-day business. RMAX has established a management system to oversee the development, implementation, and successful continuing implementation of its RMP/PSM Plan. The goals of this system are:\r\n\r\n- Clarify the roles and responsibilities related to process safety issues at the facility;\r\n- Avoid problems or conflicts among the various people responsible for implementing elements of the risk management plan;\r\n- Avoid confusion and allow those responsible for implementation to work together as a team;\r\n- Ensure that the program elements are integrated into an ongoing approach to identifying hazards and managing risks;\r\n- Ensure effective communication about process changes; and,\r\n- Provide full compliance to all regulatory requirements.\r\n\r\nThe overall implementation of the RMP/PSM Plan is the responsibility of the Plant Manager. Under this plan, it is his duty to ensure all elements are ultimately implemented as described. Although other employees will have key roles in the RMP/PSM Plan, the Plant Manager assumes this overall responsibility.\r\n\r\nIt is in the best interest of Sika and Sika employees to continually evaluate potential safety issues. Should any employee find any area or practice to be a potential safety hazard, let your supervisor know. Do not wait for so"

Entry to confined spaces will be permitted only after proper training has been conducted.   Our employees are not permitted to enter a bulk chemical tank. \r\nIt is also our policy to prevent chemical spills by maintaining our chemical handling equipment, chemical storage tanks, chemical transfer lines, and containment walls, in excellent condition. \r\n\r\nPolicy: In the case of a Major Chemical Spill our employees will immediately evacuate the facility. Our employees will not attempt to assist in the clean-up of a major chemical spill. In the unlikely event the containment wall fails to restrict a chemical spill, Sika certified HAZMAT technicians may be asked to place absorbent barriers in the flow path of the spilled chemical. However, Sika employees will not be asked to make contact with hazardous spilled chemicals.       \r\n \r\nFacility & Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nSika, Dallas Operations manufactures polyisocyanurate foam insulating board (foam board). The facility operates under the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code 32615 (Urethane and other foam (except polystyrene) manufacturing). The foam board produced at the facility is used in both residential and commercial construction applications. Sika produces foam board in thickness ranging from \u00bd inch to 4.5 inches.\r\n\r\nSika uses three main raw materials in the production of foam board: Methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI), Polyol, and Blowing Agent (n-Pentane).  Several catalysts and fire retardants may also be used depending upon the type of foam board being produced. MDI is considered as part A and Polyol combined with catalyst and surfactants are considered as a part B.   \r\n\r\nThe main raw materials are all liquids and are stored on-site in bulk tanks d at 12,000 gallons.

RMAX uses several different types of facers, depending upon the type of foam board being produced. Once parts A and B are combined the liquids exothermically react to form solid foam. \r\n\r\nn-Pentane (CAS No: 109-66-0) is a substance regulated by 40 CFR 68 [EPAs Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions]. Taking into account 40 CFR \u00a768.115(b)(2)(i), RMAX has determined the total quantity of n-Pentane in its foam board manufacturing process (for purposes of a threshold quantity determination) to be the total amount of the Hydrocarbon Blowing Agent present in its process at any one time. The maximum amount present in Sika's foam board manufacturing process at any one time is 66,470 pounds. This is above the threshold quantity for n-Pentane of 10,000 pounds, as established in 40 CFR \u00a768.130. Therefore, Sika has determined that the Dallas facility is subject to the requirements of 40 CFR \u00a768 for n-Pentane. \r\n\r\nSika has defined its covered process as that equipment which contains or contacts the Hydrocarbon Blowing Agent starting at the bulk storage tank loading (or fill) connection and extending up to and including the mix heads (located at the Pour Table). This determination was made based on the fact that once the Blowing Agent is mixed with the other foam components; it is no longer a liquid and is part of a solid, non-flammable product.  Thus, the blowing agent is flammable according to the definition as contained in 29 CFR \u00a71910.1200(c). As stated previously, the Sika Dallas Operation may have up to 66,470 pounds of Hydrocarbon Blowing Agent present in its process at any one time. This is above the applicability quantity for a flammable liquid of 10,000 pounds, as established in 29 CFR \u00a71910.119(a)(1)(ii). Thus, Sika has determined its Dallas, Texas facility is subject to the requirements of 29 CFR \u00a71910.119.\r\n\r\nThrough preparation"

This determination is based on the results of the worst-case release scenario for n-Pentane (the location of public receptors being within the distance to the endpoint) and the applicability of 29 CFR \u00a71910.119 to its facility. Thus Sika has complied with the requirements for preparation and submittal of a Program 3 RMP as contained in 40 CFR \u00a768.\r\n\r\nWorst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\r\n\r\nIn order to calculate the distance to the endpoint from a worst case release of Blowing Agent (n-Pentane), the EPA automated program RMP*Comp browser based version was used to perform the off site consequence analysis. The program provided a conservative estimate for the distance to an endpoint of 1.0 psi overpressure. The quantity of n-Pentane used in the worst case release scenario analysis for Sika's Dallas, Texas facility has been determined to be the amount of Blowing Agent contained in the facility's on-site bulk storage tank. In accordance with 40 CFR \u00a768.25(e), for purposes of calculating the distance to the worst case release endpoint, RMAX has assumed that the entire contents of the single largest vessel containing Blowing Agent (66,470 pounds) is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, and that 10% of the released quantity participates in the resulting explosion. \r\n\r\nSika has determined the maximum threat distance to an endpoint of 1.0 psi overpressure using RMP*Comp is 0.3 miles for a release quantity of 66,470 pounds of Blowing Agent.  Using U.S. Census Data for 2001 and an aerial map, it is estimated there is a residential population of approximately 1,209 within a 0.3 mile radius.

This possible alternative release scenario was defined as a 10-minute transfer hose release of Blowing Agent during tanker truck unloading.  Sika has determined, based on the physical properties of the Blowing Agent, that a release from a transfer hose would result in a spill of a highly volatile liquid which would have the potential to result in a Pool Fire. \r\n\r\nSika has determined the maximum threat distance to a Lower Flammability Limit endpoint of 38 milligrams per liter using RMP*Comp is 0.1 miles for a release quantity of 12,700 pounds of Blowing Agent.  Using U.S. Census Data for 2001, it is estimated there is no residential population within a 0.1 mile radius.  The affected area is 100% occupied by industrial and commercial properties.
