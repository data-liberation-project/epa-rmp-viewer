Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR ?5189\n\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR ?1910.119\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, POM Wonderful has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1 POM Wonderful, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that POM Wonderful has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\n\n\nProcess Name               | Process Chemical              | Process Quantity(lbs.)\n\nFresh Side                   Anhydrous Ammonia               46,000\n\nJuice Side                   Anhydrous Ammonia                4,400\n\n \n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses and physical property damage.\n\n\n\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.

Organized the program so that it meshes closely with general business practices\n\n3.

The facility has two ammonia refrigeration systems that provide refrigeration capacity to the following: \n\n\n\nFresh System: \n\n(8) Storage Rooms \n\n(2) Anti Rooms \n\n(16) CA Rooms \n\n(1) CA Hallway \n\n(1) Shipping Dock \n\n(1) Plate Heat Exchanger\n\n(1) Machinery Room \n\n\n\nJuice System \n\n(1) Blend Room \n\n(1) Tank Room \n\n(1) Plate Heat Exchanger \n\n(1) Shell and Tube Heat Exchanger\n\n\n\nMost refrigerated spaces are equipped with air-cooling evaporators and accumulators as required for flooded operation. The Blend and Tank rooms are equipped with DX coils.The refrigeration machinery is contained within or directly adjacent to each machinery room. \n\n \n\nThe Fresh System operates as follows: high pressure liquid from our high pressure receivers is piped through the king solenoid valve.  From there it is piped to each flooded zone of refrigeration, where it passes through a solenoid valve, an expansion valve, and into a low temperature & pressure accumulator vessel. From the accumulators, cold liquid ammonia is circulated through evaporator coils. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature & pressure gas which is returned to the accumulator vessels. The ammonia vapor is returned from the accumulator vessels through a suction return line to our main suction accumulator in the engine room.  From there, it passes through the compressors. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent"

      "SummaryText": " to our water cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquefied and returned to our high pressure receiver.  Liquid separated from the suction return gas in the main suction accumulator drains into liquid transfer vessels. Operation of a float switch activated solenoid valve raises the pressure in the liquid transfer vessels to the point the liquid can be drained into the high pressure receivers.\n\n\n\nThe Juice System operates similar to the Fresh system except the Blend and Tank room are equipped with DX coils. In these coils, high pressure ammonia liquid is piped directly to each coil where it passes through a solenoid valve, a hand expansion valve, and directly into the coil.  As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature & pressure gas which is returned directly to the main suction accumulator via the suction main.\n\n\n\nThe system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and pressure relief valves which vent to the atmosphere and diffusion tanks if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point. \n\n\n\nThere is one ammonia detector installed inside each refrigeration machinery room. Each sensor is set at the California OSHA permissible exposure limit of 25 ppm, which will activate an audible alarm. Also, each refrigerated area (e.g. CA Room, CA Hallway, Room 1, etc.) has a standalone ammonia detector that provides continuous monitoring.\n\n\n\nAn emergency control box is installed for both systems and contains three valves. The high and low side of the system each have a valve that would discharge to atmosphere or a diffusion tank. The connecting pipe between the high and low side has one equalizer valve that would equalize the system.\n\n\n\nEach ammonia refrigeration system at POM Wonderful consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping but are not connected to each other"

As such, the refrigeration systems at POM Wonderful are treated as two processes.\n\n\n\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\n1.3.1 General \n\n\n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nPOM Wonderful has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n\n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at POM Wonderful facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active logbook of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n\n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nPOM Wonderful has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\n\n\n\nPOM Wonderful's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n\n- Cal/OSHA's Emergency Action Plan - Title 8 CCR ?3220\n\n- U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Emergency Action Plans - Title 29 CFR ?1910.38\n\n- Cal/OSHA's Process Safety Management ["

Nevertheless, POM Wonderful continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\n\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved POM Wonderful's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that POM Wonderful's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\n\n\nPOM Wonderful has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documente"

It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for POM Wonderful employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program POM Wonderful will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety.\n\n"
