Executive Summary\r\n\r\nGEO Specialty Chemical's plant in Allentown, Pa., is committed to operating and maintaining processes (especially those using hazardous substances) in a safe and responsible manner.  A combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs help ensure the safety of employees, the public and the environment.  These programs comply with the requirements found in the Process Safety Management regulations (29 CFR 1910.119) and these Risk Management regulations.  They address the following elements:\r\n\t- Process safety information\r\n\t- Process hazard analysis\r\n\t- Operating procedures\r\n\t- Training\r\n\t- Contractors\r\n\t- Pre-startup safety review\r\n\t- Mechanical integrity\r\n\t- Hot work permit\r\n\t- Management of change\r\n\t- Incident investigation\r\n\t- Emergency planning and response\r\n\r\nFormaldehyde is the only chemical used onsite that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause off site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release.  Formaldehyde is used as a raw material in other processes, and what is not used internally is shipped to customers.  The formaldehyde worst case scenario assumed the complete loss of the contents of the largest formaldehyde tank over a 10 minute period.  The alternate case scenario assumed a loading line failed and it took 10 minutes to shut-off the flow.  Both of these scenarios are very conservative and there are numerous safeguards in place to prevent them from happening.  There have been no incidents involving formaldehyde in the last five years that would be considered an RMP event.\r\n\r\nThe Plant has developed and implemented an effective release prevention program. A management Team, consisting of qualified management personnel is accountable for enforcement and oversight of the elements of the release prevention program.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response to any potential incident at the plant is accomplished in accordance with the site's Emergency Response Plan.

GEO continues to upgrade its safety systems to further minimize the risk associated with accidental releases.  Some of these improvements are the result of PHA reviews, incident investigations and employee suggestions."
