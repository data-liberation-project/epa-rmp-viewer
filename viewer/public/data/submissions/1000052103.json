These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.   Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.  Our safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities.  Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.  \n\n\n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\n\n\nBHJ USA, LLC is a facility in St. Joseph, Missouri which is a pet food processing plant.  \n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is operated as a two-stage system.  On the low stage portion of the system, a low temperature accumulator operating at -40?F pumps liquid to plate freezers located in the plate freezer room.  The plate freezers are designed to maintain a -20?F "

The low-pressure ammonia vapor is sent from the plate freezers to the accumulator via a suction header.\n\nThe -40?F low temperature accumulator also pumps liquid to two freezer evaporators and two Ice Makers.  The freezer is designed to hold the room at -10 to 0?F.  The low temperature ammonia liquid flows across the evaporator coils and ice maker where it picks up heat from the product, changing the ammonia from a liquid to a vapor.  The low-pressure ammonia vapor is sent from the freezer and ice makers to the accumulator via a suction header.\n\n\n\nVapor from the low temperature accumulator is fed to low stage compressors. The compressed vapor from the low stage compressors is sent to a high temperature accumulator operating at +15?F.  The high temperature accumulator operating at +15?F pumps liquid to various cooler, dock and processing evaporators.  The high temperature ammonia liquid flows across the evaporator coil where it picks up heat from the product, changing the ammonia from a liquid to a vapor.  The low-pressure ammonia vapor is sent from the cooler, processing, and dock units to the accumulator via a suction header.\n\n\n\nVapor from the high temperature accumulator is then fed to the high stage compressors.  During the compression phase in the high stage compressors, the temperature of the ammonia vapor will rise as the pressure of the ammonia vapor is increased to approximately 150-180 psig psig. The high-pressure ammonia vapor flows from the high stage compressors to an evaporative condenser where heat is removed, turning the vapor into a high pressure liquid.  The high-pressure liquid is collected in a high-pressure receiver.  The liquid collected in the high-pressure receiver provides liquid make-up for the accumulators.\n\n\n\nThe emergency action plan at BHJ USA, LLC requires all associates"

Training shall include escape routes, notification of appropriate response agencies, instructions on activating a building fire alarm system and what should be done after evacuating a building. The evacuation alarm and emergency evacuation procedures will be tested no less than once per year. The decision of when to practice evacuating the building will rest with the Plant Manager, Melvin Smith.

The supervisor of the affected area should immediately contact the shift Maintenance personnel to determine if evacuation of the plant is the safest course of action.  If the emergency involves the release of ammonia and a decision is made to evacuate the plant, the Maintenance Department will notify the Shift Supervisor. The shift supervisor will sound an evacuation alarm, and then determine the assembly area.  The location of the assembly area will be based on the current wind direction and will be upwind of the release area and will be relayed to the Employees.  If your immediate contact options cannot be reached, dial 911.  In the event of an evacuation, all employees should proceed to the designated assembly area and await further instructions from their evacuation supervisor.  Once everyone has evacuated the facility and arrived at their designated meeting area, a head count must be conducted by the Shift Supervisor to account for missing people, including visitors and/or contractors in his/her area. \n\nMaintenance empl"

In the event of an emergency release of ammonia it will be necessary for some specifically assigned and properly trained employees to remain in work areas that are being evacuated long enough to perform critical operations. Before a maintenance employee enters a release area, they must first test the concentration of the release by using an ammonia detector. They must also operate in pairs. If the isolation is their within reasonable capabilities they may isolate the leak and shut down the system if needed.\n\n\n\nIn response to an ammonia release, BHJ USA, LLC will not respond to releases of hazardous chemicals in an offensive manner. The facility does not have any employees trained at the HAZMAT Technicians or First Responders Operations Level.  However, in the case of a minor ammonia release, designated maintenance personnel are allowed to isolate or maintain the release.\n\n\n\nBHJ USA, LLC has not had any accidental releases to report since the commissioning of the plant.\n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario would be failure of the low temperature accumulator releasing 13,500 lbs of ammonia (the entire charge) for duration of ten minutes. Under worst-case weather conditions, ammonia could travel 0.832 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.
