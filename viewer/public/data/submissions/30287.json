If an accidental release should occur, the facility will work with the local emergency responders to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the community.\n\nThe primary activity at the faciltiy is the storage and blending of fertilizer for sales to farmers. Anhydous ammonia is recieved, stored and distributed for direct application by our farmer customers. Our total storage potential at any given time is 361,000 lbs of anhydrous.\n\nOur facility has implemented the State of Kansas anhydrous ammonia rules, ANSI K.61, and the OSHA rule 1910.111 in order to provide a safe operation and to prevent an accidental release. Our employees attend training sessions from our trade associations and insurance providers as well. We have a regular maintenance program and our plant is inspected by outside agencies such as the Kansas Department of Agriculture and our insurance carrier.\n\nOver the past 5 years we have had no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia tha have caused death, injuries or significant property damage at the facility nor to our knowledge , have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. We are proud of the fact we have had no accidents however if we do our firm is prepared to investigate and implement our emergency action plan.\n\nOur firm utilizes an emergency action plan for emergencies. We utilize Tier II reporting according to SARA Title III. We have made an effort and continue to work with our local emergency preparedness director."
