The Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policy\nVan Diest Supply Company\u00bfs accidental release prevention policy is a unified approach that integrates technology, procedure, and management practices, while complying with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations for our anhydrous ammonia storage.  If an accidental release were to occur, Van Diest Supply Company is prepared and trained to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and to the environment.\n\nB.   A Brief Description of the Facility and the Substances Handled\nVan Diest Supply Company is a formulator, distributor, and dealer of agricultural chemicals, and a dealer of fertilizers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application on the field.  Two storage tanks are used to store the anhydrous ammonia, and there may also be up to 55 nurse tanks on site.  \n\nC.  The Accidental Release Prevention Program\nFor our ammonia tanks, Van Diest Supply Company implements the provisions of the \u00bfSafety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Ammonia, K-61.1\u00bf published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \u00bfStorage and Handling of Ammonia\u00bf.\n\nImpact distances for any release will be limited by mitigation devices such as check valves, relief valves, and excess flow valves, as well as the training of our employees in our Emergency Response Program.\n\nD.   Five Year Accident History\nVan Diest Supply Company has never had an incident involving  ammonia which caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, or evacuations. \n\nE.   Emergency Response Program\nVan Diest Supply Company has a written emergency action plan (in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38) including pre-emergency planning and employee training, and has provided state"
