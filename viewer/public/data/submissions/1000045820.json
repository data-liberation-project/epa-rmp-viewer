We are committed to to the prevention of any accidental release of NH3.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Pilger Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\n\n\n  The primary purpose of this facility is storage of fertilizer to the agriculture sector.  Anhydrous Ammonia is received, storedand distributedfor direct application through sales to farmers. Acces to the site is restricted to authorized facility emplyees, authorized management, and authorized contractors. The maximum intended inventory of our anhydrous ammonia main tank and nurse tanks is 259,250 lbs.\n\n\n\nWe used RMP comp to determine the worst case scenerio release at our facility. Failure of our storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would have offsite consequences.  We have check valves and relief valves along with manual shutoffs to reduce the chance of failure.\n\n\n\nThis facility complies with the EPAs Accidental Release Prevention Rule and is in the process of updating to Nebraskas most recent regulations.  The facility has implemented provisions and Safety requirements for the Storage andSafe Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1 and the standards of OSHA, 29 CFR 1901.111 Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\n\n\nWe have never had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caused death, injury, property or enviromental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place. We have not had an offsite release of amonia in the past 5 years.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency invovlving our anhydrous ammonia system, it is our policy to notify the Pilger Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. We have discussed this policy with the department and they have inspected our system.\n\n\n\nSafety improvement is an ongoing process at Farmers Coop. Periodic evaluations are preforme"
