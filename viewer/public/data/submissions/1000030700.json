The Welch's facility in Lawton, Michigan is comprised of one fruit juice processing plant owned by Welch's. The facility is involved in the production of concentrated fruit juices and by-products. The two-processes located within the facility boundary use ammonia, a chemical subject to RMP regulation, for refrigeration purposes. These processes are the Central Refrigeration System and the Freezer System. The ammonia content within these systems exceeds the 10,000 pound threshold for RMP applicability.\r\n\r\nAs required in the USEPA CAA Risk Management Program rules (rule[s]), listed in 40 CFR Part 68, this document contains information intended to analyze the impacts of an accidental release of an EHS and to highlight the steps the facility is taking to prevent a release from occurring. The intent of the rule is to reduce the likelihood of a chemical release and the consequences of a release if one were to occur. The Welch's facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) in refrigeration, which is a regulated substances under the Risk Management Program. The facility is also subject to the OSHA PSM program. Modeling results indicate the worst-case release would cause an offsite impact. Due to these factors, Welch's is subject to Program 3 requirements under 40 CFR Part 68.\r\n\r\nBecause of the potential hazards when using ammonia, it is essential that steps be taken to minimize the risk of a catastrophic release. The prevention program for Welch's includes the requirements for a Program 3 process the facility currently meets under the OSHA PSM standard. Specifically, process safety information, operating procedures, pre-startup safety review, mechanical integrity, hot work permit, contractors, and management of change contribute to safe operation of the system.\r\n\r\nWelch's has developed and implemented many standard operat"

These procedures outline steps for each operating phase, operating limits, health and safety considerations as well as safety systems and their functions. The procedures outline safe work practices to provide for the control of hazards during operations.  The process complies with good engineering practices and procedures are in place for maintaining mechanical integrity and planning for change.  Employees are trained in safe operations, health and safety hazards, and emergency procedures with respect to their job tasks. \r\n\r\nThe PHA conducted by the facility helps to identify potential problems before they occur. This process allows for participation of employees and identification of opportunities for improvement at the plant. The most recent PHA conducted by the plant identified no major deficiencies in the ammonia system. The PHA did not identify an impending release of ammonia, based on the operation and maintenance of the systems.\r\n\r\nAs described in the training section of the PSM document, each employee with job responsibilities associated with the storage, handling, or use of ammonia is thoroughly trained or otherwise deemed competent in the work procedures relevant to their responsibilities. Employee participation is also a key component of the successful implementation of the PSM program at Welch's.\r\n\r\nThe hazard analysis performed for the facility also includes a review of its 5-year accident history. During the past 5 years, Welch's has not had an accidental release that met the criteria of 40 CFR 68.42(a). \r\n\r\nWelch's has been actively involved in emergency response planning. They have worked with the Local Emergency Management Agency to coordinate offsite response activities. Welch's is a Program 3 source and a nonresponding facility.
