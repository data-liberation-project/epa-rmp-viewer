The facility's ammonia storage and handling are subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements. Kincaid's operating procedures are written and followed with specific detail for safely conducting activities involving the unloading, storage, and handling of anhydrous ammonia. In addition, each employee involved in operating the ammonia process is further trained in emergency operations. Plant personnel strictly adhere to the written maintenance procedures to ensure the mechanical and functional integrity of the tank, piping system, and emergency shutdown systems. These activities include periodic inspections, testing, and replacement of parts consistent with the manufacturer's recommendations and good engineering practices. Furthermore, Kincaid ensures that any changes to the ammonia process or plant equipment and systems are managed by implementing a hazard analysis, a root cause failure analysis, and safety procedures before modifications occur. Kincaid has taken great care to ensure the anhydrous ammonia system is properly designed, maintained, and operated.  Chemical safety training through first aid, emergency contingency plans, hazard communication, PPE, and HAZWOPER programs reinforce the criticality of chemical safety to operations personnel. Operations personnel conduct inspections on every shift to minimize the consequences of potential leaks or process problems. The emergency response program includes the training mentioned above, both announced and unannounced annual drills, emergency horns and radio communications at the facility. Kincaid has a qualified contracting agency on standby that will respond to chemical spills and cleanup operations, and the facility has confirmed its inclusion with the Local Emergency Planning Committee.\r\n\r\n(b) Kincaid Generation, L.L.C. is an electric utility generating facility wh"

The facility uses Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) in order to comply with nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission reductions required by the Illinois Administration Code Section 217 Subpart V and U.S. EPA's Cross-State Air Pollution Rule. The SCR process consists of injecting anhydrous ammonia into the boiler flue gas. The gas then goes through a catalyst bed where the nitrogen oxides react to form nitrogen and water vapor. This Risk Management Plan covers the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\n(c) Liquid anhydrous ammonia is stored at the facility in two 45,000 gallon tanks, each limited to 85% of maximum capacity through administrative controls.  The tanks, piping system, and safety devices are designed and constructed to comply with applicable federal codes and regulations. All tank process connections are equipped with internally mounted excess flow valves and a check valve on the liquid fill line to shut off the flow of liquid or vapor should a pipe rupture occur. The tanks are enclosed by a concrete berm and contain chemical sensors to detect small releases. The tanks are also equipped with other safety devices: pressure relief valves set at 200 psig and vaporizers for overpressure protection, an overpressure alarm system, an emergency shut-off system, a fogging system, and pressure, temperature, and level indicators.\r\n\r\n(d) Kincaid Generation, L.L.C. has never had a reportable release of ammonia. \r\n\r\n(e) Kincaid Generation, L.L.C.'s prevention program is based on OSHA's Process Safety Management standard.
