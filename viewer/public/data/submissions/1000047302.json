      "SummaryText": "DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Bob West Dew Point Plant located near Falcon Heights, Texas extracts hydrocarbon liquids from a natural gas feed stream providing natural gas liquids (NGL) and natural gas as products. \n\n\n\nPROGRAM 1 CERTIFICATION\n\n\n\nBased on the criteria in 40 CFR 68.10, the distance to the specified endpoint for the worst-case accidental release scenario for the Bob West Dew Point Plant is less than the distance to the nearest public receptor.\n\n\n\nWithin the past five years, the process has had no accidental releases that caused offsite impacts provided in the risk management program rule (40CFR 68.10(b)(1). No additional measures are necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accidental releases. In the event of fire, explosion or a release of a regulated substance from the process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to public emergency responders. Therefore, public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact identified in the RMP.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nThe Bob West Dew Point Plant is committed to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, gas plant trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release."
