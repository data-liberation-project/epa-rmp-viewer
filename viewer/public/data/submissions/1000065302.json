The worst case and alternative case radii of effect were determined utilizing RMP Comp software provided by the EPA.\r\n\r\nThe worst case release scenario was determined to be a release of the entire contents of a 30,000 gallon NGL storage vessel. The alternative case release scenario was modeled as a hose rupture during truck loading, resulting in the release of 1,000 gallons of NGL.\r\n\r\n4.\tThe General Accident Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention \r\n\tSteps\r\n\r\nMarkwest has taken all the necessary steps to comply with accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA regulations.

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial start up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and startup after turn around. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the process.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nMarkwest has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that the employees operating processes are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with the processes.

Refresher training is provided as needed.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nThe integrity of mechanical operations at Markwest is ensured through documented maintenance checks on process equipment.  Process equipment examined by these checks include among others: pressurized storage vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps. Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.

This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers such areas as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility, and it is the policy of Markwest to implement appropriate controls to prevent the possible release of regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, Markwest is completely coordinated with the Kanawha Putnam Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Clendenin Volunteer Fire Department, which provides emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\r\n\r\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substance Handled\r\n\r\nThe primary function of the Markwest facility encompasses natural gas liquid (NGL) extraction. NGL's and Propane are the two substances present at the facility regulated by Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations.  NGL's, a flammable substance, are a mixture comprised of propane, normal butane, isobutane, and natural gasoline (pentanes and hexanes).  The NGL's are extracted from a natural gas transmission pipeline. Once extracted, the NGL is stored in five 30,000-gallon capacity pressure vessels (801-805). The NGL is then transferred via tank truck to the Siloam Fractionation Facility.\r\nPropane, which is used as a refrigerant in the process, is stored at the facility in two (2) 1,000-gallon capacity above ground pressure vessels. \r\nThe total quantity of product stored in the vessels is administratively controlled to ensure that the vessels are not filled above 85% of full capacity. Additionally, pressure relief devices provide added assurance tha"

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nMarkwest conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. These audits are carried out every three years as required by RMP regulations (40 CFR 68.58) and any corrections required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nMarkWest investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident, as well as any corrective actions needed to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a period of five years.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nMarkWest believes that successful PSM and accident prevention programs require a team effort.
