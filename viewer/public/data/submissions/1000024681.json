As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Golden Sierra Cold Storage has elected to use PSMWriter&copy;, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \r\n\r\n1.1\tGOLDEN SIERRA COLD STORAGE, RISK & PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM \r\n\r\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Golden Sierra Cold Storage has updated their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following process which has the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \r\n\r\nAmmonia Refrigeration | Ammonia | 14,000 lb\r\n\r\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\r\n\r\nGolden Sierra Cold Storage has an exemplary safety record, one that we are quite proud of. Our company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have: \r\n\r\n1.\tPrepared a unified program based on the PSM plan"

The facility has an ammonia refrigeration system that provides refrigeration capacity to five (5) cold storage rooms and one (1) hallway/dock.  The cold storage rooms are equipped with spiral fin bunker coils, while the dock has two (2) ceiling suspended coil.  Both kinds of coils contain chilled liquid ammonia.\r\n\r\nThe system operates as follows: high pressure liquid from a high pressure receiver is piped to each cold room where it passes through a solenoid valve, an expansion valve, and into a low pressure accumulator vessel mounted inside the bunkers.  Low temperature liquid circulates by thermal convection through the evaporator coils located behind bunker walls in the cold rooms.  Low pressure and temperature gas collects in the accumulator vessel, and passes through a pressure regulator into a suction line.  The suction line returns the vapor to the main suction accumulator vessel located in the engine room, which separates any residual liquid from the gas.  The gas is piped to reciprocating and upright compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas.  The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquefied and returned to the high pressure receiver. Liquid separated from the suction return gas in the main suction accumulator vessel drains into a liquid transfer vessel.  Operation of a float switch"

      "SummaryText": "activated solenoid valve raises the pressure in the liquid transfer vessel to the point the liquid can be drained into the high pressure receiver.  \r\n\r\nThe system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and safety relief valves which vent ammonia gas to the atmosphere if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point.  \r\n\r\nThe ammonia system at this facility consists of vessels which are interconnected, or which are co-located such that a release of ammonia could impact the ability to operate vessels that are not directly connected.  Therefore, the system is treated as a single process.\r\n\r\n1.3\tGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE & CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\n1.3.1\tGENERAL \r\n\r\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\r\n\r\nGolden Sierra Cold Storage has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in the body of the program. \r\n\r\n1.3.2\tANHYDROUS AMMONIA\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Golden Sierra Cold Storage facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\r\n\r\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one"

Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \r\n\r\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\r\n\r\n1.6\tPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nOur company has an outstanding safety record, one that we are quite proud of. Many policies and procedures have been implemented to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, Golden Sierra Cold Storage continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\r\n\r\nBy utilizing PSMWriter&copy; software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Golden Sierra Cold Storage's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter&copy; tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Golden Sierra Cold Storage's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\r\n\r\nGolden Sierra Cold Storage has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program.

A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter&copy;.\r\n\r\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter&copy; to create, schedule, track, and document events, Golden Sierra Cold Storage has also entered into a contract with California Controlled Atmosphere to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation. A copy of California Controlled Atmosphere's service agreement has been included in this program with the support material.\r\n\r\nFor the future, Golden Sierra Cold Storage now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Golden Sierra Cold Storage employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Golden Sierra Cold Storage will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety."
