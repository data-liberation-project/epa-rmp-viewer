It is intended to prevent and limit the impact of potentially toxic and flammable substances from being accidentally released by the refinery. The RMP includes a facility-wide review of potential hazards, a worst-case, alternative case and off-site consequences analysis, and implements a formal management system for managing and minimizes those risks.   The RMP is just one element of Tesoro's commitment to safety and protection of employees, the surrounding community and environment.\r\n\r\nSafety Commitment\r\n\r\nThe following corporate policy statement expresses Tesoro's overall commitment to safety and the prevention of accidental releases which could impact the community.  \r\n\r\nTesoro Petroleum Corporation considers safety an integral part of its performance.  At Tesoro we believe:\r\n\u00bf All accidents can be prevented.\r\n\u00bf Safety is not to be compromised for any reason.\r\n\u00bf Each employee is responsible for their own safety and working safely is a condition of employment.\r\n\u00bf  Management is accountable for accident prevention\r\n\u00bf Trained employees are an essential element for safe workplaces.\r\n\u00bf All operating exposures can be safeguarded.\r\n\u00bf Immediate corrective action shall be taken on all unsafe practices and incidents with injury or damage potential. \r\n\r\nComplying with the requirements of OSHA's Process Management System (PSM) and EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) will help protect employees as well as the surrounding communities and environment. \r\n\r\n\r\nRefinery Process Description\r\n\r\nThe Tesoro Hawaii Corporation operates a petroleum refinery in Campbell Industrial Park.

However, as might be expected, 8 out of 15 refinery processes have the potential to contain more than 10,000 lbs of flammable mixtures.  Most of the flammable substances, such as feedstocks, motor fuels and LPG are stored in the refinery's tank farm.  Other refinery processes have flammable substances held principally in process vessels and interconnecting piping.  The 8 refinery processes described below are subject to the containment and control measures mandated by the refinery's RMP for flammable mixtures.     \r\n\r\n1.\tTank Farm:  The Tank Farm (TKF) contains many petroleum storage tanks,  including vertical tanks, pressurized horizontal tanks (bullets) and one sphere.  Stored products include crude oil, fuel oils, diesel, kerosene, gasoline, naphtha, , butane and propane. The amount of flammable substances subject to RMP was based on the tanks' capacity to store naphtha and liquefied petroleum gas LPG. The RMP flammable inventory excludes crude oil, gasoline and mixtures which are heavier than gasoline.  LPG, principally butane and propane, is stored in 8 pressurized tanks which have deluge systems in case of fire.  All vertical tanks are diked to contain releases.  Foam is also available for tank fires.     \r\n\r\n2.\tCrude Distillation and Vacuum Unit:  Crude oil is washed to remove salt, heated and then distilled in the  atmospheric distillation tower  referred to as the crude distillation unit (CDU) into naphtha, kerosene, diesel, atmospheric gas oils (middle distillates), and residual oil . The heavier oils from the CDU are further processed by vacuum distillation (VDU).  Although the CDU and VDU can be operated independently, normally both units work in conjunction with one another. The CDU contains more than 10,000 lbs of flammable material.  The VDU does not but for the purposes of RMP, and given the physical and operation interconne"

The naphtha and other light ends coming off the top of the atmospheric tower are covered by the RMP as a flammable mixture.  The hazards associated with the CDU include high temperature and pressure of the hydrocarbons, and chemicals such as caustic used to treat the kerosene.  The CDU also contains the sour water stripper (SWS).  Steam is used in the SWS to strip ammonia (NH3) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) from water containing ammonium hydrosulfide.  The H2S and NH3 are sent to the Sulfur Recovery Units discussed below.\r\n\r\n3.\tVisbreaker and Offgas Hydrotreater:  The heavy residual oils from the bottom of the VDU tower are processed in the Visbreaker (VBK) by viscosity breaking at high temperature.  This results in breakdown of the heavy oil to produce fuel gas, naphtha and lighter oils.  The hazards associated with this process are again high temperature and pressure of the hydrocarbons, gases containing ~10% H2S. For the purposes of the RMP the greatest concern is with the release and subsequent ignition of flammable mixtures. The visbreaker offgas hydrotreater (VHT) is designed to convert organic sulfur compounds, produced by the VBK into H2S.  By permit condition the two units must be operated in conjunction with one another.\r\n\r\n4.\tDistillate Hydrocracker:  In the hydrocracker (DHC), gas oils from the CDU and VDU are mixed with hydrogen and sent to a series of catalytic reactors where nitrogen and sulfur are removed and the oils are cracked and reacted with hydrogen to form diesel, kerosene, naphtha and lighter gaseous products.  Some of the reactions in these reactors are exothermic and the potential exists for a runaway reaction.  Process controls minimize this possibility and provide for rapid pressure reduction by de-pressuring the reactors to the flare to protect against accidents.  Fol"

In addition to flammable mixtures, hazards in the NHT/CRU include exothermic reactions, high temperature and pressure, H2S and hydrogen.  The hydrogen generated in the CRU is used in the DHC.    \r\n\r\n8.\tFlare System:  The refinery flare serves an emergency relief device for the process units described above. The flare system consists of the various flare headers throughout the process areas and two knockout drums.  The flare system transports gases from pressure safety relief valves to the flare for safe combustion.  There is little potential for fire or explosion because the flare operates at very low pressures and is itself a control device.\r\n\r\nBased on engineering review, the seven processes listed below do not have flammable mixtures or contain toxic substances in excess of the threshold quantities established by 40 CFR 68. Although these processes are not specifically regulated under 40 CFR 68, the following processes, along with the rest of the refinery are managed according to the refinery's PSM program which embodies many of the same elements as RMP.\r\n\r\n1.\tSulfur Recovery Units/Tail Gas Unit:  The SRU receives acidic gases (NH3 and H2S) principally from the SWS and the ATU. The feed gas to SRU are, for all practical purposes, void of hydrocarbon and generally are not characterized as a flammable mixture.   Ammonia is thermally decomposed and the H2S is converted to sulfur and removed.  The molten sulfur is condensed, prilled and sold.  The Sulfur Recovery Plant (SRP) also includes the Shell Claus Offgas Treater (SCOT) or Tail Gas Treating (TGU) is used to remove residual sulfur compounds from the flue or tail gas of the SRU.

In addition to the potential for combustion of the hydrogen and hydrocarbons, the methanation reaction to remove small amounts of CO and CO2 is highly exothermic and presents the possibility of a runaway reaction.  \r\n\r\n3.\tAsphalt Heating and Loading:  In 2006 the refinery suspended the process producing asphalt by air blowing in the Asphalt Manufacturing Unit (AMU).  The asphalt oxidizer (R801) as known as the air blower and the waste gas incinerator (H802) were taken out-of-service.  Aside from the asphalt loading rack which is used to fill trucks and inter-island container , there is a refinery fuel gas-fired heater which is used to keep asphalt warm so that is can be pumped and transferred.   \r\n\r\n4.\tCogeneration Unit:  The CGU consists of a combustion turbine power generating unit combined with a waste heat recovery steam generator (HRSG).  In addition to jet fuel the CGU was designed to and for a number of years was fired on light fuel such as naphtha and reformate. That practice was suspended in 2006. After completing a project to reduce risk associated with firing on light fuel, (and after substantial repairs were made to turbine) on May 29, 2011 the practice firing naphtha (as the primary fuel) was resumed. The naphtha, which originates from the crude unit, passes through the northernmost of three pressurized horizontal tanks (Bullet 2301A). (The other two are currently empty)  The naphtha that passes through the bullet, is first stabilized, and its initial boiler point (IBP) is more than 100 F, as verified by lab testing.  Consequently the naphtha which is stored in the bullet carries a NFPA fire rating of 3 and is not regulated as a flammable substance or mixture under 40 CFR 68. The cogen is also equipped with a duct burner which is fired exclusively on refinery fuel gas. Since there really is no storage of the refinery fuel gas prior to its use, the maximum inventory o"

The WTU separates oil from water wastewater and also strips dissolved hydrocarbons (principally benzene)  from the wastewater, prior to bio-treatment in the activated sludge unit.  Liquid hydrocarbons are stored in a recovered oil tank and recycled back into the refining process.  Potentially flammable hydrocarbon vapors contained in the head space of various tanks and vessels in the WTU are routed to a closed vent system and in a thermal oxidizer.     The potential for vapors and the flammability risk is limited because the CO2 or nitrogen are normally introduced into the head space to provide an inert gas blanket. Although light liquid hydrocarbons are recovered from the wastewater and temporarily stored in tanks, this recovered oil does not meet the NFPA flammable criteria and thus the 10,000 lb RMP threshold quantity is not exceeded.  The change in the inventory amounts was based on a more exacting applicability analysis, not a process change.     \r\n\r\n7.\tFuel Treatment Plant:  The fuel treatment plant (FTP) is used principally to remove impurities from fuel oil, which is routinely sold to a large independent Cogeneration Facility which borders the refinery.

In addition the inventory includes naphtha, which can occasionally exceed the RMP flammability criteria for mixtures.  The inventory and threshold for flammable substances inventory determinations does not include crude oil, or gasoline.  Although gasoline contains components such as butane and pentane, which are specifically listed as regulated flammable substances, the combination of these substances along with other hydrocarbons form a mixture (gasoline) which does not meet the NFPA 4 flammable criteria. More specifically gasoline does not normally meet both of the following criteria: flash point less than 73 F and boiling point less than 100 F.  Similarly products and intermediates which are heavier than gasoline are not included in the RMP inventory, even though products (such as diesel, jet and kerosene) would be consider flammable or combustible under other regulations or standards.   \r\n\r\nThe great majority RMP flammable mixtures are stored in the tank farm.

Since these toxics substances are processed rather than stored they do not exceed the threshold quantities that would cause the units through which they are processed or treated to be considered a process covered by RMP.  However the release of all hazards substances have been fully addressed through the refinery's safety program and potential release scenarios have been analyzed and mitigation measures taken.  Preventative and mitigation measures for these releases are addressed in Tesoro's PSM program and Emergency Response Plan.\r\n\r\nRelease Scenarios (Worst Case and Alternatives)\r\n\r\nUnder the Chemical Accident Prevention regulations, if any process stores toxic or flammable substance above EPA's threshold quantities, the refinery must determine the worst-case accidental release (defined as the release resulting in the greatest downwind impact) for that substance. Only a very limited subset of mitigation measures may be considered in projecting the impact of a worst-case scenario.  While EPA strictly defines the worst-case scenario, alternative cases that may be more likely to occur may be presented, and are used as the basis for conducting emergency response drills.\r\n\r\nWorst-case Scenario: The worst-case scenario would involve the release, dispersion and ultimately and explosion a 30,000 gallons butane bullet in the tank farm.

The worst-case scenario assumes the entire contents of the bullet is released as a gas over a 10 minute period and is then involved in a vapor cloud explosion (VCE).

Likewise, no sensitive environmental receptors would be impacted under the worst-case scenario.  The public receptors are commercial enterprises and offices located closest to the refinery   The worst-case scenario does not take into account the effects of mitigations measures which presumably would be rendered ineffective. For example, the tank farm bullet has a deluge system on it to mitigate the effects of a fire.  The vessel is also isolated and inspected and tested according to industry standards to prevent failure.    \r\n\r\nThe Alternative Case:  A number of processes and circumstances were reviewed and evaluated before identifying the alternative case.  The alternative case represented by a two inch hole or line connection from a 25,650 gallon propane (C3) bullet also located in the SW tank farm.   Utilizing the more conservative of two dispersion modeling approaches ( ALOHA and EPA Offsite Consequences Analysis Table 29) the vapor cloud is expected to be blown (by 10 mph winds) 528 feet from the point of release .

The PSM program applies to the entire refinery, and is not limited to processes that contain a threshold quantity of a regulated substance.  Hazard and Operability Studies (HAZOPS) are completed by professionals on all refinery processes and repeated every five years as a minimum.  This assures that design standards are adequate for safe operation, and that controls are installed and address all identified hazards. Note that the great majority of actions identified in the HAZOP are addressed as quickly as practicable.  Some items however require long lead times due to design requirements or other work necessary to determine a solution.  Management of Change (MOC) procedures and Pre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs) ensure that any change in materials, equipment or procedures is thoroughly reviewed for safety and risk.  A mechanical integrity program ensures that equipment is maintained, inspected and tested using manufacturers and industry standards.  Accidents and near misses are subject to an incident investigation process that ensures actions are taken to prevent similar incidents in the future.\r\n\r\nThis RMP submittal asks for a number of dates to show compliance with various elements of the prevention program.

To prevent a reactor runaway the DHC was shutdown. There were no injuries or property damage.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nOur emergency response program is designed around the Incident Command System (ICS) and is used for all types of emergencies.  Training and drills are held routinely to test response, communication, coordination and training.  Drills range from routine un-announced checks of the call-in system to scheduled all day drills involving other Tesoro locations and response agencies.  The refinery maintains a well-trained Fire Brigade with a full range of response equipment. \r\n\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes\r\n\r\nThe refinery routinely makes changes to procedures, equipment, training programs and materials in order to improve safety and reduce environmental impacts.  These changes are made as a result of HAZOP studies, accident and near-miss investigations, safety inspections, pre-startup reviews and audits.  The refinery has implemented a union led system, referred to as Triangle of Prevention (TOPS) which identifies and reinforces systems of safety.  Through its various safety programs, a key objective is continuous improvement through involvement at all employee levels."
