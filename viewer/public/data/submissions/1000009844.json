Highway 29 is just west of the site and Highway 58 is north of the site.\n The Plant includes both a chlorine and sulfur dioxide storage and distribution systems contained in a specially designed process building. The boundaries of the chlorine system and adjacent sulfur dioxide system are subject to the RMP regulation.  The subject processes include the bulk chlorine and sulfur dioxide storage, feed, and control building with the associated vent make up and exhaust systems.\n1.2.2. REGULATED SUBSTANCE:   CHLORINE (b)(2)Chlorine is the first of two regulated substances on site which exceeds the EPA 40 CFR-68 rule threshold quantity.  The chlorine process was installed as part of the process of purifying wastewater to permit discharge into the Dan River.  The chlorine is received, stored, and distributed through four process control systems, which feed the chlorine into a water stream.  This chlorinated water is then used to disinfect the wastewater.\n Chlorine is an EPA-and OSHA-listed toxic chemical.  It is an irritant and it is corrosive.  Chlorine is a halogen with the formula Cl2.  It is a chlorinating or oxidizing agent that is not flammable.  It has a 1 ppm OSHA ceiling Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) and a NFPA health rating of 3, severe; with immediate and delayed health hazards.  Chlorine is not a carcinogen.\n1.2.3. REGULATED SUBSTANCE: SULFUR DIOXIDE (b) (2)Sulfur dioxide is the second regulated substance on site which exceeds the EPA 40 CFR-68 rule threshold quantity.  The dechlorination process was installed as part of the process of purifying wastewater to permit discharge into the Dan River.  The sulfur dioxide used to dechlorinate is received, stored, and distributed through two process control systems, which feed the sulfur dioxide into a water stream. This sulfonated water is then used to scavenge excess chlorine in the treated wastewater.\n  Sulfur dioxide is"

It is a dechlorinating or oxidizing agent that is not flammable.  It has a 2 ppm OSHA Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) and a NFPA health rating of 3, serious; with immediate and delayed health hazards.  Sulfur dioxide is not a carcinogen.\n1.3. WORST AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS  (C)Four offsite consequence analyses were conducted which include two chlorine release scenarios and two identical sulfur dioxide release scenarios.  The first is a worst case release.  The second is a more probable alternative release scenario.  The first scenario used for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide is defined by EPA, which states that the shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over 10 minutes due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario.\n   Atmospheric dispersion modeling was performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine or like sulfur dioxide released before its concentration decreases to the toxic endpoint.  The EPA selected endpoint for chlorine is 0.0087 mg/L which equals 3 ppm. The end point for sulfur dioxide is 0.78mg/L, which also equals 3 ppm.  The 3 ppm endpoint is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual\u00c2\u00bfs ability to take protective action.

Results demonstrate a distance of 1.30 miles to the toxic endpoint for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  The residential population that could potentially be affected by the release is estimated at 503 people.\n1.3.2. ALTERNATIVE CASE   (C)(2)\n The alternative release scenario involves the failure of the pipe system or evaporator up to the vacuum check regulator of the high pressure system connected to one of four, one-ton containers. This failure is equal to creating a 1/16 inch diameter hole in either a pipe tube, evaporator, a pipe, or even the container in the vapor space.  Modeling using the EPA wastewater guidance demonstrated the rate of chlorine release is 20.0 lb./min.  The toxic endpoint distances determined is 0.20 miles.  The number of public receptors that would be impacted by this release is 0.\n1.4. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM  (D)\nThe facility's accidental release prevention program is based on OSHA\u00c2\u00bfs PSM program and EPA\u00c2\u00bfs RMP Level 3 prevention program.  The PSM program has been in place and effectively used for several years.  It is part of the plants operating culture.  There are two parts to the program.  The first is the general overall site program.  The second is the chemical-specific actions for either chlorine or sulfur dioxide within the site program.  This is coordinated with the Danville, Virginia Fire Department, which has a HazMat team.\n1.4.1. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM   (d)(1)\n Facility-wide, many elements of the prevention program are used for all operations. The overviews of these written programs are listed below:\n\u00c2\u00b7 American Water Services has detailed process safety information on each of its operations. \n\u00c2\u00b7 The DMS document control system is integral to the management of change for all operations on site.  \n\u00c2\u00b7 Training is the backbone of employee knowledge, job"
