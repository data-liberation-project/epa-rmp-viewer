Olin is an active member of the Chlorine Institute, and industry group that develops technology for the safe handling and management of chlorine.  Olin also participates in Responsible Care, the industry's outreach to dialogue with the public regarding our environmental, health and safety program and to receive input from the community of issues of concern.\n\nOlin meets the EPA RMP Prevention Program and OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements.  Physical safeguards are in place to prevent a release of either chlorine or sulfur dioxide. Best industry practices are followed for the design and construction of equipment, piping and instrumentation.  Facility process designs include expansion bottles and/or rupture disks and pressure switches to safeguard against hydrostatic overpressure of equipment and piping.\n\nStationary Source/Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe facility receives liquefied chlorine and caustic in 90-ton rail cars.  Sodium hypochlorite (bleach) is produced from the chlorine and caustic, in addition, chlorine is repackaged into 1-ton containers and 150-pound cylinders.  The facility also distributes sulfur dioxide in 1-ton containers and 150-pound cylinders.  These chemicals provide important benefits in critical applications sucha as water purification and household disinfectants.  Olin's policy is to implement reasonable measurere to prevent a release of a hazardous material from occurring, to provife early detection of a release in the unlikrly even that one would occr, and to have in place a contingency plan to respond promptly yet safely to such a release.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidents involving chlorine or sulfur dioxide in the past five (5) years.\n\nEmergnecy Response Program\n\nOli"

In the unlikely event that a release cannot be controlled completely with these systems, Olin has an Emergency Response Team trained and equipped to respond safely to a release in accordance with a written Emergence Response Plan.  Olin has worked closely with the Tracy Fire Department, San Joaquin County Sheriffs Office, San Joaquin Office of Emergency Services and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) in developing its Emergency Response Plan.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nOlin continues to make significant changes to improve safety, future plans include the installation of a tank level control system and expansion of the video surveillance system."
