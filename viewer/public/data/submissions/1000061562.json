These are Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) and Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM). A description of the covered processes is included in this summary.\n\n\n\nRMP-Covered Materials:\n\n\n\nThe facility has five RMP-covered materials on site exceeding the RMP-specified regulatory threshold quantities. These materials are chlorine, anhydrous hydrogen chloride, vinyl chloride, propylene, and chloroform.\n\n\n\nChlorine is a greenish-yellow gas; it's heavier than air; it has the strong odor of household bleach; it is corrosive. Chlorine is used as a drinking water disinfectant; making household bleach; making plastics and other chemicals. Formosa uses this material in the manufacture of vinyl chloride.\n\n\n\nVinyl Chloride monomer is a colorless gas; it is heavier than air; it has a sweet odor; it is flammable. Formosa manufactures and uses this material in the production of polyvinyl chloride.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous Hydrogen Chloride is a colorless gas; it is heavier than air; it has an irritating, pungent odor; it is corrosive.

Propylene is used as a non-CFC refrigerant and in the manufacture of plastics, antifreezes, and food additives. Formosa uses this material as a refrigerant.\n\n\n\nChloroform is produced as a byproduct/impurity in the VCM manufacturing process.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Policy:\n\n\n\nThe facility's commitment to the safety of its employees, the community and the environment is exemplified by their EHS policy statement. The facility recognizes that it operates under privilege and acknowledges that protection and safety of the environment, community, and employees are integral to its continued success as an organization. As such, a holistic approach consisting of sound design, engineering and administrative measures is utilized in preventing accidental releases.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Programs and Measures:\n\n\n\nIn the prevention of accidental releases, the facility employs numerous engineering and administrative controls to ensure the chance of a hazardous material release is minimized. Engineering controls utilized include, but are not limited to, conservative process design safety factors, check valves that limit/prevent releases in the event of reverse excess flow, pressure and level alarms on primary storage vessels, redundant level detection for overfill protection, relief valves to prevent vessel overpressurization, insulated vessels to prevent solar overpressurization, shut-down systems, automatic/manual valves to isolate/limit releases, and redundant mechanical seals to prevent leaks.\n\n\n\nAdministrative controls utilized include certification to ISO quality and environmental management standards, Process Safety Management programs, Safety Permitting programs, Hot Work Procedures, Hazardous Energy Control pro"

The facility recognizes that quick response to an incident is instrumental in assuring protection of the environment, community, and employees. To assist with this, the facility utilizes numerous engineering and administrative controls for early detection, communication, and response to incidents.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Programs and Measures:\n\n\n\nThe facility employs numerous engineering and administrative controls to ensure the chance of a hazardous material release is minimized. Engineering controls which aid in the identification and/or communication of such incidents including atmospheric leak detection systems, portable atmospheric detection equipment, facility alarm and siren systems, public address systems, two-way radios, phones, and computers.\n\n\n\nAdministrative controls include an Emergency Response plan, Spill Prevention plan, Emergency Notification procedures, and Emergency Shutdown procedures. An exercise testing the response plan and the communication procedures is conducted annually and a critique is held following the event.\n\n\n\nThe site has an emergency response team which consists of employees who have been trained in the areas of fire fighting, hazardous materials response, rescue, and injury treatment. Larger emergency response activities are coordinated under the Shift Safety Coordinator.\n\n\n\nEmergency preplanning and response coordination with external agencies and responders is accomplished via membership and/or participation in organizations such as the Baton Rouge Area Mutual Aid Society and the North Baton Rouge Chemical Industry Task Force.\n\n\n\nThe facility is part of an emergency hotl"

Additionally, there are fire hose houses which contain fire hose, fire water nozzles, and various wrenches and adapters that provide mobile fire fighting capability. The site also has a fire truck and foam trailer which can be utilized by the emergency response team members. Additional fire water capacity can be accessed through a neighboring industry's fire water system if required.\n\n\n\nFor hazardous materials incidents, a supply of emergency equipment is kept on-hand, including protective clothing, fresh air systems, capping kits, absorbent pads, leak dams, etc. For incidents requiring external assistance, manpower is provided by the local fire department.
