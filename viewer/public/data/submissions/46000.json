Are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training of all persons that work with the material.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.Facility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is recived, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The maximum quantity stored would be 225,827lbs in the facilities one tank.  The capacity of this tank is 26,000 gal.\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tanks released as a gas over 10 minuets.  The maximum quantity released would be 225,827 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and company procedures.  The distance to the end point of dispersion based on the model used is 7.2 miles.\n\nThe alternative-case release scenario is assumed to be a release from the rupture of a 1.25 inch transfer hose, with a release rate of 394 pounds per minute.  The distance to the end point of dispertion is .14 miles.\n\n4.  The accidental release program:  The facility complies with the Rules and Regulations relating to the handling of Anhydrous ammonia and Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions, Equipment, Containers, and Storage Facilities.  These regulations administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture are consistent with ANSI K61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 reguarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n5.  The Five-Year Accident History\na.  There have been no accidental releases of anhydro"

The Emergency Response Program:  The facility has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and provide state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III of EPCRA.  Our emergency response action plan has been reviewed with the local fire department and provided to the local emergency planning committee for coordination in the community response planning.  \n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety:  Safety improvements is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
