Each employee is provided with a copy of the Handbook. FMS is committed to the implementation of these policies, which has resulted in there being no chlorine related accident in the last 5 years. \r\n\r\nIt must be stated that FMS has been recognized for its excellent record of safety.  In 1993, 1997, 1999, and 2001, FMS received the Sentinels of Safety Award.  This Award is co-sponsored by the American Mining Congress and MSHA, and is recognized as the most prestigious award for safety in the mining industry.   \r\n\r\nYOUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\n\r\nFMS  operates a copper and molybdenum mining and concentrating facility located approximately seven miles west of Green Valley, Arizona. Ore containing low-grade copper and molybdenum is excavated, crushed, conveyed, milled and treated with chemicals to produce copper and molybdenum  concentrates. Copper concentrates are shipped to a smelter for further processing. The molybdenum  concentrate contains a small percentage of copper. It is first treated with ferric chloride for removal of copper and  then roasted to yield molybdenum trioxide which is packaged for distribution. \r\n\r\nThe regulated substance handled at the facility is chlorine. It is used for the regeneration of ferric chloride. \r\n\r\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe Accidental Release Prevention Program is designed in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68. It includes off-site consequence analysis, safety information, hazard review, standard operating procedures, training, inspections and maintenance, compliance audits, management systems and emergency response program.  \r\n\r\nChlorine specific prevention steps include: (1) chlorine sensors located around the perimeter of"

The ERP includes contact information of key people, coordination arrangements with external agencies, personal protective equipment, medical response team, evacuation routes, emergency notification procedures, emergency communication systems, emergency response team, and post-emergency decontamination procedures.         \r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nPlanned changes to improve safety include modifications to the existing process control system and implementation of a HazOps study for the chlorination system."
