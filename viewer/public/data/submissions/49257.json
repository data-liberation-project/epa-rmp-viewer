We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that have been designed and implemented, including;\n?    A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA) Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulation\n?    An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n?    A fire-year history of accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA?s RMP\n?    An overview of our emergency response program\n?    An overview of improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public and the environment\n?    The certifications that EPA?s RMP rule requires us to provide\n?    The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe Ferro Delaware River Plant uses a variety of materials and processing operations to produce:\n?    Benzyl chloride, which is used as an intermediate to produce a variety of end-products, including plasticizers, perfumes, biocides and flavorings\n\n?    Plasticizers, which are used to produce vinyl flooring, wire coating, caulk and other soft vinyl end products\n\n?    Dibutyl phenyl phosphate (DBPP) and Tri-isobutyl phosphate (TiBP), which are used to make hydraulic fluids for use to aviation control systems\n\nOur plant operates 24 hours, (7) days a week, year-round, except for planned or unplanned downtime for maintenance or inventory control. Our plant has operated safely since its initial startup in 1961 without a major incident affec"

Our accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n\n    Toxics\n\nOur facility uses two RMP-regulated chemicals, chlorine and phosphorous oxychloide, to produce our products.\n\nChlorine, which is purchased, is used at our site to produce benzyl chloride and is stored in and distributed from railroad tank cars. Chlorine is a gas at normal pressure and temperature, but is stored as a liquid under pressure in the tank cars. It is unloaded directly from the tank car into a steam-heated vaporizer, where it is heated to vaporize the liquid chlorine for use.\n\nFlammables:\n\nWe have no RMP-regulated flammables stored or handled at our facility.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs, including those incorporated into EPA, OSHA and New Jersey Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act requirements:\n?    Inventory Control to minimize the quantity that could be released in an accident\n?    Process Safety Information to ensure up-to-date parameters for safely operating the process\n?    Process Hazards Analysis to identify and correct potential safety problems\n?    Standard Operating Procedures which describe how to safely operate the process\n?    Training to ensure that operators and mechanics are qualified to safely perform their job\n?    Mechanical Integrity/Preventive Maintenance to inspect and test equipment to ensure mechanical integrity and minimize equipment failure\n?    Management of Change to identify and addr"

Incident investigations to identify and address the root causes of incidents or near-misses to prevent recurrence\n?    Employee Participation in all process safety management activities\n?    Hot Work Permit to ensure that work involving flame, sparks or heat producing equipment is controlled to minimize the chance of a fire\n?    Contractor Safety Program to ensure that safe companies are hired to work in the plant, and to make sure that contract employees are aware of potential hazards and safety procedures and are trained to safely perform their job. A permit system is also in place to control contractor work and help ensure that it is done safely\n?    Risk Assessment to estimate and reduce the likelihood and impact of potential accident scenarios\n?    Breaking Into Process Permit Procedure to ensure that proper precautions are taken when opening process equipment to prevent release of hazardous chemicals\n?    Comprehensive security program to deter, detect, and delay an intruder onto our site so that we can respond promptly to any threat\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented chemical-specific prevention steps:\n?    The benzyl chloride processes are monitored, alarmed, and interlocked to shut down if a problem occurs using computer control systems\n?    Atmospheric chlorine sensors are in place to quickly detect a leak in the unloading area if it occurs\n?    Vents and relief devices are connected to scrubbers, where the chlorine is neutralized with caustic soda\n?

Both American Petroleum Institute (API) and plant standards are used to ensure proper design, installation, operation and maintenance of chlorine systems\n?    A special capping kit is available to seal any leaks in the tank car unloading fittings\n\nThe risk of phosphorus oxychloride releases is minimized by a number of features:\n?    The Phosphate Esters process is monitored, alarmed and interlocked to shut down if a problem occurs by a computer control system\n?    Atmospheric sensors are installed to quickly detect a leak if one occurs\n?    Phosphorus oxychloride is unloaded and stored in an enclosed building vented to a scrubber to contain leaks and resulting vapors\n?    Special spill blanketing systems are provided in case of a spill which would minimize the formation of hazardous vapors\n?    Both API and plant standards are used to minimize the potential for a release, including design, installation, operation and maintenance of phosphorus oxychloride handling systems.\n\nThe risk of hydrogen chloride releases is minimized primarily through use of corrosion-resistant piping and vent scrubbing equipment. Atmospheric HCl sensors are installed to quickly detect a leak if one occurs.\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.
