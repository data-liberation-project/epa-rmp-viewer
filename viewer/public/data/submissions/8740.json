      "SummaryText": "The Litchfield Wastewater Treatment Facility is located at 1350 East Ryder Street, between East Ryder Street and the Litchfield Country Club. The facility uses one ton cylinders of chlorine for disinfection of the discharge. Four cylinders are kept on site at all times in a cinder block building. Two cylinders are kept on line and two are kept on stand by. The safety of the facility's employees and the community is our number one priority. The chlorination equipment is monitored on a daily basis and tested monthly. The facility is equipped with a leak detection system that will alert the employess at any time of day. All proper protective and repair equipment is kept on site. All employees attend training sessions to prepare them for a safe response and a safe repair. The Litchfield Fire Department has agreed to assist with evacuation, safety of the employees and community, chemical control, and repairs. The facility has not had a release in the past five years. To comply with the CleanAir Act Part 112R, Environmental Management Corporation (EMC) and the City of Litchfield have developed this Risk Management Program (RMP). The RMP contains two scenarios, a worst-case and an alternative. The worst case scenario is a release of an entire one ton cylinder in ten minutes. If this were to happen, it is a possibility that a chlorine cloud could reach 1.6 miles from the facility in approximately 40 minutes. The speed and direction of the chlorine cloud would depend on the wind speed and direction. During an event like this, the fire department would respond as well as the EMC personel to assist in public notification, evacuation, chemical control, and repair. The alternative release would be a release of 171 pounds of chlorine over one hour. The chemical cloud would not leave the facility's boundries. The facility will undergo a complete upgrade during 1999 and 2000. The chlorination system will be replaced. All regulating equipment will be done at the cylinders to minimiz"
