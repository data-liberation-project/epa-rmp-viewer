      "SummaryText": "The City of Hornell owns and operates a drinking water treatment plant (WTP) that stores and uses chlorine gas for drinking water disinfection. The City, including operators of the water treatment plant (WTP), is committed to the implementation and maintenance of safe procedures to maintain safe operation of the WTP chlorination system. Typically, the WTP stores two one-ton chlorine cylinders with one cylinder on-line and one cylinder on standby. Often an additional four to six 150 pound chlorine cylinders, and occasionally a third one-ton chlorine cylinder, are present as an emergency backup supply. \n\n\n\nThe chlorination system is a Program Level 3 covered by OSHA PSM and EPCRA section 302. WTP operators routinely complete on-site, hands on training in operations and response, review the chlorination system process and standard operating procedures, and complete daily inspections of the entire chlorination system as part of the chlorination system mechanical integrity program. Training, review, process hazard analysis (PHA), and compliance audits are completed on a routine, well-established schedule. The City Fire Department has participated in periodic reviews of operations and response requirements and procedures. Due to these preventive measures, there have been no releases of chlorine in the past five years. \n\n\n\nA chlorine leak detector connected to an alarm continuously monitors the system and vents, manual shutoffs, emergency backup power, and enclosures are in place and available in the event of a leak. The potential need for public evacuation has been discussed and planned for.\n\n\n\nThe WTP maintains an emergency response plan (ERP) as required by the New York State Department of Health (NYS DOH) (10 NYCRR Subpart 5-1.33). WTP operators, in coordination with City personnel, update the ERP at least every five years.  \n\n\n\nOver the coming year, the ERP and the WTP vulnerability assessment (VA) will be updated per existing NYS DOH requirements and new provisions w"
