The prevention program includes the following elements:\n \nEmployee Participation\n\nSummit Midstream encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Employee participation activities range from updating and compiling technical documents to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility RMP prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in the PSM program manual that is maintained at the facility and addresses each accident prevention program element. \n \nProcess Safety Information\n \nSummit Midstream maintains a variety of technical documents used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the Company are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information for the DAPL Valve Yard Expansion facility. \n \nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs).

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n \nSummit Midstream has conducted a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) to ensure that hazards associated with the various processes at the DAPL Valve Yard Expansion facility are identified and controlled. Within the PHA, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  The Company primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. The HAZOP methodology utilizes a systematic nodal approach to assess potential process deviations and associated risks.\n \nThe analyses are conducted using a team of people with operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when it believes such measures are necessary. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking is measured against the Summit Midstream risk matrix to ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive appropriate attention. \n \nOperating Procedures\n \nSummit Midstream maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary oper"

The specific details of the action plans are documented in the PSM/RMP program manual.  \n\nPlanned Changes for Improved Safety\n\nIdeas for changes to improve safety shall be actively sought from employees. Employee safety meetings that focus on chemical safety issues shall be held regularly at the plant. Employees will be encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards.\n\nProcess hazard analyses are conducted with key employees to meet the PSM/RMP requirements. During these sessions, recommendations are made for the purpose of improving safety and preventing accidental chemical releases. Each recommendation is considered for implementation. Though not all recommendations may be implemented, all will be considered.  The exercise has provided all affected employees with a heightened awareness of safety issues related to the covered process."
