      "SummaryText": "General Facility Overview: The Middle Georgia Calcine Facility consists of five calciners and associated equipment utilized to process kaolin  into calcined kaolin products.  The facility utilizes natural gas as a primary fuel and liquefied propane as a secondary fuel.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in liquefied form and made down into a water solution for use as a pH control agent in the crude kaolin blunging operations.\n\nAccidental Release and Emergency Response Policies:  This facility complies with NFPA 58 requirements for LP-Gas storage and ANSI Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous ammonia.  It is the policy of ECC International to comply with all applicable federal, state and local regulations.  If an emergency were to occur the Sandersville Fire Department and the Washington County EMA would be notified and requested to respond to the facility emergency.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario - Anhydrous Ammonia:  The facility's worst case scenario is the catastrophic release of the entire liquid contents of the 15,000 gallon (73,500 lbs) anhydrous ammonia tank.  RMP Comp estimates the distance to end point of 3.2 miles.  This areas encompasses the entire populations of Sandersville and Tenille with an estimated population of 9000 people.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios - Anhydrous Ammonia:  Two scenarios were developed.  Scenario 1 involves a pipe leak with an end point of 0.3 mi and no impact to residential areas.  The second involves a hole in the side of the tank with an end point of 0.5 miles with impact to the same areas as listed in the worst case Propane scenario.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario - Propane:  The facilities worst case scenario involving propane would be the release and detonation of the entire contents of four liquified propane tanks.  RMP Comp estimates the distance to end point of 0.4 miles.  This area encompasses a small section of a residential area comprised of Hillcrest, Lime, Reeves, Cooper, Wiggins and Spring Streets.\n\n"
