      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - UNILEVER ICE CREAM\r\n\r\nThis report contains the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the two ammonia refrigeration systems located at the Unilever Ice Cream facility in Henderson, NV. The RMP was prepared in accordance with the requirements of the EPA's Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).\r\n\r\nThe information presented in this report reflects the data element requirements of the EPA RMP submission. The Henderson facility has two distinct ammonia refrigeration system loops. These are designated as the 'East system' and the 'West system'. Many of the components and processes are similar in the two systems, however they do not intermingle.\r\n\r\nA. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nUnilever Ice Cream operates an ice cream production facility at 1001 Olsen Street in Henderson, NV. The facility operates two ammonia refrigeration systems to provide cooling and freezing capabilities. The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in each system is in excess of 10,000 pounds. Since ammonia releases from both systems could pose a risk of offsite public impact and both systems are regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the systems are subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's RM program.\r\n\r\nB. Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nUnilever Ice Cream recognizes management's responsibility in protecting the employees, equipment, property, and the environment. The safety and health of all personnel are very important. The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the Henderson facility.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish the Company's goal in controlling accidental losses, the facility has established a Plant Safety Program and a Plant Safety Team. The objectives of the Plant Safety Program are to: achieve maximum efficiency and safety performance, reduce losses associated which damage of property, and the economic burden re"

      "SummaryText": "sulting from injuries and accidents.\r\n\r\nOne of the activities associated with the Plant Safety Program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response programs which are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119), Nevada's Chemical Catastrophic Prevention Act and EPA's Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (40 CFR Part 68).\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs is to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\r\nThe Prevention Program consists of the following elements:\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation: This program involves the employees in establishing and implementing the program. Employees are also be involved when a process hazard analysis is conducted. The program also ensures that all employees have complete access to the program.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information: Written information has been collected which enables the employees to identify and understand the potential hazards in the systems. The written information includes the ammonia MSDS and a description of the design of the ammonia refrigeration systems.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis: Formal studies using the What-If Technique have been conducted to look at the systems and identify potential hazards.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures: Written, detailed procedures have been developed which describe the steps which should be followed to safely operate the ammonia refrigeration systems.\r\n\r\nTraining: A training program has been developed which ensures that employees are trained on all aspects of the systems and on the duties which they should perform to ensure the safe operation of th"

The contractors are also periodically evaluated to ensure that they perform work by following safe work practices.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Safety Review: A pre-startup safety review is completed for all new ammonia projects to verify that all safety programs are in place, training has been performed, and construction has been completed according to design standards before the project is put into use.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity: This program ensures that the ammonia refrigeration systems are built and maintained using preventive maintenance procedures to minimize unexpected breakdowns or failures.\r\n\r\nHot Work Permit: These procedures ensure that a signed permit is obtained prior to any cutting, welding, or burning.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change: The procedures are designed to ensure that all changes made to the ammonia refrigeration systems are properly reviewed.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation: The procedures ensure that any incidents (and near misses) are investigated, reviewed, and documented using an investigation team.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits: There are procedures to conduct regular audits of the program to ensure that the program is in place and working properly.\r\n\r\nC. Summary of Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\r\n\r\nAs stipulated in EPA guidelines, worst-case and alternate case release scenarios must be completed for the two regulated processes at the Unilever Henderson facility.  These off-site consequence analyses have been calculated and documented for the RMP submission and the results are on file at the Henderson facility as part of the overall RMP Plan\r\n\r\nD. Five-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere were no significant on-site or offsite consequences concerning the ammonia processes at the Henderson facility over the past five years. \r\n\r\nE.

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nChanges to improve safety were recommended to either the equipment (hardware recommendations) or the system operating / maintenance procedures (procedural recommendations) when the East Ammonia Refrigeration system was analyzed in a PHA during March 2012. The recommended changes have been evaluated and have been, or will be implemented."
