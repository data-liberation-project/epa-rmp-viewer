General accidental release and prevention policy of Merchants Terminal.\r\n\r\nIn this frozen food distribution center we utilize anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant.  Anhydrous\r\nammonia is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency. The same properties\r\nthat make ammonia a valuable refrigerant also makes it necessary to observe certain safety\r\nprecautions during it's use to prevent exposure to our workers, the surrounding community and\r\nthe environment.  It is our policy at Merchants terminal Corporation to implement the\r\nrequirements of the Risk Management Program by managing and operating this facility in full\r\ncompliance with all applicable federal and state regulations that we are governed by. The\r\nobjective is to minimize the risk of an accidental release of hazardous materials. Safety depends\r\ndirectly on our proper handling of ammonia. Our plant personnel have been trained on the\r\nequipment operating procedures and the various safety devices that are incorporated in our facility\r\nto prevent the possibility of accidental releases.\r\n\r\n2.  Stationary source and regulated substance handled.\r\n\r\nMerchants Terminal Corporation, 7950 Oceano Avenue, Jessup, Maryland is responsible for the\r\nstorage and distribution of various frozen food products. Merchants Terminal is located in an\r\nindustrial area of the suburban Baltimore area. In addition to our facility the surrounding\r\ncommunity houses other commercial businesses as well as residential areas.\r\nThere are approximately 34 employees at this facility which includes hourly and salary personnel. \r\nThis distribution facility receives and prepares shipment of frozen and refrigerated food products\r\nvia tractor trailers approximately 10 hours a day, five days a week.  \r\n\r\nThe potentially hazardous chemical used at the Merchant"

      "SummaryText": "s Terminal facility is Anhydrous\r\nAmmonia. Anhydrous ammonia, in a liquid and vapor physical state, is the chemical used in the\r\nrefrigeration process.  \r\nThe potential hazards that could lead to an accidental release of ammonia include, but are not\r\nlimited to, equipment failure, damage to piping, damage to equipment, human error, etc.\r\n \r\nAlthough ammonia is a colorless, tasteless liquid, it's dominant characteristic is it's pungent,\r\ndistinct odor.  Persons exposed to ammonia will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small\r\nconcentrations, although these levels would not normally result in any health risks. Risks from\r\naccidental exposure to ammonia in a vapor state are irritations to the eyes, nose and throat. The\r\nextent of irritation depends on the exposure amount and length of time exposed.  \r\nAmmonia is classified non-flammable by the Department of Transportation.  Ammonia will burn,\r\nbut only in a very narrow concentration level when accompanied with a constant ignition source.\r\n\r\nThe normal inventory level of ammonia that is used during the refrigeration process at the\r\nMerchants Terminal facility is 28,000 pounds.\r\n\r\n3. Worst case  and alternate case release scenarios including administrative and\r\nengineering controls to limit/ prevent accidental release.\r\n\r\nWorst case scenario depicts continuous source leak from the High Pressure Receiver (HPR)\r\nlocated inside the plant main machine room.  This vessels normal operating level is 6,500 pounds\r\nof liquid ammonia,  approximately 50% of it's total capacity. Although the high pressure receiver\r\nis capable of holding 13,000 pounds, this far exceeds company policy  and engineering controls\r\nwhich limits the liquid level to a maximum of 80% at any time.  Considering the \"catastrophic\"\r\npossibility does exist for this vessel to release it's entire contents, engineering controls\r\nincorporated into the system would normally prevent such a release.\r\n\r\n     Worst case release scenario criteria for Merchants Terminal"
