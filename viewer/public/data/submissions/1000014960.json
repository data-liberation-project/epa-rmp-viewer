This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as, personnel training on the proper operation and maintenance of plant equipment and preventative maintenance programs.  \n\nAmaizing has emergency response policies in place that are addressed in the facilities Health and Safety Plan, Industrial Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan, Spill Prevention Response and Countermeasures Plan, Facility Response Plan, and Emergency Response Action Plan.  Most of the listed Plans have a minimum of annual training requirements to keep employees educated on emergency response procedures in place at the facility.  New employees are required to read the Plans listed above and undergo training on emergency response procedures prior to initiating responsibilities onsite.\n\nAmaizing\u00c2\u00bfs policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nAmaizing is located in Denison, Crawford County, Iowa.  The facility operates 24 hours per day, seven (7) days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from the natural fermentation of corn.  The regulated substances stored at the facility are anhydrous ammonia and flammable mixture, natural gasoline (denaturant).\n\nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATE CASE SCENARIOS\nWorst Case Scenarios:\n1.\tAnhydrous Ammonia:  Anhydrous ammonia is stored as a gas liquefied by pressure in a 18,000 gallon aboveground steel tank.  The worst case scenario used is a release of the entire contents of the storage vessel, 97,20"

The ammonia tank sits on a concrete pad, passive mitigation was not included as part of this scenario.  The facility can elect to place a fence around the ammonia tank for security purposes; the typical chain link fence used to enclose the ammonia tank would not prevent migration of a release.  Public receptor information was obtained using 2009 US Census data for Denison City and Arion City, Iowa.  The Milwaukee Road Habitat Prairie is within the worst case distance to endpoint for ammonia. \n\n2.\tFlammable Mixture (Denaturant):  The flammable mixture stored onsite is natural gasoline, typically referred to as denaturant.  Natural gasoline is used onsite to denature ethanol prior to shipment off-site.   Denaturant is stored in a 100,000 gallon steel tank in the facility tank farm.  The tank is located within a diked containment structure that contains an impermeable liner with gravel overlay.  A worst case MSDS was used to determine initial RMP applicability.  The breakdown of reportable constituents is included as part of the determination documentation on file at the facility.  The worst case scenario used is the release of the entire contents of the denaturant tank, 560,000 pounds, causing a vapor cloud explosion.  Of the entire tank contents, only 190,400 pounds is reportable under CAA Section 112(r).   RMP Comp was used to determine the worst case distance to endpoint, the model results are kept in facility records.   Public receptor information was obtained using 2009 US Census data from Denison City, Iowa and the facility\u00c2\u00bfs knowledge of nearby residences.  No environmental receptors are affected by a worst case release of denaturant.  \n\nAlternate Scenarios:\n1.\tAnhydrous Ammonia:  The alternate scenario used for anhydrous ammonia is a release of 10,000 pounds due to a rupture disk/relief valve failure fro"

The alternate release duration assumed is 30 minutes with an atmospheric stability of F (as a worst case condition) and wind speed of 3.0m/sec.  The facility control room is manned 24 hours/day and would be alerted of the relief valve failure at the ammonia tank within minutes.  The emergency shutdown system installed at the facility has been considered in this scenario as active mitigation.  RMP Comp was used to determine the alternate distance to endpoint, the model results are kept in facility records.

No environmental receptors are affected by an alternate release of anhydrous ammonia.  \n\n2.\tFlammable Mixture (Denaturant):  The alternate scenario used for the flammable mixture is the release of 43,680 pounds of natural gasoline due to a tanker truck loadout spill, causing a vapor cloud fire.   The endpoint used was an over pressurization of 1 PSI, a worst case option.  Denaturant deliveries at the facility typically occur during normal business hours with a facility staff member overseeing loadout operations \u00c2\u00bf therefore a release at the loadout area could be ceased within minutes by manual overrides.  The loadout area also has a catchment basin with underground piping to secondary containment of the tank farm.   For this scenario passive and active mitigation was not considered, as the mitigation strategies currently in place would not contain a vapor cloud fire.  RMP Comp was used to determine the alternate distance to endpoint, the model results are kept in facility records. Of the 43,680 pounds of the flammable mixture, only 14,851 pounds was used in the RMP Comp model due to the breakdown of regulated constituents under CAA Section 112(r).  Public receptor information was obtained using 2009 US Census data"

Amaizing has listed the flammable mixture as Program 3 in the RMP as a worst case scenario.

The spill lasted for approximately two (2) hours.  Amaizing properly documented the release and response efforts and notified the IDNR, NRC, and LEPC within the required timeframes.  As a result of the spill, Amaizing revised operating procedures and provided additional training to personnel. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nAmaizing has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including the Health and Safety Plan and Facility Response Plan.  Amaizing also has an Emergency Response Action Plan that details evacuation and response procedures for spills and releases, fire, etc.  The Plans listed in this section have been prepared in accordance with applicable regulations, as necessary.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nAmaizing will continue to provide training programs to ensure the safety of employees and contractors."
