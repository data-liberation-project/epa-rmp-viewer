In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release at the facility.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM  \n\nAn emergency planning and response policy has been developed at the Danone North America facility and is maintained by the Environmental Health & Safety department.  It is based on Cal-OSHA\u0092s requirements for Emergency Action Plan (CCR Title 8, Section 3220).\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan contains procedures detailing how the facility will react to accidental ammonia releases and other emergencies such as fires, earthquakes, power outages, etc.  This policy has been coordinated with the local emergency service agencies including:  the City of Industry Fire Department, and the Los Angeles County Fire Department - Hazardous Materials Division.\n\nThe facility\u0092s Emergency Action / Response Policy includes the following elements:\n\n  --  Key Facility Personnel and Responsibilities\n  --  Outside Agency Notification Contact Information\n  --  Detailed Action Plans for Internal Departments"

The contractor is also assigned the duties to conduct the weekly, monthly, semi-annual, and annual preventative maintenance tasks.\n\nThe Danone North America ammonia refrigeration system has many safety design features including ammonia leak detectors, microprocessor controlled compressors with automatic safety cutouts, ASME certified pressure vessels, emergency stop controls, and an Emergency Refrigerant Control Box.  In addition, all pressure-rated vessels are equipped with mechanical pressure relief valves that automatically engage in case of a high pressure situation to ensure the integrity of the vessel and associated piping is protected.\n\nMuch of the safety of the refrigeration system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  The Danone North America facility, including the ammonia system, was designed and constructed in accordance with the recognized industry codes and standards, which specifically outline requirements for the design and operation of ammonia refrigeration system.  In addition to routine patrols and inspections at the facility by the security company, the facility has Utilities personnel on-site 24/7 who monitor for any abnormal conditions.\n\nAmmonia refrigeration systems do not experience any chemical reactions or internal corrosion.

Discussions range from outstanding corrective action items, to planned design changes to the ammonia system, to changes in plant personnel, to reviewing evacuation drill results, etc.  Significant issues that may be identified are brought to plant leadership to ensure appropriate resources are allocated.\n\nThe ultimate goal for Danone North America\u0092s PSM/RMP plan is to prevent accidental releases of ammonia, injuries / illnesses, and to avoid adverse impacts to the environment.  These programs enable our facility to operate the refrigeration system safely because they are based on the rules, procedures, and guidelines that govern the ammonia refrigeration system, as well as the broader ammonia refrigeration industry throughout the country.

The resulting high pressure ammonia vapor is routed to the condensers (outside), where fans and sprayed water are used to reject latent heat in the ammonia vapor to the atmosphere, causing the ammonia to condense to a high pressure liquid, which drains by gravity back into the High Pressure Receiver.\n\nMultiple auxiliary systems are in place to support the operational and safety requirements of the ammonia refrigeration system including:  ammonia leak detection, pressure relief system w/ water diffusion tank, emergency refrigerant control box, auto purger to remove non-condensible gasses, and a refrigeration control system.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nTo deal with the risks involved with ammonia refrigeration, policies and programs have been developed for the Danone North America facility to limit the risks of an accidental ammonia release and/or minimize the consequences of a significant ammonia release, fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.\n\nPolicies developed for the PSM/RMP programs include employee participation, process safety information, process hazard analysis, standard operating procedures, training, management of change + pre-startup safety review, mechanical integrity (inspections / testing / maintenance), hot work permit, contractor management, and incident investigation.
