This Executive Summary briefly reviews the major elements of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for Valero's dry mill ethanol production facility located in Jefferson, Wisconsin (Valero). This summary is presented in response to the requirements of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 (40 CFR 68) and Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act. The Valero ethanol facility is subject to the RMP rule due to the storage of aqueous ammonia, a regulated toxic substance, and natural gasoline, a regulated flammable mixture, above threshold quantities and the following policies relate to these regulated substances.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nValero is committed to protecting the environment and operating facilities in a manner that promotes the safety of employees and the general public. Management has adopted and implemented policies that adhere to applicable Federal and state rules and regulations. The design and construction of the facility has incorporated physical and operational safeguards to prevent accidental releases. Using the proper design, installation, operation and maintenance of equipment, and the training of our personnel, Valero is minimizing the hazard to human health and the environment from fires, explosions, or any unplanned sudden or non-sudden release of hazardous materials.\n\nIn the event that a release does occur, the facility's emergency response actions are described in its Emergency Response Plan. The Emergency Response Plan includes procedures to coordinate resonse actions with local emergency response personnel (i.e., law enforcement, fire, and rescue departments, emergency medical services, hospital and government personnel, etc.) as well as any potentially affected neighbors. In addition, the Emergency Response Plan is "

      "SummaryText": "used to familiarize local emergency response personnel with the types of material handled and internal emergency response procedures.\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\nThe Valero facility is a 110 million gallon per year nameplate corn-based dry-grind fractionation denatured ethanol fuel production plant. Ethanol is produced through the conversion of corn starch to sugars and then conversion of the sugars to ethanol (i.e., grain alcohol) through fermentation and distillation process.\n\nRegulated substances stored at the facility include aqueous ammonia, which is used for pH control and as a nutrient in the fermentation process, and natural gasoline, which is used as a denaturant in the ethanol fuel product.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nValero has programs in place to address accidental release prevention measures required by EPA, process safety management (PSM) requirements from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and notification requirements of EPA's Emergency Response and Community Right-to-Know regulations.\n\nEmployee Participation\nValero has developed an employee participation program. All process safety information incident investigations, compliance audits, operation procedures, emergency response plan, and records of management of change are available to the operation personnel at any time.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis and Process Safety Information\nValero purchased this facility as part of an asset purchase agreement in February 2010. Valero was unable to identify a PHA completed by the prior owner of the facility. As a result, Valero undertook its first PHA at the facility in August 2010. \n\nValero keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the facility. Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). The facil"

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, piping and instrument drawings.\n\nOperating Procedures and Training\nValero maintains written procedures that address process operations during normal, emergency, startup and shutdown situations. The facility develops and implements a training program for its employees involved in facility operations. \n\nContractors\nValero requires its on-site contractors to attend a training program and to follow Valero safe work practices. \n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews\nValero conducts a pre-startup safety review (PSSR) as may be required for its facility modifications that require a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nThe facility's mechanical integrity program includes inspections and equipment testing to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief systems, pumps, emergency shutdown systems, and controls in a safe operation condition.\n\nManagement of Change\nThe facility's management of change (MOC) program reviews proposed changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures, materials, and design conditions prior to implementation of the change. Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by a process change.\n\nIncident Investigation\nValero investigates incidents that result in, or could reasonably result in, a release of a regulated substance. Investigations will be undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent a similar release in the future.\n\nCom"

The audit will include a review of documentation and process safety information, inspection of the physical facilities, and interviews with all levels of plant personnel.\n\nAccident History\nThe facility has not had any accidents reportable for the regulated substances under RMP. \n\nEmergency Response Program\nValero maintains a written Emergency Response Program. The purpose of the Emergency Response Plan is to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The Emergency Response Plan addresses aspects of emergency response, including medical treatment, evacuation plans, and notification of local emergency response agencies and the public. In addition, Valero maintains, inspects, and tests emergency response equipment. Employees receive training as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. We work with the local fire department and emergency responders to ensure the proper execution of our plan. The emergency response program will be updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nAs a new owner of this facility, Valero will continue to evaluate and implement changes as necessary to improve safety at the facility. As it updates procedures affecting RMP, modifications will be submitted.\n"
