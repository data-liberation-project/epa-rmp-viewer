This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED\nSUBSTANCES\n\nThe Paulsboro Refinery operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products, including fuels and lubricants, from raw crude oil. The refinery produces several regulated flammables, such as propane and butane.  The refinery also produces hydrogen sulfide, which causes the removal of sulfur compounds from the refined products.  Two other regulated chemicals, hydrofluoric acid and chlorine, are used in the refining processes.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nThe worst case scenario (WCS) associated with toxic substances at the refinery is a failure of the hydrofluoric acid storage drum, releasing its maximum quantity (244,000 pounds) in ten minutes.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for administrative controls or active mitigation measures is allowed when developing this hypothetical scenario.  Therefore, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 20-PPM (0.016 milligrams per liter) for this WCS is 19 miles. \n\nThe alternative case scenario (ACS) for hydrofluoric acid is a small leak from a storage vessel.  The release rate is 1.5 pounds per minute for 10 minutes.  The distance from the leak source to the toxic end point is 0.06 miles, which does not extend outside of the refinery.\n\nThe alternate case scenario (ACS) for chlorin"

The distance from the source to the toxic endpoint is 0.1 miles, which does not extend outside of the refinery.\n\nThe alternate case scenario (ACS) for hydrogen sulfide is leakage from a pipe or fitting, releasing an estimated 2000 pounds of hydrogen sulfide. The distance from the source to the toxic endpoint is 0.3 miles, which could extend beyond the refinery boundary.\n\nThe WCS associated with a release of flammable substances at the refinery is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest LPG storage tank containing butane.  Using methods prescribed by the EPA, the entire tank inventory of 150,000 pounds is assumed to release, completely vaporize, and ignite, resulting in a VCE.  The maximum distance to the 1psi over pressure endpoint for this WCS is 0.24 miles.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for active mitigation measures allowed when developing this hypothetical scenario.\n\nThe alternate case scenario ACS for flammable substances at the refinery is a VCE resulting from the release of propane from a transfer releasing 2500 pounds of propane.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi over pressure endpoint for this event is 0.1 mile.  This event was selected as being a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response.  \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Paulsboro Refinery.  Processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, as well as New Jersey chemical safety regulations.  This summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Paulsboro Refinery encourages employees to participate in all face"

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the refinery accident prevention program.  The refinery Joint Health and Safety Committee facilitates much of the refinery safety communications.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Paulsboro Refinery keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis configuration information.  Specific departments within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  \n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response and exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address chemical safety concerns. For specific process areas, the refinery has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the Standard Operating Procedures manuals.  The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., alarms, interlocks and automatic shutdown systems).\n\nThe refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating, of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a bas"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Paulsboro Refinery primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  The PHA team findings are forwarded to management for resolution.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Paulsboro Refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings are documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Pa"

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by reviewing them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nOperator Training\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Paulsboro Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees and unit transfers receive basic operator training in refinery operations related to the process to which they are being assigned.  After successfully completing this training, a newly assigned operator receives on the job training from a qualified operator to learn unit specific duties and tasks. Operators demonstrate required qualification requirements through written tests, demonstrative skills and oral testing.  Once the Unit Supervisor has reviewed the qualification of the Operator, their progress is documented and they are released to perform their job responsibilities.  There are additional qualified operators working at the process unit for operator support.  In addition, operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  Operating procedure review and job rotation is performed every year.  Additional refresher testing, on all jobs for which an operator is qualified is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understoo"

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has procedures in place to ensure that contractors\n(1)    Perform their work in a safe manner,\n(2)    Have the appropriate knowledge and skills,\n(3)    Are aware of the hazards in their workplace, \n(4)    Understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, \n(5)    Understand and follow site safety rules, and\n(6)    Inform refinery personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. \n\nThis is accomplished by providing contractors with \n(1)    A process overview,\n(2)    Information about safety and health hazards,\n(3)    Emergency response plan requirements, and\n(4)    Safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  \n\nIn addition, the Paulsboro Refinery evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Refinery personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\nThe Paulsboro Refinery conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all-supporting systems are operationally ready. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Paulsboro Refinery has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown sy"

In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.  Maintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. \n\nInspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or an MOC team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Paulsboro Refinery incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and those proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Paulsboro Refinery has long standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology, procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Paulsboro Refinery promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to refinery management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.

Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  The audit team develops a report of findings and recommendations.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at the Paulsboro Refinery have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all covered processes at the Paulsboro Refinery.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) equipment failures and (2) human error.\n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, the Paulsboro Refinery has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\n\nRelease Detection\nThe refinery used computerized process controls, which provide capability to detect problems, which could lead to chemical releases.  In addition, chemical leak detection is provided for specific hazards (HF&H2S) where appropriate.\n\nRelease Containment Control\nThe refinery employs various measures to contain accidental release of hazardous materials, as listed below.\n\nProcess relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\nScrubber to neutralize chemical releases\nValves to permit isolation of"
