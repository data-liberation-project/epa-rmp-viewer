Carl Buddig has developed an Emergency Action Plan that contains procedures designed to maximize the safety of all employees, contractors, and visitors in the event of an emergency and also guard against environmental consequences.\r\n\r\nIII.\tFacility Identification\r\nThe Carl Buddig and Company facility is located at 50 West Taft Drive in South Holland, Illinois.  The facility is a producer of custom and specialty meat products. \r\n\r\nThe NAICS code for the facility is 311612. Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to preserve meat and meat products.   \r\n\r\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. There are two (2) refrigeration systems onsite that are used for refrigerating meat and meat products. \r\n\r\nThe amount of ammonia currently present in the east refrigeration system is approximately 16,000 pounds.  The east refrigeration system is used to cool production rooms, holding freezers, and the office area.  This system is a single stage system with five (5) high stage compressors.  Evaporators in the production areas are fed with high pressure liquid from the receiver, through the accumulator.\r\n\r\nThe amount of ammonia currently present in the west refrigeration system is approximately 14,000 pounds.  The west refrigeration system is used to cool production rooms and holding coolers.  It is a single stage system with three (3) high stage compressors.  Evaporators in the production areas are fed with high pressure liquid from the receiver, through the accumulator. \r\n\r\nThe total amount of ammonia onsite, considering the quantities in the east ammonia refrigeration system and the west ammonia refrigeration, is approximately 30,000 pounds, which is above the minimum threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds. \r\n\r\nAn aerial photo identifying the site location is included as Appendix A. \r\n\r\nIV.\tHazard Assessment - Worst Case Scenarios (WCS)\r\nAppendix B consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional inform"

Appendix D consists of the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the alternative release scenario. \r\n\r\n \r\nVI.\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and the EPA Risk Management Program.   However, as discussed through out this document Carl Buddig and Company is actively working on improving this program. \r\n\r\nThis prevention program covers those processes that handle ammonia above the threshold quantity for both PSM and RMP rules. The most recent audit of the PSM program was conducted on March 12, 2015, and the next audit will occur before March 12, 2018, in compliance with the requirement to conduct PSM audits every three years.  The elements of the PSM / Program 3 prevention program and a brief description are listed below.\r\n\u00bf\tEmployee Participation - Carl Buddig and Company has updated a site-specific employee participation plan that ensures employees and their representatives are consulted when conducting and developing process hazard analyses and other information required to be developed under the PSM/RMP regulation.

In addition, this program ensures PHAs are conducted in accordance with OSHA and EPA regulations and ensures findings and recommendations of PHAs are properly documented. Carl Buddig and Company conducted a thorough PHA study for the East and West ammonia refrigeration systems during September of 2014.\r\n\u00bf\tOperating Procedures - Carl Buddig and Company has updated a site-specific procedure that ensures operating procedures provide clear instruction for different phases of process operations and ensures they are properly maintained.  Carl Buddig and Company updated operating procedures for both the East and West refrigeration systems in February of 2015.  Annually, the operating procedures will be reviewed and certified as accurate.\r\n\u00bf\tTraining - Carl Buddig and Company has updated a site-specific training procedure that ensures employees operating the ammonia process have the knowledge to safely operate the process, are aware of the potential hazards of the process, and understand the causes of process problems.\r\n\u00bf\tManagement of Change - Carl Buddig and Company has updated a site-specific management of change procedure that ensures changes (except for replacement in kind) to the ammonia process, such as additions of new equipment or changes in operating, maintenance, or other procedures are documented. \r\n\u00bf\tPre-Startup Review - Carl Buddig and Company has updated a site-specific pre-startup safety review procedure that ensures a safety review is performed when modifications to the ammonia process are significant enough to require a change in PSI.\r\n\u00bf\tMechanical Integrity - Carl Buddig and Company has updated a site-specific mechanical integrity procedure that ensures written preventative maintenance procedures are developed and maintained,"
