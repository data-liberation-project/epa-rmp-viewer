Los Angeles\n\nCounty Department of Public Works is diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety\n\nof its employees and the neighboring community. Los Angeles County Department of Public Works staff is\n\ntrained and utilizes equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while effectively and safely\n\nusing chlorine.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICIES\n\nLos Angeles County Department of Public Works has a long standing commitment to worker and public\n\nsafety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as\n\npersonnel training, reputable contractors, and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and\n\nmaintenance of the Chlorination Process. Los Angeles County Department of Public Works policy is to\n\nimplement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nAs a result of the LADPW Acton and Antelope Valley Disinfection Conversion Project, the existing chlorine\n\ntreatment equipment and other accompanying work is being replaced with chloramine treatment\n\nequipment. With this advancement, LADPW is aiming to improve the water quality by reducing the formation\n\nof disinfection byproducts in water supplies. The disinfection byproducts such as trihalomethanes (THMs) and\n\nhaloacidic acids (HAAs) are strongly regulated by the EPA, due to their possible carcinogenic activity.\n\nChloramine, a more stable substitute of chlorine, is a chlorine-ammonia compound. Although chlorine is toxic\n\nat high levels, the concentrations used in disinfecting drinking water are low enough not to pose any risks to\n\nhuman health. Liquid chlorine is delivered to the facility in a one-ton container. The one-ton container is\n\ntransferred to the Chlorine ChlorTainer area by a trolley monorail system. The connected chlorine container\n\nis within a Ch"

Chlorine gas under pressure flows from the online container through a\n\nvacuum regulator that is directly connected to each ChlorTainer. The vacuum regulator reduces the chlorine\n\npressure to a vacuum. The chlorine gas is suctioned out of the container using vacuum pressure generated by\n\na flow of pumped water. No chlorine piping or tubing is under pressure outside the ChlorTainer. One gaseous\n\nchlorinator is installed adjacent to the ChlorTainer. The chlorinator meters and injects gaseous chlorine into\n\nthe raw water supply as it enters the Water Distribution pipeline. Chlorine is injected into the water in order\n\nto disinfect it and to prevent bacterial growth while the water travels through pipelines. Chlorine leak\n\ndetection and warning is provided by an immediate visual detection system. Special paint is applied near\n\npossible leak areas that turns from golden yellow to red when gas with a pH of 3 or less is present.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary Scenario Description:\n\nPer the CalARP Regulations, one worst case analysis has been defined for each covered process. The results\n\ncan be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment Tab in the\n\nCompliance Workbook. Alternative Release Scenarios Results Summary Scenario Description:\n\nTwo alternative case release scenarios were modeled. The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment\n\ndocumentation located behind the Hazard Assessment Tab in the Compliance Workbook.\n\n\n\nRISK CONSIDERATIONS\n\nAlthough the storage and use of chlorine has inherent potential risks, and worst case release scenarios can\n\npotentially reach the community; Los Angeles County Department of Public Works has recognized these\n\npotential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst case type of event non-cre"

In\n\naddition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make the worst case event noncredible,\n\nit should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of\n\nthe atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an\n\nevent. In addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential\n\nrelease, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with a\n\nrelease of a regulated substance:\n\nThe system has alarms and interlocks\n\nThe system undergoes periodic maintenance to reduce the likelihood of catastrophic failures\n\nGas detection is in place to notify individuals if a leak occurs\n\nThe chlorine container is located within a locked secondary containment vessel. The vessel is tamper proof\n\nand in the event of a release, would contain the contents of the chlorine preventing a release to atmosphere.\n\nThe facility has been subject to CalOSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) and California Accidental Release\n\nPrevention (CalARP) Program 3 since 2008 due to the use and storage of Chlorine above the threshold of\n\n1500 pounds and 100 pounds, respectively.

Increased storage to limit deliveries pushes the facility into the EPA\n\nRMP Program.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION\n\nThe key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by Los Angeles County Department of Public Works to manage process safety issues associated with the use of chlorine.
