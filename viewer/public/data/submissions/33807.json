Description of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nHunt Corporation (Hunt) is a manufacturing facility located in Statesville, North Carolina.  As a result of the manufacturing process, isopentane is stored at the facility in quantities that exceed the 10,000 pound threshold quantity specified by the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation.  The facility has one covered process that requires the facility meet Program 1 requirements under the EPA RMP regulation.  Hunt maintains a 10,000 gallon underground storage tank of isopentane which is used in the production of polystyrene foam products.  The isopentane is fed from the underground storage tank into the pump house, where it is pressurized to approximately 115 psi and fed in to one of the three extruders.\n\nSince the original 1999 RMP submission,   the facility has been issued a Title V permit. The permit ID number has been entered into the RMP Submit 2004.\n\n\nB.   Accidental Release Prevention & Emergency Response Policies of Hunt\n\nHunt is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards.  Appropriate responses to releases of regulated chemicals are documented in the Plant Safety Manual and Stormwater Spill Plan.   Safety, environmental protection and risk management programs are fully implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response efforts.\n\nC. Five-year Accident History\n\nUnder the EPA RMP regulations, an accidental release is defined as a release of a regulated substance that resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. Within the past five years, Hunt has had had no accidents. \n\nD. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Hunt facility complies with the"

The facility also complies with all applicable state and local codes and regulations.\n\nIn 2003, the isopentane pumps were relocated outside. This change was in response to a recommendation from our causality insurer to reduce the fire risk at the site. \n\nE. Emergency Response Program\n\nEmployees at the Hunt facility will only respond to incidental releases of isopentane where the release can be absorbed, neutralized, or otherwise controlled at the time of release by employees in the immediate release area, or by maintenance personnel. For non-incidental releases Hunt will rely on outside responders, therefore, they do not have to comply with OSHA 1910.120 and do not have to develop and Emergency Response Program under 40 CFR 68.95. \n\nF. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nBy meeting the Program 1 eligibility requirements, Hunt believes that the existing safety program is adequate. However, if any changes occur in the future which affect the isopentane process, these changes will be thoroughly reviewed to ensure that the safety of Hunt employees and neighbors is not compromised."
