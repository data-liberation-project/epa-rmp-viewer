It is our belief that\r\nthose things that contribute to safe operations also improve\r\nquality and reduce costs.   This commitment to safety can be\r\nseen in the investment of resources made for accident\r\nprevention.   These efforts include extensive employee\r\ntraining and a systematic approach to safety in the design,\r\ninstallation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.\r\nOur policy is to implement effective controls to prevent\r\nforeseeable releases of dangerous substances.  To supplement\r\nthese controls, additional safeguards are provided to reduce\r\nthe impact of a release should one occur in spite of all\r\nprecautions.

The\r\nimmediate area surrounding this plant is open undeveloped\r\nland to the north, industrial development including Ferro\r\nCorporation and residential zoned areas lie to the west,\r\ncommercial/residential-zoned areas to the south, and the\r\nTrinity River to the east.\r\n\r\nSpecialty surfactant manufacturing has been conducted at\r\nthis location since 1974.  This facility makes a variety of\r\nspecialty surfactants that are used in industrial and\r\nagricultural applications throughout the world.  The plant\r\nis operated 24 hours per day, seven days per week.  Plant\r\nmanufacturing activity can be categorized into 4 major\r\nproduct lines employing a total of 44 people.  During normal\r\noperations, the plant is staffed by 5 hourly plant operators\r\nand 1 quality control technician.  Four maintenance\r\npersonnel and nine managers"

Operators are organized as\r\nteams with extensive cross training enabling personnel to\r\nfunction in multiple roles.\r\n\r\nOne of the four major product lines produced at this\r\nfacility is the Morwet D-425 Dispersant.   This product was\r\nfirst produced in 1978.    35% formaldehyde solution is\r\nreacted with a sodium naphthalene process intermediate in\r\ntwo batch reaction vessels.   The final product of this\r\nprocess is a water-based surfactant with highly efficient\r\ndispersant properties.   This product is used in\r\nagricultural product formulations to retard sedimentation of\r\nwater dispersible granules such as herbicides, insecticides,\r\nand fungicides.    The formaldehyde solution is supplied\r\nfrom a 10,400-gallon storage tank.   The maximum intended\r\ninventory is limited to 9824 gallons due to the presence of\r\nhigh level warning systems and procedures that prevent\r\nmaterial additions beyond this level.\r\n\r\nA minor product line involves the manufacture of naphthalene\r\nbased products.   One of those products, scheduled for\r\ninitial production in August 1999, is Di-Isopropyl\r\nNaphthalene.   This product is a process intermediate that\r\nis further processed at another Akzo Nobel Industrial\r\nSpecialties facility before being sold as an oil field\r\ndrilling aid.   This initial manufacturing phase involves\r\nthe reaction of propylene gas with naphthalene in the\r\npresence of a catalyst.   These two processes were\r\nidentified during an evaluation of this facility's inventory\r\nof raw materials, finished products, and process\r\nintermediates to determine if any regulated flammable or\r\ntoxic substances used or stored on site exceeded the\r\nthreshold quantity.

In selecting this\r\nscenario, operating experience suggested a scenario\r\ninvolving a hose failure represented a more credible release\r\nscenario than others considered.  In this scenario, a hose\r\nor hose fitting failure results in a release from a tank\r\ntruck during the process of unloading.  The release consists\r\nof a 200 gallons per minute stream that continues for a\r\nperiod of ten minutes.  Endpoints for toxic substances\r\nremain the same as for the worst-case.   Those parameters\r\nthat significantly influence differences in the scenario's\r\noutcome include wind speed and ambient temperature.  In the\r\nworst-case release, an ambient temperature of 112\u00f8 F and\r\nwind-speed of 1.5 meters per second is assumed.  In the\r\nalternative release case, more typical conditions are used.\r\nThis includes a temperature of  77\u00f8F  and a wind-speed of 3\r\nmeters per second.   The expected reduction in evaporation\r\ndue to lower ambient temperatures is offset by the greater\r\nwind-speed.  Because of this, the release rate actually\r\nincreases.

Process\r\ntemperature is monitored from a control room where flow\r\nrates may be adjusted as needed.   Should a release occur in\r\nspite of these controls, secondary containment systems are\r\ndesigned to limit the movement and surface area.  All\r\nprocess activities are attended by operating personnel who\r\nare knowledgeable of process hazards and procedures for\r\nconducting emergency shutdowns.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.6.2 Di-Isopropyl Naphthalene Process Safeguards\r\nThe shipping container meets strict DOT requirements for\r\ncontainers shipping liquefied petroleum gases.   All\r\ntransfers are carried out in well-ventilated areas that\r\nlimit potential accumulations of flammable gas.   Two\r\noperations personnel attend transfers to ensure proper\r\nmonitoring of the operation.    Emergency shutoff valves are\r\nlocated away from the unloading connections to facilitate\r\ntheir quick employment if needed.   Pressure relief systems\r\nprevent overpressure conditions for both the shipping\r\ncontainer and the process reactor.  The process reactor is\r\nprotected from process deviations in pressure or\r\ntemperatures through a system of interlocks, which\r\nautomatically stops the transfer of propylene under upset\r\nconditions. The pressure relief system for the reactor is\r\npiped to a safe location away from other processes. The\r\nprocess reactor relief system is connected to an alarm to\r\nsignal operations personnel if a relief event occurs.   The\r\nunloading pipeline system is equipped with an emergency\r\nshutdown system that may be employed from a safe distance in\r\nthe event of a hose failure during material transfer.  It is\r\nalso equipped with a fusible link shutoff valve that is\r\ndesigned to automatically close if exposed to the heat of a\r\nfire.  Equipment ground systems are installed to prevent\r\nstatic electricity buildup during material transfers.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.6.3 Employee Participation\r\nAkzo Nobel Industrial Specialties employee"

Incident\r\ninvestigation reports are retained for at least 5 years to\r\nfacilitate their use during PHA updates and revalidation.\r\n\r\n1.6.14 Compliance Audits\r\nTo assure that the goals of the accident prevention programs\r\nare met, program performance is periodically evaluated in\r\nthe form of compliance audits.   An audit team reviews\r\nrecords and documents to determine the degree of program\r\ncompliance.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every\r\n3 years.   Audit team findings are documented and presented\r\nto plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions\r\ntaken in response to audit findings are tracked until they\r\nare complete.

The plan consists of procedures for\r\nresponding to a release of formaldehyde, including the\r\npossibility of a fire or explosion.  These procedures\r\naddress notification and emergency signals, specific\r\ncontainment actions, and proper first aid and medical\r\ntreatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for\r\npersonnel after an evacuation, notification of local\r\nemergency response agencies and the public if a release\r\noccurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination\r\nrequirements.  In addition, the plant has procedures that\r\naddress maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency\r\nresponse equipment.  All personnel entering the Akzo Nobel\r\nIndustrial Specialties Fort Worth Plant receive some level\r\nof orientation which contains instruction in emergency\r\nsignals and actions to be taken during an emergency.\r\nSpecific employees are trained to Hazardous Materials\r\nTechnician level for actively responding to hazardous\r\nmaterials emergencies.  These personnel are sufficiently\r\ntrained to deal with most hazardous materials emergencies\r\nthat might occur in this facility.  I"

All employees are\r\ntrained as first responders at the awareness level and in\r\nprocedures for cleaning up small spills based on their work\r\nassignments.\r\n\r\nOverall emergency response programs are coordinated with the\r\nFort Worth Fire Department.  This coordination includes\r\nbriefings and information sharing to address specific\r\nconcerns in the event of an incident at the plant.  The Akzo\r\nNobel Industrial Specialties Fort Worth Plant has around-the-\r\nclock communications capability with the Fort Worth Fire\r\nDepartment.   This department has the capability to\r\ncommunicate to all state, federal and county agencies and\r\nmay draw on whatever resources or equipment are needed to\r\neffectively manage emergency operations (i.e., fire-fighting\r\nequipment, manpower, ambulances, hospitals, law enforcement,\r\nand HAZMAT operations).  This provides a means of notifying\r\nthe public of an incident, if necessary, as well as\r\nfacilitating a quick response to an incident.   Akzo Nobel\r\nIndustrial Specialties' Fort Worth Plant conducts drills\r\nannually to assess personnel readiness, proficiency and the\r\neffectiveness of emergency response plans.\r\n\r\n1.10 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nAkzo Nobel Industrial Specialties' Fort Worth Plant is\r\nconstantly striving to improve process safety, quality, and\r\nefficiency.   Several noteworthy improvements scheduled for\r\nthe future include\r\n\r\n\u00fa    Improvements to the tank truck unloading station which\r\n  involve installation of  dedicated pump and hose systems\r\n  which significantly reduce the risk of an off-loading mishap\r\n\u00fa    Spill containment area reductions that reduces the\r\n  surface area size of a spill in off-loading areas.  Reduced\r\n  surface area significantly reduces any resulting vapor\r\n  emissions in the event of an emergency.\r\n\r\n__________________________"
