We operate our business in a manner that consciously safeguards our employees, customers and the communities in which we do business. \n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Twin Oaks Facility, located in Bremond, TX, is a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system for reduction in NOx (nitrous oxides) emissions from their stack gases. Anhydrous ammonia is stored on-site in one dedicated, specially designed storage tank. The storage tank is supplied with anhydrous ammonia on demand. The storage capacity of the tank exceeds the threshold quantity for RMP applicability. \n\n\n\nOff-site Consequence Analysis (OCA)\n\nPlease refer to OCA data located onsite at the Twin Oaks Facility. \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe Twin Oaks Facility is subject to OSHA's PSM standard and Program 3 of EPA's RMP rule. The accidental release prevention program at this facility includes: \n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nAll Twin Oaks Facility employees are actively encouraged to participate in the accidental release prevention program. Each employee is urged to participate in the continual upgrading and maintaining of all health and safety programs. Employee involvement is achieved through direct participation on a voluntary basis, active consultation with affected employees, and representative participation in the process hazard analysis. Employees have access to all information required under the PSM and RMP regulations. \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\n\nThe Twin Oaks Facility maintains a variety of technical documents to ensure that process hazards are understood and that the plant is operated and maintained in a safe manner. These documents include information concerning the hazards of anhydrous ammonia, process technology, and process equipment. PSI data is updated when changes in the process occur.

Information concerning the process technology includes process flow information, maximum intended inventory information, safe upper and lower process limits, and consequences of deviating from safe limits.\n\nInformation concerning the process equipment includes the materials of construction, piping specifications, piping and instrument diagrams, relief design calculations and design basis, design codes and standards employed, and safety systems. \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Twin Oaks Facility has a comprehensive PHA program to ensure that hazards associated with the ammonia process are systematically identified and controlled. The analysis is conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements, generally accepted industry standards, and guidance from safety organizations such as the Center for Chemical Process Safety. The plant has a system in place to ensure that PHA recommendations are resolved in a timely manner. \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Twin Oaks Facility maintains written operating procedures that address the various modes of process operations, including initial startup, normal startups and shutdowns, emergency shutdowns, emergency operations, normal operations and temporary operations. The procedures also discuss safe upper and lower process limits, consequences of deviation from the safe limits, and how to return the process to safe operations. The procedures are readily available to operations personnel, and are reviewed and certified annually. Safe work practices such as hot work, lockout and line breaking, are referenced in operating procedures, where applicable. \n\n\n\nTraining\n\nAll operations personnel at the Twin Oaks Facility are initially trained in an overview of the ammonia process and the procedures to safely operate the process. Operations personnel receive refresher training every three years. \n\n\n\nC"

Because some contractors will work on or near the ammonia process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors are pre-qualified before performing work, aware of the hazards of the process, understand what to do in the event of an emergency, understand site safety rules, and inform plant personnel of any hazards they encounter during their work.

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety systems, procedures, training, and equipment are prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accidental release prevention programs are properly implemented. \n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Twin Oaks Facility has implemented practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief systems, controls, pumps and emergency shutdown systems, in a safe operating condition. The program includes: (1) the development of a maintenance schedule for equipment in the ammonia process and critical safety equipment, (2) developing written maintenance procedures, (3) conducting maintenance training, (4) performing and documenting inspections, (5) correcting identified equipment deficiencies, and (6) applying quality assurance measures to ensure replacement equipment meets the req"

The hot work permit program is designed to control heat and spark-producing activities and to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before work begins in the process area. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n \n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe Twin Oaks Facility has a system in place to ensure safety concerns associated with changes to the ammonia process are reviewed and addressed prior to changes meeting the PSM/RMP criteria. The changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls and safety systems are in place to manage any new hazards as well as to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. The system requires that process safety information and operating procedures are updated and that operations and maintenance personnel are trained before the change is implemented. \n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Twin Oaks Facility promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or could reasonably be expected to result in, the release of ammonia. The findings of the investigation, along with any corrective actions taken to prevent recurrence of the incident, are reviewed with all affected personnel (including contractors). \n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo ensure that the accidental release prevention program is functioning properly, the Twin Oaks Facility conducts compliance audits every three years.
