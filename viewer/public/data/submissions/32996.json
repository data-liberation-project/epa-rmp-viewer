      "SummaryText": "\nThe Wine Group d.b.a Franzia, McFarland's Risk Management Plan details the chain of command and the authority of the individuals assigned to manage the RMP.\n\nThe accidental release prevention measures and emergency response policies are based on knowledge of the systems and training on how to prevent releases and control (minimize) releases should they occur.  Accidental release prevention is accomplished by routine insepction of the integrety of the process systems, reporting of any detected odors immediately to management and to maintain operation logs on systems.  Training on the ammonia refrigeration system is scheduled prior to the peak harvest season (August thru November) for all maintenance and cellar employees so that any releases will be minimized by understanding controls on and knowledge of the system.\n\nThe two regulated substances handled by Franzia, McFarland are anhydrous liquid ammonia and anhydrous sulfur dioxide.  Anhydrous liquid ammonia is used in the plant's refrigeration system and is stored in two (2) separate ammonia receivers and the piping used to move the ammonia from compressor to heat exchanger and back to the receiver.  The sulfur dioxide is used as a wine/juice antioxident and preservative.  It is delivered to the facility in portable, one ton cylinders. Sulfur dioxide is added to wine/juice through the use of portable addition cylinders ranging from 6 lbs to 100 lbs in capacity.\n\nIn the case of liquid anhydrous ammonia, a worst case and three (3) alternate accidental release scenarios were evaluated.  The worst case scenario modeled a catastrophic tank failure of the largest ammonia receiver.  Although the ammonia would actually pool under that condition, the worst case model reflects the release entirely as a gas over a 10-minute period.  The three (3) other alternative ammonia release scenarios reflect a tank failure leading to a liquid pool, a pressure relief valve failure (40 minutes) and a compressor seal failure (60 minutes) le"

      "SummaryText": "ading to gas releases.  Administrative controls for the ammonia system outlined in the RMP include written emergency shut down procedure. \n\nIn the case of sulfur dioxide, a worst case release and two (2) alternate scenarios were analyzed.  The worst case scenario  modeled a catastrophic one ton cylinder failure and subsequent 10-minute release of  gas vapor.  The alternative scenarios include a tank rupture leading to a liquid pool formation and the failure of the tank pressure relief valve leading to a gas release.  Administrative controls for sulfur dioxide in the RMP include visual and sensory inspection and disaster preparedness.  Additionally, the ammount of sulfur dioxide used at any one period has been reduced from the previous owners of the facility.\n\nFor both regulated substances, the worst case release scenarios were modeled using the RMP-Comp (NOAA) model aproved by the EPA.  All release scenarios were modeled using both the EPA DEGADIS and RMP-Comp methods.  Additionally the McFarland facility has had no accidents involving regulated substances in the past six (6) years.\n\nFranzia McFarland's emergency response programs (ammonia and sulfur dioxide) includes detailed procedures for responding to an injured employee, evacuation procedures and emergency notification control phone numbers.  Detailed first aid procedures for responding to ammonia and sulfur dioxide injuries are also included in the plan.  Other components of the emergency response plans include:\na) Emergency utility shut off procedures\nb) PPE use and care\nc) Coordination with Fire and Hazmat reposnse teams\n\nIn Spring 2004 a training day was held in conjunction with the local fire department.  Tank entry, lock-out tag-out, ammonia and sulfur dioxide safety was discussed.  Franzia, McFarland will continue to work closely with the local emergency responders to help them understand the nature and location of potential hazards in the facility."
