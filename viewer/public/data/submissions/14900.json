      "SummaryText": "Facility Overview: The Red Star Yeast & Products (Red Star) facility in Baltimore, Maryland is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Universal Foods Corporation, headquartered in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  Red Star manufactures yeast for sale to the baking and brewing industries and for retail consumers.\n\nThe facility is regulated under EPAs Accidental Release Prevention Provisions (40 CFR 68) and is required to submit this RMP due to onsite storage and use of anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is used in refrigeration processes at the plant as well as a raw material for making approximately 30% aqua ammonia solution.  The aqua ammonia is used as a nutrient in the yeast manufacturing process.  The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system has a total charge of 16,000 pounds of ammonia.  An 18,000-gallon storage tank of anhydrous ammonia is present at the site to store anhydrous ammonia prior to use in making aqua ammonia.  Three aqua ammonia storage tanks are present at the site, each with a maximum capacity of 12,000-gallons.\n \nChemical Safety Overview:  The facility's overall approach and commitment to chemical safety is demonstrated by 1) the existing management, training, operating procedures and maintenance systems in place at the facility, and 2) the hazard assessment, prevention program and emergency response provisions implemented specifically for anhydrous and aqua ammonia as part of the RMP requirements. If an emergency were to occur in any of the covered processes, an emergency response program has been developed and would be implemented.  This program includes coordination with the local fire department. \n\nRelease Scenarios:  The worst-case release scenario following EPA guidelines was represented by a release of anhydrous ammonia from the refrigeration system.  The alternative release scenario for anhydrous ammonia was represented by a gaseous leak from one of the evaporative condensers in the refrigeration system.  For aqua ammonia, the altern"

      "SummaryText": "ative release scenario resulted from a malfunction of the scrubber operated at the plant to control ammonia emissions.  \n\nFive-Year Accident History:  The facility has not had any accidents in either of the anhydrous or aqua ammonia systems in the past five years. \n\nPrevention Program:  The facility has implemented a Program 3 Prevention Program for the anhydrous ammonia processes and a Program 2 Prevention Program for the aqua ammonia process in accordance with US EPA and industry standards.  These prevention program provisions are specifically intended to minimize the probability and/or consequences of any accidental releases from either the anhydrous or aqua ammonia processes at the facility. The facility prevention program is an ongoing system based on periodic training, process hazard reviews, incident investigations, audits, procedure revisions, and RMP revisions and updates as required to reflect facility change and RMP requirements.  \n\nEmergency Response Program: The facility has coordinated response with the Baltimore City Fire Department to ensure that any accidental release from the ammonia processes will be appropriately addressed.\n\nSafety Management and Changes:  The facility is committed to ensuring its operations are safe and in accordance with all RMP requirements, and has established a senior manager responsible for RMP development, implementation and compliance.  This manager will ensure that the appropriate changes occur as necessary to maintain/improve safety, conduct ongoing hazard reviews, training, audits, maintenance and investigations will be conducted as required."
