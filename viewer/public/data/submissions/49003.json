American Cold Storage has been in operation at this facility for over 30 years, providing over 20 jobs to the local community.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nIn this facility, we use Anhydrous Ammonia, which is considered hazardous by the EPA.  This chemical must be used to provide cooling for the storage.  It is our policy to have programs in place dealing with safety precautions for handling these substances and to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own health, as well as to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ammonia, combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, as well as the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\nAmerican Cold Storage is committed to protecting the health of its employees, the surrounding community, and the environment; therefore, it is American Cold Storage?s policy to maintain compliance with 40 CFR 68 as well as Occupational Safety and Health Organization (OSHA)?s Hazardous Operations and Emergency Response regulations (29 CFR 1910.120). \n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nAmerican Cold Storage is not subject to 112(r), of the Clean Air Act, because ammonia, a regulated substance, is not present in any single system, at the facility in amounts greater than 10,000 pounds.  \n\nAmerican Cold Storage is required to maintain low temperatures, which are within standards required by the United St"

American Cold Storage uses anhydrous ammonia (the 112(r) regulated substance) as a refrigerant to maintain the facility within the required range of operating temperatures. American Cold Storage?s refrigeration system, consisting of receivers, compressors, evaporators, condensers, and piping in two systems contains a maximum amount of 17,920 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The larger of the two systems contains 9,420 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is designed and constructed in accordance with ANSI/IIAR 2-1992 Standard for Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigerating Systems.  To prevent and mitigate accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia, American Cold Storage has implemented several precautionary measures.  \n\nAmerican Cold Storage has implemented evaluated and engineered against anhydrous ammonia releases.  Some of the controls installed to prevent catastrophic releases of ammonia are: process equipment (vents, pressure relief valves, backup pumps, and manual shutoffs) and automated controls (electrical distribution system grounding).  In addition, Louisville?s Fire Department HazMat team responds to any ammonia release at the facility.  Seven American Cold Storage personnel are trained to respond to potential ammonia releases (HazMat).\n\nAmerican Cold Storage has developed work order procedures and plans to develop standard operating procedures, which incorporate safety measures into the procedures, for all employees and contractors who have contact with the ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety procedures were developed by the safety team and will be reviewed annually.  American Cold Storage encourages employee participation in development of the control measures used at the plant by means of key employee participation at meetings and an open door policy regarding concerns or sugg"

Any changes to the operating procedures will be communicated to affected employees by following written management of change procedures established by American Cold Storage.\n\nAmerican Cold Storage understands that maintaining the refrigeration system in good working order is essential to preventing accidental releases; therefore, American Cold Storage has implemented a preventative maintenance program.  The preventative maintenance program is scheduled, documented and managed using computer maintenance management to ensure that regular maintenance occurs on the system\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nOver the last five years, American Cold Storage experienced one on-site release.\n\nOver the last five years, American Cold Storage has not experienced an accidental off-site release of anhydrous ammonia from the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program \n\nAmerican Cold Storage has documented emergency response procedures in a document entitled AMERICAN COLD STORAGE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN, to facilitate response efforts in the event of an off-site anhydrous ammonia release.  Included in the response plan are measures to be taken internally by American Cold Storage.\n\nAmerican Cold Storage has trained four (4) on-site personnel to respond to accidental ammonia releases.  University of Louisville provided the last training session in March, 2007 for the following personnel:\n\nGreg Logsdon \nJoe Lile \nRobert Corbin \nLarry Hagen\n\n\nThese personnel are trained in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120, OSHA?s Hazardous Operations and Emergency Response regulations according to their duties and function.  \n\nTo plan for an ammonia release with off-site effects, American Cold Storage includes procedures/equipment to mitigate the release, procedures to inform local response agencies, and procedures for public communication.\n\nIn addition to the above local response agencies, American Cold Storage has available emergency response assistance from the Louisville Fire D"
