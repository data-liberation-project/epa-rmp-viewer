This state of the art system is operated 24/7 by experienced, licensed refrigeration management and operators. \n\nOver one half of the plant is protected by an automatic sprinkler system where flammables and combusible materials are either used or stored.  The balance of the facility is of concrete and metal construction.  The sprinkler system is monitored by a remote alarm system which is supervised by security personnel which are on site 24/7.  \n\nThe plant has a Waste Water Pre-Treatment Plant on site to ensure all waste water is within St. Joseph Waste Water Permit specifications before being released to the city waste water system.  Storm water runoff is managed by the use of detention ponds on the site. \n\nAll employees are trained per OSHA, EPA regulations and other mandated industrial standards, including Hazards Communications which instructs employees on the particular hazards and proper handling of the cleaning and sanitizing chemicals used in the plant.  Particular emphasis is placed on the reporting of spills and releases or any other unusual events.\n\nTriumph Foods has written emergency action and response plans which identify potential emergencies and the steps to be taken to safetly remove all employees from harms way in the event incidents should arise.  A Health Services Department is staffed by nurses on both production shifts and supplemented with designated First Aid/CPR/AED responders throughout all departments and shifts to provide medical for employees.\n\nEmergency declaration is done via radio and/or telephone to designated Emergency Coordinators, w"
