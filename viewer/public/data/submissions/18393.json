Facility information\n\tThe primary activity of our facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for\nsale to farmers.\n\tAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application\nas a crop production nutrient.\n\tThe maximum quantity stored would be 80,650 pounds in our 18,000 gal.  \nstorage tank.\n3. The worst case release scenario and the alternate release scenario.\nA. The worst case release scenario would be the release of the entire contents of \nof our storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity\n\treleased would be pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 87%\n\tcapacity as limited by design standards. The distance to toxic endpoint is 4.2 miles.\nB. The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential  incident\n\tis a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to toxic endpoint is 0.3 mile.\n4. Accidental release prevention program.\n\tOur facility has implemented the provisions of  \" Safety requirements for the \n\tStorage and handling of anhydrous ammonia ,K61.1\" published by the American\n\tNational Standard Institute (ANSI) and the Standards of the Occupational  Safety\n\tand Health  Administration  (OSHA) 29 CFR 1910.111 \" Storage and Handling\n\tof  Anhydrous Ammonia.\"\n5.
