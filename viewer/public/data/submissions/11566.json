The Company's products are distributed throughout the United States and Puerto Rico. Suiza strives to manufacture and distribute products that are an integral part of consumers' lives; to constantly delight consumers and customers with the quality, value, and innovative nature of its products; and to responsibly increase value for its shareholders\n\nMorningstar Foods Inc, Fullerton is part of The Morningstar Group owned Suiza Foods Corporation.  It is our corporate and company policy to provide every employee a safe and healthy workplace.  The personal health and safety of each employee is our first concern and top priority.  Management will provide a safe and healthy workplace to the greatest degree possible.  Our efforts for personal safety and health shall be in keeping with the highest standards.\n\nManagement has every desire to provide for its employees a safe working environment.  To accomplish this, management will provide all reasonable safeguards to ensure safe working conditions.  No job is so important and no order is so urgent that we cannot take time to perform our work safely.\n\nWe will maintain a safety and health program conforming to the best practices of occupational safety.  To be successful, such a program must embody the proper attitudes toward injury and illness prevention on the part of both supervisors and employees.  It also requires cooperation in all safety and health matters, not only between supervisor and employee, but also between each employee and his or her co-workers.  Only through such a cooperative effort can an outstanding safety record be established and preserved.\n\n\nTHE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO (S) AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO (S)\n\nThe following scenarios were modeled using the followi"

The CalARP regulations require the analysis of a worst-case release scenario specific to the vessel in the system which holds the greatest amount of pressurized liquid, and would be released as a gaseous liquid release in a 10 minute period (Section 2750, c, 1).  The release rate must be assumed to be one-tenth the total quantity.  The pressurized liquid receiver is the largest vessel in the system and is a dedicated liquid reservoir for anhydrous ammonia.  The estimated release quantity for the scenario of this system is 4,650 pounds.  This assumes the failure of any administrative controls, or passive mitigation measures to the system.  The resultant release then is assumed to be at a rate of 465 pounds per minute.\n\nThe CalARP regulations require the use of the parameters stated in section 2750.2 in order to estimate the distance to the toxic endpoint for a worst-case scenario.  The table below lists the parameters.  These parameters are from the guidance given in Section 2.0 for the 'EPA Model Program.'  The guidance is as follows:\n\n7 Wind speed:  1.5 meters per second\n7 Atmospheric stability class:  'F'\n7 Height of release:  ground level\n7 Surface roughness:  urban topography based on the use of surrounding properties\n7 Ambient temperature/humidity:  25 degrees centigrade and 50% humidity\n7 Model classification for anhydrous ammonia:  Dense or neutrally buoyant gases\n7 Model classification for temperature assumed at substance release:  25 degrees centigrade \n\nThe toxic endpoint for ammonia is 0.14 mg/l or 200 parts per million (ppm).

      "SummaryText": " definition of exposure of  'safe' airborne concentration (Section 2.1.1) of the model the interpolation of the toxic endpoint for the release of 4,650 pounds of ammonia is 1,584 feet (0.3 miles).  This is based on the release of the specified vessel under the qualified weather conditions.\n\nThe estimated population within the worst-case release scenario radius constitutes a mixture of commercial, industrial and residential receptors.  Based on information from EPA Marplot Software the estimation of effected population is approximately 1830 people.      \n \n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe CalARP regulation requires that the facility evaluate a release scenario that is more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario and that will reach an endpoint offsite (Section 2750.4,b, 1).  Using the 'EPA Model Program' definitions for this type of release a typical scenario line rupture with an orifice leading to an airborne release (Section 2.2.2) for the high pressure side of the system will have a corresponding release of 465 pounds of ammonia per minute.  This coupled with the data for evaluation for the corresponding section describes a wind speed of 3 meters per second and an atmospheric stability class 'D'.  Therefore, the predicted distance to the toxic endpoint is 1,056 feet. \n\nThe estimated population within this release scenario is 800 people. Employees of the facility, commercial businesses and the residences bounded by the plant to the south would be effected.  This population estimate is based on employees and surrounding minimally effected structures that are commercial and residential.  \n\nTHE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWe have maintained excellent ammonia accident release prevention programs. The Fullerton Plant has never had an incident involving the release of Ammonia. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe following procedures are to be followed in the event of an Ammonia leak.\n1.
