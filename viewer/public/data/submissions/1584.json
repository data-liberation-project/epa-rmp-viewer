If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Harveyville Fire Department and the Wabaunsee County LEPC or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. The primary activity of the Harveyville Anhydrous Ammonia facility is the storage and distribution of Anhydrous Ammonia fertilizer to the agricultural customers we serve. Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored and distributed for the direct application of the product as a plant nutrient. The maximum quantity stored would be 80,325 pounds in our 18,000-gallon storage tank. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a tank truck unloading 40,000 pounds. The worst-cast release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity relesed would be 80,325 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at our faciltiy at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.6 miles. The alternative release scenario is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm is 2.6 miles. The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\" published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111,  \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia. There have been no accidental releases of Anhydrous Ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility, nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sh"

A writtten emergency response program, in accoudance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergcency planning and employee training is in place. Safety improvement is an on-going process at the Harveyville Farmers Union Co-op facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assure the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific Anhydrous Ammonia Safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
