Nitrogen is produced by cryogenic separation of air, and is also delivered to site by truck from remote locations.  Hydrogen is produced by steam methane reforming of natural gas, and is also delivered by truck from remote locations.\n\n\nRegulated Substances\n\nThis facility uses, manufactures, or stores a chemical listed in the part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, beyond a threshold quantity, as established by the EPA:  Liquid hydrogen, which is vaporized (converted) to a gas and supplied via pipeline to an on-site customer for the use in silane and polysilicon manufacturing processes. Hydrogen is also produced on site.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Policy\n\nPraxair is dedicated to being the best performing industrial gas company in all aspects of our business including safety, health, and environmental affairs. Our safety, health, and environmental policy call for a commitment to protecting the health and safety of our employees, neighbors, and the surrounding environment. This policy is the basis for engineering and construction programs that produce equipment and process systems that minimize the possibility of accidental chemical releases and operational safety programs that assure safe operation of our facilities. Praxair is committed to the continuous improvement of these programs.\n\nPraxair is an active member of the American Chemistry Council and subscribes to the council\u00bfs program of Responsible Care\u00ae Employee Health and Safety Code of Management Practices.\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nIn accordance with OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management standard and EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Program rule, the Hemlock MI facility has a comprehensive accident prevention program in place. This program is built around process safety concepts such as:\n- Technical documentation of Process"

Following is a description of some of these safety features.\n\nAt the Hemlock facility we have installed additional process isolation valves to enhance our capability to shut down the process safely in the event of an incident. We have also upgraded our fire detection system to increase our ability to detect and respond to minor problems before they can become major incidents.\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nThe Hemlock facility accident history indicates continuous safe operation of our covered chemical process over\nthe last five years. There were no covered process releases that resulted in an EPA RMP recordable accident.\n\n\nEmergency Response Programs\n\nPraxair has an emergency response program in place to minimize the effects of accidental release of regulated sub"

Praxair has a LEAP (Local Emergency Assistance Program), with responders located throughout the United States, closest being in East Chicago, IN (270 miles) and Niagara Falls NY (310 miles) \n  \nAll facility employees are trained in their role in the emergency plan and emergency drills are conducted at least\nannually.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nPraxair has a commitment to safety that is expressed in a company-wide goal of \u00bfZero/Zero, which means zero accidents and zero injuries or illnesses at each and every location. We look to constantly improve the safety of oar processes using recommendations developed through the prevention program and a program soliciting safety suggestions from our employees.\n\nThere are currently no major projects for safety improvement that have reached the planning stage."
