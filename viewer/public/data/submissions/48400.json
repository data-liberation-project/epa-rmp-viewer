              "Description": "The Johnsonville site takes a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. Our management system addresses key features of successful prevention programs including; Process Technology, Process Hazards Analysis, Operating Procedures and Safe Work Practices, Training and Performance, Mechanical Integrity, Quality Assurance, Management  of Change Personnel, Pre-start up, Auditing, Incident Investigation, Management of Change, and Operational Discipline.\n\nThe individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to full compliance with these management systems, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention. \n\nOur Plant Manager has the overall responsibility for ensuring that our facility operates in a safe and reliable manner.  This responsibility includes overseeing the continued implementation of the elements of our Risk Management Program.  Our Plant Manager  assigns the role of PSM/RMP Coordinator to a member of the plant organization with the necessary background, training and experience to fulfill this position.  The PSM/RMP Coordinator, acting with the authority delegated directly from the Plant Manager, has the responsibility for the continued implementation and integration of the EPA RMP elements and the elements of OSHAA?s PSM program. PSM is one of the Seven (7) main competencies of Responsible Care Management Systems (RCMS) that our site is committed to. \n\nThe PSM/RMP Coordinator serves as the chairman of the facilityA?s Process Safety Management Leadership Team (PSMLT).  This PSM Committee is comprised of members with responsibilities that include maintaining and upgrading specific elements of our Risk Management and Process Safety Management Programs for the entire site.  Managing the specific elements of our Risk Management and Process Safety programs is a line organization function.  The members of PSMLT are assigned by the Plant Manager based on recommendations from the PSM/RMP Coordinator.  \n\nThe PSM/RMP Coordinator has the responsibility for ensuring that the facility has an integrated, effective, and compliant prevention program that meets EPA/RMP and OSHA PSM requirements.  Although the PSM/RMP Coordinator has specific individual responsibilities, many of the responsibilities for specific program elements are assigned to other members of PSMLT and the siteA?s line management organization.\n",

Titanium dioxide is manufactured via the chloride process in which titanium dioxide ore is chlorinated to titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4); the TiCl4 is subsequently re-oxidized to refined TiO2. A small amount of TiCl4 is futher processed for sale as a by product. Sodium Chloride (salt)is also produced as a by product from the TiO2 manurfacturing process.   The RMP covered chemicals we handle are detailed in the following:\nTOXIC-USE AT JOHNSONVILLE\nChlorine-Produce Titanium Tetrachloride\nTitanium Tetrachloride-Intermediate used in the manufacture of TiO2\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nIn the past five years, we have had (5) accidental releases that resulted in (5) OSHA recordable injuries. Our on site medical department or first aid responders treated the injured. All five(5) injured personnel returned to work the same day as the injury. We conduct formal incident investigations to identify and correct the root cause for all safety incidents.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nJohnsonville's emergency response program is contained in our Emergency Manual. It consolidates the various regulations for emergency response planning.   It provides the essential planning for effectively protecting our workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations. We coordinate our emergency plan with applicable community emergency response plans and local emergency responders (Humphreys County and Benton County LEPC).  \n\nImportant keys to the success of our emergency response program include:\n\nA?
