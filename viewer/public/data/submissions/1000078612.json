      "SummaryText": "Whiting Oil and Gas operates the Ray Gas Plant located in Williams County North Dakota. The plant is located at 11221 Hwy 2 Ray North Dakota. The facility operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week monitored by operators located on site. The facility processes natural gas produced from wells near the Ray Gas Plant. A network of pipelines transports the natural gas into the plants inlet receiver.  As the plant receives the natural gas the initial separation of gas and liquids takes place. Then the gas flows to the inlet gas compressors, where it's compressed through various stages to achieve the pressure needed to initiate the fluid extraction process. From there the gas flows through a dehydrator  where it is dried and chilled through the refrigeration process. The cooling of the gas allows the natural gas liquids also called NGL's to be removed.  The dry natural gas is metered and transported to market via pipeline. The extracted NGL's are collected in pressurized bullet tanks for storage. The NGL's are transported via tanker trucks for additional processing or marketing.\n\nThere are no public receptors within this distance. There are no environmental receptors within this distance.\n\n\n\nAccident History\n\nHas not experienced an incident that resulted in injuries or environmental damage as defined in the RMP rule in the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe facility has established and maintains an emergency response plan that is coordinated with local response agencies.   The plan is designed to protect personnel on the site, to ensure their safe and orderly evacuation in event of an emergency, and to provide notification, appropriate information and protection for response personnel."
