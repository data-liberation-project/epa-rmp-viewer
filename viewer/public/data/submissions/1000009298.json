              "Description": "Albertsons implementation of the PSM program includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce exposure to accidental ammonia releases. The revised plan includes a regular preventative maintenance program for ammonia system components, as well as programs for pre-startup safety review and management of changes (MOC) to the ammonia refrigeration system. The program also includes operating procedures for the safe operation of the refirgeration system; specific requirements for safe work practices (such as safe approaches to welding and similar hot work; and safety requirements for contractors who may be hired to work on the refrigeration system. Albertsons has a procedure in place for investigating incidents to ensure root causes are identified and corrective actions are taken to minimize the potential for recurrence of incidents. The program also has a procedure for conducting compliance audits to ensure the PSM program is being implemented at the Plant City facility. Lastly, the PSM written program incorporates the Plant City facility emergency response plan and places special emphasis on handling accidental releases of ammonia and coordination of emergency response with local fire departments and other emergency response organizations.",

Albertsons LLC operates many retail grocery stores throughout Florida that are supplied through a distribution and transportation complex located in Plant City , Florida. Albertsons Refrigerated  Distribution Center #8243 located on this facility employees 241 people and uses anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration of the products in storage. Anhydrous ammonia is subject to EPA regulation under 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Risk Management of highly Hazardous Chemicals. Albertsons Plant City facility has never experienced  a release of ammonia involving consequences that affected residents or the environment.\n\nPursuant to PSM regulations (40 CFR 68) and the Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations, Albertsons has developed a comprehensive written PSM program to protect employees and the surrounding community from exposure to the anhydrous ammonia onsite. The facility has completed a process hazards analyses (PHA) for ammonia using the industry standard What-If?/Checklist Analysis developed by the International Institute of ammonia refrigeration (IIAR). The PHA was completed using technical and operations staff from the Plant City facility as well as experienced facilitators from an outside engineering firm (ERM-West, Inc.), and was revalidated to meet PSM and RMP Requirements in 2006.\n\nAlbertsons LLC's implementation of the PSM program includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce employee and community exposure to accidental releases of ammonia. The plans include preventative maintenance programs (mechanical integrity) for the ammonia system, and a program for both pre-startup safety reviews and management of changes (MOC) to the ammonia refrigeration system. The program also includes specific requirements for safe work practices (such as safe approaches to welding and similar hot work) and safety requiremen"

Although such a release is highly unlikely, the regulation requires this review.  \n\nAlbertsons LLC is committed to minimizing accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration process at the Plant City distribution center. Facility management is involved in the design, operation , and maintenance of the system. Albertson?s employees have been involved in the development of the PSM and RMP programs.  Management has committed to working with local agencies and the community to educate the public regarding the hazards of ammonia and to ensure a safe workplace and surrounding community. Specific questions regarding RMP compliance at Albertsons LLC should be addressed to Albertsons Environmental Affairs Department.  "
