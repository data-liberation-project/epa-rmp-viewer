      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWDSC) distributes drinking water to member water agencies throughout Southern California. MWDSC provides approximately 50 percent of the drinking water used by nearly 19 million people living on the southern California coastal plain between Ventura County and the Mexican border.\n\n\n\nDisinfection is a critical process used by MWDSC in the treatment of its drinking water.  Disinfection helps to protect public health by killing pathogens in the water and preventing the spread of waterborne diseases.  The use of chlorine as a disinfectant in the treatment of drinking water and wastewater has been the dominant disinfection method in the United States since it was introduced, around the beginning of this century.  MWDSC currently utilizes bulk chlorine for disinfection at all of its water treatment plants, including the Robert B. Diemer Water Treatment Plant (Diemer Plant).\n\n\n\nAs one might expect from its superior disinfection properties, chlorine is a hazardous substance.  Thus, storing and handling chlorine can present a risk to employees and the public without proper precautions.  MWDSC regards safe practices in the storing and usage of chlorine to be of primary importance and has an excellent safety record with chlorine.\n\n\n\nDiemer Plant's chlorine storage and usage process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule (RMPR) and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program regulation.  Both of these regulations require submission of a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  An integral part of the RMP is a summary of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility, including a description of the possible consequences in case of an accident and the actions, which will be taken, by the facility in an emergency.\n\n\n\nThe following information is specifically required in the RMP Executive Summary:\n\n    Accidental release preventio"

All applicable CalARP and RMPR Prevention Program requirements are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.\n\n\n\nThe MWDSC emergency response policy for hazardous materials, including chlorine and aqueous ammonia, involves the preparation of integrated contingency plans, which address emergency response for hazardous materials and are tailored to each facility.  These plans integrate with the emergency response services available in the community and are in compliance with the RMPR and CalARP Program Emergency Response Program Requirements.  Diemer Plant has prepared an Emergency Response Plan for Hazardous Materials to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.  This emergency response plan includes the containment and scrubbing system and is coordinated with local response agencies (Orange County Fire Authority and Anaheim Fire Department).  Diemer Plant has had an excellent safety record of chlorine use.\n\n\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\n\n\n\nThe Diemer Plant is located at 3972 Valley View Avenue in Yorba Linda, California.  The plant is situated north of the State Highway 91, and just east of State Highway 57 covering 200 acres.  The plant is designed to treat drinking water, including disi"

The facility stores and uses chlorine, a regulated toxic substance under the RMPR and CalARP Program rules, as well as the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Cal/OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard.  \n\n\n\nThe chlorine storage and feed system at the Diemer Plant is located inside the Chlorine Containment Building and treatment plant tunnels.  Chlorine leak detectors are provided at various locations in the Chlorine Containment Building and pipe tunnels.  Based on the concentration and location of chlorine detected, the leak detection system will activate a succession of safety measures, beginning with visual and audible alarms, then automatic start-up of the chlorine neutralization system and shutdown of the normal ventilation system, and, finally, automatically closing supply valves.  A packed-bed chlorine gas scrubber system, consisting of two parallel scrubber units, is provided to neutralize an accidental release of chlorine gas from either chlorine storage bay, evaporator room, or the chlorinator room.  Caustic soda (20%) is used as the scrubbing media.  Emergency showers and eye wash stations are also provided throughout the chlorination facility and beside the scrubber system.\n\n\n\nThe chlorine pressure reducing valves, vacuum regulator valves, leak detectors, and computer control system are connected to uninterruptible power supply (UPS) system.  In the event power is lost at the chlorination facility, an alarm will alert the control room and activate an emergency generator system, which provides backup power to run the water treatment plant.\n\n\n\nThe control room at the plant is manned 24 hours a day, year round to monitor all treatment operations via security cameras and computer control systems.  Access to the plant is through guarded security gates, which are closed after regular hours.  In addition, access into the chlorine storage and containment facility is limited by strict procedures and secured a"

Depending on the severity of the accidental release, external hazardous materials response agencies, such as Orange County Fire Authority and Anaheim Fire Department will be called to handle a chlorine release.  Diemer Plant coordinates with local response agencies (Orange County Fire Authority and Anaheim Fire Department) to help ensure that they are familiar with the Diemer Plant chemical systems and its emergency response requirements and that it is reflected in their Area Plans. Specially trained Diemer Plant employees will be available during such an emergency to provide technical support to fire department responders.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nNumerous changes to improve safety (recommended actions) were previously identified for the chlorine process when Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) conducted under the California Risk Management and Prevention Program (RMPP), Process Safety Management (PSM) Program and Risk Management Program were prepared for the facility.  Additional changes to improve chlorine safety were identified in April 2012, when the 2007 RMP process hazard analysis was revalidated.
