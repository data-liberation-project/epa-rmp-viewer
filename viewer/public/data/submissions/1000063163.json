All applicable CalARP and RMPR Prevention Program requirements are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.\r\n\r\nThe MWDSC emergency response policy for hazardous materials, including chlorine and aqueous ammonia, involves the preparation of integrated contingency plans, which address emergency response for hazardous materials and are tailored to each facility.  These plans integrate with the emergency response services available in the community and are in compliance with the RMPR and CalARP Program Emergency Response Program Requirements.  Diemer Plant has prepared an Emergency Response Plan for Hazardous Materials to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.  This emergency response plan includes the containment and scrubbing system and is coordinated with local response agencies (Orange County Fire Authority and Anaheim Fire Department).

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\nThe Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWDSC) distributes drinking water to member water agencies throughout Southern California. MWDSC provides approximately 50 percent of the drinking water used by nearly 19 million people living on the southern California coastal plain between Ventura County and the Mexican border.\r\n\r\nDisinfection is a critical process used by MWDSC in the treatment of its drinking water.  Disinfection helps to protect public health by killing pathogens in the water and preventing the spread of waterborne diseases.  The use of chlorine as a disinfectant in the treatment of drinking water and wastewater has been the dominant disinfection method in the United States since it was introduced, around the beginning of this century.  MWDSC currently utilizes bulk chlorine for disinfection at all of its water treatment plants, including the Robert B. Diemer Water Treatment Plant (Diemer Plant).\r\n\r\nAs one might expect from its superior disinfection properties, chlorine is a hazardous substance.  Thus, storing and handling chlorine can present a risk to employees and the public without proper precautions.  MWDSC regards safe practices in the storing and usage of chlorine to be of primary importance and has an excellent safety record with chlorine.\r\n\r\nDiemer Plant's chlorine storage and usage process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule (RMPR) and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program regulation.  Both of these regulations require submission of a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  An integral part of the RMP is a summary of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility, including a description of the possible consequences in case of an accident and the actions, which will be taken, by the facility in an emergency.\r\n\r\nThe following information is specifically required in the RMP Executive Summary:\r\n\tAccidental release preventio"

Diemer Plant also includes employees trained in Incident Command system.  Depending on the severity of the accidental release, external hazardous materials response agencies, such as Orange County Fire Authority and Anaheim Fire Department will be called to handle a chlorine release.  Diemer Plant coordinates with local response agencies (Orange County Fire Authority and Anaheim Fire Department) to help ensure that they are familiar with the Diemer Plant chemical systems and its emergency response requirements and that it is reflected in their Area Plans. Specially trained Diemer Plant employees will be available during such an emergency to provide technical support to fire department responders.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nNumerous changes to improve safety (recommended actions) were previously identified for the chlorine process when Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) conducted under the California Risk Management and Prevention Program (RMPP), Process Safety Management (PSM) Program and Risk Management Program were prepared for the facility.  Additional changes to improve chlorine safety were identified in April 2012, when the 2007 RMP process hazard analysis was revalidated.  No recommendations were generated as part of the 2017 PHA Revalidation."

Diemer Plant holds contractor safety briefings before allowing them near or in the process area; controls access to the process areas, and evaluate the contractor's safety performance.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Safety Review and Mechanical Integrity Program\r\n\r\nDiemer Plant ensures that a pre-startup safety review is completed for any new process covered by this regulation, or for significant modifications to an existing covered process that requires a change in the process safety information.  Diemer Plant maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment.

This system allows Diemer Plant staff to identify and review safety hazards or provide additional safety, process, or chemical information to existing data before the proposed change would either compromise system safety or need training to be completed.\r\n\r\nInternal Compliance Audits\r\n\r\nInternal compliance audits are conducted every 3 years to verity compliance with the programs and procedures contained in the RMP.  The Diemer Plant assembles an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the Risk Management Program rule and in the process.  This team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the Risk Management Program rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process.  The results of the audit are documented, recommendations resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nDiemer Plant investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release (serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment) so that similar accidents can be prevented.  An investigation team is assembled and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.  Information found during the investigation is reviewed by affected staff and added or used to revise operating and maintenance procedures.\r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History Summary\r\n\r\nNo chlorine releases that could have caused safety or health hazard (deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place) occurred at the Diemer Plant"
