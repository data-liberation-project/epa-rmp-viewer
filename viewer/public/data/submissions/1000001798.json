      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nDreisbach Enterprises is a northern California based company, providing complete warehouse and logistics capabilities at three public cold storage facilities located in Richmond, Oakland and Watsonville, California.  As stated on the company's website, \"Dreisbach serves you with the pride and integrity of a family-owned company and with experience honed from 50 years in the industry.  No other Frozen Logistic Company surpasses us in service or commitment.\"\n\nDreisbach's senior management is not only committed to offer superior service, but to also maintain a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  Dreisbach's safety and environmental policies are administered by the Chief Operating Officer, who conducts quarterly inspections of its facilities to ensure compliance, and oversees the entire safety and environmental programs.  These programs include forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers documentation, Emergency Action Plan, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Dreisbach Refrigeration System is currently located at 1276 Highway 1, in Moss Landing, California, which is approximately 3 miles south of the city of Watsonville. The area immediately surrounding the facility is agricultural.\n\nThe refrigeration system uses 15,000 pounds of ammonia to provide refrigeration for vegetable/fruit freezing, cold storage, and freezer warehousing.  The refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of high pressure liquid ammonia from the High Pressure Receiver to various pump receivers.  The liquid ammonia is pumped to the Cold Storage and Blast Tunnel / Freezer evaporators.  High pressure liquid is also routed to an Economizer to subcool ammonia liquid prior to being sent to the Frigio Scandia Accumul"

Heat in the cold rooms is transferred to the liquid ammonia in the evaporators, which are piped to return a liquid/vapor mix to either of the Pump Receivers.  \n\nDifferent compressors are piped to draw suction from several vessels, depending on system requirements.  The Booster Compressors only draw suction from the low side while the high stage compressors draw suction from the high side vessels.  At the compressors, the pressure and temperature of the gas is increased.  Booster Discharge is subcooled in the Intercooler.  Discharge from the Compressors is routed to the Condensers, where the high pressure vapor is condensed to a high pressure liquid which drains to the High Pressure Receiver to begin the refrigeration cycle again.  A portion of the discharge gas is used for hot gas defrost purposes at the evaporators.  \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nIn order to operate the ammonia refrigeration system, the facility complies with the following risk management regulations:\n\n1) OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM);\n2) EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP); and\n3) OES California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.\n\nThese regulations impose numerous requirements on the facility to ensure the safety of the public and on-site workers.  The following summarizes the key compliance programs that have been implemented by Dreisbach to prevent the accidental release of ammonia from the facility.  The Operating Procedures program ensures that the ammonia system is operated in a safe manner.  The Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their jobs in a safe manner.  The Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the ammonia system is in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards.  The Management of Change program ensures that process modific"

      "SummaryText": "ations are implemented in a safe manner.  The Pre-Startup Safety Review program ensures that adequate safety measures are in place before ammonia is introduced into a process.  The Hot Work Permit program ensures that Dreisbach's employees and contractors perform hot work (e.g. welding) in a safe manner.  The Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors understand the hazards of ammonia and must take specified precautions to safely complete job requirements.\n\nIt is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  Currently, the facility has eight ammonia sensors, one located in each of the following: Zone 1, 3, & 5 Warehouses, Blast Tunnels, Shipping Dock, Repack Room, IQF Room, and the Engine Room.  The detectors are connected to the Andover computer system.  The engine room detector has one setpoint at 150 ppm, which activates an audible alarm (horn) and pages the maintenance operators.  The ammonia detectors in the cold storage rooms have a single setpoint at 50 ppm to close the liquid feed solenoid valve and alarm through the Andover computer system and page a maintenance operator.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nBased upon the Dreisbach Hazard Assessment Update Report (05/18/2009), there have been no reportable releases of ammonia at the facility over the past five years (May 2004 - May 2009.)\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe facility has an Emergency Action Plan (plan) in effect at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \n\n save lives;\n minimize and avoid injuries;\n protect the environment; and\n min"

This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations.  Facility personnel receive annual training regarding the emergency procedures.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nIn December 2006, the refrigeration system was thoroughly examined for safety hazards by way of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) which consisted of the following:\n\n1) Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study;\n2) series of safety checklists; and\n3) facility inspection.\n\nThe mitigation measures include additional training, key maintenance-related tests/inspection, and enhanced emergency response policies and procedures.  All recommendations resultant from the revalidation study have been addressed.\n\nOngoing updates to the written program, policies and procedures are completed by way of Quarterly PSM / RMP meetings."
