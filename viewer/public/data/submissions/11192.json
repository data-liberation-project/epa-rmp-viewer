The Miami-Dade Water & Sewer Department (MDWASD) South District Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) also uses chlorine (for chlorination) for disinfecting treated wastewater for in-plant use.  Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations.  The South District WWTP takes safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as it takes care in treating wastwater.\n\nThe South District WWTP chlorine handling process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule and is a Program 3 process.  This regulation requires submission of a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The South District WWTP also produces digester gas and stores it for on-site use as fuel.  The maximum quantity of digester gas stored at a given time exceeds the RMP threshold quantity, however, the digester gas process qualifies as a RMP Program 1 process.  \n\nAn integral part of the RMP is a summary of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility, including a description of the possible consequences in case of an accident and the actions, which will be taken, by the facility in an event of an emergency.\n\nThe following information is specifically required in the RMP Executive Summary: \n\n* Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\n* General facility and regulated substances information.\n\n* Offsite consequence analysis results.\n\n* Summary of the accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n\n* Five-year accident history summary.\n\n* Emergency response program summary.\n\n* Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nThe above information for the South District WWTP chlorination system and the digester gas system, as required, is provided below.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe MDWASD accidental release prevention policy involves a unifie"

South District WWPT has prepared an Emergency Response Plan for Hazardous Materials to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.  South District WWTP has an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\n\nThe MDWASD South District WWTP is located at 8950 SW 232 Street, in Goulds, Florida. The South District WWTP is bounded to the North by SW 232nd Street, to the South by the Black Creek Canal, to the West by SW 97th Avenue, and to the East by SW 87th Avenue.  The South District WWTP is located within the 10-mile radius evacuation zone of the Turkey Point Nuclear Power Plant.  The facility currently stores and uses chlorine, a regulated toxic substance under the EPA rules. Chlorine is delivered in one-ton containers to the South District WWTP chlorine building.  The chlorine building is divided into a covered chlorine storage area and a chlorinator room.  The one-ton containers contain liquid chlorine under pressure.  The chlorine building is equipped to store up to 20 (containers) tons of chlorine. The maximum quantity of chlorine present at the South District WWPT at any given time exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the EPA rules.  It also exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the federal Occupation"

Downstream of the manifold system there is a pneumatically actuated automatic shut-off valve.  The valve will also close automatically (or manually) when the chlorine sensor senses a leak.  The liquid chlorine flows through the automatic shut-off valve to the evaporators.  At the evaporators the liquid chlorine is heated and converted into chlorine gas.  The gas then flows from the evaporator through the temperature actuated control valve and the vacuum regulator to the chlorinator.  The chlorinators are used to control the feed rate of the chlorine gas.  The chlorinators are equipped with a gas rotameter and a v-notched orifice for controlling the feed rate.  Injection of the chlorine into the plant water produces the concentrated solution that flows through piping to various injections points in the treatment process.\n\nThe South District WWTP is also provided with a number of safety features to protect the employees and the surrounding community.  The two important safety features are (1) automatic shut-off valves and (2) chlorine leak detection and alarm system.  The automatic shut-off valves are located immediately downstream of the chlorine containers.  Therefore, if a leak occurs anywhere in the system the chlorine source can be isolated and the flow of chlorine can be stopped.  The automatic shutoff valves are operated either automatically due to the detection of chlorine leak by the chlorine sensors or manually by pushing a switch.  Emergency shutoff switches are located inside the chlorine storage room and in the chlorinator room.\n\nThe leak detection system consists of chlorine gas sensors located in both the chlorinator room and the storage area.

Thickened sludge is pumped to two-stage anaerobic digesters for stabilization.  The gas produced by the digestion process is compressed, scrubbed to remove hydrogen sulfide, and stored on-site in two 16,500 pounds compressed gas spheres.  The digester gas is used to power engine driven blowers and electric generators.  Waste heat from the gas power engines is used to heat the primary digesters.\n\nA perimeter fence and locked security gates surround the South District WWTP.  The plant operates three shifts with employees onsite  24 hours per day, 365 days per year.\n\nThe South District WWTP is provided with a backup emergency power generator that supplies power for the entire facility.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two release scenarios, identified as \"worst-case release scenario\" and \"alternative release scenario\". The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over 10-minutes,\" due to an unspecified failure. The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario\".  EPA also requires the performance of one worst-case release scenario for all the regulated toxic substances and one worst-case release scenario for flammable substances.  In addition, alternative release scenario analysis is not required for Program 1 processes.

Thus, chlorine was selected for the worst-case release scenario.  Only passive or administrative controls are allowed under this scenario to reduce off-site impacts.  The scenario used for the South District WWTP is the rupture of a single one-ton chlorine container resulting in the release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine over a 10-minute duration.  There are no passive or administrative controls at the South District WWTP for the chlorine storage containers; thus, the chlorine release rate will be 200 lb./min.\n\nThe released liquid chlorine is assumed to form a denser-than-air cloud consisting of chlorine vapor and liquid droplets (aerosols) and then disperse in the atmosphere.  The distance to the toxic endpoint was estimated using the EPA's RMP*Comp software (version 1.06).  The toxic endpoint selected by EPA rules for chlorine is 3 ppm, which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  The toxic endpoint was conservatively set by EPA to ensure public notification and that local emergency response planning takes into account the greatest possible impacted area surrounding the release point. EPA-mandated meteorological conditions, namely atmospheric Stability Class F, wind speed of 1.5 meter per second, highest daily maximum temperature (77 deg F), and average relative humidity (50%) were used for the worst-case release scenario analysis.

A yield factor of 10 percent of TNT-equivalency model is used to determine the distance to the endpoint.  The distance to the endpoint is defined as the distance over which a minimum pressure of 1 psi occurs from the pressure wave formed by the detonation.  The distance to the endpoint was estimated using the EPA's RMP*Comp software (version 1.06).  No public receptors were identified within the flammable endpoint distance for the worst-case release scenario.\n\nRMP rules, for Program 3 processes, require that a scenario which results in offsite toxic endpoint distance and is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario should be selected as the alternative release scenario, unless no such scenario exists.  Unlike the worst-case scenario, the alternative release scenario may consider \"active\" mitigation such as automatic shutoff valves, excess flow valves, and containment with scrubbers.  Active mitigation is defined as requiring mechanical, electrical, or human input.\n\nThe alternative release scenarios must consider the facility accident history and/or failure scenarios identified in the process hazard analysis.  A review of the past five-year accident history data for the chlorination facility pursuant to these rules indicated that there were no chlorine releases, which could have resulted in offsite (outside the South District WWTP boundary) toxic endpoint distances.

It is assumed that approximately 15 to 30 minutes would be required for the emergency response team to respond to the accident.  In the meantime, all of the chlorine in the container would have been released.  The chlorine release rate from the one-ton container was estimated at 150 pounds per minute; thus, the whole container would be emptied in about 13 minutes.  No passive mitigation was considered for the estimation of chlorine release rate.  However, human input in closing the shut-off valve was taken into account as an active mitigation, which will reduce the quantity of chlorine released to the atmosphere.\n\nThe alternative release scenario toxic endpoint distance was also estimated using the RMP*Comp (version 1.06) software.
