The same properties that makes anhydrous ammonia valuable as a cold storage refrigerant chemical, also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling anhydrous ammonia. Overall, the prevention of unnecessary human exposure, reducing the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-worker, and reducing the threat to nearby members of the community is the main goal of incorporating this risk management plan into our daily operations.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle anhydrous ammonia combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, with the safe handling procedures that we utilize, and the training of our personnel.  \n\nThe emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the Morrilton Packing Company Hazmat Responders, the Russelville Fire Department(Haz Mat Team Battalion Chief), Baker Refrigeration Haz Mat Responders, Lee Sumner (Safety Director), and then notifying the Conway County 911 System for 911 call-out to affected responding agencies.  The Morrilton Fire Department and Morrilton Police Department will help to notify and evacuate any potentially affected neighbors by utilizing vehicles with PA mounted announcing systems.  The 911 System will also notify Conway County LEPC.  \n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to cool and/or freeze storage compartments by utilizing anhydrous ammonia. Anhydrous ammonia is stored in a reciever in the engine room building.  Anhydrous ammonia is fed into the cooling system for cold storage.  The system is a two-stage pump re-circulated ammonia refrigeration system.  The Hi Stage Compressor serves the Freezer Dock, Cooler, Cooler Dock and the Lo Stage Compressor discharge loads.  The Lo Stage system serves the freezer.  Other associated s"

Note:  The  system flow diagram and control wiring diagrams should be used in conjunction with this description. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, and authorized contractors.  \n\nThe regulated substance handled at the 51 Blue Diamond Drive location is anhydrous ammonia.  The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored at this plant is 13,000 pounds.  This amount is an aggregate found in the storage vessel, as well as the entire cold storage system.\n \nThis cold storage facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. \n\nWe have discussed this program with the Conway County LEPC, the Conway County Sheriff's Office, the Morrilton Police Department, as well as the Morrilton and Russellville Fire Departments. \n\nThe cold storage system was originally constructed in 1986, and underwent additions in 1999. This facility is striving to be in compliance with all applicable regulations applicable to this facility."
