      "SummaryText": "The Airgas facility in Chattanooga, Tennessee is owned and operated by Airgas South. The Facility is a chemical distribution plant, which stores, sells, and repackages industrial gases.\n\nThe Facility operates from 0600 hours to 1630 hours, Monday through Friday and is staffed with approximately 19 full time employees.  The Facility is secured with chain link fencing, locking gate, security cameras, and yard lights.\n\nBased on the facility inventory, the following listed flammable substances are stored by the Facility in quantities above the substance's EPA threshold quantity: \n\nAcetylene gas (CAS # 74-86-2)\nPropane gas (CAS # 74-98-6)\n\nAcetylene is packaged in a variety of cylinders, including 24 pound, 12 pound, 5 pound, 1 pound and smaller.  Gas can be released through a valve on the top of the cylinder.  The valve itself is protected by a cylinder cap that screws into the cylinder, except smaller cylinders that do not accommodate cylinder caps, i.e. Nb\u00c2\u00bfs and Mc\u00c2\u00bfs.  \n\nPropane is packaged in pressure vessels (cylinders) to a maximum of 1800 pounds.  The gas is compressed into a liquid under pressure.  Both liquid and gas exist simultaneously within the cylinder, with liquid below the gas.  Gas can be released through a valve on top of the cylinder.  The valve itself is protected on small cylinders (100 pounds or less) by a guard rail and on larger cylinders by a valve cap.\nBoth regulated gases are filled by a 3rd party supplier.\n\nThe maximum amount of acetylene stored at the facility is 20,000 pounds.  The maximum amount of propane stored is 20,000 pounds.\n\nA worst-case release, as defined in the RMP regulations, is a release of the entire contents of the largest vessel in the process, followed by a vapor cloud explosion.  The single largest vessel of propane contains a maximum of 1,800 pounds.  Because of this, the worst-case release amount for the Chattanooga plant is therefore 1,800 lbs of propane.  EPA\u00c2\u00bfs RMP*Comp was used to calculate the distance to 1 psi ov"

      "SummaryText": "erpressure for a vapor cloud explosion involving 1,800 lbs of propane.\n\nIn consultation with Chattanooga plant personnel and Airgas\u00c2\u00bf Safety Director, a leak in a 33-pound propane cylinder resulting from the age and fatigue of the valve apparatus was chosen as the most likely alternative-case scenario.  For determination of the endpoint distance, it was assumed that the released propane would detonate in a vapor cloud explosion.  Similar to the worst-case scenario, EPA\u00c2\u00bfs RMP*Comp was used to determine the release rate based on vessel parameters, and the release duration was assumed to be approximately one (1) minute.\n\nThe results of the worst-case and alternative case scenarios are as follows:\n\n\u00c2\u00bf\tWorst-case Scenario: RMP*Comp calculated endpoint distance 0.1 mile;\n\u00c2\u00bf\tAlternative-case Scenario: RMP*Comp calculated endpoint distance 0.02 miles.\n\nThe estimated end point distance, a conservative estimate of the extent of impact caused by a release of 1,800 lbs of propane, was 0.1 miles.  Because the facility is subject to OSHA PSM and there is a public road at a distance to the endpoint for the worst case scenario, the facility is a Program 3 under the Risk Management Rule in 40 CFR 68."
