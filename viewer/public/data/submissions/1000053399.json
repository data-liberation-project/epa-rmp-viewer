The plant is designed to process natural gas and recover liquid product from natural gas by physical separation. Petroleum condensates are recovered from the inlet pipeline gas in this process for off-site sales.\n\n\n\nWilliams has a long-standing commitment to workers and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel, quality assurance, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Bucking Horse Plant is located near Douglas, Wyoming and produces the following petroleum products:\n\n1. Stabilized Condensate\n\n2. NGL\n\n3. Residue Gas\n\nThese substances can contain the following components:\n\na. Methane\n\nb. Ethane\n\nc. Propane\n\nd. Butane\n\ne. Isobutane\n\nf. Pentane\n\ng. Isopentane\n\nIn addition, a refrigerant system containing propylene is used with the operations to produce the above substances.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \n\nA. Employee Participation\n\nWilliams encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention as follows:\n\n\n\n1. Updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information\n\n2. Performing necessary calculations for PSM and RMP\n\n3. Maintaining good engineering practices\n\n4.

Sufficient information to assure good engineering practices\n\nThe location of the technical documents referenced above is listed in the Process Safety Information portion of the PSM.\n\n\n\nChemical -specific information, including hazard and emergency response/exposure considerations, is provided in material safety data sheet (MSDS). For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety- related limits for specific process parameters such as temperatures, level and composition in the operators' procedures manual. The facility maintains the process within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel and protective instrument systems such as automated shutdown systems.\n\n\n\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of the process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressures, temperature and electrical ratings. This information, in combination with procedures and equipment operating history, provides a basis for inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nC.

The approved mitigation options in response to the PHA team's findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nThe facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.\n\n\n\nD. Operating Procedures\n\n\n\nWilliams maintains written Operating Procedures of the covered process that address primary operations mandated by OSHA, EPA, Good Engineering Practice and manufacturers. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current accurate by management. The procedures are maintained current and accurate revising them as necessary by employee's suggestion, compliance audit, PHAs, Good Engineering practice, Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) and implemented through Management of Change.\n\n\n\nCovered Process Operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job task and maintain the covered process unit operating within its safe limits.\n\n\n\nE.

If a deficiency is identified and the situation presents an immediate safety concern, the deficiency is corrected before placing the equipment back into service. A management of change team will review the use of equipment and determine what action is necessary.\n\n\n\nAn integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. Williams incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps to determine that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and thee proper materials and spare parts a"

Safe Work Practices\n\n\n\nWilliams has long-standing safe work practices as mandated by OSHA, EPA, Industrial Standards and Good Engineering Practice in place to help provide employee, public and process safety.\n\n\n\nJ. Management of Change\n\n\n\nWilliams has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all Reported Covered Processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology and procedures be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to:\n\n\n\n1. Determine that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards\n\n2. Verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the proposed change\n\n\n\nAffected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information and procedures are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are trained on the changes.\n\n\n\nWilliams promptly investigates all incidents related to a covered process that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, property damage, environmental loss or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective action to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent future occurrences and forwards these results to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented and investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years.\n\n\n\nL Compliance Audits\n\n\n\nAt least every 3 years a Compliance Audit addressing OSHA, EPA, RMP and Good Engineering Practices are conducted by employees and management of Williams. This audit team develops findings that are forwarded to facility management for resoluti"

Final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\n\n\nM. Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe following is a description of existing features applicable to prevention of accidental release of regulated substances in this facility.\n\n\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\nWilliams accident release prevention and response policies are applied to all RMP-covered processes. Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\n\n\nN. Specialized Safety Features\n\n\n\nSite specific detection and control equipment (safety features) are deployed throughout the plant to:\n\n1. Contain/control a release\n\n2. Quickly detect a release, and\n\n3. Reduce the consequences of an RMP-regulated substance release\n\nThe following type of safety features are used in the covered process: Release Containment/Control\n\n1. Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\n\n2. Automated and manual valves to permit isolation of the process\n\n3. Automated plant shutdown system to shut down all engines, plant utilities and automatically operate all automatic valves to their fail-safe position, diverting all incoming gas to the emergency flare.\n\n4. Curbing or diking to contain liquids releases\n\n5. Redundant equipment and instrumentation\n\n6. Atmospheric relief devices\n\n\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n1. Fire extinguishers only\n\n2. Trained emergency response personnel\n\n3. Personal protective equipment\n\n\n\nO. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nBucking Horse Plant has had no RMP-regulated substance release during the past five years. \n\n\n\nP. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nWilliams Bucking Horse Plant is a Non-Responding Facility as per 48 CFR 68.90(b). The plant maintains a written emergency action plan, which is in place to "

The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including: proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs.\n\n\n\nEmployees receive training in the procedures to be followed by employees who remain to operate critical plant operations before they evacuate. Williams has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate emergency response organizations (Fire Department, Police and Sheriff's Office). This interface provides the means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition, Williams conducts periodic emergency drills and annual refresher training for plant personnel.\n\n"
