Employee participation is also a key component of the successful implementation of the PSM/RMP program at MGL.\n\nThe hazard analysis performed for the facility also includes a review of the five-year accident history.  During the past five years, MGL has not had an accidental release that met the criteria of 40 CFR 68.42(a).\n\nMGL is actively involved in emergency response planning.  MGL has worked with the St. Clair County Local Emergency Management Agency, St. Clair County Hazardous Material Response Team and the Marysville Fire Department to develop emergency response plans.  The MGL Emergency Action Plan outline procedures for internal response to incidental releases and notification and coordination with the local emergency response organizations in the event of an incidental release which cannot be contained.\n\nMGL is committed to continous improvement of the safety programs for its employees and dedicated to working with the local emergency agencies to ensure the safety of the facility and the surrounding community."

The facility consists of eight underground storage caverns for the storage of liquidified hydrocarbons such as propane and butane.  The facility receives and ships hydrocarbons by pipeline, railcar, and truck.\n\nAs required in U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Clean Air Act Risk Management Program rules listed in 40 CFR Part 68, this document contains the information intended to analyze the impacts of an accidental release of an extremely hazardous substance and to highlight the steps the facility is taking to prevent a release from occurring.  The facility stores highly fammable materials in sufficient quantities such that the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68 (RMP) apply.  MGL stores propane and butane at the facility and also injects Ethyl Mercaptan into the propane before loading it out in railcars and trucks.\n\nThe facility is also subject to the Occupational Health and Safety Association (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  Modeling results indicate the worst case release would cause an offsite impact.  Due to this factor, MGL is subject to Program 3 requirements under 40 CFR Part 68.\n\nMGL is commited to employee and public safety.  Policies have been established to implement the requirements of RMP.  MGL's policies are intended to prevent releases of chemicals.  If a release does occur,  the operating personnel, supplemented by the local fire department and county hazardous material response team, will respondto control the effects of the release and to evacuate potentially affected personnel if needed.\n\nThe Process Hazardous Analysis (PHA) conducted by the facility helps to identify potenttial problems before they occur.  This process allows for participation of employees and identification of opportunities for improvement at the facility.  The review of  the PHAs also allows the facility to apply new technology and"
