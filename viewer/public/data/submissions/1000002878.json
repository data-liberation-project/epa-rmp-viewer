      "SummaryText": "2.0\tProcess Description and Regulated Substances\n\nAt this location Kraft Foods manufactures cheese and whey products from milk.  The SIC code for the primary process at this facility is 2022. Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to preserve the products.  Some of these areas include: raw material storage, process equipment, filling and finished product storage. \n\nKraft Foods has one regulated substance under 40 CFR 68, anhydrous ammonia, at this location.  Ammonia is used as a cooling agent in the refrigeration of the milk and cheese products in the various areas described above.\n\nThe ammonia threshold for triggering applicability to 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds. The quantity of ammonia stored on-site is approximately 16,033 pounds. Thus, 40 CFR 68 is applicable to this facility.\n\n\n3.0\tWorst-case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nBoth the Worst \u00c2\u00bfCase and Alternate Release Scenarios have been updated to reflect change in population numbers for affected areas. \n\n4.0\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThis facility has an OSHA PSM program for their ammonia refrigeration system.  Ammonia falls under the RMP Program 3 prevention program, which is identical to the OSHA PSM program.  EPA has stated that if the process is in compliance with OSHA PSM, it is in compliance with RMP Program 3.  Thus, Kraft\u00c2\u00bfs ammonia PSM has been reviewed and determined to be complete for the RMP document. Date of most recent PSM audit 01/5-7/2009\n\nThere are several aspects of the prevention program that are key:\n\n1.\tThe Utility Service Area design (USA) serves as an excellent safeguard for plant personnel because it greatly reduces the amount of ammonia piping inside occupied rooms.  Since most of the pipe work is out of the way of people and the machinery and so there is less of a chance of an ammonia release.\n\n2.\tHazmat Team members undergo annual training conducted by a certified instructor. General plant awareness training is conducted"

There are many in-plant contacts for an emergency, which can be found in the Emergency Response Plan.  There are also back-up personnel in the event that the primary incident response personnel cannot be contacted.  The emergency response plan includes information about the frequency of employee emergency response training, as well as a detailed description of the training content, which includes a CPR and first aid training.  There are also specific procedures to follow in the event of a fire and ammonia emergency. \n\nAt the discretion of the Incident Commander, the Bentonville Fire Department will be called to provide emergency responders and equipment.  In the event of an ammonia release, a trained on site responder will accompany the fire department into the facility. \nThe site maintains all necessary protective equipment for such incidents.  The fire department will take the lead in responding to the emergency.  The Bentonville Fire Department will also be called for all fire related emergencies.  In all cases where the fire department is called, an ambulance will also be called to the facility."
