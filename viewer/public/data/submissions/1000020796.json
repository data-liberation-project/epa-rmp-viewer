      "SummaryText": "Weylchem US Inc. is a multi-purpose batch chemical manufacturing facility located in Elgin, South Carolina. The facility is situated in the southern sector of approximately 200 acres of contiguous land. Surrounding property is rural/residential/farmland.  Weylchem has a mature process safety management program in place, designed to minimize and control the potential risks presented by the processes at this site.  Management at the site are committed to ensuring that the facility is operated in a safe manner, protecting the employees, environment and surrounding community.\n\nReduction in inventory and substitution of RMP chemicals is considered when and where feasible. To this end, bromine inventory is substantially reduced at this time. In addition, one RMP chemical has been eliminated.\n\nWeylchem utilizes 7 RMP regulated chemicals in quantities above the threshold; Allyl alcohol, bromine, chlorine, ethyl chloride, trichlorosilane, and phosphorous trichloride. For each of these chemicals measures have been taken to prevent and/or mitigate potential for accidental releases. Efforts for each chemical are detailed below.\n\nAllyl alcohol is currently used in several processes. For each of these processes the same bulk storage and transfer facilities are utilized. Allyl alcohol is stored in diked storage tanks. The storage tanks are equipped with level indicators, and vent to a regenerative thermal oxidizer. Overfill protection is provided by piping the tank vents to a knockout pot with level, temperature, and pressure indicators. This knockout pot also vents to the regenerative thermal oxidizer. These tanks are filled from tanker trucks which are staged on an adjacent concreted area surrounded by trenches. These trenches discharge to an in ground sump, equipped with a metal cover and vented to the regenerative thermal oxidizer through a detonation arrestor.\n\nIf a full tank truck or the unloading hose were to fail, the contents of the tank truck would spill on the unloading"

The in ground sump is pumped to a plant-wide wastewater collection system that feeds a biological treatment system owned by Weylchem.  Sections of the trenches may be isolated in the event of a spill or leak.\n\nReactor systems for allyl alcohol service are all similar in design and use. Each reactor system consists of a stainless steel reactor, two stainless steel receivers, and associated stainless steel tanks and piping. Failure of a reactor or receiver will result in the released allyl alcohol being collected in the surrounding trenches.\n\nBromine is also used in several processes at Weylchem. All bromine storage tanks, receivers, and pumps are housed in two containment buildings. These vessels are also diked inside the containment buildings, and are equipped with deluge systems for the dikes in the event of a release. Both bromine buildings are vented to emergency scrubbers. In the event of a storage vessel failure and containment of the bromine in a dike, the bromine sensors will immediately activate the emergency scrubbers and safely evacuate the vapor space of the building. The scrubbers can be activated manually or automatically by bromine/chlorine located inside the containment buildings.\n\nBromine off-gasses from manufacturing processes are vented through acid absorbers and caustic scrubbers. Bromine is stored in lead lined storage tanks designed with a pressure rating of 50 psig. Bromine is weighed on a batch basis for individual processes into glass lined receivers. All bromine tanks and receivers are diked and housed in containment buildings.\n\nMeasures are in place to prevent accidental releases from the bromine tanks and receivers. All storage tanks and receivers are equipped with rupture discs and relief valves. A corrosion resistant rupture disc is installed just above the vessel shell. Above the rupture disc is a pressure relief valve. In the event t"

This would minimize the amount of bromine released to the building. The rupture disc protects the relief valve from corrosion. A pressure indicator is installed between the rupture disc and relief valve for protection of rupture disc failure.\n\nBromine is received on site in tank trailers and off loaded into one of three storage tanks via pressure. The tank truck is parked inside the containment building while unloading. All connections are bolted flanges, and all transfer lines are teflon-lined steel construction. Material handler personnel are present during the entire unloading operation.\n\nChlorine is currently used in several processes at Weylchem. It is received and used in 1 ton cylinders only. Cylinders are stored inside specially constructed containment buildings equipped with sensors for leak detection. Each chlorine building is equipped with an emergency scrubber capable of safely evacuating the contents of a one a ton cylinder within 45 minutes. Chlorine is vaporized in a unit contained in the buildings and transferred to production equipment as a vapor, which minimizes the quantity of chlorine in the piping. Piping outside the containment building is enclosed in corrosion resistant piping ductwork. The ductwork directs any piping leakage back to the containment building where sensors will detect the leak and activate the emergency scrubber(s). The ductwork is easily opened for inspection and repair.\n\nAs an administrative control, no more than one chlorine cylinder is open to the plant manifold at any one time. Chlorine addition is typically interlocked to batch reactor agitation and temperature alarms to prevent transfer when these parameters are out of spec.\n\nPhosphorus trichloride is used in 1 process at the Weylchem facility. Phosphorus trichloride is received and stored in drums insi"

Failure of the reactors would result in the release of phosphorus trichloride and collection in the surrounding trenches. this process is currently inactive, but will remain in the site's RMP.\n\nEthyl Chloride is currently used in only one process at this facility. The ethyl chloride is stored in a pressurized storage tank with a nitrogen blanket on the tank. The storage area for ethyl chloride is equipped with a remote activation fixed foam system for fire suppression.\n\nTrichlorosilane is used in 1 process at the site. It is stored in DOT specification cylinders. \n\nVinyl chloride is used in 1 process at the Weylchem facility and is stored in 120 gallon cylinders. These cylinders drums inside of a containment building that is vented to a caustic scrubber in the event any material should be spilled. When vinyl chloride is charge to the process ventilation is provided both at the cylinder connection and in the process vessel. During the charging process area monitoring is performed for any leaks of vinyl chloride.\n\nWeylchem has a well organized, highly trained emergency response group (fire brigade) which is the first line of defense in response to any release. Trained firefighters, hazmat responders and first responders are all a part of this group. Weylchem also has coordinated agreements with the local LEPC, which consists of local and county fire departments, nearby industry response personnel, hospitals, law enforcement, and government personnel. The site is well prepared for response to any potential releases of materials detailed in this plan, and others.\n\nIn summary, 4 (four) specially designed containment buildings have been constructed to reduce the likelihood and the severity of potential releases.

This program is a valuable tool for prevention and minimization of releases.   \n\nIn the five years prior to 3/8/2011 the site did not have any incidents that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage."
