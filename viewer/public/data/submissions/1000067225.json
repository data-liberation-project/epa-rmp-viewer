Examples of employee participation range from updating\r\nand compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a\r\nprocess hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of\r\nthe facility accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the\r\naccident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the facility.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nEnlink Midstream Partners keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain\r\nsafe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated\r\nhazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment\r\ndesign basis/configuration information. The reference documents are maintained on file at the\r\nfacility to provide open access.\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure\r\ntreatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). This information is\r\nsupplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known\r\nhazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For the process, the facility has\r\ndocumented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level,\r\ncomposition) in key process parameter documents.

This commitment is demonstrated by the\r\nresources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in\r\nthe design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Enlink Midstream\r\nPartners' policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated\r\nsubstances. However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control\r\nand contain the release.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\nNatural gas is gathered from wells in the surrounding fields and sent to the Chisholm Processing\r\nPlant for processing prior to being sold for domestic consumption. This gas contains impurities\r\nin the form of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen (N2) and water. These impurities must be brought\r\ninto specification before residue companies will purchase this gas.\r\nThe Chisholm Processing Plant is a non-fractionating NGL extraction plant utilizing two trains\r\nthat are designed to process natural gas. The plant consists of inlet gas, separation and filtration,\r\na condensate stabilizer, amine treatment units, cryogenic processing units, overhead\r\ncompression, residue compression, and, including all associated utilities and ancillary systems.\r\nCondensate recovered from inlet gas is stored in six 1000-barrel tanks in a metal-diked\r\ncontainment area and loaded into tanker trucks for shipment. NGL from the cryogenic units and\r\nnatural gas from residue compression are sent offsite via pipeline without intermediate storage.\r\nThe processes at the station are interconnected by piping and fit the EPA's definition of a\r\nstationary source in 40 CFR part 68. The facility contains four sources of regulated substances\r\nheld over their respective threshold quantities; Methane, Condensate (Pentane), Flam"

This information includes\r\nmaterials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of\r\nequipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel,\r\nprovides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating\r\nproposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not\r\ncompromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\nEnlink Midstream Partners has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated\r\nwith the process are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is\r\nsystematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to\r\nmanage these hazards. Enlink Midstream Partners primarily used the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform this evaluation. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most\r\nsystematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team\r\nof people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This\r\nteam identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation\r\nmeasures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures\r\nwhen the team believes such measures are necessary. The PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution per Enlink's Risk Management Protocol. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.

Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nChisholm Processing Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of\r\noperations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4)\r\nemergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These\r\nprocedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent\r\ntraining of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as\r\ncurrent and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as\r\nnecessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\r\nIn addition, the Chisholm Processing Plant maintains key process parameter documents that\r\nprovide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedance for specific process or\r\nequipment parameters.

A PSSR\r\ninvolves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by\r\nrequiring that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nEnlink Midstream Partners has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure\r\nvessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and\r\nemergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program\r\ninclude: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections\r\nand tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In\r\ncombination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the\r\nprocess. Maintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health\r\nhazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5)\r\napplicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.\r\nJob plans/written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and\r\nprovide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment\r\nfunctions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall\r\nthickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the\r\ndeficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of\r\nchange team will review the use of the equipment and determine what a"

The Chisholm\r\nProcessing Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.\r\nThis helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials\r\nand spare parts are used when repairs are made.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices\r\nEnlink Midstream Partners has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker\r\nand process safety. Examples of these include, (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support\r\npersonnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment\r\nundergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before\r\nprocess piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing\r\nactivities (i.e., hot work) and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are\r\nin place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of\r\naffected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are\r\nperformed safely.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\nEnlink Midstream Partners has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered\r\nprocesses. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals,\r\ntechnology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be\r\nproperly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1)\r\nensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to (2) verify that\r\nexisting controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard\r\ninformation, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are\r\nupdated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are\r\nprovided any necessary training"

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts, and develop corrective\r\nactions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team\r\ndocuments its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these\r\nresults to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the\r\ninvestigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The\r\nfinal resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results\r\nare reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.\r\nIncident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed\r\nduring PHAs and PHA revalidations.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Enlink Midstream\r\nPartners periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices\r\nrequired by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are\r\nconducted on a periodic basis. Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team\r\nmembers. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to facility management for\r\nresolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent\r\naudit reports are retained.\r\n\r\nChemical - Specific Prevention Steps\r\nThe processes at the Chisholm Processing Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure\r\ncontinued safe operation.
