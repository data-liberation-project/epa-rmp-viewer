      "SummaryText": "Risk Management Program\n\nExecutive Summary\n\n\nFirst Chemical Corporation (FCC) has three chemicals on-site that exceed the threshold quantities of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) as established in the 1990 Clean Air Act Section 112(r) and described in detail in 40 CFR 68.  These chemicals are anhydrous ammonia, 20% oleum, and 47% formaldehyde solution.  Each of these chemicals has a single designated storage tank and is used as a raw material in certain discrete processes.  FCC receives oleum and formaldehyde by trucks, which are unloaded in tanks located inside dikes.  FCC receives ammonia principally by pipeline and infrequently by rail car. The unloading processes are continuously monitored.\n\nThere is no flammable gas worst-case release scenario because FCC does not store any RMP flammable chemicals above the threshold quantity.\n\nUsing the EPA defined process, an ammonia tank rupture represents FCC's worst-case toxic chemical release scenario.  FCC has a 95,700 gallon pressurized liquid ammonia storage tank.  This scenario assumed the tank was full, containing 510,000 pounds of ammonia; the ammonia completely vaporized in 10 minutes.  This occurred when the very worst weather conditions occur, which is a calm night with a very gentle breeze at 1.5 m/s and an extremely stable atmospheric stability class of F.  By EPA 's definition of the worst-\ncase scenario, FCC must ignore every active response procedure in place to mitigate the release.  The end-point for this scenario is 12 miles downwind of the release, using methods described in EPA's lookup tables in the November 19, 1998 Guidance Document.\n\nThe ammonia alternative release scenario is a complete relief valve failure.  Unlike the worst-case scenario definition, the EPA allows companies to assume Operator response to reduce the off-site consequence of the alternative release scenario, as long as the consequence goes off-site.  Approximately, 64,167 pounds of ammonia would be released to the air, as determined b"

The endpoint was calculated to be 0.2 miles, using RMP Comp software, assuming 3 m/s wind speed, a D atmospheric stability class, and rural setting.\n\nThe formaldehyde alternative scenario is a pump seal failure during recirculation.  This Operator shuts off the pump and closes the valves around the pump.  Approximately 2,349 gallons of 47% formaldehyde would be released in 30 minutes, with the material contained inside a concrete dike that would reduce the amount of formaldehyde released to the air and facilitate the cleanup.  The end-point would be 0.2 miles downwind of the release, using EPA's May 24, 1996 off-site Guidance Document calculations.  The end-point would not leave the Industrial Park.\n\nFirst Chemical Corporation has not had a release of any RMP chemical that has had off-site health or injury consequences for the past five years.  The scenarios described above are hypothetical and have never occurred at this location.\n\nIf a release should occur that would create an off-site hazard, FCC will immediately notify the Industrial Park industries and emergency responders in the community.  The Fire and Police Departments will notify the community of the status of the release and the actions to take using public address systems.  These actions will depend upon the direction of wind, the amount of the material released, and the length of the release.  These actions may include shelter-in-place or evacuation.  Local radio and television stations will be notified and will assist in notifying the public of the proper actions to take.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk Management Program\nExecutive Summary\nPage 4\n\nFirst Chemical Corporation has many written programs in place to prevent accidental releases of chemicals into the environment.

The end-point is 0.7 miles directly downwind of the release, using EPA's lookup tables in the November 19, 1998 Guidance Document.  The end-point would be contained inside the Industrial Park.\n\nIf either of these highly unlikely events ever occurred, FCC has an Emergency Response Plan in place. For the alternative scenario release, while the Shift Supervisor would be making emergency notification, an Operator would immediately prepare to close the emergency manual shut-off valve between the relief valve and the tank.  This process would take no more than twenty minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk Management Program\nExecutive Summary\nPage 2\n\n\n\nOther Operators would be designated to assist this Operator and would operate the fire monitors, using the water spray to reduce the ammonia release.  In addition, the water deluge valves would be activated.\n\nFCC utilizes OSHA's PSM program to reduce the likelihood that this worst-case release or the alternative release never occurs.  There are formal review programs beginning with the initial determination to produce a product, continue through the entire premanufacture process, and are ongoing after manufacture begins.  Listed below are some of the formal procedures used to insure the safe storage of ammonia:\n \n1)  Equipment selection is part of a formal review by Certified Professional Engineers.  In the case of this ammonia tank, the selected tank had a one and three sixteenths steel wall thickness. Independent companies performed ultrasonic tests and the Brunell Hardness Test on the tank to certify the tank meets the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) ammonia storage tank requirements.\n\n2)  FCC staff performed a formal Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) before process startup.

While the relief valve is a required piece of equipment, if it vented and failed to reseat, the PHA analysis revealed the release could be significant.  The PHA required the relief valve to be removed annually and inspected by an independent, certified inspector to insure the valve parts would be maintained and inspected regularly.  In addition, since overfilling would cause the relief valve to activate, FCC installed an automatic high level shut-off valve and alarm.  Automatic \nshut-off valves were installed on each fill and discharge line.\n\n3)  Operating procedures are written and available to all Operators for safe handling and storage transfers.   FCC has a formal Management of Change procedure detailing in writing changes associated with equipment, procedures, and personnel.\n\n4)  Each Operator must pass process-specific qualification before assignment to this area.  Competency is determined by written and oral testing.  After this initial testing, FCC has ongoing training for operating and safety analysis, as well as hazard response.  Each shift has members on the Emergency Response Team, which receives additional emergency response training.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk Management Program\nExecutive Summary\nPage 3\n\n\n\n5)  A formal preventative maintenance program is in place to monitor the integrity of the tank, lines and pumps.  FCC performs an ultrasonic testing of the tank every 5 years.  The tank is emptied and internally inspected every 10 years.  Operators visually inspect the tank, lines and pump several times a shift.  The pumps are formally checked every week.\n\nThe oleum alternative release scenario is a pump seal failure during the unloading of a tank truck.
