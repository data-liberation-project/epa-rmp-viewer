(Boskovich) facility located at 711 Diaz Avenue in\nOxnard (see Figure 1).  This facility is a produce preparation and distribution facility, which\noperates various connected ammonia systems to cool produce prior to distribution.  This\nprogram has been prepared pursuant to Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5 of the California Code\nof Regulations.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration systems at Boskovich contain approximately 23,000 pounds of\nammonia.  The maximum quantity of ammonia at the facility is approximately 33,300 pounds\ndue to the presence of the Aqua Ammonia Absorption Refrigeration Plant (AAARP) located on\nthe northeast corner of the Boskovich facility. The AAARP system is owned by Sithe Energies\nand operated by E.F. Oxnard, Inc. (E.F. Oxnard). The land where the AAARP system is located\nis leased from Boskovich by E.F. Oxnard.  Because the AAARP system is owned and operated\nby E.F. Oxnard, risk management and accident prevention issues pertaining to this system are\naddressed in the E.F. Oxnard facility RMP documents.\n\nIn July 1993, Boskovich prepared a Process Safety Management (PSM) Plan and a Risk\nManagement and Prevention Program (RMPP). These documents were updated in August\n1997. Boskovich's PSM and RMPP are referenced by this RMP because they contain many\nof the elements required by the new RMP requirements.\n\n     1.1  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nTo prevent the accidental release of ammonia, Boskovich has developed the following: \n\n- Maintenance and inspection procedures to ensure that equipment is properly maintained and\nfunctioning properly.\n- Operating procedures to ensure that equipment is operated in a manner that minimizes the\npossibility of an ammonia release.\n- Employee training to ensure that operators know how to properly use the equipment and\nnon-operators are aware o"

In\ngeneral the plan includes:\n\n- A list of safety equipment available at the Boskovich facility;\n- Response procedures for minor leaks;\n- Response procedures for major emergencies;\n- Agency notification procedures; and \n- Emergency procedures.\n\nA copy of the Emergency Response Plan (ERP) for Boskovich can be found in Binder 2: Risk\nManagement and Prevention Program, Section 10. Further description of the ERP is contained\nin Section 6.0 Emergency Response Program in this document.\n\n     1.2  Stationary Source and Substance Handled\n\nAs explained above, Boskovich operates various ammonia cooling systems to cool produce\nprior to shipment.  The systems contain approximately 23,000 pounds of ammonia. \n\n     1.3  Accidental Release Scenarios\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario (WC), atmospheric release of the maximum contents of the largest\nhigh pressure vessel (East Freezer; 4,635 lb) in 10 minutes, which is based upon Title 19 CCR\nChapter 4.5 Article 4 criteria, is considered improbable and would result in offsite impacts.\n\nAlternate Scenario 1 (A1) is a one-minute release of a pressure safety valve (PSV) due to the\novercharging of the system from a leaking AAARP solenoid valve.  This scenario also assumes\nthe high pressure switch fails.  This scenario is considered occasional.\n\nAlternate Scenario 2 (A2), is a five-minute release from of a PSV due to the overcharging of\nthe system from a leaking AAARP solenoid valve.  This scenario is the same as A1, except\nit assumes a slower response time by on-site safety personnel (i.e. the release occurs at\nnight).  This scenario is co"

This scenario is considered possible.\n\nIn order to reduce the distance to the endpoint from an accidental release, the following\nadministrative controls and mitigation measures are in place at Boskovich:\n\n- System operation and emergency response training;\n- Routine maintenance schedule and procedures;\n- Written operating procedures;\n- Release detection sensors promote early detection of a release; and\n- Security personnel who monitor the facility to ensure that no unauthorized personnel are on-\nsite.\n\nDetails regarding the offsite consequence analysis for the worst case and alternative release\nscenarios can be found in Section 3.0 of this document.\n\n     1.4  General Accidental Release Prevention Program Components and Substance-Specific\n     Prevention Steps\n\nThe following components are contained in the following sections of this Risk Management\nPlan document:\n\n- Registration\n- Offsite Consequence Analysis\n- Five-year Accident History\n- Program 3 Prevention Program Component\n- Emergency Response Program\n- Certification\n- Update Procedure\n\nIn order to further mitigate the effects of a ammonia release, the following risk management\ncomponents are in place:\n\n- Maintenance and standard operating procedures for the ammonia systems.\n- The site is prevented from being accessed by trespassers with the use of fencing and on-site\nsecurity personnel.\n- Emergency Response Plan.\n- Training for employees.\n- Incident investigation documentation and procedures.\n- Automatic system shutdowns.\n- Windsock for direction of wind visible on neighboring property.\n- Ammonia sensors (solid state) set at 150 ppm at various locations at the facility.\n\n     1.5  Five-year Accident History\n\nBoskovich has had no incidents in the past five years from the ammonia system that resulted\nin on site injuries that required medical attention. \n\n     1.6  Emergency Response Plan Com"

      "SummaryText": "ponents\n\nThe Emergency Response/Action Plan (ERP) for the Boskovich facility has been prepared and\ncontains information for responding to an ammonia release.  The general emergency response\npolicy for the site when ammonia is released is to: \n\n- Determine the severity of the release;\n- Evacuate non-emergency response personnel to a safe area;\n- Have two trained employees don self contained breathing apparatus (SCBA);\n- Isolate and / or fix leak; and \n- Notify the appropriate personnel and authorities.  \n\n     1.7  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe original RMPP plan identified recommendations, all of which have been implemented at\nthe facility.  The RMPP plan was revised in 1997 and no additional recommendations were\nidentified at the time.  There are currently no planned changes to improve safety. \n\nThe following recommendations have been made based on a review of Boskovich's previous\nProcess Hazard and Seismic Analyses, the recent Offsite Consequence Analysis, and site\nvisits:\n\n- Continue to document the implementation of the RMP Program 3 prevention items."
