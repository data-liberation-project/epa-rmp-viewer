Employee Participation - all employees at Baystar are involved in our safety program.  Baystar believes that process safety management and accident prevention are a team effort.  Company employees actively participate in accident prevention and development of our process safety management programs.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the Risk Management Plan rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\n2. Process Safety Information (PSI) - Baystar maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with our processes.  The information is kept current and is available to all employees.\n\n3. Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) - Comprehensive hazard reviews are performed on our covered processes to ensure that hazards are identified, evaluated, and controlled effectively.  The reviews are performed by a multi-disciplinary team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations.  Entire PHAs are revalidated every 5-year and updated as required for changes to the process.  Any findings from the hazard analysis are addressed promptly. \n\n4. Operating Pr"
