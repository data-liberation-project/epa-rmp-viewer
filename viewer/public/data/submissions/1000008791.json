The only materials considered hazardous at our facility are anhydrous ammonia and aqua (a 20wt% solution of ammonia in water).  The only flammable substance at our site is propane.  Our facility has two tanks for storing anhydrous (25,000- and 30,000-gallon), an atmospheric-pressure 15,000 gallon tank for storing aqua, and an atmospheric-pressure 7,000 gallon tank for storing aqua.  The propane tank holds 18,000-gallons.  We have equipment for receiving anhydrous by truck and by rail, equipment for receiving aqua by truck, and equipment for transferring anhydrous and aqua from storage to trucks for delivery to customers.  We have equipment for receiving propane from truck transports and transferring propane from storage to trucks for delivery to customers.  It is our policy to meet, or exceed, all local, state, and national standards relating to handling ammonia.\n\nSite-Specific Process Safety Information is tabulated below.  Specific safety features that we employ to minimize the impact of an accidental release include:\n\n1.  Pull-away shut-off valves that immediately shut to minimize the amount of anhydrous released if a truck accidentally leaves before disconnecting hoses.\n2.  Emergency shut-off valves to minimize the amount anhydrous released if anything unusual occurs during loading or unloading.\n3.  Excess flow valves to prevent flow from the tank if any propane or anhydrous hose or line breaks.\n4.  Pressure relief valves on the anhydrous storage tank to prevent overpressuring and rupture of the tank.\n5.  Diking around the aqua storage tank, to contain any accidental spills.\n6.  Emergency shut-off valves, with both local and remote activation, to minimize the amount released if anything unusual occurs during loading or unloading propane.\n7. Annual inspections by independent inspectors to ensure that our equipment is maintained in the manner that ensures safe oper"

If there is a valve to vent the line segment, open valve and allow line to vent.\n5.  If there is NO valve to vent the line segment, the line segment may be vented from a flange in the line segment as described in Step 6.\n6.  Loosen the flange bolts on the opposite side of flange (to direct any spray, from residual contents in line, away from you).
