CHEMICAL COMPANY, INC. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with Jacksonville FIRE DEPARTMENT which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Distribution of chemical products.  We have 3 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Chlorine, Aqua Ammonia and Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous). The Sulfur Dioxide, Aqua Ammonia and Chlorine are received prepackaged in different size containers.  Chlorine, Aqua Ammonia and Sulfur Dioxide are used only for resell to our customers.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 57,400 lbs. while Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) is 28,700 lbs and Aqua Ammonia is 21,375lbs.\n\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios and alternative release scenarios, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance as well as SAFER/TRACE. The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program  2 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from a 2000 pound Chlorine container.

Under worst case weather conditions, namely Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 2.20 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of  .0087 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine involves a release from a 150 lb. CHLORINE CONTAINER STORAGE process.  The scenario involves the release of 150 lb. of Chlorine in a gaseous form over 2.3 minutes. \n\nWith Class D atmospheric stability and windspeed of 3.0 m/sec the maximum distance of 0.20 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/l.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous) involves a release from a 150 lb. SULFUR DIOXIDE CONTAINER STORAGE process.  The scenario involves the release of 150 lb. of Sulfur Dioxide in a gaseous form over 2.3 minutes. With Class D atmospheric stability and windspeed of 3.0 m/sec the maximum distance of 0.20 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0078 mg/l.\n     \nThe aternative release scenario for Aqua Ammonia involves a release from a 350 gallon portable tank in storage. The scenario involves the release of 2,480lbs. of Aqua Ammonia in a liquid form over 4 minutes. With class D atmospheric stability and windspeed of 3.0 m/sec the maximum distance of 0.3 is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of o.14 mg/1.\n\n4.
