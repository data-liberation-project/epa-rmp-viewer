The most prominent of these include reducing exhaust emissions, improving fuel economy, prolonging oil-drain intervals, and extending equipment life.  The Facility has one regulated flammable substance (2-methylpropene, commonly referred to as isobutylene) and two regulated toxic substances (chlorine and carbon disulfide).  \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies (68.155(a))\n\n\n\nThe Facility has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  The Facility invests in accident prevention, including, but not limited to, the Facility's training of its personnel and the Facility's commitment and consideration of safety in every phase of its operations- from the design to the installation, operation, and maintenance of its processes. The Facility has a Spill Prevention, Containment, and Countermeasure (SPCC) policy which addresses prevention of foreseeable releases of regulated substances as well as the circumstances that if an accidental release occurs, how its personnel will respond to, control and contain that release.    \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps (68.155(c)) \n\n\n\n(A)    Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\n\n\n(i)    Toxic Substance Scenarios:\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario for toxic release is a catastrophic failure of a 90-ton chlorine railcar, resulting in a release of 179,000 lbs. of chlorine gas over a 10-minute period.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures is taken into accou"

Because the plant is located in a populated area, the toxic cloud formed by such an event would reach off-site public receptors. \n\n\n\nAn alternative scenario for chlorine is a failure of the 2-in. diameter liquid charge line between the railcar and the vaporizer.  If this scenario were to occur, automatic sensors would detect chlorine and shut off flow from the railcar immediately, releasing only the contents of the line (approximately 38 lbs. of chlorine) to the atmosphere.  The toxic cloud formed by such an event would reach public receptors immediately adjacent to the facility boundary. \n\n\n\nAn alternative scenario for carbon disulfide is a failure of a 2-in. diameter liquid charge line from a storage tank to a reactor.  If this scenario were to occur, our operators would shut off the flow from the tank within a few minutes.   With the assumption that it requires approximately 1 hour to stop the spill, the results from our analysis should be larger than would actually be the case if this event were to occur.  The toxic cloud formed by such an event would reach nearby public receptors.\n\n\n\n(ii)    Flammable Substance Scenarios:\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario for flammable release is a vapor cloud explosion involving a full railcar inventory of isobutylene.  The maximum railcar inventory of 160,000 lbs. is assumed to be released to the atmosphere, to completely vaporize, and to ignite, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this scenario. The overpressure generated by the explosion would reach nearby off-site public receptors.  \n\n\n\nAn alternative scenario for isobutylene is a rupture of an unloading hose from a railcar containing isobutylene.  If this scenario were to occur, our operators would shut off the flow from the railcar within a few minutes.  For this scenario, ho"

The excessive thermal radiation generated by the pool fire would reach public receptors immediately adjacent to the facility boundary.\n\n\n\n(B)    General Accidental Release Prevention Program Steps\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Facility.  Because processes at the plant that are regulated by the EPA risk management program (RMP) rule are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) rule, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements that are part of the RMP prevention program and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\n(1)    Employee Participation\n\n\n\nThe Facility encourages employees to participate in all facets of PSM and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility accident prevention program.\n\n\n\n(2)    Process Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Facility maintains a number of technical documents used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the facility are responsible for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sh"

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  The Facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the operating procedures for each process, and ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g. automated shutdown systems).  \n\n\n\nThe Facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\n(3)    Process Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nThe Facility has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the each covered process are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe Facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis (PHA) results at least once every 5 years until a process is no longer operating. Between formal PHA reviews, the Facility conducts \"Potential Problem Analyses\" (PPAs) when changes to the process warrant such an evaluation. This mechanism also ensures that the process controls and/or process hazards do not deviate significantly from the original design safety features.

These written procedures are used for both reference and training materials.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  \n\n\n\nIn addition, the operating procedures at the Facility provide guidance on how to respond in the event of an exceedence for process or equipment specific parameters.  This information is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\n(5)    Employee Training\n\n\n\nThe Facility has implemented a comprehensive training program for any employees involved in operating a process.  After successfully completing initial training in the operations of the facility, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate adequate knowledge to perform the duties in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. \n\n \n\nAll operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.

Environmental, health, and safety has been integrated as a key pillar of the production system.  \n\n-  The site recently migrated to a new mechanical integrity management software system and will continue to consolidate maintenance and inspection information into the system, which has allowed for improved tracking of key metrics and better visibility of inspections. Additionally, the asset integrity team is reviewing and updating the piping inspection plans for many of the piping circuits throughout the plant.\n\n-  The site currently utilizes API 754 criteria for identifying and tracking lagging process safety indicators as members of the American Chemistry Council. The site also has an electronic tracking system for leading process safety indicators and challenges to safety systems. This system is planned to be improved to continue to drive process safety performance and reduce process safety events.\n\n\n\nIn the last 5 years Afton has implemented a behavior-based safety program designed to engage all employees throughout the organization, has maintained its status as members of OSHA's VPP program at STAR level, and upgraded fixed gas monitoring for carbon disulfide and flammable gases in two of our covered processes. Additionally, the plant has implemented a critical safety function management program intended to ensure that interlocks, procedures, a"

The program includes scheduled review and maintenance of the process controls and procedures identified as safety critical. The plant also installed several occupied building upgrades based on recommendations from a plant-wide facility siting review.\n\n\n\nFinally, Afton continues to reassess its current PSM and RMP practices to look for ways to improve these programs.  This ongoing effort is part of Afton's commitment to compliance and ACC's Responsible Care program.\n\n"
