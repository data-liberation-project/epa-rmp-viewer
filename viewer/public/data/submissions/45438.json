The terminal has a mission to provide the highest quality service to customers while maintaining a safe workplace and protecting the environment. The terminal is proactive in achieving these goals. The terminal policy is to prevent releases before they happen and to provide the appropriate level of emergency response should an accidental release or other emergency occurs.\n\n1.2 THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe IMTT- Bayonne terminal requires an RMP because it stores one compound in excess of the RMP threshold quantities as identified in the Federal Register, January 31, 1994. These include the following.\n\nButane - rail car unloading racks and operations in Yards 4 and 6\n\nThe New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) has exempted butane from the requirements of the TCPA Program.\n\n1.3 WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n1.4 ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n1.5 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nIMTT maintains a comprehensive accidental release prevention program. For all materials handled on site along with the regulated substance, safety information is maintained regarding the materials, tanks and associated equipment. A hazard analysis has been carried out for the regulated process. \n\nOperating procedures including ISO 9000 procedures and work instructions are followed in all loading and unloading operations.  IMTT- Bayonne operators are trained in the procedures and receive additional safety training.\n\nIMTT- Bayonne maintains an extensive maintenance facility and provides continued inspection and maintenance of tanks and loading and unloading systems at the terminal.\n\nIncidents are tracked through an incident investigation program with prompt follow-up."

The groups maintain a large inventory of fire fighting apparatus and emergency response equipment and materials.\n\nIn addition, there is an annual emergency response drill coordinated with local emergency planning and response agencies.\n\n1.8 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThere are no planned changes to improve safety for either regulated product."
