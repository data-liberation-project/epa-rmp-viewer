The facility is located at 100 Pine Drive, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania and is owned and operated by Capital Region Water.\r\n\r\nThe WTP is a stationary source with one process assigned to Program Level 2. The regulated substance of the process is chlorine. The chlorine disinfection process involves one building which contains the chlorine cylinders, the chlorine scales, the water injectors, and the chlorinators. An adjacent docking area is where the extra cylinders are stored, when empty. The amount of chlorine that is connected at any one time is four, one-ton cylinders. The facility is manned 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The operators check the chlorine room at least four times a day and respond to alarms that occur.\r\n\r\nIt is the policy of CRW to promote the awareness and detection of a spill/leak or the potential of a spill/leak of any regulated substance in order to initiate a timely response to mitigate or eliminate a health or safety hazard and/or an environmental incident. Management's commitment to process safety is a critical element of CRW's Risk Management Plan to ensure that program elements are integrated and implemented on an ongoing basis; and all parties understand the lines of responsibility and communications.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the CRW prevention program is to ensure that management staff and employees understand the safety-related aspects of the equipment and processes, know what limits they place on operations, and adopt accepted standards and codes where they apply. Key elements of the program include: training, preventive maintenance, state-of\u00ad the-art process and safety equipment, operating procedures, hazard review, auditing, and inspection.\r\n\r\nCapital Region Water has not had any accidental release of the regulated substance, chlorine, from its covered proces"
