              "Description": " The Columbus plant has a single, closed-loop ammonia system.  The ammonia system is used to cool water to 33 to 40 degrees (F).  The frigid water is circulated throughout the plant to cool various processes and storage tanks.  At no time does the ammonia come in contact with the water.  All of the ammonia handling equipment is located in the site's Energy Center.\n\n   The system is comprised of 37,000 pounds of ammonia, two ammonia compressors, four chill plates (heat exchangers), three condensers, one high pressure receiver, one low pressure receiver, control systems, relief vents, safety equipment (such as leak detection and ammonia monitors) and associated piping.  The compressors are differently sized for efficient energy use.  The smaller is rated at 270 tons of cooling, the larger is 435 tons.  A ton of cooling power equals 12,000 Btu/hour.  Residential air conditioners are generally in the three to five ton range.  Operation of the system is monitored and controlled 24 hrs per day, 365 days per year from the Energy Center Control Room.\n\n   The ammonia side of the process acts as two systems. On the low pressure side, liquid ammonia is pumped from the Low Pressure Receiver through the chill plates while water is circulated over the outside of the chill plates.  The liquid ammonia absorbs energy from the water through the chill plates and is turned into a low pressure gas.  The water temperature is reduced from the loss of energy.  This water is circulated throughout the plant for cooling.  The set pressure of the ammonia in the chill plate determines the temperature of the water leaving the chill plate.  Chill plates can be added or subtracted depending on the cooling load.  The low pressure gas is then returned to the low pressure receiver.\n\n   The second side uses the ammonia compressors to turn the ammonia vapor back into a liquid. The low pressure gas is drawn from the top of the low pressure receiver into the ammonia compressors and is compressed into a high pressure gas. The high pressure gas then travels through the ammonia condensers. The condensers use fans and water circulated over ammonia-containing pipes to remove the heat from the ammonia and return it to a liquid. The liquid then drains by gravity into the high pressure receiver.  The liquid stored in the high pressure receiver is used to maintain the proper liquid level in the low pressure receiver.\n\n   The compressors are located in adjacent rooms, each having an exhaust fan.  Both fans normally run in low speed at all times.  The fans are regularly tested through our Preventive Maintenance (PM) system to assure that they continue to work properly. Each compressor room has two ammonia detectors which are tied into the monitoring system. One detector is set at 50 ppm and the other at 300 ppm.  If a level of 50 ppm of ammonia is detected, an alarm sounds in the control room.  If a level of 300 ppm is detected, an alarm sounds in the control room and both exhaust fans will switch to high speed.  The fans are programmed such that in the event of a leak in either room, both exhaust fans switch to high speed.  \n\n   All safety valves are piped into a common relief piping system that has both a rupture disk and an ammonia detector in the piping at the discharge point. The detector is tied into our computer monitoring system and will sound if a reading of 50 ppm is detected. All safety valves are replaced every five years.  Safety valves allow the system to relieve over-pressurization in a controlled manner, avoiding a catastrophic failure. \n\n   Each piece of ammonia equipment is on the Preventative Maintenance program. The PMs are generated automatically at the designed frequency from a computer database. In addition to the PM system, each year during the plant shutdown, a certified ammonia contractor performs a complete inspection of each compressor.  The certified contractors also check several other pieces of ammonia equipment such as alarms and control systems.\n\n   Each valve is numbered to correspond to our process and instrumentation drawings (P&IDs) for the ammonia system. All difficult to reach hand valves have been equipped with chain operation for ease of operation and faster response in the event of an ammonia release. \n\n   All energy center employees are certified Hazardous Materials Technicians per Federal OSHA requirements, found at 49 CFR 1910.120(q).  Each Energy Center employee receives annual refresher training, as required.  Additionally, each employee receives a number of required safety training courses such as: Lock Out/Tag Out, Confined Space Entry, Hazard Communication, Compressed Gas handling, Safety Awareness, Area Safety Rules, PSM Video, PSM Ammonia Work Permit, PSM Equipment, PSM Operating Procedures Review, PSM Operating Procedures Demonstration.  The result is a highly trained work force that is extremely familiar with the ammonia system and able to respond to any contingency.\n\n   The site also has an Emergency Response Team (ERT) on site which is staffed on each of the three shifts.  ERT members are also trained to OSHA's \"Hazardous Materials Technician\" level.  These ERT members are first responders for any site emergency and are specifically trained to assist Energy Center Personnel with any situation that may arise. \n\n   A \"What If\" analysis was performed on the ammonia system in 1995.  Each piece of equipment and piping was reviewed during this analysis. In 1999, a process hazard analysis was performed on the system. These analyses will continue to be performed to identify potential risks and establish corrective actions.  The ammonia system is also governed by a \"management of change\" program that ensures that any changes to the system will be subjected to thorough engineering and safety reviews.  The goal of these analyses is to ensure continued safe operation  and prevent failures anywhere in the system.",

The detector is tied into the site's monitoring system and will sound if a reading of 50 ppm is detected. All safety valves are replaced every five years.\n\nA \"worst-case scenario\" using conditions predefined by U.S. EPA requires dispersion modeling to reflect all of the following assumptions: all control devices fail; the Energy Center building collapses; the entire contents of the ammonia system are released into the environment in ten minutes; and atmospheric conditions are selected that minimize downwind mixing.  It is Abbott's strong contention that equipment design, rarely opening the system to add or remove ammonia, frequent inspection and maintenance, and high level of training provided to site personnel make the actual probability of a \"worst case\" release an extremely remote occurrence.\n\nThe results of the worst-case scenario would result in an off-site impact.  Depending on wind direction, a long narrow plume could reach one or more of the following potential receptors: residences, schools, recreational areas, industrial and office areas, a hospital or a correctional facility.  Modeling and results are summarized in Section 2.  The modeling software used was Degadis+ 2.1.\n\nAn alternate release scenario for the Cleveland Avenue facility involves a break in a liquid level sight glass.  The subsequent ammonia release, contained inside of the Energy Center building and promptly correct by site personnel, would result in a much smaller off-site impact.  This scenario was selected based on an actual incident that occurred once in site history (but more than five years ago).  \n\nThe alternate scenario results in a much smaller release"
