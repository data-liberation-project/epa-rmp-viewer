(OEHI), a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corporation, is strongly committed to employee and  public safety, as well as sound environmental practices.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe OEHI stationary source contains four (4) regulated processes related to natural gas production and one process related to fossil fuel power generation that supports the other processes.     Within these processes, OEHI has identified flammable substances and mixtures of these substances in various concentrations (Methane, Ethane, Propane, Butane, Isobutane, Pentane, and Isopentane) that are present in amounts that exceed the threshold quantities.   One process contains ethyl mercaptan that is used for natural gas odorizing and one (1) process contains anhydrous ammonia that is used for emissions control and is present in an amount that exceeds the threshold quantity.  Natural gasoline, comprised of pentane and heavier hydrocarbons, is present in three of the processes having storage vessels.  The regulated processes are: \n\n\n\nID    Program    Description        Chemicals\n\n1    1        LTS-1            Flammable hydrocarbons\n\n2    1        LTS-2            Flammable hydrocarbons\n\n3    1        Cogeneration  Plant    Ammonia (anhydrous)\n\n4    1        Storage & Loading    Propane, Butane, Natural Gasoline, Ethyl mercaptan\n\n5    1        CGP1                   Propane, Butane, Natural Gasoline\n\n\n\nAll of these processes are assigned to a Level 1 Prevention Program as 1) there have been no accidents in the past five (5) years that resulted in significant off-site impacts, 2) there are no public rec"

Although these processes are assigned to the lowest prevention program level, OEHI has implemented higher level prevention program elements consistent with an RMP Level 3 Prevention Program and OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements.\n\n\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\nWorst Case Scenarios, which involve release of the entire contents of the largest vessels and pipelines, were modeled for regulated toxic and flammable substances in each process using the EPA RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance tables and equations.  Administrative controls considered in the analysis include inventory limitations for storage vessels based upon high level alarms and shut-downs to ensure adequate \"head space\".  No mitigation measures were considered that would serve to limit the distances for these scenarios.  Worst case scenario analysis determined that there are no public receptors or environmental receptors within the distance to the toxic or flammable substance endpoints.\n\n\n\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps Our facility has taken all steps necessary to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. \n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at OEHI. These elements are the basis for Process Safety Management system as required under 29 CFR 1910.119 / CalOSHA ? 5189. \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information \n\nOEHI maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the hazards of the chemicals used in the processes, information regarding the technology of the process (process chemistry, process flow diagrams, safe upper and lower limits for "

The primary methodology used to conduct these analyses is Hazard And Operability  (HAZOP) studies.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner based on relative risk of potential hazards.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purpose of safely conducting activities within covered processes, OEHI maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\n\nOEHI has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes as well as emergency response activities. Refresher training is provided every 3 years.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nOEHI carries out documented inspections, tests, and maintenance checks of process equipment to ensure adequate mechanical integrity.  These activities are conducted by the Mechanical Integrity group and Maintenance persons.  Only qualified personnel are permitted to carry out inspections, tests, and maintenance activities on process equipment and systems such as pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, pumps, compressors and electrical equipment.

Equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are tracked to completion through the company maintenance work order system and corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nA Management of Change program is in place at OEHI to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures, and personnel. Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and trained on the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications of established processes are conducted whenever there is a change in the safety information as part of the Management of Change process. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nOEHI conducts internal audits on a regular basis to verify compliance and effectiveness of the prevention program elements defined by the RMP rule and OSHA Process Safety Management.  Although compliance audits are required at least every 3 years under OSHA PSM, current practice is to conduct audits on an annual basis.  Corrective actions required as a result of the audits are tracked to completion through the company action tracking system.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nOEHI promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent future releases. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nOEHI believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. Company employees are strongly encouraged to express "

In addition, employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs).\n\nContractors\n\nOEHI utilizes contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities. Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out. OEHI has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n\n5.  Five-year Accident History\n\nOEHI has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases during the last 5 years. Due to effective release prevention program elements, there has been no accidental releases during this period that meet the RMP reporting requirements.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Plan\n\nOEHI maintains a written emergency response plan (Emergency Management Plan) that covers accidental releases of hazardous materials. The plan includes all aspects of emergency management, including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas. To ensure proper functioning, emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced. In addition, the Emergency Management Plan is regularly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n"
