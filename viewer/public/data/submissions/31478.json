We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n *  A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n *  An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n *  A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n *  An overview of our emergency response program\n *  An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n\nFACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nOur facility is a food distribution warehouse which uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant.  Perishables are kept in the cooler sections.  Frozen food items are kept in the freezer sections.  The anhydrous ammonia we use as a refrigerant is a chemical that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release.\n\nToxics\n\nCurrently, we have approximately 23,530 pounds of anhydrous ammonia on site in our refrigeration system.  Under most conditions, ammonia is a toxic chemical (see Flammables). \n\nFlammables\n\nAmmonia has an NFPA Fire Hazard Rating of 1 (slight).  In the presence of an ignition source, ammonia is flammable in air at concentrations between 16% and 25%.  Also, ammonia in combination with lubricating oil may be flammable at lower concentrations, depending on the amount of oil dispersed in the amm"

Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n *  Process safety information\n *  Process hazard analysis\n *  Operating procedures\n *  Training\n *  Mechanical integrity\n *  Management of change\n *  Pre-startup review\n *  Compliance audits\n *  Incident investigation\n *  Employee participation\n *  Hot work permit\n *  Contractors\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\na.  Scheduled preventive maintenance of our ammonia refrigeration system according to manufacturer recommendations.\nb.  Certified training of our ammonia refrigeration personnel\nc.  Adoption of a process safety management program [29 CFR 1910.119]\nd.  Membership in the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR)\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  \n\nWe have not had any reportable incidents or releases within the past five years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local re"

Coordinating with local fire department and local emergency response team to schedule emergency drills.\n\n2.  Enhanced employee awareness training in process safety and risk management program elements.\n\n3.  Add an emergency pumpdown switch to system.\n\n4.  Add rupture discs with permanent indicating guage before relief valves."
