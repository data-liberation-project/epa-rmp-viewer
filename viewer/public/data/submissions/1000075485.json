The plant manufactures pesticides which require the handling of Acutely Hazardous Materials in quantities which make them subject to the RMP requirements of the Clean Air Act. AMVAC's Risk Management Plan is prepared in accordance with the RMP Rule 40 CFR 68. The AMVAC Axis facility has a North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code of 32532 for Pesticide and Agricultural Chemical Manufacturing. The AMVAC RMP must be revised and resubmitted every five years.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the K500/ K550/ Tokuthion process has been out of operation since 2019 and therefore a PHA has not been performed since 09/30/2019. Before restarting the process, a new PHA or PHA update/ renew will be performed. PSSR, training, and operating procedure reviews will also be followed before reinstating K500/ K550/ Tokuthion operation.\r\n\r\nRelease Prevention and Emergency Response Policy:\r\nAMVAC is committed to operating and managing the facility in keeping with applicable regulations and good operating practices. AMVAC has implemented operating practices in its endeavors to minimize the risk of an accidental release of a regulated substance. If an incident were to occur, AMVAC has preparedness measures in place to respond appropriately and minimize the release impact. \r\n\r\nStationary Source and regulated substances handled:\r\nThe AMVAC Axis facility was originally a portion of the FMC (Formerly Dupont) Mobile Manufacturing Center. It was purchased from Dupont by AMVAC on May 18, 2001. The AMVAC Axis facility and the FMC (Formerly Dupont) facility are on a common site. The AMVAC facility consists of various buildings, chemical process vessels, above ground storage tanks, truck loading/unloading stations, railcar loading/unloading stations, and various ancillary equipment.\r\n\r\nTh"

Isopropylamine (MIPA), CAS # 75-31-0\r\n\r\nAs listed in the RMP, chlorine and phosphorus trichloride are chemicals associated with multiple covered processes. These covered processes are run as batch processes and operate using some of the same tanks, equipment, etc during different campaigns. The covered processes that utilize the same tanks/ equipment are unable to be in operation at the same time. As such, maximum quantities of chlorine and phosphorus trichloride are the same for each of their applicable processes and not additive when determining the maximum quantities for the site.\r\n \r\nAMVAC'S MISSION STATEMENT\r\n\r\nAMVAC Chemical Corporation (AMVAC) is committed to:\r\n- Providing its customers with sustainable environmentally responsible, cost-effective and high-quality products on time.\r\n- Providing a safe, healthy and secure working environment for its employees.\r\n- To operate in a manner which meets or exceeds existing laws and regulations and reflects the high level of concern and respect for the local community.\r\n- Investing in its future through aggressive research and development of new innovative products and markets.\r\n- Providing its investors with higher than normal returns.\r\n\r\nSAFETY FIRST POLICY\r\n\r\nOne of Amvac's missions is to provide a safe and secure environment for its employees while maintaining a high level of concern and respect for the community.  To accomplish this mission, it is necessary for Amvac to maintain safe conditions at all of its facilities and to prevent a release of any kind to the environment. Every employee's fi"

If the supervisor is unavailable, the employee must immediately inform the Plant Manager, Operations Manager or Manager on duty of the situation so that the condition can immediately be corrected.  Any and all unsafe conditions must be corrected immediately and notification of the supervisor is required in a timely manner.  Employees need not fear any form of reprisal as the result of their compliance with this policy.  Amvac will not tolerate any reprisals towards an employee who reports non-compliance to this policy.  \r\n\r\nWorst-Case and Alternative Case Release Scenario for covered toxic substances:\r\nThe site-specific worst-case and alternative case release scenario for covered toxic substances is on file at the covered facility.\r\n\r\nWorst-Case and Alternative Case Release Scenario for covered flammable substances:\r\nThe site-specific worst-case and alternative case release scenario for covered flammable substances is on file at the covered facility.\r\n\r\nAMVAC's Release Prevention Program:\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information 40 CFR 68.65 - AMVAC has a written Process Safety Information (PSI) procedure that outlines how process safety information is maintained for all covered processes.
