To fulfill this goal and commitment, Galaxy Chemicals has establish and practice  system and procedures to porvidie safe operation of the processess at the facility.  Galaxy Chemicals has implemented the risk  management program(RMP) as a part of our safety program.  This program also help us manage the risk at our  facililty and complies wth the requiremens of the Environmental Protection Agency's EPA requlation 40CFR Part 68,  Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs, ( the RMP rule).  This plan is intended to satisfy the Risk Management Plan requirement of the RMP ruls68.150 through 68.185.  This Risk Management Program also provide  public information about this program.\n\nOff Site Consequence Analaysis\nThe RMP rule requires Galaxy Chemicals to perform an offsite consequence analysis forone worst-case and alternate release scenario for the anhydrous hydrogen fluoride, which is toxic substance. Both worst case and alternate scenario are included in the RMP filing.  \nThe worst case scenario is the falilure of 200 gallons storage tank, which releases 1300 lbs of HF to a toxic  end point of 2.6 miles with a population of 4500 people.  \n\nThe alternate  case scenario uses a copper tube with a leak and developes a 1/8 inch hole.  The HF release is 5 lbs, to a toxic end point of 0.1 mile with a population of 50  people.  No enveironmental receptors are in distance. \n\nRegulated Substances and Galaxy Chemicals\nGalaxy Chemicals uses hydrogen fluoride, HF in many of its manufacturing process in 50% of higher concentration.  These process involve neutralization procedures with hydrogen fluoride and the final products contain trace amounts of hydrogen fluoride.  Hydrogen fluoride is stored in storage tanks for use in manufacturing.\n\nGalaxy Chemicals stores 3,000 lbs( 400 g"

The weight of this acid exceeds the RMP rule threshold quantity for hydrogen fluoride, HF acid in a process (1000 lbs) and therefore HF acid storage process is covered the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's process safety managementr egulation and potential offsite consequences resulting from an accidental release of HF acid. This process falls under the RMP Program 3 prevention program.\n\nEmergency Response and Accidental Release Prevention Policies\n\nAt Galaxy Chemicals the safety of our employees, neighbours and the public and environment is the top priority and commitment which ensure the preservation of the accidental releases of the hazardous materials. Galaxy Chemicals implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseable releases of hazardous chemicals.  Ijn the  case of an accidental release , Galaxy Chemicals controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will prevent the injury to the public and environment\n\n\nAccdental Release Prog;ram and Chemical-Speicific Prevention Steps\n\nUnder the RMP rule ,  a program 3,  prevention program is required for the storage of anhydrous hydrogen fluoride.,  The following paragraph describe the elements of the prevention program at Galaxy Chemicals. \n\nProcess Hazardous Analysis and Safety Informatin\n\nGalaxy Chemicals provide Material Safety \nData Sheets to its employees for the physical data and safety information about hydrogen fluoride.  The written procedures are also provides and discussed before the start up of manufacturing.  Galaxy Chemicals performs the hazard review of the hydrogen fluoride storage process to control process hazards.  \nOperating Procedures\nGalaxy Chemicals have developed the operating procedures to perform the work in a safe manner.  These procedures are also use to train. \n\nIncident Investigation\nGalaxy Chemicals investigate"
