      "SummaryText": "This Risk Management Plan (RMP) was written in accordance with all provisions contained in 40 CFR 68, Risk Management Program, as required by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The City of Richland uses chlorine gas for disinfection purposes at the water treatment plant and wastewater treatment plant in quantities that exceed the 2,500-lb threshold limit defined by the regulations.  Therefore, this document was prepared to provide a Program 3 framework under which proactive management of the chlorine systems, training of operations staff, and emergency response procedures can be integrated to ensure that the public health and safety is protected to the maximum practical extent possible during a release scenario.\n\nIt should be noted that the water treatment plant and the wastewater treatment plant have not had a chlorine gas release during the past five years, and that substantial controls exist to prevent chlorine releases from escaping from the chlorine storage rooms to the ambient environment.  However, the possibility of release scenarios occurring during cylinder transport and loading has been analyzed, and contingency response plans formulated to ensure the literal requirements and intent of 40 CFR 68 will be met or exceeded where feasible."
