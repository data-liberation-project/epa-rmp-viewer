      "SummaryText": "The City of Gillette Environmental Services Water Division (COGWD) accidental release prevention program involves a unified approach that uses available technology, procedures and management policies to meet requiremnents. The  COGWD emergency policy involves the preparation of response plans tailored to each facility and to the emergency response available within the community.   All applicable procedures of the EPA RMP are adhered to.\n\nPump Station One (PS1) is a facility used to collect raw water from the wells located in and around the City of Gillette, disinfect the water and send out into the distrbution system.  PS1 is an unmanned remotely controlled station.  PS1, for the purpose of RMP, consists of a chlorine storage room  and a feed room.  These two rooms have their own entrances to the outside. The rooms are aside of the main pump bay. The pump bay holds the leak repair kits and self contained breathing apparatuses.  The maximum amount of chlorine on site at any one time is four 1-ton containers (8000 lbs.), only two containers are on line at once. The feed room contains feed control valves and injection equipment.  PS1 is equiped with a computer contol operating and alarming system.  Operators check the facility every week, or as often as needed.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of the two chlorine release scenarios identified as \"worst case scenario (WCS)\" and \"altenative case scenario (ACS).\"  The first scenario is defined by the RMProgram states that \" the owner/operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel in released as a gas over ten minutes,\" due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative release scenario is defined as a \"more likely to occur leak than the worst case release scenario.  OCA Guidance was used for modeling of this station.\n\nAt PS1 there would be offsite consequences for the WCS.  The station is located on the north end of the  city.

      "SummaryText": " we have in place are, written operating procedres, chlorine gas leak detectors, and enclosured rooms for the chlorine containers & equipment.\n\nOur ACS would consist of a lead washer leak or the connecting tubes leak.  The same mitigating systems would apply as for the WCS.  The rooms themselves would cut the amount released by 45%.  The chlorine gas detector would alert us in case of a leak so we could possibly stop a release in a minimal amount of time.\n\nThe COGWD fashioned their accidental release prevention program after OSHA's PSM program.  Our personel have been trained in case of leaks by in house personel and by the Campbell County LEPC/Fire Dept.  Personel have had classroom (Hazmat) and on site drill trraining.\n\nThe COGWD has not had a accidental chlorine gas release over the last five years.\n\nThe COGWD's emergency response plans have been coordinated with the Campbell County LEPC/Fire Dept. and personel have been trained by the Campbell County LEPC/Fire Dept..  The COGWD personnel has had Hazmat training, SCBA training, and the required first aid training.  Drills are conducted by the Campbell County LEPC/Fire Dept. with COGWD personnel.  The rooms containing the chlorine containers and equipment do have leak detectors that are tied into the alarm system.  \n\nThere are not any plans in place at this time to change any equipment to improve safety.  Training and drills will continue as usual.  The City of Gillette also has a safety committee that inspects all facilities periodically to make sure procedures are followed and hazards are not over looked."
