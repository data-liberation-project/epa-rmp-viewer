      "SummaryText": "Gordon Food Service operates a food service distribution facility in Shepherdsville, KY.  \n\n\n\nLike most cold storage warehouses, we use anhydrous ammonia in our refrigeration system. Ammonia is the best refrigerant \n\navailable for our use.  Because of its moderate toxicity and slight flammability, ammonia is considered a hazardous material.\n\n\n\nGordon Food Service is committed to maintaining a safe manufacturing operation for our employees and the surrounding community. Our refrigeration system obeys our local building and fire codes, as well as industry-consensus codes\n\nand standards where appropriate.  Finally, to comply with requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the United States Environmental Protection Agency, we have a Process Safety Management \n\nprogram to help us operate and maintain the system safely.\n\n\n\nOur priority is to prevent accidental releases of hazardous materials instead of merely responding to problems.  Our Process Safety Management program includes elements addressing:\n\n- Employee Participation: We involve our employees at all appropriate\n\npoints in our program.\n\n- Process Safety Information: We maintain information relating to the\n\nsafety of ammonia and the design limits of the refrigeration system so\n\nthat our employees are fully informed.\n\n- Process Hazards Analysis: We conduct detailed studies of our\n\nrefrigeration system to identify the\n\nimportant hazards and safeguards.\n\n- Operating Procedures: We provide written operating procedures to\n\nhelp our staff stay within the safe operating limits of the\n\nrefrigeration equipment.\n\n- Mechanical Integrity (Maintenance and Quality Control): We are establishing a\n\ncomprehensive program of inspections and preventive maintenance to\n\nkeep mechanical failures from occurring. We follow the IIAR standards for compliance and operations\n\n- Training: We train our mechanics in safe operation and maintenance\n\nof the refrigeration system. Our Refrigeration Technicians are certified"

All hot work permits are approved by the maintenance management team\n\n- Emergency Response: We coordinate our response to emergencies, \n\nwith the Shepherdsville Fire Department.\n\n- Incident Investigation: After an incident, we investigate to\n\ndetermine the causes and any suitable actions to address them.  We have had no previous accidents involving our refrigeration system.\n\n- Compliance Audits: Approximately every three years, we examine the\n\nsafety program in detail to identify areas for improvement.\n\n- Trade Secrets: OSHA and EPA require us to maintain a trade secrets\n\nprogram in case confidential information affecting the safety of the\n\nammonia refrigeration system is ever found.\n\n- Management System: An overall management system monitors the ongoing\n\nprogress of safety items.\n\n\n\nAs required by the EPA, we have analyzed \"worst-case\" and\n\n\"alternative\" hypothetical ammonia release scenarios and their\n\nconsequences, details of which appear in other portions of this Risk\n\nManagement Plan. The methodology used to evaluate these accidents is\n\nprescribed by regulation, and makes no effort to estimate the\n\nlikelihood or \"risk\" of these incidents. \n\n\n\nThe \"worst-case\" release scenario involves loss of the contents of a\n\nhigh-pressure receiver vessel over ten minutes.
