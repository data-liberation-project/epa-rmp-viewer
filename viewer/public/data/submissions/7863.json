The combined quantity of hydrogen used in these systems exceeds the threshold quantity for hydrogen.  The systems interconnected are: the Hydrogen Water Chemistry System (provides hydrogen to reduce corrosion potential of reactor internal components), the Generator Cooling System (provides cooling media for keeping the generators cool, when running), the Hydrogen Control System (maintains sufficient amounts of hydrogen in the generator), and the Hydrogen Seal Oil System (provides seal mechanism keeping hydrogen in the generator, when operational).  These are two identical systems, of each type, one for Unit 1 and one for Unit 2.  All hydrogen for these systems originates from the Hydrogen Storage Facility.

QCNPS has two 2511 mega-watt thermal rated reactors generating electricity for northern Illinois.  QCNPS is located in the northwest corner of Illinois' Rock Island County.  The Mississippi River forms the western border of the 784 acre site.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at QCNPS:\n\nIt is the policy of QCNPS to perform work activities in a professional, skilled, and highly competent  manner.  Safety is our number one priority, in both spirit and action.  Our policies drive our employees toward the performance of activities in an atmosphere where conservative decision making and safe work practices are our norm.  Our Safety Handbook, procedures, and policies all are driven by this desire to perform activities in a safe manner.  Our Team at QCNPS, both Management and Bargaining Union employees (Local 15 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers), are committed to providing and maintaining a safe environment.  We are, however, prepared to deal with any anticipated emergency situation.  Highly dedicated individuals compliment our emergency response policies by providing a highly trained, highly competent, and highly skilled response efforts.  We have policies and measures in-place compliant with the following emergency response requirements:  Fire, Medical, Hazardous Materials Emergency Response (HAZMAT), Resource Conservation & Recovery Act (RCRA), Spill Prevention Control & Countermeasure Plan (SPCC), and General Site Emergency Plan (GSEP).     \n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled at QCNPS:\n\nHydrogen is the only regulated substance applicable to 40 CFR 68, above the threshold quantity, used at QCNPS.  QCNPS has various interconnected plant systems that use hydrogen; the Hydrogen Water Chemistry (HWC), Generator Cooling, Hydrogen Control and Hydrogen Seal Oil systems.  Two identical system"

For the purposes of this standard, the hydrogen contained in these various plant systems is considered one process.  The chemistry for the combined process is simple:  Hydrogen used in HWC system has the following process chemistry: 2H2 + O2 = 2H2O.  Hydrogen injected into the feed water combines with free oxygen in the water to form water.  This \"removal\" of oxygen reduces the corrosion potential for reactor vessel internals.  Hydrogen is used in the Generator Cooling system as a cooling media, because of it's unique chemical properties, for the units operating generators.  Hydrogen Control makes up for lost hydrogen in the Generator Cooling system and Hydrogen Seal Oil system keeps the hydrogen in the operating generator.  For these three systems, there is no process chemistry.  The maximum intended inventory of hydrogen, in all systems making up the process, is approximately 12,000 pounds. \n\n\nQCNPS Worst-Case and Alternate Release Scenarios:\n\nQCNPS modeled Worst-Case and Alternate Release Scenarios, based on seriousness and probability of release.  Our Worst-Case and one Alternate Release Scenario result in an endpoint that leaves our facilities' site boundaries, as modeled by the EPA's RMP*Comp program.  Fortunately, QCNPS has no projected impact to population receptors (other than people who would happen to be on the Mississippi River, should a worst-case type event occur) and only slight impact to environmental receptors, the Mississippi River.  The modeling methods for this type of release are extremely conservative when compared to most applicable models available.  This provides some assurance that a worst-case type event would in fact have little or no impact outside the boundaries of our facility.  We still control all of our processes, maintenance activities, inspections, testing, a"

The Nuclear Power industry, due to the inherent risk a catastrophic event could pose to the public and the environment, place great importance on the procedures and policies governing our actions.  We fully comprehend the inherent dangers any catastrophic event has on the site, public, and the environment.  As a result, we place a significant amount of resources in planning and performing activities in a manner that minimizes a potential event.  To Limit the potential of a large release associated with the HWC system, there is a hydrogen monitoring system that monitors for hydrogen leaks around the injection piping and equipment of the HWC system.  The hydrogen line that supplies hydrogen to equipment in the protected area contains two excess (limiting) flow check valves, one at the Hydrogen Storage Facility and one in the piping where it enters the Turbine Building.  These valves are designed to isolate the line if a flow exceeds the set point, thus limiting the amount of hydrogen that could be lost.  The storage vessels and piping in the Hydrogen Storage Facility are protected from overpressure concerns by relief and safety valves.  \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program for QCNPS:\n\nQCNPS fully implemented the requirements of this standard to prevent an accidental release of hydrogen from occurring at our facility.  We have gathered safety information on the process applicable to this standard.  We have performed an extensive process hazard analysis and are currently evaluating and resolving the recommendations identified during that analysis.
