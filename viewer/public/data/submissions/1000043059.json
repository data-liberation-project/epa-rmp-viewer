The PHA is updated and revalidated every five years.\r\n- Standard operating procedures (SOPs) are used to provide the basis for proper and safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  The SOPs include procedures for normal operations, startup, shutdown, emergency operations, and emergency shutdown.  They also describe safe operating limits for temperature and pressure, the consequences of operating outside these safe operating limits, and a description of safety systems and how they operate.\r\n- Refrigeration system operators receive refresher training at least every three years.  The training content is based on the process safety information and operating procedures.  The training program ensures that the operators understand the nature and causes of problems arising from system operations and serves to increase awareness with respect to the hazards particular to ammonia and the refrigeration process.\r\n- Contractors that are hired to work on, or adjacent to, the refrigeration system are pre-qualified based on their knowledge of ammonia refrigeration, understanding of applicable codes and standards, and their demonstrated ability to work safely.  In addition, these contractors are periodically evaluated to ensure that they continue to work safely.\r\n- A preventative maintenance program is in place at the Luverne facility.  This includes regular inspection of major powered equipment, including compressors, pumps and large fans, bearings, couplings, shaft seals, mountings, etc., for vibration or incipient mechanical failure, and regular inspection and calibration of liquid level sensors, temperature and pressure instruments, switches and shutdown devices that have safety implications.\r\n- A mechanical integrety inspection of ammonia refrigeration system has been conducted"

      "SummaryText": "1.0    SOURCE\r\nThe Gold'n Plump Poultry Luverne facility (Luverne facility) in Luverne, Minnesota is subject to the USEPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) for Accidental Chemical Release regulations (40 CFR 68) because it has a refrigeration system that contains more than the threshold quantity (10,000 pounds) of anhydrous ammonia (CAS Number 7664-41-7).  The anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) refrigeration system is used to control the temperature for chicken processing and packaging.  \r\n\r\n2.0    POTENTIAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\r\nAs required by the RMP rule requirements, two specifically defined release scenarios (a worst-case release and an alternative-case release) were analyzed to determine the maximum distance to an endpoint where the ammonia concentration is 200 parts per million in air, or 0.02 percent.  The release scenarios analyzed are based upon EPA guidance.  \r\n\r\n3.0    PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nThe facility has carefully considered the potential for accidental releases of ammonia, such as the occurrence of the worst-case and alternative-release scenarios described in Section 2.0.  To help minimize the probability and severity of an ammonia release, a prevention program that satisfies the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals (29 CFR 1910.119) has been implemented.  The key components of the prevention program are summarized below:\r\n\r\n- The development of an employee participation program, which includes Luverne facility employees from all areas within the plant.\r\n- The development, documentation, and operator availability of critical process safety information regarding the hazards of ammonia, the design basis of the system, and the equipment.  This information is used to fully understand and safely operate the ammonia refrigeration system.\r\n- The performance of a formal process hazard analysis (PHA) on the ammonia refrigeration system using a What-If Protection Analysis..

      "SummaryText": "by an independent firm.  Additionally, the facility insurance company typically inspects the plant every two years.\r\n- Formal authorization systems (i.e., management of change procedure, pre-startup safety review) are in place to ensure that system changes or expansions are as safe as the original design and that an independent recheck confirms that the changes are consistent with the engineering design and in a condition to be safely operated prior to startup.\r\n- Events that might cause an accidental or unexpected release of ammonia are subjected to a formal investigation.  The objective of the investigation is to correct deficiencies in such a way as to prevent recurrence.\r\n- Prior to the performance of any hot work (i.e., spark or flame producing operations such as welding, cutting, brazing, grinding), management must approve the work by executing a written hot work authorization permit to verify that precautions to prevent fire have been implemented.\r\n- Planning with the local sheriff's department to ensure a rapid response to potential incidents with the system or external events, such as floods or tornadoes.\r\n- Adherence to fire codes and preparation for fires, storms, or events which could impact the ammonia system.\r\n- Prevention program compliance audits performed every three years to verify that the appropriate management systems are in place and are being properly implemented.  Any deficiency found in an audit is corrected.\r\n\r\n4.0    ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nThere have been no accidental releases of ammonia at the facility in the last five years that have resulted in death, injury, or significant property damage on site or off-site death, injury, evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\r\n\r\n5.0    EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\nThe Luverne facility has implemented a detailed written Emergency Response Plan (ERP).  The ERP is intended to address all emergencies at the facility, in addition to incidents related to a release of ammonia."
