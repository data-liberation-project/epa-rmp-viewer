This program continues the City of Gastonia's commitment to the protection of its employees and the surrounding community and the control of the potential for such a release.\n\nThe City of Gastonia WTP currently uses chlorine (delivered in one ton cylinders) as a disinfection agent to comply with the requirements of the Safe Drinking Water Act.  As part of the RMP/PSM program, the City of Gastonia has developed the following accidental release prevention and emergency response procedures and policies regarding the use of chlorine:\n\n1)  Protection of its employees and citizens is the City of Gastonia's highest priority.\n2)  Preventing the release of extremely hazardous substances is a key element of that protection.\n3)  Commitment by management to taking every appropriate step toward the prevention of such  releases\n     including:\n     a)  Making all important information readily available.\n     b)  Providing training to all employees on a routine basis.\n     c)  Defining roles and responsibilities in a clear manner.\n4)  Fulfillment of his or her roll in prevention of such releases is a condition of employment for all facility\n     employees.\n\nIn order to reduce the likelihood of a potential release, the City of Gastonia has incorporated the following general accidental release prevention program and chlorine-specific prevention steps:\n\n1)  Facility maintenance staff and/or outside contractors proficient in chlorine system maintenance shall\n      conduct routine preventive maintenance of key process components in facility chlorine systems.\n2)  City employees and/or any contractor employees on site shall conduct all work in accordance with any\n      applicable Lockout/Tagout procedures"
