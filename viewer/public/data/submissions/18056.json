THE FACLITY SUMMARY; The owners, management, and employees of Tarter Feed and Fertilizer are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training of all persons that work with the material. Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.                                                                                                                                                         2. FACILITY INFORMATION; The primary activity at the facility is the storage for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient. The maximum quantity stored would be 71,500 lbs. in the facility's 1 tank. The capacitiy of this tank is 15,300 gallons at 85% Full. It is our company policy to never fill the tank past 85% full.                                                                                                                                                                        3. THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum Quantity released would be 71,500 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standard and company procedures. The distance to the endpoint of dispersion based on the model used is 2.05 miles.                                                                                                                                                                   THE ALTERNATIVE-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO is assumed to be a release from the rupture of a 1 inch transfer hose, with 2,901 released over 2 minutes. The distance to the endpoint of dis"

THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PROGRAM; The facility complies with the rules and regulations relating to the handling of anhydrous ammonia containers and storage facilities. These regulations administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture are with ANSI K61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.                                                                                                                                                              5. THE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY; There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the past five years that caused any death, injuries, or significant property damage on site; nor to our knowledge, have any accidental releases resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.                                                                                                                                                                6. THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM; The facility has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and provide state and local authorities the emergency planning an community right-to-know information as required under SARA Tittle III of EPCRA. Our emergency response action plan has been reviewed with the local fire department and provided to the local emergency planning committee for coordination in the community response planning.                                                                                                                                                               7.
