OSHA and EPA consider chlorine a hazardous chemical.  The hazards of chlorine make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in the use and handling to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is IAWC policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends on the manner chlorine is handled and used, combined with the safety devices inherent in the design along with operating procedures and the training of our personnel.\n\nThe emergency action plan is based upon OSHA 1910.38 (Employee Emergency Plans)  1910.120 (Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response) and experience obtained from community drills.\n\n14.2   THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n?The maximum amount of chlorine stored at this location is 10,000 pounds.\n?The chlorine is delivered by truck in one-ton cylinders.  Liquid chlorine is added to water by evaporating chlorine liquid to gas, metering the gas through an injector, and then diffusing the gas into the flow stream of water at the point of application.\n\n14.3   THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThis facility and process uses design codes and standards from the Chlorine Institute, Wallace and Tiernan Manuals, American National Standards Institute, American Society for Testing and Materials, and applicable state codes and regulations.\n\n14.5    FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n?We have had no accidental releases of chlorine in the past five years.\n\n14.6    THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n?The written emergency response program as mentioned in the opening paragraph is located at the facility with an ongoing training program.\n\n14.7    PL"
