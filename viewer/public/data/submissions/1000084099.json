      "SummaryText": "Molson Coors USA LLC - Trenton Brewery produces malt beverages at the facility located in St. Clair Township, Butler County Ohio. We have a strong commitment to operate our facility in a safe and responsible manner. \r\n\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia is used at our facility as the cooling medium in our refrigeration system. The ammonia is contained in a closed loop system; it is designed to remain inside the piping and vessels in our facility.  We believe that ammonia provides the safest and most efficient cooling choice for our operation. \r\n\r\nA. Describe the Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies \r\nWe take many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system.  These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure.  We also have a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel, and emergency action plan to enable a quick response to any system upsets. \r\n\r\nThe PSM Coordinator is responsible for the management of these ammonia safety programs. \r\n\r\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled \r\nAmmonia is the only substance covered by the Accidental Release Prevention Regulations handled at this facility. \r\n\r\nThe hazard assessments for this facility include a worst case and an alternative case scenario which are available upon request.\r\n\r\nC. Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program \r\nThe facility has an accident release prevention program that complies with Occupational Safety and Health Act's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Rule. The prevention program consists of the following elements: \r\n\u00bf\tManagement Systems\r\n\u00bf\tEmployee Participation Program\r\n\u00bf\tProcess Safety Information"
