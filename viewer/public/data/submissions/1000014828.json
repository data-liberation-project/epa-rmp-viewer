The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management and employees of Green Valley Chemical (GVC) Corporation are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.   If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  \n\n2.  Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the manufacture of anhydrous ammonia as an agricultural fertilizer for member  owners (ag retailers).  Anhydrous ammonia is made by reacting natural gas with steam and atmospheric air in the presence of a catalyst to reform the components into Nitrogen (N2), Hydrogen (H2) and Carbon Dioxide (CO2).  The carbon dioxide is then stripped from the process with the remaining nitrogen and hydrogen reacted in the presence of a catalyst to form Anhydrous Ammonia (NH3).  The maximum quantity of ammonia stored would be 4,000,000 pounds in one refrigerated storage tank.\n\n3.  The worst case scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n    NOT INCLUDED\n\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the Standards of the U. S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of anhydrous ammonia\".  In addition, Iowa Dept. of Ag Rules.\n\n5.  The Five-year Accident History.\n\na.  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\nCaused any death, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6.

Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations.  The facility is currently undertaking a capital project to upgrade process automation, control and feedback to improve plant efficiency, reliability and safety."
