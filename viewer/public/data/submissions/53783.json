The worst case toxic cloud endpoint is approximately 5.6 miles from the center of the plant.  Residence homes, recreation areas, schools, and other public receptors are located within this 5.6 mile radius.\n\nFor denaturant, the worst-case scenario is based on the release of all denaturant stored on site.  The worst case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 1.10 miles from the center of the plant.  Residence homes, schools, and other public receptors are located within this 1.10 mile radius.\n\nAlthough Green Plains Bluffton, LLC has numerous controls in place to prevent such a release and to manage potential consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario.\n\nThe facility qualifies as a Program 3 due to the close proximity of public receptors, and therefore, Program Safety Management has been completed for this facility.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nGreen Plains Bluffton, LLC has constructed a new ethanol facility and is subject to RMP upon delivery of substances on site.
