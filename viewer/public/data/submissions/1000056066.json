The Plan includes an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release, a five-year accident history, and a release prevention and emergency response program.  \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nWilbur-Ellis has implemented release prevention and emergency response procedures to minimize the potential for accidental releases of hazardous materials.  Emergency response procedures including evacuation procedures and notification procedures have been implemented by Wilbur-Ellis.  In addition, Wilbur-Ellis has developed operating procedures and preventative maintenance activities to reduce the likelihood of accidental releases.\n\n\n\nThis Plan and the emergency response procedures document the accidental release prevention, safety, and emergency policies in place at Wilbur-Ellis.\n\n\n\nDescription of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nWilbur-Ellis is located at 841 West Elkhorn Boulevard in Rio Linda, California (the \"facility\").  Wilbur-Ellis is a retailer of fertilizer.  There are two anhydrous ammonia storage tanks located at the facility with a capacity of approximately 12,000 gallons each.  The anhydrous ammonia is used in a reaction process for the production of ammonium polyphosphate. The contents of the storage tanks are consumed in entirety during the reaction process.  Wilbur-Ellis is subject to OSHA PSM for anhydrous ammonia; therefore, Program 3 requirements are applicable to the Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n\nThere is one 4,000-gallon aqueous ammonia tanker truck located at the facility. The aqueous ammonia (24.5% in solution) is used as a pH adjuster during onsite blending of nutr"

Since the total onsite quantity of ammonia in solution is below the 20,000 pound reporting threshold, Wilbur-Ellis is only subject to Program Level 2 of California Accidental Release Program (CalARP) requirements for aqueous ammonia.\n\n\n\nWilbur-Ellis is also a retailer of pesticides. The facility sells pesticides in liquid and dry forms for agricultural applications.  Dimethoate (5 gallon containers), methomyl (ten pound bags), oxamyl (5 gallon containers), paraquat dichloride (5 gallon containers), and peroxyacetic acid (2.5 gallon and 5 gallon containers) are stored in the warehouse.  For the pesticides, Wilbur-Ellis is subject to Program Level 1 of CalARP requirements.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n  \n\nWilbur-Ellis has developed and implemented this Plan with the objective of complying with the requirements and guidelines set forth by CalARP and Federal Risk Management Program.  The Plan's purpose is to enhance the facility's existing safety programs implemented at the site to reduce the possibility of accidental releases of ammonia, dimethoate, methomyl, oxamyl, paraquat dichloride, and peroxyacetic acid that could cause harm to employees, the public and the environment.  The emergency response program, documented in the emergency response procedures, includes accidental release prevention and chemical specific prevention steps.\n\n\n\nWilbur-Ellis ensures that equipment meets the appropriate industry standards prior to use.  Wilbur-Ellis implements operating procedures and maintenance procedures in accordance with manufacturer and industry specifications to prevent accidental releases at the facility.  Chemical specific prevention steps implemented at the site include excess flow valves, pressure relief valves, emergency shut off valves with cables that run along the length of the horizontal storage tanks for quick access, and ammonia training for personnel.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nT"

      "SummaryText": "here have been no qualifying accidents involving ammonia, dimethoate, methomyl, oxamyl, paraquat dichloride, and peroxyacetic acid in the five-year period prior to the completion of this Plan.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe facility coordinates with the Sacramento County Fire Department (\"fire department\") and Sacramento Environmental Management District regarding specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release of ammonia and regulated substances.  In compliance with 2765.1, the facility has established emergency evacuation procedures to evacuate the site and notify the appropriate agencies regarding a release.  The facility's emergency response program is documented in the facility's Emergency Response Procedures.  The emergency procedures contain the following key elements:\n\n\n\n1. Procedures for informing local agencies responsible for responding to accidental releases.\n\n2. Information on emergency health care.\n\n3. Emergency response training for employees.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nPlans to improve safety at the facility were developed based on the results of compliance audits, hazard reviews, and a Risk Management Plan (RMP) site inspection conducted by an outside contractor.  The Branch Manager is currently working on an implementation schedule for the recommended actions.  Recommended actions include the following:\n\n\n\n1. Update seismic evaluation for the anhydrous ammonia system.\n\n2. Remove wraparound labels from liquid and vapor lines. Paint and identify liquid and vapor lines.\n\n3. Update SOPs for ammonia systems to reflect colors for liquid and vapor lines.\n\n4. Document bulkhead inspections and add inspections to maintenance schedule.\n\n5. Review processes and procedures in control room including but not limited to ventilation."
