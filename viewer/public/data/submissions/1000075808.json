Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nFXI, Inc.is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public, and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards. An appropriate response to releases of TDI is in the written Risk Management Program. Safety, environmental, and risk management programs are fully implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response. \n\n\n\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nFXI, Inc.is a urethane foam manufacturing facility which produces various type of flexible urethane foam products located in High Point, NC. The facility fabricates some of the urethane foam into various finished products.\n\nFlexible urethane foam is a product made by combining various chemicals that undergo a chemical reaction. The finished product is produced in a variety of colors, thicknesses, and densities.  One of chemicals used is 2, 4-Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI). The TDI is stored in three (3) TDI Storage Tanks within the tank storage area, totaling 31,338 gallons. These tanks are limited to 90% for safety reasons, which brings the total down to 28,204 gallons.  The facility also has the ability to store up to three (3) 20,000 rail-cars with a combined total of 60,000 gallons.  The railcars are not filled past 93%, which brings the total railcar amount to 55,800 gallons.  The Maximum storage for all three (3) storage tanks and three (3) railcars is calculated to be approximately 84,004 gallons.  Including piping the calculated estimated on-site TDI storage is approximately 860,000 pounds of TDI.\n\nThe EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) is part of the Clean Air Act and applies to a process storing a specified chemical above a threshold quantity. The chemicals and threshold quantities are specified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68. One such chemical is Toluene 2, 4-Diisocynate (TDI) in excess of 10,000 pounds"

Accidental Release Prevention and Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nFXI, Inc.is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public, and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards.  An appropriate response to releases of TDI is in the written Risk Management Program. Safety, environmental, and risk management programs are fully implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response. \n\nFXI, Inc.'s specific prevention steps include:\n\n1. Hazard reviews to identify, evaluate and control potential TDI process hazards,\n\n2. Develop, review and update operating and maintenance procedures for the TDI process.\n\n3. Provide the appropriate training for TDI process operators, maintenance personnel, and emergency response personnel.\n\n4. Conduct timely investigations of all incidents involving the TDI process.\n\n5. Conduct RMP Compliance audits as per RMP regulations.\n\n\n\nC. Hazard Assessment:\n\nThe RMP requires FXI, Inc.to evaluate the maximum potentially affected area for accidents involving TDI for a worst-case release scenario and an alternative scenario.\n\nThe worst-case release is highly improbable since it involves the combination of a certain set of conditions for a large release of the chemical without any employee intervention.  Because the assumptions required for the worst-case analysis are very conservative, the results likely will be very conservative. The endpoints specified for regulated toxic substances are intended to be protective of the general public. The distance to the endpoint estimated under worst-case conditions should no"

EPA intends the estimated distances to provide a basis for discussion among the regulated community, emergency responders, and the public, rather a basis for any specific actions.\n\nA release from a 20,000-gallon railcar has been identified as the worst-case release and was considered in the hazard assessment.  The catastrophic release would release approximately 204,400 lbs. of TDI. The impact distance from the worst-case scenario has been estimated using EPA's ALOHA Model.  The ALOHA Method estimates a distance to the endpoint of 0.1 mile for the worse-case release scenario. The impact distance extends beyond the facility property line. There are approximately less than thirty (30) people in nearby industrial setting that may be within the potentially affected area.                    \n\nThe alternative scenario is an event more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario and is a more realistic accident scenario.  FXI, Inc. has determined that the appropriate alternative scenario for the facility is a shearing of a TDI railcar unloading hose while transferring TDI from a railcar to an on-site TDI storage tank. The leak would release approximately 100 lbs. of TDI. The ALOHA Method estimates a distance to the endpoint of 15-yards for the alternative release scenario. The impact distance does not extend beyond the facility property line.           \n\n          \n\nD.
