The most current edition of NFPA 58 is followed for the safe handling of liquefied petroleum gases and the maintenance of equipment. Safety is the number one consideration in the handling of liquefied petroleum gases, the design and maintenance of the equipment, and the training of our personnel. The Certified Employee Training program (CETP) modules relating to Railcar product transfer is the guide for safety practices and procedures at this facility.\n\n\n\nOur emergency response plan is based upon the \"Guidelines for Developing Plant Emergency Procedures\" and \"How to Control L-P Gas Leaks and Fires.\" Facility staff will not respond to accidental releases of flammable substances at our facility, but has coordinated response actions with the local fire department. Our response plan includes procedures to call the local emergency responders as well as any potential affected neighbors. \n\n\n\nStationary source and regulated substance handled:\n\nThe regulated substance handled at this facility is liquefied petroleum gases. The purpose of this facility is to store liquefied petroleum gases for distribution to wholesale customers. The liquefied petroleum gases are received by rail car, up to 100 rail cars. This facility is equipped to unload railcars into transport trucks to be hauled to wholesale customers. This facility does not sell liquefied petroleum gases to the general public.
