It also complies with the including OSAH PSM rule and EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule. The transfer equipment was designed in accordance with NFPA 58 code for the storage and handling of liquefied petroleum gases. Period inspections of the transfer equipment are done to ensure continued safe operations. All maintenance and improvements are done per the latest NFPA code in effect at that time. To ensure that it is operated and maintained properly, regulatory authorities inspect this facility. The employees are trained as required by the appropriate codes and regulations using the Certified Employee Training Program (CETP).\n\n\n\nFive-year accident history:\n\nNo accidental releases of liquefied petroleum gases have occurred at this facility resulting in off-site consequences.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response program:\n\nThe emergency response plan at this facility was based upon the NPGA bulletins \"Guidelines for Developing Plant Emergency Procedures\" and \"How to Control Small Leaks and Fires\" and the CETP training program. Employees are trained in emergency operating procedures such as controlling sources of ignition and leaks. Employees are not trained in emergency medical response and are not equipped to respond to offsite releases. Facility employees will not respond to accidental releases of a regulated flammable substance. Emergency response will be coordinated with the local fire authorities. The plan identifies who is responsible for calling emergency responders and notifying potentially affected neighbors.\n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nThe facility was opened in 2017 to meet or exceed all existing standards and is maintained in compliance with NFPA 58.
