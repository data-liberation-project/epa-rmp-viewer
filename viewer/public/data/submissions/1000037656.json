Description of the Hollister, CA Facility\r\n\r\nThe Hollister, CA facility is located at 2301 Bert Drive, Hollister, CA, 95023. The facility provides transportation and public warehousing services for manufacturers, distributors and end users of prepackaged specialty chemicals. Warehousing activities include shipping, receiving and storage of chemicals as specified by customer requirements. The chemicals stored at the Hollister, CA Warehouse include chemicals containing toxic hazards. Hydrogen Chloride is the only RMP regulated substances handled at the site.\r\n\r\n1.2.2. Description of the Warehousing and Storage Processes\r\n\r\nRinchem receives Hydrogen Chloride by truck as shipped from the manufacturer or distributor. The material is unloaded from the truck using a forklift and staged for inspection. After the material passes quality and safety inspection, it is placed into the hazard specific storage area until it is shipped to the end user. The storage location of each material is tracked in an electronic inventory management system. After an order is received, Rinchem ships the above listed chemical as ordered by the end user.

Worst-Case Release Scenario\r\nWell-documented offsite consequence analyses are essential to adequate communication of potential hazards at the Rinchem Hollister, CA Warehouse. Rinchem conducted an offsite consequence analysis, using the EPA's Areal Location of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA) and Marplot in conjunction with the rules specified in 40 CFR 68.25 to estimate the offsite consequence of a Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) from our warehousing process. The WCS associated with toxic substances in the Hollister, CA warehouse is a catastrophic failure of the single largest container resulting in a release of the total contents, 600 Lbs. of Hydrogen Chloride. The passive mitigation measure taken into account for this scenario is the limited quantity of the chemical that can be released due to container and the handling of containers within the building.\r\n\r\n1.4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nRinchem management realizes that implementation of appropriate administrative and technological safeguards ensure the safety of the workers and the continued safety of public receptors. Those recommendations that are planned for implementation will be discussed in Planned Changes to Improve Safety. The safeguards shown in Table A-1 include both administrative and technological safeguards that prevent, detect, or mitigate releases of Hydrogen Chloride.\r\n\r\n1.5.
