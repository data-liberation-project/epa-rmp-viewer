As a requirement of the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program and Clean Air Act Amendments 112? Accidental Release of Hazardous Air Substances program, Pacific Ethanol Stockton, LLC has completed a risk management plan (RMP) for chemicals stored on-site above RMP reporting thresholds. Regulated chemicals at Pacific Ethanol Stockton, LLC include isopentane and pentane (each exceed 10,000 pound threshold) and aqueous ammonia (exceeds 20,000 pound threshold).\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nPacific Ethanol Stockton, LLC is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol production process, specifically aqueous ammonia and isopentane and pentane (constituents of the natural gasoline used as a denaturant).  The ammonia is used for pH control directly in the process feed mixture to fermentation.  The denaturant is added to ethanol to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption.  It is the policy of Pacific Ethanol Stockton, LLC to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  In the event of an emergency, including an accidental release of toxics and flammables, it is the policy of Pacific Ethanol Stockton, LLC to notify the Stockton Fire Department and the San Joaquin County Office of Emergency Services and evacuate all employees at the facility.  \n\nRegulated Substances Handled\nThe facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn and a process by-product known as wet distillers' grain with solubles, which is used as a livestock feed.  Aqueous ammonia is stored on-site and used in the ethanol production process for pH control.  The maximum amount of aqueous ammonia stored is approximately 34,200 pounds (20-30 percent ammonia in solution).  The fuel ethanol production process requ"

The maximum amount of denaturant on-site is approximately 437,000 pounds (total pentane approximately 44,000 pounds; total isopentane approximately 31,000 pounds).  The natural gasoline is stored in an above ground tank as a liquid and is mixed with the fuel ethanol in the final stage of production; this tank is located in the facility tank farm area, which includes a secondary containment dike.  Unleaded fuel may also be used as a denaturant in place of natural gasoline and does not contain any regulated constituents above the threshold quantity.  Pacific Ethanol Stockton, LLC has evaluated the worst-case and alternative case scenarios as they relate to the regulated substances.  An Emergency Response Program (included in the facility Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP)) will be implemented at start-up. Pacific Ethanol Stockton, LLC has coordinated emergency response with the local authorities and will conduct periodic drills.  \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThrough completion of this RMP, Pacific Ethanol Stockton, LLC has complied with the EPA requirements under 40 CFR Part 68 and OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements, as well as California regulations at CCR Title 8, Section 5189 and CCR Title 19 D-2, Chapter 4.5.  Process safety information, safe work practices such as Hot Work, Confined Space Entry and Lockout/Tagout, and operations and maintenance procedures are documented on-site as part of the facility PSM/RMP Prevention Program.  Periodic functions such as process hazard analysis, training, management of change, pre-startup safety reviews, and incident investigation are conducted on a regular basis as outlined in the PSM/RMP Prevention Program.  Audits of the overall RMP and Prevention Program will be conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA regulat"

This plan includes actions to respond to accidental releases of regulated substances, actions to inform the public and local agencies responding to accidental releases and emergency health care information.  Pacific Ethanol Stockton, LLC will routinely conduct employee training on the ICP and periodically evaluates the plan for necessary revisions.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nPacific Ethanol Stockton, LLC completed its most recent Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) of the aqueous ammonia and flammables processes on August 12 and 13, 2008. A number of recommendations to improve facility safety were accepted as part of the PHA process, and a timeline was developed to track the recommendations to completion.  A complete summary of the PHA process and recommendation tracking progress is maintained at the facility.  The following presents a brief summary of the recommendations:\n\nAmmonia system: \n\nPlant will evaluate the necessity of breakaway connectors on ammonia fill line and vapor return line based on the safety features of the ammonia vendor(s) delivery trucks.\n\nPlant will confirm that ammonia load-in standard operating procedure is complaint with PSM guidelines.\n\nPlant will clearly label ammonia and sulfuric acid fill ports and ammonia vapor return line and evaluate further administrative and engineering controls to include access control procedures and padlocking fill ports.\n\nPlant will include pressure safety valves in maintenance program.\n\nPlant will consider installing kill switch on ammonia fill port based on safety fe"
