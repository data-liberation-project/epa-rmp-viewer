We train them annually in a classroom setting and on the job site. They are evaluated regularly. We check that all of the proper procedures are being followed and that personal protective gear is in place. Our equipment is user friendly to help reduce the chances of operator error. Our tank is maintained exceptionally well. We are meticulous about keeping the equipment safe and in excellent repair.\n\nWe are in close contact with the proper Emergency Response agencies. We annually report to the State Emergency Response Commission, the Local Emergency Planning Committee, and our local fire department. We have also worked with our local fire department in thier exercises responding to Anhydrous Ammonia releases."
