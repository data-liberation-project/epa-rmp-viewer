The \n    facility manufactures fiberglass building insulation which is sold in the commercial, \n    residential, and retail markets.  In addition, the facility manufactures air handling and \n    acoustical products and chopped fiber for use in roofing mat and gypsum board \n    manufacturing.  The facility currently encompasses approximately 750,000 square feet \n    under roof and is set in approximately 100 acres of rural area.  There are presently about \n    410 full time employees who operate the Plant 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.\n\n    Johns Manville places a strong emphasis on safety and environmental leadership.  The         \n    Company fosters a proactive philosophy to ensure that employees work in a safe               \n    environment and that each facility remains in full compliance with all applicable federal,   \n    state, county and local regulations.  JM is also committed to environmental leadership       \n    within the community served.  This commitment is exemplified in the Cleburne Facilitys      \n    strong recycling and waste minimization programs.  The Companys long term goal is to        \n    have zero process wastes taken to disposal facilities, with all residual materials either    \n    recycled or used for beneficial purposes.  The Facility demonstrates another example of      \n    its aggressive position on recycling through its use of extraordinarily high levels of       \n    outside, post-consumer glass in its forming process.  This crushed glass, or cullet        \n    would otherwise be deposited in municipal landfills.                                         \n\n    The facility maintains a good working relationship with all federal, state, county and   \n    local agencies.

The facility                      \n    exceeds the qualifying threshold of 15,000 pounds of this material onsite for two separate             \n    processes.                                                                                             \n                                                                                                           \n    Liquid resin solution containing formaldehyde (above 1% mixture) is delivered to the                   \n    facility via truck transport.  Resin solution is stored in cold storage until it is mixed with         \n    water and other materials to make a binder solution (less than 1% formaldehyde) which is               \n    applied to fiberglass.  This binder solution is applied in the fiberglass manufacturing                \n    process as a low VOC binder which acts to bind glass fibers.  The formaldehyde                         \n    containing resin solution is stored as a liquid in numerous 5,000 gallon storage tanks                 \n    associated with two similar (but separate) processes located inside the facility.  The                 \n    storage vessels are constructed and operated in accordance with ASME specifications.                   \n    The resin storage processes are designed to minimize spills in the event of an accidental              \n    release.  The resin storage rooms and adjacent rooms are equipped with trenches that                   \n    minimize the surface area of a spill.  In addition, the resin storage rooms are maintained             \n    at 50 degrees F to reduce the volatility of the material.  Although not a qualifying         "

As a result of these factors, Johns Manville has not experienced an accidental              \n    release of formaldehyde over the entire life of the facility.
