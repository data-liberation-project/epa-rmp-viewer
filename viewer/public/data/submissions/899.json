      "SummaryText": "The Alford Refrigerated Warehouses (ARW) facility is located on a 28 acre site SE of the intersection of N Broadway and Barbours Cut Streets in the City of LaPorte. The complex includes a large cold storage warehouse building with ancillary office space. The refrigerated warehouse (approximately 145,000 sf) is refrigerated using anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant.\n\nGiven the presence of anhydrous ammonia, ARW has in place a Process Safety Management program to ensure the safety of employees and the general public in the vicinity. This program addresses items related to the operation of ammonia based refrigeration systems including but not limited to the handling of the chemical, operator training, equipment selection and maintenance, contractor qualifications, preventative maintenance programs, routine and emergency operating procedures and emergency planning and response. Ammonia system operators and management personnel have participated in a comprehensive Process Hazard Analysis process which carried out a thorough assessment of the ammonia system, its operation, and safety issues related to ammonia refrigeration systems. Emergency scenarios were developed and evaluated and emergency action plans reviewed or modified to address possible emergency situations. Primary attention was given to protecting the health and welfare of workers and the public that may be in or near the affected area.\n\n Ammonia has a strong pungent odor which is detectable at very low concentration levels when released to the atmosphere. The refrigeration system is designed such that under normal operating conditions no ammonia is released to the atmosphere. However, unforseen circumstances or system upset could lead to leakage of a portion of the ammonia from the system. Given the strong odor of ammonia, even a small quantity of released ammonia will be detected at some distance from the source of the leak. Ammonia is detectable by its odor at levels well below that which will raise health"

      "SummaryText": "concerns.\n\nThe potential effect of an ammonia leak from the facility's refrigeration system has been evaluated for worst case and alternate case scenarios base on EPA guidelines and concentration level limits mandated in the guidelines. The worst case scenario is very unlikely as it assumes the total and catastrophic failure of a vessel containing ammonia in its most volatile state. This scenario is used to estimate the worst possible effect of an ammonia incident at the facility. The alternate scenario is used to illustrate the possible range of effect from slightly more probable leak situation which could have off site consequences. The facility has not had a recorded leak situation causing personnel injury or with off site consequences. \n\nAs stated above ARW has in place a process safety management program. This program ensures that all security and safety procedures are addressed. Staff are trained in operation, maintenance and emergency procedures related to the operation of the ammonia refrigeration system. All refrigeration equipment and ammonia vessels are equipped with automatic pressure safety relief devices to prevent pressure build-up beyond safe equipment operating levels. A preventative maintenance program assures that equipment is maintained and serviced on a regular schedule and that worn, ageing, or defective components are replaced as required to maintain equipment in good operating condition. Controls and safety devices are tested regularly to ensure proper operation.\n\nARW has in place emergency procedures that are to be activated in the event of an ammonia leak or other emergency situation. These procedures include instructions for alerting police, fire, ambulance, EPA and other regulatory bodies as required. Site evacuation procedures are set out in the plan. The overall control and direction of emergency response is to be turned over to the most senior rank emergency responder upon his/her arrival on site. ARW personnel are to make themselves"
