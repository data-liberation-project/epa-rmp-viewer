      "SummaryText": "Transok / Custer Gas Plant RMP / Executive Summary\n\n\nA.    Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\nThe Custer Gas Plant has a commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Transok's policy for the design and operation of gas plants is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to and attempt to control and contain the release.\n\n\nB.    Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nTransok operates the Custer Gas Plant located 4 miles north and 3 miles west of Arapaho, Oklahoma in Custer County.  The Custer Plant receives natural gas with some condensed hydrocarbon liquids (i.e. condensate) from production wells by pipeline system.  The plant separates ethane, propane, butanes, and higher molecular weight hydrocarbon components from natural gas by liquefying them at cryogenic temperatures. The natural gas minus these liquefied components (called \"residue gas\") is delivered back into the pipeline system for ultimate use as fuel.  The natural gas liquids (NGL's or Raw Mix) are sold separately for petrochemical feedstock, fuel, and other uses.  The NGL's are delivered into a Koch Company pipeline connected to the plant.\n\nThe Custer Gas Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Based on process knowledge, Transok identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site.  The chemicals, largest quantities on site, and associated threshold quantities are presented in Section II - Accident Release Prevention Program, Table 1.  \n\nListed flammable substances, which are stored above threshold quantities at the Custer Gas Plant, are NGL's (product), methane and condens"

      "SummaryText": "ate.  However, Transok has determined that condensate has an NFPA rating of 3, which exempts this mixture from threshold determination.  There are no listed toxic substances stored above threshold quantities at the Custer Plant.\n\nBased on worst-case analysis, the distance to the endpoint exceeds the distance to public receptors.   In addition, the Custer Gas Plant is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management Program (PSM).  Therefore, the Custer Gas Plant is classified as a Program 3 process under the Accident Release Program\n\n\n\nC.    Offsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\n1.    Worst-Case Releases\n\nFlammable Substances\n\nThe endpoint for a worst-case scenario (WCS) release of a flammable substance is a 1 psi overpressure (i.e., 15.7 psia), resulting from a vapor cloud explosion.  The Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program requirement for flammables assumes an instantaneous release and vapor cloud explosion.  A yield factor of 10 percent of the available energy released in the explosion shall be used to determine the distance to the explosion endpoint.  Since the worst-case release scenario for a flammable substance is based on the assumption that the entire quantity of the substance forms a vapor cloud, passive mitigation systems are not applicable.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is from the NGL storage tank (i.e. product surge tank) with an endpoint 1 psi overpressure distance of 0.40 miles.  This is based on using the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) equations found in the \"RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance\" dated May 24, 1996.   The storage capacity of the largest (& only) NGL storage tank is 40,000 gallons, which is limited to 80% or 32,000 gallons by administrative controls.  It assumes the entire contents of the tank (32,000 gallons or 119,607 pounds) is released instantaneously and is involved in the vapor cloud explosion.\n\nToxic Substances\n\nThe Custer Gas Plant does not have any toxic substances above the threshold quantity; therefore, analy"

Alternative Releases\n\nAlternative releases scenarios are those that are more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.  Alternative release scenarios for toxic substances should be those that lead to concentrations above the endpoints beyond the facility's fenceline.  Alternative release scenarios for flammable substances should have the potential to cause substantial damage, including on-site damage.\n\nFlammable Substances\n\nA single alternative release scenario for all flammable substances is required under the ARP program.  A hypothetical, but likely to occur, release scenario has been identified for NGL's as follows:  \n\nA 2 inch valve on the 40,000 gallon, 250 psi, product surge tank fails and releases contents undetected for a period of 30 minutes.  This volume released of 30,785 pounds then participates in a vapor cloud explosion resulting in a 1 psi overpressure endpoint distance of 0.25 miles. This is based on EPA equations found in the \"RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance\" document. \n\nToxic Substances\n\nThe Custer Gas Plant does not have any toxic substances held above the threshold quantity.  Therefore, analysis of each regulated toxic substance is not required.\n\n\nD.    General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Custer Gas Plant. The processes at the gas plant are regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation.  They are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the Accident Release Prevention (APR) Program under EPA's RMP.\n\n1.

Employee involvement will help ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are implemented.  Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues. In addition, this is mandated as part of Transok Corporate Policy #SA4 - Employee Participation and is further identified in Section II, Part C of the PSM Manual.\n\nThe Custer Gas Plant strongly encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of this include a cross-section of employees and management ad hoc teams participating in:\n\n* Process Hazard Analysis \n* Pre-Startup Safety Reviews\n* Audits\n* Operating Procedures Development\n\nThe Custer Gas Plant also actively seeks employee involvement in the development and conduct of all accident prevention activities through existing safety programs.  Accident prevention is discussed at monthly safety meetings and/or during special training sessions if necessary.  Employee suggestions on improving safety processes are encouraged at these meetings. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are also documented in Section II, Part C of the PSM Manual.\n\n2.    Process Safety Information\n\nComplete and accurate written process safety information (PSI) concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to an effective PSM and RMP program and to completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis (PHA).  The PSI will be useful to the operators; the team performing the PHA; those in charge of training; contractors; those conducting pre-startup safety reviews; and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.

The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and recommendations from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team recommendations are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the recommendations is documented and retained.\n\nThe details of this program are also identified in Section II, Part E of the PSM Manual.\n\n4.    Operating Procedures\n\nThe Custer Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed to determine if they are current and accurate.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  \n\nThe intent of the opera"

To have effective operating procedures, the task and procedures directly and indirectly related to the covered process must be appropriate, clear, consistent, and most importantly, communicated to employees.  Operating procedures are specific instructions or details on what steps are taken or followed in caring out the stated procedures.  The specific instructions include the applicable safety precautions and appropriate information on safety implications.  See also Section II, Part F of the PSM Manual.\n\n\n\n5.    Training\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Custer Gas Plant has various training programs available for operations personnel.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  New operators are also paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.  See training and certification requirements also in Section II, Part G of the PSM Manual.\n\n6.    Contractors\n\nThe Custer Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

In addition, Transok evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Gas plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.  Detailed contractor orientation and work rules are also identified in Section II, Part H of the PSM Manual.\n\n7.    Pre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe Custer Gas Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field \nverification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that Accident Prevention Program requirements are properly implemented. See also Section II, Part I of the PSM Manual\n\n8.    Mechanical Integrity\n\nThe Custer Gas Plant has well-established practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment.

Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.  \n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Custer Gas Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper material and spare parts are used when repairs are made.   Mechanical integrity procedures are also covered in Section II, Part J of the PSM Manual.\n\n9.    Safe Work Practices\n\nThe Custer Gas Plant has safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.

Management of Change\n\nThe Custer Gas Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process-operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.  The details of the management of change system are also identified in Section II, Part L of the PSM Manual.\n\n11.    Incident Investigation\n\nThe Custer Gas Plant promptly investigates all incidents (no later than 48 hours after incident) that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to management for resolution.
