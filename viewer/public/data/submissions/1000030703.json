The management and employees of the Phoenix facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous hydrogen chloride. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the community and the environment.\n\n\n\nThe facilities primary operation is the storage and distribution of anhydrous hydrogen chloride. Hydrogen chloride is received and stored in high pressure tube trailers that contains 3,000 - 3,500 pounds of anhydrous\n\nhydrogen chloride in each tube. The hydrogen chloride is then distributed into various DOT specification containers such\n\nas cylinders.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario, based on the EPA's definition for a toxic gas release and the alternatice release scenarios were conducted and endpoints were determined using EPA's RMPComp* 2.01.  Dispersion and results may be reviewed by contacting the facility.\n\n\n\nPassive and Active Mitigation systems in place that would reduce the likelihood of a release or the release itself. These include check valves in the fill lines, a preventive maintenance schedule for the system, safeties and testing of the DOT containers.\n\n\n\nThe facility has developed a comprehensive prevention program designed to prevent accidental releases of hydrogen chloride. The program utilizes state-of-the-art technology, sound engineering practices, administrative controls and active employee participation. Employees serve on task groups and teams in developing and maintaining risk management program elements. They are frequently consulted concerning the various aspects of the program and ways to continually improve the safety of the process.\n\nWritten process safety information was developed for the hydrogen chloride system to enable managers,supervisors, and emp"

This information was utilized to develop a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) which assists management and employees in making decisions for improving safety and reducing the consequences of releases of hydrogen chloride. The PHA focuses attention on equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions, (routine and non-routine), and external factors that might impact the process by identifying potential failure points or failure modes in the process. The PHA was\n\nreviewed and updated on August 2011, and will be updated at least every 5 years.\n\n\n\nDetailed 0perating procedures exist which describe tasks to be performed, dates to be recorded, operating conditions to be maintained, samples to be collected, and safety and health precautions to be taken. The procedures were reviewed/approved to ensure they are technically accurate by employees, managers and personnel with the technical expertise/knowledge of the process. The operat ng procedures were reviewed in November 2013 and are annually reviewed/revised as necessary to reflect current operations.\n\n\n\nEmployees are thoroughly trained, including maintenance and contractor employees. The training meets and exceeds the requirements as outlined in OSHA's hazard communication standard 29 CFR 1910.1200.  Training includes operating procedures, safe work practices, emergency procedures (including alarms),special assignments, evacuation and emergency response; safety rules and procedures; routine and non-routine work authorization; and other pertinent process safety information. Each employee trained has a\n\ndefined and documented program based on their job duties. The training goals and objectives have been established and written in clear and measurable terms. Hands-on training is provided to employees to enhance their senses beyond listening.

The employees are periodically evaluated to ensure they posses the necessary skills and\n\nknowledge via written tests, observation and/or oral interviews. The training program was last reviewed in November 2013.\n\n\n\nA contractor screening process has been established and is designed to ensure that contractors hired or used can accomplish their assigned tasks without compromising the safety and health of employees and the public. The screening program involves obtaining information on the contractor's safety performance,including injury and illness rates, and experience. In addition, the contractor's safety performance, job skills,knowledge, and certifications (such as pressure vessel welders) are also verified. The contractors safety procedures were last review in March 2012.\n\n\n\nPreStart-up Safety Reviews (PSSR) are used for new or modified processes to improve the design and construction of the process from a reliability and quality stand point. The PSSR recommendations are resolved before final installations are complete. Other items completed prior to initial process startup include piping and instrument diagrams, operating procedures, and ensuring operating personnel are fully trained.  The initial startup and normal operating procedures are fully evaluated as part of the PSSR to assure a safe transfer into the normal operating mode for meeting the process parameters. The last PreStart-up Safety\n\nReview was conducted on 1/29/2014.  PreStart-Safety reviews are typically completed for any process changes.\n\n"
