      "SummaryText": "General Facility Overview: The Imerys Sandersville Calcine Plant consists of four calciners and associated equipment utilized to process kaolin clay into calcined kaolin products.  The facility utilizes natural gas as a primary fuel and liquefied propane and fuel oil as secondary fuels.  Aqua ammonia (20-30% ammonia in water solution) is stored in liquid form and is made down into a water solution for use as a pH control agent in the crude kaolin blunging operations.\n\nAccidental Release and Emergency Response Policies:  It is the policy of Imerys Clays, Inc. to comply with all applicable federal, state and local regulations.  If an emergency were to occur,  the Sandersville Fire Department and the Washington County EMA would be notified and requested to respond to the facility emergency.  The Sandersville Police Department would assist should road blocks and other measures be warranted.\n\nFive year accident history:  This facility has not had an accident in the previous five years involving aqua ammonia which has caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in place.\n\nEmergency Response Program:  Imerys Clays, Inc. does not have a formal emergency response/hazmat team and would depend on the Sandersville Fire Department and Washington County EMA for assistance and response.  Private emergency response contractors are available within a 70-100 mile radius should further emergency resposnse assistance be needed.\n\nThere have been no changes to the process or use of the RMP regulated chemical since the submission of the RMP in 2004 and mid-point update in 2007.    This update is provided as part of the 5 year renewal.   "
