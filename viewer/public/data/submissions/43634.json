To accomplish this we integrate health, safety, and environmental planning into all business activities.  This includes complying with applicable laws, responsibly managing risks, and working collaboratively with others in addressing health, safety, and environmental issues.\n\nIn the Hexion Safety Manual, the Safety Policy Statement clearly states that safety will not be compromised to achieve any other operational or business objective.  This manual defines requirements and guidelines developed to prevent injuries and accidental releases.\n\nIncluded in the Safety Manual are Emergency Response Policies that state that safety is the top priority in all emergency response situations.  This policy refers to the plant Emergency Response Plan for specific procedures for handling releases of hazardous materials.\n\n2.Stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\nThe Hexion Specialty Chemicals facility in Virginia, Minnesota manufactures melamine urea formaldehyde (MUF) resin and wax emulsions.  The plant also stores and repackages phenol formaldehyde resin.  \n\nThe regulated substances used in the plant and the maximum quantities stored are:\n\nFormaldehyde                    97,450 lbs.\n                                                                                                                                       . \n3.Accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\n\nThis plant has a comprehensive process safety management program that is in compliance with the EPA Accidental Release Prevention Rule, the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, and all applicable state codes and regulations.  A safety management system is in place to assure on-going compliance.  This management system includes the"

The Plant Manager has overall responsibility for this program.\n\n\"Process stewards\" are assigned to maintain and improve the safety of their units.  Their duties include keeping operating procedures up-to-date, training operators so they can safely carry out these procedures, assuring that the plant is run safely on a daily basis, and when necessary, investigating incidents in their unit.  All employees participate in the safety program to improve safety and plant operation.\n\nEach Process Steward maintains an Operating Guide that includes process safety information, operating procedures, and a training certification program.  Operators use this Operating Guide as a training tool and for reference.  By applying the information it contains their actions will prevent accidental releases.\n\nProcess hazard analyses are conducted on an on-going basis to identify hazards and recommend safeguards that will prevent an accidental release.\n\nTwo methods are used to assure that changes to plant equipment, procedures, or processes do not cause accidents.  For equipment and procedure changes, a Change Worksheet initiates a safety review.  This review may include process hazard analysis.  Changes to product formulations initiate a review by a chemist, process engineer, and the plant manager.  Training is performed as needed to assure that those affected by the change understand its impact.  Pre-Start-up Safety Reviews are performed to assure that the plant can be started up safely after a significant change is made. \n\nA preventive maintenance program maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment.  A computer database is used to manage the preventive maintenance schedule and other corrective or improvement repairs necessary to maintain th"

The schedule is based on plant experience to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release caused by equipment failure\n\nThe requirements in the Safety Manual include safe work practices which prevent accidental releases.  One important section describes safety measures for welding or other \"hot\" work, which includes a permit system to reduce the risk of fire.  The Safety Manual also includes requirements for locking out equipment for maintenance.  These procedures reduce the likelihood that a valving error will lead to a release.\n\nContractors, who periodically perform work in the plant, are given safety orientations to brief them on plant hazards and safety practices.  Contractor safety programs and performance are evaluated prior to their selection for jobs that impact process safety.\n\nIncidents that cause or could have caused a release are investigated and recommendations are made to prevent recurrence.  These recommendations may lead to improvements in equipment, procedures, operating conditions, or training.\n\nInternal Corporate Health, Safety and Environmental Audits are conducted periodically to maintain compliance with local, state and federal regulations.  Regional Safety and Environmental professionals periodically review the health,safety, and environmental programs.  Addressing recommendations from these audits and reviews keeps the Facility's Safety and Environmental programs effective.\n\n4.Five-year accident history\n\nIn the five year period from June 21, 1999 to June 21, 2004 there were no deaths, inuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage as a result of an accidental release of a regulated substance from our covered process.\n\n5.Emergency response program\n\nThe plant Emergency Response Plan describes"
