BASF Bishop has not had any releases of chlorine or HF that resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release, since BASF Bishop's acquisition in January 2017.  Worst-case scenarios (WCS) and alternate release scenarios (ARS) were prepared for each covered process. \r\n\r\nProcess safety is a core part of BASF Bishop's safe and efficient production. BASF Bishop follows corporate values and never compromise on safety in the facility operation. In addition to the RMP WCS and ARS, BASF uses a risk matrix to assess the risks arising from potential incident based on their probability and impact. The resulting risk classes are used to determine appropriate protection measures, which are divided in so-called primary and secondary protection measures.  Primary protection measures prevent further consequences such as the release of substances in the event of a plant malfunction. To this end, equipment is installed to shut down the plant automatically or safety valves are used to prevent overpressure. Our focus lies on these primary protection measures.  Secondary protection measures back up the primary measures. They include protection walls, enclosures, retention systems and firefighting measures designed to restrict the impact of an incident to a manageable level.\r\n\r\nBASF Bishop has an incident reporting system designed to allow the recording of security-relevant incidents which endanger or harm BASF, its employees, facilities, products or information, including RMP-related incidents.  Incident reporting will be facilitated by means of a single, standardized database that provides Corporate Security with optimal access to all incidents. The timely evaluation of this information will allow for the early detection of security tendencies, along with the implementation of appropriate countermeasures and investigative procedures.\r\n\r\nThe BASF Bishop location shares and coordinates security and emergency response"

The location has an on-site emergency response team which would initially respond to an incident with backup support from the local emergency response agencies as necessary. Emergency response drills are routinely conducted for BASF employees as well as location-wide drills with the on-site emergency response team.  In addition, the BASF Corporation has a global Emergency Response Management System that has the comprehensive knowledge and experience to handle both on-site and off-site incidents. \r\n\r\nIn 2018 BASF Bishop commenced a comprehensive mechanical integrity inspection of its processes. BASF Bishop implementation of recommended preventative actions identified during the inspection is on-going to improve to the safety of its processes."

      "SummaryText": "The BASF Corporation Bishop facility (BASF Bishop) is a manufacturing site for chemicals and pharmaceuticals, located in a rural area between Kingsville and Bishop, Texas.  BASF Bishop shares the location with two other companies: OXEA Bishop LLC, Celanese Chemicals, Inc./ Ticona Polymers, Inc.  These companies own and operate assets and manage RMP programs at the location, independently from BASF Bishop.  \r\n\r\nBASF Bishop became the owner/operator of RMP-covered process as part of an acquisition in January 2017.  This is the first-time RMP submittal for BASF Bishop.  The previous RMP submittal for the covered processes was by Celanese Chemicals, Inc./ Ticona Polymers, Inc., under EPA Facility ID 100000139398.\r\n\r\nThe facility processes covered under both EPA's RMP and OSHA's process safety management (PSM) standards; and are currently managed as part of the facility's Responsible Care Management System (RCMS). BASF's RCMS comprises the global rules, standards and procedures for environmental and health protection, safety and security and forms the superordinate structure for the EHS documents. This document applies throughout the BASF Group and covers all EHS topics including RMP/PSM. In addition, the facility is ISO 9001 certified.  \r\n\r\nThe RMP/PSM substances handled in covered processes at BASF Bishop are chlorine and hydrogen fluoride (HF), which are used in the manufacturing of chemicals and pharmaceuticals (generally ibuprofen, 4-HAP, and aluminum trilactate).  Typically, two 2000-pound cylinders of chlorine gas are present at the facility.  Up to 162,580 pounds of HF may be present at the facility, with approximately 87,980 pounds in the ibuprofen process; approximately 54,600 pounds in the 4-HAP process; and 20,000 pounds in a storage tank. HF is delivered by a tanker truck into the facility's 20,000-pound storage tank.\r\n\r\nThe information submitted in the RMP includes accident prevention and safety programs, emergency preparedness and response programs, chemic"
