This policy complies with all the applicable requirements of section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) and all applicable procedures of the Environmental Protection AgencyA\u00bfs Risk Management Program(RMP).  The BPW Risk Management Program involves the preparation of response plans that are tailored to each facility.\r\n\r\nThe Broad River Waste Treatment Plant, the Clary Waste Treatment Plant, the Cherokee Water Treatment Plant, and the Victor Gaffney Water Treatment Plant are facilities owned by the BPW that exceed the OSHA Process Safety Management Program ( PSM ) ( 29 CFR 1910.119 ) threshold limit of 1500 pounds for Chlorine ( CAS: 007782-50-5 ).  These facilities are manned and are required by 1910.119 to establish a PSM program.  The BPW has implemented a PSM program that is unique to each facility.  Presently, all the facilities exceed the threshold limit of 2500 pounds of chlorine established by CAA 112r,therefore, each facility has implemented a Risk Management Program based on CAA 112r Program 3 requirements.\r\n\r\nEach facility has special characteristics such as number of employees, hours the facility is manned, density of the surrounding population, and public receptors that required the BPW to develop RMP for each of the facilities.  The facilities use many technological and managerial practices that are not unique, in fact, are common in the water-waste, water treatment industry. Liquid chlorine is delivered to each of the facilities in ton cylinders and placed in a tank storage area.  Gaseous Chlorine, collecting in the top of the tank as a function of temperature, is piped off by a vacuum chlorinating system and injected into potable water to form a solution of hypochlorite.  The solution is"

The equipment at each facility includes a tank storage area, chlorinator room that contains the chlorinators, flow recorders, various safety equipment, and electrical panels.  A compete listing of equipment, along with block flow diagrams, and pipe and instrumentation diagrams are included in the BPW PSM for each facility.\r\n\r\nThe offsite consequence analysis, required by CCA, includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified as A\u00bfworst case releaseA\u00bf and A\u00bfalternative scenarioA\u00bf.  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that A\u00bfthe owner or operator shall assume that the A\u00bf maximum quantity in the largest vessel A\u00bf is released as a gas over 10 minutes,A\u00bf due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as A\u00bfmore likely to occur than the worst-case release scenarioA\u00bf.\r\n\r\nAtmospheric dispersion model was performed for each facility based on the RMP COMP VER. 1.07. The RMP COMP PROGRAM was used to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to the A\u00bf toxic endpointA\u00bf selected by EPA of 3 ppm or 0.0087 mg/L, which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the A\u00bfmaximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individualA\u00bfs ability to take protective action.A\u00bf  The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance is defined, A\u00bf to estimate the population potentially affectedA\u00bf. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWORST CASE RELESE SCENARIO\r\n\r\nThe worst case release scenario for Victor Water Treatment Plant involves a failure of a one ton cylinder (a total of 2000 lb. of chlorine).

      "SummaryText": "r the worst case scenario are pre-defined by EPA (release of the entire amount of gas in 10 minutes).  The rate of release is equal to the amount in the cylinder divided by the time of the release or 2000 lb. / 10 minutes = 200 lbs. per minute.  The facility has containment walls, but not to the degree that the walls should be considered passive mitigation.  This scenario includes the following conditions: rate of release 200 lb. per minute, urban conditions, f stability, 1.5 meters per second wind speed, 0.0087 toxic endpoint. \r\n\r\nWhen the RMP COMP analysis for worst case scenario is used to obtain the distance, an area of concern can be determined in order to obtain an estimate of the population affected.  In addition, other public receptors can be identified including schools, businesses, industries, and recreational facilities.  Information with respect to the receptors identified for the worst case scenario for the Victor Gaffney Water Treatment Plant can be viewed by contacting the BPW at the main office.  Interested persons can also view the RMP of the Victor Gaffney Plant by contacting an EPA viewing site.\r\n\r\n\r\nATERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario for the Victor Gaffney Plant involves the misalignment of the vacuum regulator value that is connected to the ton cylinder.  This connection requires the use of a lead or composite washer  Misalignment of the washer or improper torsion of the valve fitting would allow chlorine gas to escape through an opening no greater than 3/8 inch resulting in the release of 960 lbs. of chlorine over a 60 minute release period (16 lb/min).  The calculation for the release rate is taken from the EPA reference guide, section 8.1 and is as follows: QR (release rate) = HA (hole area in square inches) x Pt (tank pressure in pounds per square inch absolute (psia) x 1/square root of  Tt (tank temperture-kelvin) x GS (gas factor). \r\n\r\nBased on results of the RMP COMP analysis which assumes a 60 minute release,"

This system will reduce significantly the amount of chlorine released in the case of a piping rupture. \r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Accidental Release Prevention Program at the Victor Gaffney Plant is based on the elements of the OSHA PSM Program.
