      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\nThe Taft Manufacturing Company facility located in Taft, California is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program (RMP) for Accidental Release [40 CFR 68] because its Acrolein production, storage and loading process contains more than the threshold quantities of acrolein (CAS No. 107-02-8) and propylene (CAS No. 115-07-1). Acrolein is a toxic and flammable substance which is a liquid at ambient temperatures.  Propylene is a flammable substance which is a gas at ambient conditions, but is carefully stored under pressure as a liquid at the Taft Manufacturing Company.\n\nThe Taft Manufacturing Company uses air, propylene, and steam to produce specification-grade acrolein.  The raw materials are feed into a reactor with a catalyst that converts the propylene to acrolein.  The acrolein is separated from the other reactant by-products and residues in a series of quench columns, a stripper, and two distillation columns.  The acrolein is stored in three 1,000 gallon vessels and ultimately transferred to the railcar storage at the repackaging plant.\n\nA maximum inventory of 260,000 lbs of propylene can be on site at any one time with up to 130,000 lbs of propylene per railcar storage vessel. Acrolein is stored in three 1,000 gallon process tanks and dedicated railcars. The process generates approximately 660 lbs of acrolein, with up to 30,000 lbs present in a single iso-container.\n\nThe Taft Manufacturing Company utilizes standard operating procedures, training, administrative and engineering controls, and other safety practices to assure that acrolein and propylene are handled in a safe manner. There has not been a fire, explosion, or release event at the facility plant in the last five years which has impacted people or property offsite.  Details of the facility's extensive prevention program are summarized in Section 3.0.\n\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Facilities\n\nWe at the Taft Manufacturing Co"

This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release does occur, our emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release and can call on assistance from the Kern County Fire Department.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activity encompasses the manufacturing and transfer of Acrolein, a chemical used in oilfield and agricultural applications, into bulk storage containers and then into transfer and shipping/dispenser containers.  We also rework and service the containers.  The acrolein is used as a pesticide and algaecide for crop protection and a sulfide scavenger, biocide, and corrosion inhibitor in oil field applications. \n\n\n3.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA as well as the requirements of Ca. Code of Regulations , Title 19, Public Safety, Div. 2, Off. Of Emerg. Ser., Chapter 4.5 Ca. Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program. A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information- The Taft Manufacturing Company maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associate"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the HAZOP method.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, plant operations, and/or maintenance.  Employees are involved in making suggestions to improve the safety and environmental operation of their work environment.  The analyses are reviewed and revalidated at least every five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures - For the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, the Taft Manufacturing Company maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address normal operations, including startup, shutdown, and emergency operations.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining- The Taft Manufacturing Company has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. \n\nMechanical Integrity- The Taft Manufacturing Company carries out maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  The Taft Manufacturing Company also participates in a quarterly leak detection and repair program.
