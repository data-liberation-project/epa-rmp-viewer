      "SummaryText": "Peter Pan Seafoods, Inc., (PPSF) owns and operates a seafood processing plant at King Cove, Alaska. The facility will be referred to as PPSFKC.\n\nPPSFKC has a large ammonia refrigeration system to provide for all cold storage needs of the plant for storing freezing seafood catch and for freeze-packaging of seafood. Since the amount of ammonia present in the system exceeds the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs, the PPSFKC is subject to OSHA's (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) process safety management (PSM) standard. In addition, facilities subject to PSM are also subject to the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) risk management program (RMP) regulations under Section 112[r] of the Clean Air Act (CAA).\n\nPPSFKC has implemented an extensive PSM program for its ammonia refrigeration system covering all the fourteen (14) elements of the PSM program:\n\nEmployee Participation\nProcess Safety Information\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\nOperating Procedures\nTraining\nContractor Requirements\nPre-Startup Safety Review\nMechanical Integrity Audits\nHot Work Permits\nManagement Of Change\nIncident Investigation\nEmergency Planning And Response\nCompliance Audits\n\nA process hazards analysis (PHA) was conducted on an ammonia refrigeration system at Peter Pan Seafoods - King Cove, in August 1996. The PHA was based on a generic study developed by the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) and the International Association of Refrigerated Warehouses (IARW).  The generic study was customized and supplemented with unique site-specific issues to ensure that all hazards of this particular ammonia refrigeration system were thoroughly reviewed.  This was done with a qualified PHA leader in a team format, centered around the What-If/Checklist technique.\n\nWith respect to modes of operation, the scope of the PHA included continuous normal operations, startup, shutdown, emergency situations, charging, and pumpout.  In addition, maintenance activities were d"
