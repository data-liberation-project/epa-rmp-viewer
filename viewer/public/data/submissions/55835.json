This Risk Management Plan (RMP) summarizes changes made to the east refrigeration system, which will result in a decrease in the total amount of ammonia on-site.  This RMP includes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to site personnel, contractors, visitors, the community and environment at large of hazardous chemical releases. The RMP is organized to correspond with specific U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP, Program 3 of 40 CFR 68, definitions and requirements of Subpart G, including: \n?Introduction;\n?Windsor Foods policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\n?Facility identification and regulated substances covered processes;\n?Hazard Assessment;\n?Prevention Program;\n?Five-Year Accident History;\n?Emergency Response Plan; \n?Emergency Communications;\n?Spill Reporting / Environmental Release Procedures;\n?Planned changes to improve safety; and\n?Management Program\n\nII.Windsor Foods Policies To Protect Health, Environment, and Safety\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at Windsor Foods; this RMP formalizes and documents these activities. Windsor Foods is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and to the environment. It is Windsor Foods? policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations.\n\nThis RMP has identified potential hazards and has taken steps to design and maintain a safe facility in order to prevent releases, and minimize the consequences of accidental releases, which could occur. RMP addresses potentially catastrophic chemical releases that could result in immediate harm and acute health effec"

Windsor Foods has developed an Emergency Action and Response Plan (EARP) that contains procedures designed to maximize the safety of all employees, contractors, and visitors in the event of an emergency and also guard against environmental consequences.\n\nIII.Facility Identification\nThe Windsor Foods facility is located at 301 West Third Street in Toluca, Illinois.  Windsor Foods, Benardi brands is a producer of frozen italian foods.  The facility is currently undergoing a change to the east refrigeration system, which will result in an overall decrease in the total amount of ammonia on-site.\n\nThe NAICS code for the facility is 311822.  A large portion of the facility is refrigerated to preserve products for processing and distribution.   \n\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. There are two (2) refrigeration systems onsite that are used for refrigerating coolers and freezers at the facility. \n\nThe amount of ammonia in the west refrigeration system is approximately 6,500 pounds.  The west refrigeration system is used for cooling in spiral freezers and compressor oil cooling.  The west refrigeration system consists of two (2) high stage compressors, one (1) low stage compressor, two (2) evaporative condensers, two (2) spiral freezers, one (1) low temperature recirculator with oil pot and ammonia pumps, one (1) intermediate intercooler, one (1) high pressure receiver, and one (1) auto purger.\n\nThe amount of ammonia in the new east refrigeration system has been calculated at approximately 13,500 pounds.  The new east refrigeration system will be used for cooling in spiral freezers, dock freezers, process freezers and coolers, storage freezers and coolers, and compressor oil cooling.  The new east refrigeration system consists of six (6) high stage compressors, four (4) low stage compressors, four (4) evaporative condensers, three (3) storage freezer evapor"

Worse Case Scenarios (WCS)\nAppendix B consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the worst-case scenario.  Appendix C consists of the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the worse case release scenario. \n\nV.Hazard Assessment ? Alternative Release Scenarios (ARS)\nAppendix B consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the alternative release scenario.  Appendix D consists of the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the alternative release scenario. \n\nVI.General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and the EPA Risk Management Program.   \n\nThis prevention program covers those processes that handle ammonia above the threshold quantity for both PSM and RMP rules. The next audit of the PSM program will occur by October 30, 2010, in compliance with the requirement to conduct PSM audits every three years.  The elements of the PSM / Program 3 prevention program and a brief description are listed below.\n?Emp"

Windsor Foods has developed a site-specific employee participation plan that ensures employees and their representatives are consulted when conducting and developing process hazard analyses, standard operating proceures, and other information required to be developed under the PSM/RMP regulation.  In addition, the employee participation program will ensure employees and their representatives have access to process hazard analyses and all other information required to be developed under PSM/RMP.  \n?Process Safety Information ? Windsor Foods maintains a site-specific PSI program that ensures information pertaining to the hazards, technology, and equipment of the process are properly developed and maintained. Process safety information for the ammonia process has been compiled and was last reviewed and updated as of July 2009.\n?Process Hazard Analysis ? Windsor Foods has updated a site-specific PHA program that ensures a PHA is conducted initially, at a minimum of every five (5) years, and whenever a change is significant enough to require a change in PSI.  In addition, this program ensures PHAs are conducted in accordance with OSHA and EPA regulations and ensures findings and recommendations of PHAs are properly documented. Windsor Foods conducted a thorough PHA study for the east and west refrigeration systems during July 2009.\n?Operating Procedures ? Windsor Foods has updated a site-specific procedure that ensures operating procedures provide clear instruction for different phases of process operations and ensures they are properly maintained.  Windsor Foods developed updated operating procedures for the east and west refrigeration systems during July 2009.
