(Agrium) facility located at 1801 Broadway Street in Marseilles, Illinois, for the reduction of accidental releases of hazardous materials. This updated, five (5) year Risk Management Plan (RMP) summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to site personnel, contractors, visitors, and the community and environment at large of hazardous chemical releases. The RMP is organized to correspond with specific U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP, Program 3 of 40 CFR 68, definitions and requirements of Subpart G, including: \n\u00b7Introduction;\n\u00b7Agrium policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\n\u00b7Facility identification and regulated substances covered processes;\n\u00b7Hazard Assessment;\n\u00b7Prevention Program;\n\u00b7Five-Year Accident History;\n\u00b7Emergency Response Plan; \n\u00b7Emergency Communications;\n\u00b7Spill Reporting / Environmental Release Procedures;\n\u00b7Planned changes to improve safety; and\n\u00b7Management Program\n\nII.

Agrium is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and to the environment. It is Agrium\u00bfs policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations.  This updated risk management plan is being submitted to comply with EPA 40 CFR 68 requirements to submit a risk management plan, every five (5) years.\n\nThis RMP has identified potential hazards and has taken steps to design and maintain a safe facility in order to prevent releases, and minimize the consequences of accidental releases, which could occur.

Facility Identification\nThe Agrium facility is located at 1801 Broadway Street in Marseilles, Illinois.  The facility is operated as both a dry and liquid terminal with storage of agricultural fertilizer materials and anhydrous ammonia in two liquid storage tanks.  Sales from this facility are from agricultural anhydrous ammonia and fertilizer solutions.  The NAICS code for the facility is 42459. \n\nThe amount of ammonia currently present on-site is stored in two liquid storage tanks with a capacity of approximately 20,000 tons each, for a total of 40,000 tons (80,000,000 lbs.). \n\nA topographic map identifying the site location is included as Appendix A. An area map is included as Appendix B. \n\nIV. Hazard Assessment \u00bf Worse Case Scenarios (WCS)\nAppendix C consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the worst-case scenario.
