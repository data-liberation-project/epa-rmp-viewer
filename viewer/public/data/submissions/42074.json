      "SummaryText": "Mississippi Chemical Corporation is a major manufacturer of fertilizers.  The main ingredient in all of our nitrogen products is ammonia.  Most of the ammonia produced in Yazoo City is used to make nitrogen fertilizers.  It is these nitrogen fertilizers that feed the plants that in turn feed and clothe the world's population.\n\nAmong the many other things that Mississippi Chemical brings to its community is a commitment to operate safely.  The company recognizes the health concerns of its neighboring community and is committed to responding to those concerns.  A safe workplace is a top priority for company management and personnel, and Mississippi Chemical employees continuously look for innovative ways to operate and maintain the production facilities in a safe manner.  Mississippi Chemical participates in routine safety training programs and drills.  In addition, continuous monitoring and assessment of the plant facilities ensure that all operations are running smoothly and efficiently.\n\nMississippi Chemical has a close working relationship with local emergency responders, and together we are prepared to respond to chemical emergencies within the facility.  To ensure proper emergency preparedness, Mississippi Chemical has several teams of employees trained in confined space rescue, hazardous waste operations and other specialties.\n\nMCC's safety and environmental record reflects the company's commitment.  We have multiple layers of safety and environmental protection integrated into our daily operations at our plants to protect our employees and the community.  The following identifies some primary layers of protection:\n\n   *Managing risks is something we do on a daily basis.\n\n   *We have worked for many years to reduce risks at our site and to be prepared for emergencies.\n\n   *Our employees are highly skilled and well-trained.\n\n   *Our equipment is routinely inspected and tested to make sure it is safe.\n\n   *We have computer monitors and controls in the process thr"

They involve \"what if\" scenarios where employee teams investigate every possible scenario of a new project and resolve it as part of the design phase of the project.\n\n   *Hazard reviews are also conducted on all existing MCC facilities.\n\n   *Emergency response, including employee responders as well as off-site responders, add another layer of protection to the community.\n\n   *We work closely with the civil defense, police and fire departments, and conduct routine drills.\n\n   *In the event of an emergency, we are prepared to respond within the facility.\n\nMCC has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  The following summarizes the elements of the release prevention program that are in operation at our Yazoo City facility.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nWorkplace health and safety are of paramount concern.  MCC maintains a file and makes its employees aware of process safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.  This information is maintained in the workplace.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nMCC conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is known as the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated every five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, MCC maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, nor"

The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nMCC has a comprehensive training program to inform and educate employees and to ensure they are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nMCC carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment during each operational turnaround to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes, among others:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations with training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrercted in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nProposed changes are evaluated for potential impact in the areas of safety, regulatory, etc., before being implemented.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-startup safety reviews of new processes and to significant modifications in existing processes are conducted as a regular practice at MCC.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nMCC conducts audits on a regular basis to monitor and sustain this process and ensure that MCC management is kept informed of all safety, health, and environmenta"

Formal audits will be completed at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits will be undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nMCC promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nMCC believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the EPA Risk Management Program rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nHot Work Permits\nMCC recognizes the inherent danger associated with hot work and requires the issuance of a work permit for all such activities at the facility.  The permit documents that all appropriate fire prevention requirements have been considered and implemented prior to beginning the hot work operations.  The permit is kept at the site of the work until completion of the hot work operation.\n\nContractors\nMCC hires outside contractors to conduct some specialized maintenance and construction projects.  All contractors working in the facility or visitors to the facility are expected to be aware of and adhere to all MCC health, safety, and environmental policies and procedures.

MCC's releases in the past five years have been typically very small releases to the air and do not meet the criteria stipulated in the regulations.\n\nMCC has an extensive emergency response program.  Specific to the facility, there is a written Emergency Response Plan (ERP).  The ERP is designed as a guide to help in determining the magnitude of an incident, the steps needed to bring the incident under control and the requirements to ensure that all the federal, state, and local laws are complied with.  The ERP is a definitive plan that assigns responsibilities, defines several different methods of communication, assigns control centers and safe havens, designates evacuation procedures, and coordinates with outside assistance.  The plan has detailed action plans that specifically address incidents concerning chemical spills, fire, acts of nature, personnel injury or fatality, and equipment failures.\n\nThe plan also designates the type and frequecty of training that employees are required to have depending on their responsibilities.  Furthermore, the plan commits the company's management team to devote the necessary resources to prepare, implement and audit the ERP.\n\nMCC strives on a daily basis to make its facility as safe as possible for the employees, contractors and the community.  MCC literally has safety and/or environmental training almost daily.  Every employee and contractor will attend numerous safety and/or environmental training meetings annually.  MCC and its employees have an enduring commitment to protecting health, safety and the environment, and our success is accomplished by research, innovation and the use of good common sense."
