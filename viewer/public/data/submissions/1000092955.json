In addition, the Trainer Refinery has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to refinery processes or other refinery facilities. The emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Trainer Refinery is coordinated with the Delaware County, PA Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. The Trainer Refinery has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., Delaware County 911 Center). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Trainer Refinery conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and the refinery provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the refinery.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nThe Trainer Refinery emphasizes continuous improvement to augment and strengthen its accident prevention program.

The column was isolated and the operator began to remove a bleeder cap so that a flex hose could be connected to the flare.  As he began to loosen the cap, the cap tilted indicating the threads were not secure.  Before the cap could be removed or retightened, it began to leak, indicated by puffs of smoke. As the operator prepared to back away from the area, he turned his head to locate the ladder to exit the platform when material contacted the left side of his face and he felt a burning sensation. The operator descended the ladder to grade and immediately entered a nearby safety shower.  He was assisted by another operator.  An emergency call was made immediately and Monroe Emergency Response Technicians responded and began treatment with calcium gluconate gel and a nebulizer. The operator was transported to the Alkylation Unit change house where treatment continued and then to Crozer Chester Medical Center (CCMC) where he was treated for minor burns.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\nThe Trainer Refinery maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the root cause and develop corrective actions and actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations, and reviews these results with the appropriate members of the Refinery Leadership Team. The investigation team's recommendations are tracked until they are resolved. The final resolution of each recommendation is documented, and the investigation lessons learned are reviewed with all employees and contractors when appropriate who could be affected by the findings. The results of the investigation are retained for at least 5 years so that they can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\nCompliance Audits\nTo help the accident prevention program to function properly, the Trainer Refinery conducts periodic audits to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.\n\nThe audit team develops findings that are presented to refinery management and assigned to appropriate subject matter experts for resolution.

The basic aspects of this program include: developing written procedures, conducting training, performing inspections and tests, correcting identified deficiencies, and applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on an overview of the process, safety and health hazards, applicable instructions for maintenance of equipment, refinery's emergency response plan, and applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner. Written instructions and practices help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.

Because many contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has procedures in place so that contractors perform their work in a safe manner, are aware of the hazards in their workplace, understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, understand and follow site safety rules, and inform refinery personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with site specific orientation, information about safety and health hazards, emergency response plan requirements, and safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, the refinery evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Refinery personnel and/or contractor safety personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\nThe Trainer Refinery conducts a PSSR for new facilities or facility modifications to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.

LOPA is a risk assessment technique that was developed to semi- quantitatively evaluate the safety integrity of process operations. LOPA uses a simple numerical calculation to measure the adequacy of protection layers (alarms with operator response, relief valves, control loops, etc.) against the potential risk of process deviations (loss of containment, personnel exposure, etc.). The LOPA results give order of magnitude approximation of the risk of a scenario.\n\nThe PHA team findings and recommendations are presented to the Refinery Health, Safety, Environment and Reliability Team. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.
