      "SummaryText": "1.Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies A\u00bf Mid-Florida Freezer Warehouses Ltd. in Apopka, FL is committed to protecting its employees, the surrounding community and the environment from an accidental release of the anhydrous ammonia used in our refrigeration system.  The release prevention program addresses such issues as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance and training to ensure that releases do not occur.  Frequent inspections, regular maintenance, detectors, rigorous supervised on-the-job training and 24 hour security/surveillance of the process reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  If a release does occur, however, employees are trained to contain the spill from a safe distance and implement notification procedures.  Emergency response activities are coordinated with the City of Apopka Fire Department, located less than a mile from the facility, and the Florida District 6 LEPC.\r\n\r\n2.Regulated Substance - The facility is a cold and dry storage warehouse and anhydrous ammonia is used as a cooling media in a closed system.  There is approximately 39,500 pounds of ammonia within the system and it is the only regulated substance at the site that exceeds the threshold quantity.  Due to the amount of product and the location of public receptors, this facility is covered as a Level 3 facility under RMP regulations and also is subject to the OSHA PSM Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119\r\n\r\n3.Accidental Release Prevention Program - This facility has developed all prevention program elements based on the Federal EPAs Accidental Release Prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR part 68 and OSHAs Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.\r\n\r\n4. Process Safety Information - The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable state and industry codes.  Diagrams, drawings and written has been prepared and maintained on site.\r\n\r\n5. Process Hazard Analysis - PHA was conducted, deficiencies identified and correct"

      "SummaryText": "ions implemented.  PHAs have been reviewed as required and all changes noted, corrected or scheduled for implementation.\r\n\r\n6. Operating Procedures - were developed and implemented for all activities relating to the process and prepared in accordance with OSHA and EPA guidelines.  They are revised and revised as necessary to remain consistent with the process.\r\n\r\n7. Training - Employees have extensive experience in operating and maintaining the process (25-35 years) and receive refresher training every 3 years or more frequently as necessary.  Southern Technical College has also become a resource.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity - An extensive maintenance program for all components has been implemented.  Thorough inspections, (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, etc.) are performed and deviations or deficiencies corrected immediately.  Standard Maintenance and Preventative Maintenance Procedures have been written for all maintenance and inspection activities and are reviewed annually to ensure that they are current.\r\n\r\n8. Management of Change - There is a written management of change procedure in place.Evaporators in Buildings H & I were replaced \"in kind\" but did not require implementation of MOC procedures.  \r\n\r\n9. Pre-start-up Review - conducted any time the ammonia refrigeration system or its components are opened for repairs, tie-ins or modifications.  A checklist has been developed (Based on IIAR Bulletin 110) and used to ensure safe start-up prior to placing equipment into operation.\r\n\r\n10. Compliance Audits - audits will be conducted every 3 years and corrective actions as a result of the audits implemented immediately.\r\n\r\n11. Incident Investigation - there is a program in place to promptly investigate any incident that resulted in, or had the potential for, an accidental release of ammonia.  The process is designed to identify root causes and indicate preventative measures to prevent a re-occurrence.  The reports will be maintained on file for a minimum of 5 years."

      "SummaryText": "12. Employee Participation - Every employee at the facility has participated in all phases of the establishment of the Risk Management Program.  Each is dedicated to the prevention of product releases and subsequent potential injuries to themselves, their coworkers, the surrounding community and the environment.\r\n\r\n13. Contractors - A procedure for reviewing the safety performance and past safety history of any contractor hired to work on or with the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system has been developed and will be adhered to.  The policy includes an obligation to inform the contractor of the hazards they and their workers will be exposed to as well as emergency response procedures.  A performance evaluation system to ensure that the Contractor adheres to Mid-Florida Freezer's company safety and health policies is also contained in the procedures.  We have a 24 year working relationship with the current contractor.\r\n\r\n14. Five-year Accident History - there have been no ammonia release in the past five years.\r\n\r\n6.Emergency Response plan - In the event of a  leak, employees will control the leak using defensive measures (shutting down valves) diking from a safe distance, and otherwise using measures from outside the danger zone.  The Apopka Fire Department would be contacted immediately and provide spill response.  If the leak were large, the facility would be evacuated.  We have coordinated our emergency response plan with The Florida District 6 LEPC and the City of Apopka Fire Department.\r\n\r\n7.Improved Safety - The facility and all employees involved in the process will continue to inspect and examine the system to identify areas where improvements can be made.  All deficiencies noted on audits, inspections and walk-throughs will be corrected and recommendations based on PHAs implemented immediately."
