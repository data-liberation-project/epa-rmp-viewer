Should an accidental release occur, this facility is prepared to work with the Arenzville Fire Department and Morgan County Local Emergency Planning Committee so they can plan for response to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. \n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application to the soil as a crop production nutrient.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nThis facility has developed a worst-case and alternative-case scenario however it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as security-sensitive information as requested by EPA.\n\nThis facility complies with various rules and regulations governing the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia including ANSI K61.1, OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 and regulations administered by our state agency. Compliance with these regulations and on-going training of our employees make up our accident release prevention program.  \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered facility in the past five years.\n\nThe facility has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.120. Emergency planning and community right-to-know information is provided to state emergency response commission, Morgan County LEPC and the Arenzville Fire Department as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations and inspections are \nperformed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions and operations. The"
