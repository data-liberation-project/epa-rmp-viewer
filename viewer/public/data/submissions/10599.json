Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at the Mariner Energy, Inc. Sandy Lake Natural Gas Processing Plant are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  In the unlikelyevent that such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with the Beaumont Fire Department that provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the processing (separation) of natural gas liquids received under pressure from several wells in the local Beaumont area.  The regulated substances present at our facility include flammable mixtures that are made up of butane, propane, condensate and several other hydrocarbons removed from the natural gas stream.  The Sandy Lake facility sells natural gas liquids, condensate and natural gas.  The maximum inventory of natural gas liquids at our facility is approximately 243,000 pounds stored in two pressurized horizontal bullet tanks storing 121,500 pounds each.  The maximum, inventory of condensate at our facility is approximately 2,188,860 pounds stored in two 5,000-barrel aboveground tanks storing 1,094,430 pounds each.\n \n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the look-up"

One worst case and one alternative case release scenario has been submitted for each flammable substance present in the  Program 3 processes cumulatively.  \n\nNatural Gas Liquids\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release of natural gas liquids from the horizontal bullet storage tanks at the facility.  The scenario involves the release and resulting vapor cloud explosion of 121,500 pounds of natural gas liquids from one tank.  The resulting maximum distance to a 1 pound per square inch (psi) overpressure is 0.4 miles from the facility.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for the natural gas liquids involves a release from a piping leak at the horizontal bullet storage tank area in the facility.  The scenario involves the release and resulting vapor cloud explosion of 12,150 pounds of natural gas liquids. The resulting maximum distance to a 1 pound per square inch (psi) overpressure is 0.2 miles from the facility.\n\nCondensate\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release of condensate with a Reid Vapor Pressure of 11.0 from the 5,000 barrel condensate storage tanks at the facility.  The scenario involves the release and resulting vapor cloud explosion of 1,094,430 pounds of condensate from one storage tank.  The resulting maximum distance to a 1 pound per square inch (psi) overpressure is 0.8 miles from the facility.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for condensate involves a release from a piping leak at the condensate storage tank area in the facility.  The scenario involves the release and resulting vapor cloud explosion of 10,000 pounds of condensate. The resulting maximum distance to a 1 pound per square inch (psi) overpressure is 0.2 miles from the facil"

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirement set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the USEPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, along with meeting ASTM, ANSI, API, NEMA, ASME and other specifications and codes.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Sandy Lake facility maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.  This is maintained through our Process Safety Management (PSM) program.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is based on our PSM program.  The studies are undertaken by qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated as part of our regular maintenance inspection program.  Any findings related to the process hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, the Sandy Lake facility maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after maintenance.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\n\nThe Sandy Lake facility has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees"
