This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our facilities. Crestwood's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  \r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\r\n\r\nCrestwood temporarily stores up to 20 railroad tank cars containing Y-Grade Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs) for approximately 48 hours on the Colt Manifest Track before being released to the BNSF railroad for scheduled departure. \r\n\r\nThe loaded interconnected rail tank cars fit the EPA's definition of a stationary source in 40 CFR part 68 while disconnected from a means of transportation (i.e. locomotive). The facility contains one source of a regulated substance held over its respective threshold quantity; Flammable Mixture (NGL).\r\n\r\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention and Program Information\r\n\r\nThe Colt Manifest Track Rail Tank Car Storage Siting is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program 2 (RMP) regulation.\r\n\r\nSafety Information\r\n\r\nCrestwood keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe storage of the regulated substance. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for safe storage of the Y-Grade NGLs and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. The reference documents are maintained by operations. \r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs).

Should potential hazards be identified Crestwood will systematically examine it and ensure that adequate controls are in place to mitigate the potential risk appropriately.\r\n\r\nFindings are prioritized on a relative risk ranking based on Crestwood's Corporate Risk Matrix. This ranking helps ensure that potential hazards assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options in response to hazard review are prioritized and tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nCrestwood maintains written procedures that address deliveries and shipments for railroad tank cars. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for deliveries and shipments for railroad tank cars, Crestwood has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees. New employees receive basic training in facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests,"

This refresher training is conducted on an as needed basis.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nMaintenance\r\n\r\nCrestwood has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\r\n\r\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner. Job plans/written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nCre"

The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.

The contact for the Epping Rural Fire Protection District is (701-859-5561). This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. The Colt Manifest Track Rail Tank Car Storage Siting has around-the-clock communications capability. Crestwood operators are required to be onsite to monitor all rail tank car switches. In the event of a product release, an operator will call the appropriate emergency response organizations (e.g., Epping Rural Fire Protection District). Crestwood also maintains a 24-Hour Emergency Hotline in which emergency personnel are able to reach the appropriate company representative in the event of an emergency. This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Crestwood conducts periodic emergency drills that involve emergency response organizations, and the Colt Manifest Track Rail Tank Car Storage Siting performs annual drills with local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the facility.\r\n\r\nFive - Year Accident History\r\n\r\nColt Manifest Track Rail Tank Car Storage Siting has not had any accidents as of the date of this RMP.
