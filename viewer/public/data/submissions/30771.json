      "SummaryText": "Within the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act (CAA), Section 112(r) required the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to issue a rule specifying the actions that facilities (stationary sources) must take to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals into the atmosphere and reduce their potential impact to the public and the environment.  On June 20, 1996, the EPA issued 40 CFR Part 68, \"Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions,\" or the Risk Management Plan (RMP) rule.  Based heavily upon OSHA's \"Process Safety Management (PSM) Plan\" (29 CFR 1910.119), Part 68 extends the responsibility of a facility from protecting the safety of the workforce to more expansive consideration of the surrounding community and environment.\n\nIn an attempt to protect all those involved (employees, the community, and the environment), EPA has developed regulations to prevent the release of regulated substances from facilities while developing management and emergency planning programs should an event ever occur.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Regulation 40 CFR Part 68, entitle \"Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions,\" and all its amendments, requires management and emergency planning to be developed at any facility manufacturing, storing or using specific hazardous chemicals above established threshold quantities to ensure safety of the workforce, as well as any public or environmental receptors.  Paragraph (a) of this regulation applies to the \"\u00bfowner or operator of a stationary source that has more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance in a process, as determined under section 68.115\u00bf\"  Under this rule, any stationary source \"\u00bf subject to this part shall submit a simgle RMP\u00bf\"\n\nAll such facilities covered under this rule originally were required to develop and implement a single Risk Management Plan (RMP) by June 21, 1999, or the specific date which the threshold quantity had been exceeded for a regulated substance in a process, whichever is later."

This document should be considered the City of Lancaster\u00bfs submission to meet the June 21, 2004 submission date\n\nAlthough the Prevention Program under the RMP Rule mimics the requirement\u00bfs established by OSHA\u00bfs PSM Standards, the RMP and PSM must be separate documents with separate documentation, revisions, or reviews.  Elements (or programs) devised under the PSM Standard may be included in the overall structure of the RMP, thus insuring compatibility between the two programs.  Each document must be maintained, updated, and reviewed separately to ensure compliance with each rule.  A copy of the RMP Rule, 40 CFR Part 68, has been included in Appendix A of the City's RMP."
