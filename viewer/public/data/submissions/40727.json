To assist with ongoing compliance, a \"Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance Manual\" has been prepared and implemented.  Concerning the emergency response policy at the facility, the owner has made the decision that employees will not respond to accidental releases of regulated substances and will instead evacuate.\n\nThis facility processes natural gas, natural gas liquids (NGL), and oil from the Rea Curran # 1 well. High pressure gas from the well is sent to a high pressure separator with the gas being routed to a glycol contact tower for drying and is then routed to the inlet of the gas plant.  The gas plant strips out NGL liquids which are stored in a single 30,000 gallon pressurized bullet tank operating at approximately 170 psig.  The NGL is removed from the facility by transfers to tank trucks.  Liquids from the high pressure separator are routed to lower pressure separation vessels and the oil product is stored in three bulk atmospheric storage tanks (400 barrels each) and removed from the site via transfers to tank trucks.  The facility is subject to the RMP requirements since it is a natural gas processing plant producing NGL and contains threshold quantities of regulated substances.  The amount of NGL is estimated at 156,000 pounds and the amount of condensate is estimated at 277,200 pounds.  The NGL and oil products are a mixture of hydrocarbons consisting of methane, ethane, butane, isobutane, propane, pentane, and isopentane.  For purposes of determining the largest weight on site, the highest density substance was used (butane for NGL and pentane for condensate).\n\nThis facility has two applicable worst case release scenarios.  Scenario # 1 involves an explosion and fire from an NGL release from the single largest NGL vessel and the distance calculated to the endpoint was"

      "SummaryText": " 0.4 miles.  Scenario # 2 involves an explosion and fire from a condensate release from the single largest tank and the distance calculated to the endpoint was 0.1 miles.  Section 3.1 of this RMP shows the calculations used for each scenario.  This facility has two alternative release scenarios.  Scenario # 1 involves a puncture of the largest diameter NGL cylinder when full and the distance calculated to the endpoint was 0.3 miles.  Scenario # 2 involves a puncture of the largest diameter condensate tank when full and the distance calculated to the endpoint was 0.1 miles.  Section 3.2 of this RMP shows the calculations used for each scenario.  The release scenarios use the maximum capacity of the single largest vessel thus no administrative controls or mitigation measures are used to limit the volume thus limiting the distance to the endpoint.\n\nSince this facility is a Program 2, a documented prevention program is required.  This program is discussed in a \"Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance Manual\" prepared for the facility.  The prevention program does discuss both NGL and condensate which are the specific chemicals contained in an amount above the threshold quantity.   \n\nAs documented in Section 4.0 of this plan, the facility has not experienced a release as defined in the regulation within the past five years.  \n\nSince this facility is a Program 2, a written emergency response program is required.  This program is contained in Section 5.0 of the \"Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance Manual\" prepared for the facility.  Further, emergency response procedures have been developed and are contained at the front of this RMP and these procedures will be implemented in the event of an accidental release or the threat of such a release.  Basically, the instructions are to evacuate the facility and then notify the proper authorities.\n\nAt present time, there are no planned changes to improve safety."
