              "Description": "Ohio Edison Company (OE) and Powerspan have compiled written process safety related information on aqueous ammonia, process technology and process equipment in a Program 2 Prevention Program addressing Accident Prevention Planning requirements.  This information is maintained in the RMP program files and within the Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Manual documentation at the plant and includes: a listing of covered process equipment; a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS); process technology information; a study of the consequences of deviations; process equipment information; and emergency and first aid equipment and response procedures.\n  \nA formal Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) has been conducted employing the HAZOP and Checklist methodologies to address consequences of the failure of the process equipment or any engineering/administrative controls to be employed.  \n\nIn conducting the PHA, process safety information, equipment specifications, drawings and other information on the Powerspan ECO technology and process were utilized.  The PHA involved six major steps: identification of associated risks; assessing of impact of equipment malfunctions; assessing human error opportunities; assessing existing safeguards; considering ways to detect/monitor releases and estimating maximum release quantities. \n\nAs a result, a number of recommendations were identified and addressed throughout the design and implementation phases of the ECO CDU process.  These recommendations, in the form of action items, were documented and assigned responsibilities and deadlines to complete.  These recommendations address process design and control improvements including alarm set points and data communication, standard operating procedures for aqueous ammonia unloading, storage and transfer, including normal and emergency operating conditions, ensuring mechanical integrity of equipment including management.\n\nOE has developed written operating procedures for the system.  A written Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Manual was prepared by OEas design/build vendor.  OE also developed detailed operating instructions addressing normal and emergency operations for various elements of the process including Aqueous Ammonia Truck Unloading and Aqueous Ammonia Storage and Transfer to ECO CDU Injection.  These procedures include specific information on safety features, alarm set points and responses, steady state conditions, shutdown procedures, long term outage instructions, maintenance requirements and emergency response.\n\nA formal training program has been instituted for training employees on the safe operation and potential hazards of aqueous ammonia storage, handling and ECO CDU system injection, especially those involved in operation and maintenance of the covered process areas.  Plant personnel receive general awareness training on the ECO CDU process, the requirement for an RMP program, and safe work practices they should follow to avoid hazards associated with the process.  Operations personnel working in the covered process areas receive instruction on operational aspects and procedures including normal and emergency startup, operation and shut down scenarios, safe operating limits, and emergency response requirements.  Maintenance personnel working in the covered process areas receive instruction on inspection, maintenance, repair and replacement of equipment. \n\nAt least every three years, employees responsible for operating or maintaining/repairing equipment or handling covered materials will receive refresher training as described above.  Whenever physical or chemistry changes to the covered process occurs, the hazard review will be revisited and affected employees will be made aware of the changes and re-trained where appropriate.\n\nIt is the policy of OE to assure the safe operation of equipment used in the ammonia storage and transfer process at the RE Burger Plant.  This will be accomplished in part through a system of periodic inspections and/or tests to monitor and assess the condition of designated equipment.  Corrective actions will be initiated as necessary. \n\nIt is also the policy of OE to safely operate a facility designed and built according to good engineering practices that incorporate methods or principles in accordance with applicable industry standards.  Generally accepted industry standards have been employed in the design of the ECO CDU system.  The facility will be operated according to specific procedures that ensure that replacement equipment is compatible with process materials and operating conditions.\n\nIn addition to initial Process Hazard Analyses, programs for mechanical integrity, managing changes, and employee training, pre-start up safety reviews ensure and confirm that all elements of accident prevention are addressed during initial start-up and whenever significant process or equipment changes have occurred.  This program includes procedures for such reviews.\n\nOE has established guidelines and procedures for auditing RMP covered process areas as required by the RMP Rule.  Compliance audits will be performed at least once every three years based on the date the RMP program is complete and the process is first started if OE continues to operate the process after the commercial demonstration period.\n\nCompliance Audits will be performed by a team that includes at least one person knowledgeable in the process and at least one person knowledgeable in the RMP Rule requirements.  The remainder of the team may include representatives from operations, maintenance, engineering, quality, safety and environmental organizations familiar with the process and requirements and trained in all elements of the RMP Plan.\n\nOE has instituted an Incident Investigation Procedure designed to assure that accidents and incidents occurring within RMP-covered areas involving the catastrophic release of hazardous substances are properly investigated and corrective actions are developed and implemented.  The goal of this program is to reduce the potential or likelihood that incidents recur and to ensure that continuous improvement of the process and procedures reduces accidents, incidents or releases of hazardous substances.  \n\nThis procedure is intended to apply to RMP-covered process areas and substances but adopts existing OSHA Incident Investigation and EPA Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasures (SPCC) Plan procedures for incident investigation and release reporting applicable throughout the RE Burger facility.  This procedure addresses accidents, incidents and/or releases that could impact the nearby public and environment in addition to employees and contractors working in the covered process areas at the plant.",

      "SummaryText": "Ohio Edison Company (OE) operates a 427 MW (NDC) coal-fired electrical generating plant, known as the RE Burger Plant, in Shadyside, Ohio.  Federal and Ohio environmental regulations increasingly are requiring coal-burning utilities to reduce emissions of pollutants including nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and mercury.  In response to regulations, pollution control providers are developing multi-pollutant control technologies.  One such technology is a process being developed by Powerspan Corporation known as Electro-Catalytic Oxidation or ECO.\n\nOE is working with Powerspan to implement a Commercial Demonstration Unit or CDU to further the development of this innovative control technology.  This involves constructing a commercial plant and tying into the flue gas stream from one of the operating units at the RE Burger Plant.  The system is scheduled to operate for a period of about one year during 2004.  If successful, OE may decide to continue operation of the process.\n\nThe ECO process utilizes several chemical reagents including aqueous ammonia for NOx control.  Similar to other NOx control processes, ECO reduces NOx emissions by reacting flue gas containing NOx with ammonia to form nitrogen and water.  The source of ammonia employed here is a 29% by-volume concentration water solution.  EPAas Risk Management Planning (RMP) threshold for coverage under the rule is any process with aqueous ammonia of 20% concentration in quantities over 20,000 pounds.  OSHAas Process Safety Management (PSM) threshold for coverage is any process with aqueous ammonia of 44% concentration in quantities over 15,000 pounds. Accordingly, this RMP covers processes as described in this RMP exceeding EPA RMP thresholds for aqueous ammonia but not the OSHA PSM concentration threshold. \n\nRMP covered processes include all areas in the ECO CDU system where aqueous ammonia exists in concentrations above the RMP threshold of 20%.  This includes the truck unloading operations,"

      "SummaryText": " storage tanks and transfer lines up to the point of mixing in the ECO scrubbing tower, where the concentration falls below the concentration threshold as it is mixed in a solution with process liquor and circulated into the emission control cycle.  Covered activities related to this process include the use, operation, repair, replacement and maintenance of equipment in the process.  All personnel involved in these activities are properly trained in normal and emergency or upset operations.\n\nAs defined by the rule, the worst case release is the failure of the aqueous ammonia storage tank (single largest vessel) inside the storage tank containment area.  This is assumed to release the contents instantly and would result in an evaporating pool of ammonia gas from the surface of the solution contained.  Utilizing analytical methods provided by EPA results in a distance to toxic endpoint that reaches just off site and may minimally impact public or environmental receptors off site.    \n\nSeveral alternate case scenarios, which may be more likely to occur than the worst case scenario described above, were examined to assess their potential to impact public receptors as well.  The scenario selected for inclusion in the RMP is that of a pipe failure downstream of the storage tank allowing aqueous ammonia to discharge onto the ground for about 10 minutes until the condition is identified and the pumps shut down.  Utilizing analytical methods provided by EPA results in a distance to endpoint that reaches just off site and may minimally impact environmental receptors immediately to the south along the Ohio River.  \n\nAs this is a new process, there have been no accidents to date regarding this process.  In considering the potential to impact public receptors, the concentrations and quantities handled on site, and having no record of accidents, OE is registering this process at the RE Burger Plant under the RMP Program as a Program 2 process.

Burger Plant.  Regulations under OSHA, EPA, and Ohio EPA have required the plant to develop and implement procedures to plan for and respond to emergency situations at the plant whether due to natural disasters and storms, exposure to releases of hazardous chemicals or harm and damage due to flammable or explosive materials.  These procedures have been documented in the Emergency Action Plan (EAP).\n\nThe Emergency Response Procedure developed around the Aqueous Ammonia ECO CDU process, as required by the RMP Regulations, is built on strong programs and procedures already in place at the RE Burger Plant.  Supplementing this procedure is the Emergency Action Plan (aqueous ammonia) which describes hazards and response requirements for aqueous ammonia in particular.\n"
