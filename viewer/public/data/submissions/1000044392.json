Chlorine is considered a hazardous substance by the US Environmental Protection Agency.  The same properties that make chlorine valuable as a disinfectant in the water treatment process also require observance of certain precautions in handling and using chlorine in order to prevent and take action in the event of an accidental release of the substance that may affect RRWA employees, the public, and environment.  RRWA is committed to employing the procedures, equipment, and other means necessary to ensure the safe handling and use of all chemicals including chlorine. \n\n\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\n\n\nRRWA provides drinking water to more than 80,000 people in 18 counties and 51 communities in Iowa and Missouri.  RRWA's water treatment plant processes approximately 6.5 million gallons of drinking water per day. The regulated substance handled at this facility is chlorine.  Chlorine is used as a disinfectant in the water treatment process.  Chlorine is shipped by truck to the water treatment plant in 2,000-pound cylinders.  The chlorine cylinders are offloaded from the truck into the chlorine storage room with a hoist crane.  The chlorine storage and feed rooms are two separate rooms that adjoin the water treatment plant.  Access to the chlorine storage and feed rooms is from outside the water treatment plant.\n\n\n\nAccident Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\n\n\nRRWA policies and procedures regarding the handling and use of chemicals entail the intent to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  RRWA's water treatment plant was designed and constructed in 1977.  A significant expansion of the facilities water treatment capacity and associate"

      "SummaryText": "d upgrades were completed in 2000.  The water treatment plant has separate chlorine storage and feed rooms.  The ventilation system maintains both rooms under negative pressure preventing any released chlorine from migrating directly to other interior portions of the water treatment plant.  Chlorine gas detection devices are installed in the chlorine storage room.  The devices detect chlorine release as low as one part per million.  The devices sound an alarm in the water treatment plant control room to notify RRWA employees of the release so that appropriate action can be taken.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History:\n\n\n\nRRWA has not had an accidental release of chlorine that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\n\n\nRRWA has developed an emergency action plan to avoid or minimize any impact on employees, the public, and environment in the event of a release of hazardous material including chlorine from the Association's water treatment plant.  The plan includes actions that will be taken to evacuate employees and others at the RRWA facility and to notify first responders and other emergency response organizations as well as nearby residences and offices.  The review, revision, and implementation, if needed, of RRWA's emergency action plan will be coordinated with the Appanoose County Emergency Planning Commission and Emergency Management Coordinator.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\n\n\nRRWA is currently in the process of designing improvements and an expansion of the existing chemical storage and feed facility. Engineering and design is complete and bid submittals are being requested. One aspect of the design is a change from chlorine gas liquified by pressure to sodium hypochlorite (bleach). The existing chemical feed and storage area will be renovated and all gas chlorine feed and storage equipme"
