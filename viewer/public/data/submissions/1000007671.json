      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nAt Celanese's Clear Lake Plant we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n- A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n- An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n- A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n- An overview of our emergency response program\n- An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nOur facility produces mainly commodity organic chemicals using a variety of chemicals and processing operations.  The major products manufacured at the facility are acetic acid, vinyl acetate, ethylene oxide, and ethylene glycol.  In our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics\n\n-Ethylene oxide, produced at a rate of 700 million lb/yr, is used for the local production of ethylene glycol, with the remainder being sold in the merchant market.  The material is stored on site in pressurized and refrigerated spheres.\n-Vinyl Acetate, produced at a rate of 750 million lbs/yr, is sold entirely in the merchant market where it is used in paints and adhesives.  The material is stored on site in inerted atmospheric tanks.\n\nFlammables\n\n-Acetaldehyde is a byproduct in the production of vinyl"

About 800,000 lbs are stored on site as a liquid in a pressurized sphere.\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nOur facility complies with the OSHA Process Safety Management Rule, and has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  We take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n- Process safety information\n- Process hazard analysis\n- Operating procedures\n- Training\n- Mechanical integrity\n- Management of change\n- Pre-startup review\n- Compliance audits\n- Incident investigation\n- Employee participation\n- Contractors\n\nCommon Work Practices are in place such as energy isolation, hot work permits, and conduct of operations.\nConduct of operations includes:\n- defining standards for handover of equipment between operations and maintenance, \n- following Standard Operating Procedures, \n- recertifying operators, \n- defining standards for equipment labeling, \n- approving and making notifications before removing safety equipment in service, and \n- verifying equipment readiness by operations prior to placing in service.\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nIn the ethylene oxide process:\n- use of sealless pumps to avoid leaks\n- use of rigid insulation with stainless steel sheaths and banding for better fire protection\n- use of both refrigeration and pressure in the storage of ethylene oxide to assure keeping it liquid"

      "SummaryText": "in case of a release\n- use of a large capacity deluge system around the ethylene oxide storage spheres to avoid forming a vapor cloud\n- limit the level to which a tank can be filled\n\nIn the vinyl acetate process:\n- use of nitrogen blanketing in all storage tanks to avoid flammability\n- use of mounted water spray around the acetaldehyde sphere to prevent formation of a vapor cloud in case of a release\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting the requirements of the law and our own internal standards for accident prevention.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  During the past five years there has not been a release involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or offsite injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.   \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  We are a member of CIMA (Channel Industries Mutual Aid), a consortium of area companies that coordinates and help each other during emergencies in which the individual plant's resources may not be sufficient to effectively handle the response.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nAs a result of the PHAs (Process Hazards Analyses) that are conducted periodically on each of the units of the plant, recommendations to improve the prevention of, and"
