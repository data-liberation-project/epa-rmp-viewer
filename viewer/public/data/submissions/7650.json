      "SummaryText": "Hydrite Chemical Co. operates as an inorganic chemical manufacturer producing chemicals used in a variety of industries from food processing to waste water treatment.  We at Hydrite Chemical are strongly committed to employee and public safety and environmental responsibility.  It is our policy to control our processes to prevent the accidental release of harmful or noxious materials that could endanger or irritate our employees, plant visitors, or neighbors.  This commitment is integrated into our design standards, equipment installation and maintenance practices, operating procedures and training programs.\n\nHydrite Chemical has developed and trained written emergency response procedures in the event of an accidental release from any of our processes.  These written plans have been provided to the local emergency response agencies including local emergency response personnel, hospitals, state and federal agencies.\n\nHydrite uses two chemicals regulated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Program and the Environmental Protection Agency Risk Management Program.  These chemicals are anhydrous forms of Ammonia and Sulfur Dioxide.  These chemicals are received in bulk truckloads averaging 40,000-42,000 pounds from various suppliers and are delivered into our on-site storage tanks.  We have on-site storage capacity for 48,000 pounds of ammonia and 286,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide.  These materials are stored as liquids under pressure.  All storage and ancillary equipment are designed to comply with National Standards including the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), the Fertilizer Institute, National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), and OSHA.\n\nWorst case scenario for each regulated substance is based on the total loss of the maximum quantity stored in each vessel.  Release is assumed to occur over a 10 minute period with weather conditions as defined by EPA in the Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  Hyd"

      "SummaryText": "rite has elected to use the ALOHA modeling package to keep our scenarios comparable with the local emergency response providers.  A limitation built into the ALOHA modeling package truncates all releases at a maximum impact zone of 6 miles, so the worst case scenario was modeled using RMP*Comp.  The worst case scenario for Sulfur Dioxide has the greatest impact zone and does have off-site impacts.\n\nAlternate scenarios for both substances were based on a hose/valve failure from a delivery truck allowing the total quantity in the truck to be released through the hose/valve.  Anhydrous ammonia uses a 1-1/2\" delivery hose and sulfur dioxide uses a 2\" hose.  Weather conditions used were as specified in the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  Modeling was conducted using ALOHA.  Both alternate scenarios have off-site impacts.\n\nHydrite Chemical has multiple release prevention programs integrated into all phases of operation from design through maintenance.  Each chemical is reviewed for physical hazards, health hazards, environmental hazards and process hazards.  Both processes are subject to the OSHA PSM program and as such, undergo a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  Written operating procedures have been developed and are reviewed on a regular basis.  Employee training procedures have been developed and are implemented ensuring the employees understand the hazards of the chemicals, know how to operate the equipment, know how to shut down the process and how to respond to a release.  Pre-start up safety reviews are performed prior to operation of new equipment or receipt of new chemicals.  Equipment maintenance procedures have been developed and implemented, including routine inspections and scheduled maintenance.  Hydrite Chemical believes that every incident has the potential for serious impact and practices Incident Investigations to determine root cause and corrective action for all releases whether they resulted in injury or impacted away from our plant or not"

      "SummaryText": ".\n\nA review of the previous five year accident history indicated 2 releases, which had community impact.  These releases have been included in the RMP.  Additionally, Hydrite had several other small releases of sulfur dioxide which were below the reportable quantity and did not impact the community.  These incidents primarily involved process or control equipment and corrective action has been implemented.\n\nHydrite Chemical has developed and maintained an Emergency Response Plan (contingency plan) for a number of years.  This plan includes\n   7 individual assignments in case of an emergency for on-scene control of the situation, \n   7 response personnel, \n   7 appropriate response actions, \n   7 resources available at the plant for use in responding such as \n      7 chemical resistant suits, \n      7 self-contained breathing apparatus, \n      7 two way radios for communication, \n      7 gas monitors, and \n      7 repair kits for leaking cylinders and tanks.  \n\nPlanned improvements to the safety systems include:\n   7 the installation of a warning siren to notify the neighbors in the event of a release which could cause \n     health or safety problems outside the plant\n   7 a remote shut-off valve on the bulk sulfur dioxide line from the tank into the plant which will provide a \n     faster response in the event of a leak.  \n\nHydrite Chemical is strongly committed to employee and public safety and environmental responsibility and continually works to improve processes or procedure that advance our goal of zero releases."
