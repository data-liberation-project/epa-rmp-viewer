The treated water is disinfected with chlorine and effective Oct.1 2007 Sulfur Dioxide is used as a dechlorinating agent. Chlorine & Sulfur dioxide is the hazardous chemical on the facilities grounds. We store and use approximately 5 one-ton cylinder of chlorine.We store and use 4 one ton cylinders of Sulfur Dioxide.\n\nThe worst-case scenario was the release of all 5 of the one-ton cylinders. The area affected was 2.8 miles in radius. This would affect shopping malls,hospital, schools, homes, creeks, river, and a lake.  The alternative scenario was the release of 1 one-ton cylinder. This release would only effect the population in a 0.8-mile radius. This release would affect a creek, a river, and homes. Chlorine & Sulfur Dioxide gas monitors are in place to monitor for leaks. At this facility the alternative release would be a worst-case scenario. This is why we chose this release for our alternative. \n\nThe Town of Waynesville's Waste Water Treatment facility complies with all OSHA PSM rules. Also, this facility complies with all SARA title III rules. The most important practice in our prevention program is training.\n\n Also, communication among employees pertaining to hazardous situations, and the immediate steps taken by the employee to fix the hazardous situation.\n\nThe Town of Waynesville's Waste Water Treatment facility has been accident free for over Twenty Five years.
