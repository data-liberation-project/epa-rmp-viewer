LDH has installed a cryognic gas processing plant at the Chalmette Refinery, an eighty mile long 10\" pipeline from Chalmette to Geismar, LA and a fractionation plant in Geismar.  Present personnel complement is 26 for the operations and maintenance activities. \n\nThe Geismar Fractionation Facility separates pipeline liquid natural gases to produce the following pure components:\n\n1.  Ethane\n2.  Ethylene\n3.  Propane\n4.  Propylene\n5.  N-butane\n6.  Isobutane\n7.  Natural gasoline\n\nMost of the liquids are shipped to customers via pipeline.  Some products are shipped by tank trucks.  There is limited on-site storage of products in pressurized tanks.  All products are gases at atmospheric pressure and temperature.\n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Facility\n\nLDH has developed an overall safety and health policy to prevent accidental releases of flammable materials to the environment.  The policy is supported by many programs such as compliance with OSHAs 29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management regulation which includes communication of risks and hazards to the employees and contractors, the development of an employee training, certification, and retraining program with written operating procedures.  Since the facility is subject to 29 CFR 1910.119, it qualifies as a Program 3 facility under EPA's Risk Management Plan regulation 40 CFR 68.\n\nThe facility management also stresses the development and documentation of the process safety information, a management of change procedure, pre-startup safety reviews, employee participation in safety reviews and an equipment mechanical in"

Work Areas - as needed\n2.  Portable Fire Extinquishers - monthly\n3.  Pressure vessels - as specified in API\n4.  Extension cords, motorized hand tools - every three months\n5.  Yards, parking lots, roofs, etc. - annually\n\nCompliance audits are conducted every three years as required by OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 regulation.  In addition, incident investigations will be conducted immediately after any accidental release or incident occurs.  The cause of the incident will be determined and appropriate steps are taken to prevent recurrence of the event.\n\nThe facility also has an emergency action plan in the event of a release of a flammable material.  The following provide support for the plant in the event of a fire:\n\n1.  Ascension Parish LEPC\n2. Prairieville Volunteer Fire Department\n\nThe facility engineering staff also follows and adheres to guidelines set forth in American Petroleum Institute (API) standards and recommended practices.
