      "SummaryText": "In this water treatment plant, we handle chlorine, which is considered hazardous by EPA. The same properties that makes chlorine valuable as a water treatment chemical, also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling chlorine. Overall, the prevention of unnecessary human exposure, reducing the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-worker, and reducing the threat to nearby members of the community is the main goal of incorporating this risk management plan into our daily operations. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, with the safe handling procedures that we utilize, and the training of our personnel.\n\nOur emergency response program was developed with the assistance of Safety & Environmental Associates, Inc. (SEA, Inc.). The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of Conway Corporation Dispatch and/or the Systems Superintendent, then notifying the Conway Fire Department via 911, the notification of the Faulkner County Office of Emergency Services will also be by the 911 call for assistance in evacuation of surrounding population. The Conway Fire Department and Faulkner County Office of Emergency Services will help to notify and evacuate any potentially affected neighbors by utilizing vehicles with PA mounted announcing systems. This emergency response plan also includes procedures for the mitigation of a liquid chlorine release if it would ever happen. The most probable event would be a vapor chlorine release, which there are no mitigation measures for, only evacuation.\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to treat the water system by utilizing chemicals such as chlorine. Chlorine is received by individual one-ton cylinders at the #5108 Highway 319 location and stored until needed. Chlorine is fed into the water system by "

      "SummaryText": "automatic feeders. All cylinders operate on a vacuum system. This cylinder mounted vacuum regulator system will prevent the continual operation of the system if there is an increase or decrease in operating pressure on the cylinders or lines. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, and authorized contractors.\n\nThe regulated substance handled at the #5108 Highway 319 location is chlorine. The maximum amount of chlorine that can be stored at this plant is 12,000 pounds. There will only be one cylinder (2,000 pounds) on line at any one time with another on automatic switchover. The other four will be stored until needed.\n\nThis water treatment facility complies with EPA?s Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.\n\nWe have had no accidental releases of chlorine in the last five years. The automatic vacuum system limits the amount (if any) of chlorine that escapes during operational periods.\n\nOur emergency response program was developed with the assistance of SEA, Inc. We have discussed this program with the Faulkner County Office of Emergency Services, the Faulkner County 911 System, the Faulkner County Sheriff?s Office, as well as the Conway Fire Department.\n\nThe chlorine feed system at the #5108 Highway 319 facility was constructed in 1986 and is in compliance with all applicable regulations for water treatment facilities. The chlorination system with cylinder mounted vacuum regulators was installed in June 1999 to further prevent a chlorine release."
