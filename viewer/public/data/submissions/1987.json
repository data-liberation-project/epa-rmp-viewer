PHAs are periodically conducted on the chlorine process to insure process changes will not compromise safety.\n \nChlorine Operating Procedures - The Village of Wilmette maintains up-to-date, accurate, written operating and maintenance procedures for the chlorination processes. \n\nChlorine Training - The Village provides training on operations and maintenance of water plant chlorination process. This training includes the inherent process hazards and appropriate response actions for accidental chlorine releases to all personnel working on the chlorination process at the water plant. \n\nContractor Chlorine Safety -- Ensures that only contractors with good health and safety programs are selected to perform work on and around the chlorination process and that the contractors and the processes are properly prepared to safely complete the work. \n\nPre-Startup Safety Review -- A Pre-Startup Safety Review is conducted to ensure that the Water Plant is ready to safely operate any new or modified chlorine feed process. \n\nMechan"

Located at Lake & Michigan Avenues in Wilmette, the Wilmette Water Plant uses the unit processes of disinfection, coagulation, sedimentation and filtration to purify the water before distribution to its customers. \n\nFifteen full time and two part-time employees staff the water plant. The Superintendent is responsible for overall supervision of the facility, assisted by the Chief Operator (operations group), Maintenance Supervisor (maintenance group) and the Meter Repair Technician II (meter group). Under the operations group there are six Operators and a Chemist; the Maintenance group includes a Mechanic, an Electrician, a Building Maintainer and an Instrument Maintainer. The meter group is staffed with a Meter Repair Technician I and a Meter Reader. \n\nThe Village currently uses chlorine gas in the disinfection process. Water plant maintenance & operations employees accomplish handling and feeding of chlorine. Due to the size and complexity of Wilmette's chlorine feed system, the Village has prepared a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to reduce the risk of a chlorine leak and an Emergency Management Plan to mitigate a leak in the unlikely event that one occurs.\n\nThe purpose of this document is to give an overview of the water plant and it's treatment processes and present an executive summary of the Village's Risk Management Plan. \n\nVillage's Risk Management Plan\n\nIn 1996, Congress passed the USEPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) Rule, a regulation intended to prevent and minimize the impact of accidental releases of 77 listed hazardous substances.

The water plant is staffed 24 hours per day. In the event of a leak in the cylinder room, a leak detector will sound an audible alarm and send an alarm to the Operator via the SCADA control system. The Operator will immediately call the Wilmette Fire/Police Departments for assistance.\n\nThe Wilmette Fire Dept. has employees trained to mitigate emergency releases of toxic chemicals. They also have access to firefighters in neighboring communities through the Mutual Aid Box Alarm System (MABAS).

The Village of Wilmette normally stores six one ton cylinders of chlorine (max capacity is 12,000 lbs.) in the chlorine cylinder room at the water plant. \n\nIn 1998, the Village developed an RMP to minimize the risk of a chlorine leak to comply with the RMP Rule. The Village's plan includes a Hazard Assessment, a Prevention Program, an Emergency Response Program and an Executive Summary (this document). The Rule requires that the first RMP Plan be submitted to the USEPA by June 21, 1999.\n\nWater Plant Process Description\n\nWater enters the treatment process through two intake lines out in Lake Michigan. During the summertime, a small dose of chlorine is fed into the intake pipes to help control the growth of zebra mussels. After traveling under the lake bed to the roundhouse building pumping station, it is lifted about 15 feet by low lift pumps and delivered to the rapid mix chamber inside the water plant. From the rapid mix, water flows by gravity through the rest of the treatment processes.\n\nAt the rapid mix, the raw water receives chemical pretreatment. Chlorine (for disinfection), alum (for clarification), fluoride (for dental health) and activated carbon (for taste and odor control) are added to the raw water and thoroughly mixed. Only about one teaspoonful of chemicals are added for every 100 gallons of water treated.\n\nFollowing this, the pretreated water enters one of six slow mix basins where gentle mixing, or flocculation, enhances the formation of floc particles with the alum. These particles collide with and stick to suspended silt particles from the lake, causing them to settle out in the next treatment step -- sedimentation. Ninety percent of all solid material that enters the plant settles out in the four-hour trip through the settling basins.\n\nAfter sedimentation, the water enters one of"

The filtered water receives an additional dose of chlorine to maintain a disinfectant residual in the water and ortho-polyphosphate to inhibit corrosion in the distribution system piping before entering the water plant's underground clearwell/reservoirs. The entire trip through the treatment processes takes about eight hours.\n\nFrom these storage tanks, the high lift pumps deliver water under pressure to the distribution system to fill the 4.0 million-gallon (MG) standpipe, 3.0-MG reservoir/pumping station and to supply the needs of the residents of Wilmette, Glenview and portions of Prospect Heights. The Wilmette Water Plant purifies and pumps 13 million gallons per day (MGD) on an average day. Under peak pumpage conditions during hot summer days the flow may exceed 30 MGD. \n\nThe treated water that leaves the water plant meets and/or exceeds all State and Federal EPA regulations for chemicals, clarity and bacteria.\n\nChlorine Feed Process Description\n\nChlorine is used for the disinfection process at the water plant. Six one ton cylinders are stored in the chlorine cylinder room, located underground adjacent to Michigan Ave. at the Water Plant chemical unloading area. Chlorine cylinders are delivered by truck, four at a time, about once every six weeks and are lowered into the cylinder room using the chlorine elevator. Inside the cylinder room a two-ton hoist is used to move cylinders into position for hook-up.\n\nWater plant maintenance personnel accomplish the hook-up of chlorine cylinders. The hook-up process involves placing full cylinders on scales (for inventory control) and connecting them to a steel pipe manifold using chlorine whip connectors. Valves on the cylinder and on the manifold allow for isolation of each connected tank. The manifold is connected to two vacuum regulator w/check units connected in parallel.

In this room, chlorinators meter the gas flow and mix the gas with water to form a solution. (The vacuum is created when treated water is passed through the ejector.) This chlorine solution is piped to nine separate feed locations in the water plant as part of the disinfection process.\n\nThe Operators control the rate of feed (or dose) of chlorine gas by adjusting the chlorinators. Under normal operations, the feed rate is set and controlled by the Water Plant Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system located in the Water Plant control room. The chlorinators can also be adjusted manually in the feed room.\n\nChlorine Leak Scenarios\n\nThe Worst-Case leak scenario for the Village, as defined by the RMP Rule, would occur if a one ton cylinder of chlorine were to fail and empty all of it's contents within 10 minutes at the chemical unloading area adjacent to Michigan Avenue. Using the ALOHA gas dispersion model developed by the National Safety Council, the hazard zone for the worst-case scenario would extend 2.6 miles from the water plant. The extent of the gas plume would depend upon the actual humidity, air temperature and wind direction and speed. The Worst-Case scenario is possible but highly unlikely due to the conservative construction of the chlorine cylinders themselves and the infrequent deliveries Wilmette receives.\n\nThe Alternate-Case leak scenario for the Village would occur if a whip connection on a one ton cylinder of chlorine were to fail and leak 283 lbs. of chlorine into the cylinder storage room in one hour. Using the ALOHA gas dispersion model, the hazard zone for the Alternate-Case leak scenario would extend 0.29 mile from the water plant. The extent of the gas plume would depend upon the actual humidity, air temperature and wind direction and speed. If a"
