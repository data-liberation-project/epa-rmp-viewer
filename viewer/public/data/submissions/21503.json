      "SummaryText": "Coffeyville Facility Risk Management Plan: Executive Summary\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\nThe Coffeyville Facility (Facility) has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility's processes.  The Tessenderlo Kerley, Inc. (Tessenderlo Kerley) policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Tessenderlo Kerley Facility is located in Montgomery County on N. Laurel St. in Coffeyville, Kansas.  The Facility is outside of the Coffeyville city limits located next to the Farmland Refinery.\n\nThe Facility produces and distributes chemicals, which are used in agricultural and industrial applications.  Production at the Facility consists of ammonium thiosulfate, ammonium bisulfite, potassium thiosulfate,  and molten sulfur.  \n\nThese chemicals utilize several regulated and non-regulated substances as raw materials.  The covered substances used is anhydrous ammonia.  The products and raw materials require loading/unloading operations at the Facility, as well as the associated process and storage equipment\n\nThe Facility was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Based on process knowledge, Tessenderlo Kerley identified no listed flammable substances and one toxic regulated substance kept on site.  The chemicals, largest quantity on site, and associated threshold quantities are presented in Table 1.\n\nTABLE 1\nLargest Quantity of Regulated Substances\n\nRegulated Substances      Largest Quantity On Site (lbs)            Threshold Quantity (lbs)\nAmmonia (anhydrous)              14484"

Based on worst-case analysis, the distance to the endpoint exceeds the distance to public receptors.  In addition, the Facility is subject to OSHA PSM.  Therefore, the Coffeyville Facility contains a Program 3 process under the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) program.\n\nFlammable Substances\n\nThere are no regulated flammable substances at the Coffeyville Facility.\n\nToxic Substances\n\nThe endpoint for a worst-case release of a toxic substance is based on the Emergency Response Planning Guideline level 2 (ERPG-2) developed for each substance by the American Industrial Hygiene Association. The ARP Program requirement for toxics, in a worst-case scenario, assumes total quantity released in ten minutes. \n\nThe distance to the endpoint for the worst-case release of the above threshold quantity toxic substance using the EPA equations is presented in Table 2. Anhydrous ammonia has a worst-case toxic release of a 6.62-mile distance to the endpoint.\n\nTABLE 2\nDistance to Endpoint for Toxic Worst-Case Scenario\n\nChemical Name                                   Ammonia (anhydrous)\nStorage Capacity (gallons)                        25,000\nWeight (lbs)                                             144,840\nToxic Endpoint ERPG-2 (mg/L)                     0.14\nDistance to ERPG-2 (miles)                         4.13\n\n\nAlternative Releases Scenarios\n\nAlternative release scenarios are those that are more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario. Alternative release scenarios for flammable substances should have the potential to cause substantial damage, including onsite damage. Alternative release scenarios for toxic substances should be those that lead to concentrations above the endpoints beyond the facility's fenceline.  The alternative release scenarios may also represent cases"

Therefore, analysis of regulated flammable substances are not required.\n\nToxic Substances\n\nOne alternative release scenario for each toxic substance is required under the ARP program.  A hypothetical, but likely to occur, release scenario has been identified for the toxic substance above threshold quantity.\n\nThe alternative release scenario chosen by the facility was a 1/8 inch pump seal leak for a duration of 5 minutes.  The distance to the toxic endpoints for the alternative-case releases is presented in Table 3.  The alternative-case release resulted in an 0.02-mile distance to the 0.14 mg/L ERPG-2 endpoint for anhydrous ammonia.\n\nTable 3\nDistance to Endpoint for Toxic Alternative Release Scenario\n\nChemical Name                                                Ammonia (anhydrous)\nAmount Released (lbs)                                             7.9\nRelease Rate (lbs/min)                                              1.586\nToxic Endpoint ERPG-2 (mg/L)                                  0.14\nDistance to Endpoint ERPG-2 (miles)                        0.02\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Coffeyville Facility.

The facility is in the continuous process of reviewing the Accident Prevention Program and as such is in various stages of implementing changes to improve work place safety.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nActive employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the Facility's PSM program is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals.  Employee involvement will help to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are implemented.  Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues.\n\nThe Facility strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs.  These programs include, regularly scheduled safety meetings, tail-gate safety meetings, Hazard Communication, Safety Suggestion Forms, near-miss reporting, and special training programs (emergency response training, first aid, etc.). \n\nThe Coffeyville Facility actively seeks employee involvement in the development and conduct of all accident prevention activities through the appropriate existing safety programs.  Accident prevention is discussed at the regularly scheduled safety meetings and/or during special training sessions if necessary.  Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors if they have questions, comments, or suggestions.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nComplete and accurate written process safety information (PSI) concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to effective PSM and RMP programs and to completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis (PHA).

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  \n\nNumerous technical documents are to be maintained that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThere is a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  However, as situations warrant, the Facility will use other inductive techniques such as what if/checklist and failure mode and effect or the deductive fault tree technique.

This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk matrix assigned by the PHA team.  The matrix is based on severity (criticality) and probability (frequency).  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the PHA team periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The recommended order of analysis will be based upon the following criteria: \n\n\u00b7 age of process; \n\u00b7 extent of process hazards; \n\u00b7 number of affected employees; and \n\u00b7 operating history of the process.  \n\nThe results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.

To have effective operating procedures, the task and procedures directly and indirectly related to the covered process must be appropriate, clear, consistent, and most importantly, communicated to employees.  \nOperating procedures are specific instructions or details on what steps are taken or followed in carrying out the stated procedures.  The specific instructions include the applicable safety precautions and appropriate information on safety implications.\n\nTraining\n\nIn addition to training on operating procedures, there is to be a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process.  New employees are to receive basic training in process operations and procedures. In addition, all operators are periodically to receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at acceptable level.  The appropriate frequency of training is to be based on management in consultation with the employees involved in operating the particular process.  All of this training is to be documented for each operator including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n Contractors\n\nThe Coffeyville Facility uses contractors during periods of"

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, there are procedures in place to ensure that contractors do as follows:\n\n\u00b7 perform their work in a safe manner;  \n\u00b7 have appropriate knowledge and skills;\n\u00b7 are aware of the hazards of their workplace;\n\u00b7 understand what they should do in the event of an emergency;\n\u00b7 understand and follow site specific safety rules; and\n\u00b7 inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.\n\nThis is to be accomplished by providing contractors with an orientation session that covers the following:\n\n\u00b7 a process overview; \n\u00b7 information about safety and health hazards including known or potential fire, explosion, or toxic release hazards;\n\u00b7 emergency response plan requirements; and\n\u00b7 safe work practices must be developed and implemented regarding control of entrance, presence and exit of contract personnel prior to beginning their work. \n\nIn addition, contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor are to be evaluated. Contract employee injury and illness log should be maintained.  Plant personnel are to periodically monitor contract performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\nA PSSR should be conducted on any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment and highly hazardous chemicals into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specification and that all-supporting systems are operationally ready.\n\nThe PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly imple"

A PSSR verifies that a PHA was conducted, recommendations resolved, and training of employees involved in the process has been completed prior to start-up.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nWell established practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment should be maintained.  The basic aspects of this program are to include:\n\n\u00b7 training; \n\u00b7 developing written procedures; \n\u00b7 performing inspections and tests consistent with good engineering practices; \n\u00b7  correcting equipment deficiencies outside acceptable PSI limits; and, \n\u00b7 applying quality assurance measures.  \n\nIn combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on \n\n\u00b7 an overview of the process; \n\u00b7 safety and health hazards;\n\u00b7 applicable maintenance procedures;\n\u00b7 emergency response plans; and\n\u00b7 applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.\n\nAnother integral part of mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. Quality assurance measures are to be incorporated into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nDuring construction of new processes all equipment to be installed is to be determined to be suitable for the process application.  Checks and inspections are to be performed to assure that installation is consistent with design specifications and manufacturer's instructions suitable for the particular application.  The Facility has long standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include the following:  \n\n\u00b7 control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel;\n\u00b7 a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for eq"

This system requires that changes to items such as process chemicals, process equipment, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, impact to safety and health and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Prior to changes being made, they are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition operating and maintenance personnel, including contractors employees, are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe facility promptly investigates (within 48 hours) all incidents that resulted in or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation will be to gather the facts, determine the root cause, and develop corrective action to prevent the reoccurrence of the incident or a similar incident.
