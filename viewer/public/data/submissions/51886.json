      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN (CalARP)\n\nPilkington NA, Inc.\nSulfur Dioxide System\n\nJune 2008\n\nExecutive Summary\n1.    The Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nPilkington North America (PNA) has incorporated many safety features in the chlorine and sulfur dioxide system to prevent system failures and to mitigate potential releases. PNA considers three primary hazards for sulfur dioxide and chlorine storage and use in plant operations. The primary concerns are over-pressurization, physical damage to the sulfur dioxide and chlorine containers, and damage/deterioration to associated piping and tubing. Locating the sulfur dioxide and chlorine containers in protected covered areas helps to mitigate the potential for over-pressurization that may be caused by exposure to direct sunlight.\n\nThe sulfur dioxide and chlorine containers are protected from vehicle traffic by barriers and by their location. The potential for a significant release at the injection systems due to damage to connected tubing and piping is greatly minimized by the use of vacuum regulators at the cylinders. Additionally, flexible tubing used in the systems is replaced on a regular basis.\n\nIn additions to the physical features of the sulfur dioxide and chlorine injection systems at the facility, PNA has extensive administrative controls in place to maintain safe operation of the system. Administrative controls include, but are not limited to, formal training programs for system operators and auditing and inspection program. Written standard operating procedures (SOPs) have been prepared for the sulfur dioxide and chlorine systems. The SOPs provide a basis for site specific operator training and a ready reference for operating and trouble-shooting the systems.\n\n2.    Your facility and the regulated substances handled:\n\nPNA, 500 East Louise Avenue in Lathrop, California, is located in an area zoned for commercial and industrial use. The facility is near Interstate 5, which runs north-south throu"

      "SummaryText": "gh Lathrop. PNA manufactures various glass products at the plant.\n\nThere is one sulfur dioxide process at PNA. Sulfur dioxide is used in the manufacture of float glass at the facility. A central control room system monitors the system. The desired flow of sulfur dioxide is controlled with manually and electrically operated valves. The largest sulfur dioxide vessel at the plant has a capacity of approximately 2,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide.\n\nThe sulfur dioxide injection system consists of a pressurized container of liquid and gaseous sulfur dioxide. Injectors provide a sulfur dioxide/air mixture for use in the manufacturing of glass products. A regulator is connected to the sulfur dioxide containers, and a high-pressure hose connects the regulator to a metering system and process equipment. A metering system controls the volume of sulfur dioxide that is injected.\n\nThere are five independent chlorine processes at PNA. Gaseous chlorine is used for wastewater treatment and controlling cooling tower water quality. Gaseous chlorine is injected into various water streams at the plant to maintain chlorine concentrations in water as required to maintain control parameters. Gaseous chlorine is injected into float bath to clean the bath atmosphere to help improve glass quality. Chlorine containers are stored at four locations outside the plant prior to being deployed at the injection system locations. Chlorine containers are located at each of two cooling tower locations and at the wastewater treatment area.\n\nEach chlorine injection system consists of a pressurized container of liquid and gaseous chlorine. A vacuum regulator attached to the container allows gaseous chlorine to pass into the injection system when it senses vacuum. Vacuum is created in the system when water flows past the injection point. A metering system controls the volume of chlorine that is injected. The maximum amount of chlorine in a cylinder container is 150 pounds.\n\n3.    The Worst-case release Scenario an"

      "SummaryText": "d the Alternative Release Scenario including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances:\n\nThe worst-case sulfur dioxide release was the entire contents of the largest vessel (2000 lbs.) released in 10 min. resulting from a total failure of the container. The release scenario was projected in a stability class F with a distance to the endpoint being 0.9 miles. The estimated population of 5996 in the vulnerability area would include schools, residences, hospitals and major commercial, office and industrial areas. Administrative controls and mitigation measures were not considered to limit the distance to the endpoint.\n\nThe alternate sulfur dioxide release was a tube leak failure releasing 600 pounds in 30 minutes. The predicted distance to the toxic endpoint for the alternative release scenario is approximately 0.1 mile. The estimated population within the alternative release scenario radius of approximately 0.1 miles is approximately 100.\n\nThe alternate chlorine release was a tube leak failure releasing 45 pounds in 30 minutes. The predicted distance to the toxic endpoint for the alternative release scenario is approximately 0.1 mile. The estimated population within the alternative release scenario radius of approximately 0.1 miles is approximately 100.\n\n4.    General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nPNA performs classroom training, competence testing to enhance employee?s understanding of the importance of handling the chemicals safely and improve employee?s chemical handling skills.\n\n5.    The Five -Year Accident History:\n\nThere have not been any accidents at the facility involving this process that has resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site or offsite in the last 5 years.\n\n6.
