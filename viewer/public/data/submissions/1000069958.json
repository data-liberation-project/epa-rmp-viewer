The plant's raw materials are used to create high purity chemicals for the semiconductor industry. Chemicals purified/packaged at the site include: High purity Ammonium Hydroxide, Isopropyl Alcohol, Hydrogen Peroxide, Hydrochloric Acid and Sulfuric Acid.\n\n\n\nThe materials used by the facility, which are on the RMP Rules List of regulated substances, are Ammonia (Anhydrous) and 29% Ammonia Solution (Site nomenclature - Ammonium Hydroxide 29%). The HEC plant's storage and use of Ammonia (Anhydrous) and 29% Ammonia Solution exceed the specified threshold of 10,000 lbs, as defined by the EPA's RMP Rule. In accordance with the requirements of the RMP Rule, a description of the following six elements is provided for the HEC plant:\n\n\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies: It is the policy of the HEC plant to operate\n\na safe and environmentally sound facility by identifying and controlling health, safety, or environmental risks\n\nrelated to its operations; by designing its processes to protect people, property and the environment; by\n\nconducting and continually reviewing and improving programs for safety, health and environmental\n\nexcellence; and by establishing processes to assure that all laws and regulations applicable to its operations\n\nand products are known and observed. The accidental release prevention and emergency response policy\n\nassociated specifically with the plant's use of Ammonia (Anhydrous) and 29% Ammonia Solution, involves the integration of safety devices and technologies inherent in the design of the process, safe operational procedures and management practices, operator training, the preparation and testing of site emergency response plans, the maintenance of onsite emergency response equipment and a professionally trained Emergency Management Team, coordinating"

Regulated\n\nRMP substances handled include Ammonia (Anhydrous) and 29% Ammonia Solution. \n\n\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps: HEC operates\n\nits process utilizing OSHA PSM Programs in conjunction with RMP Programs. These programs provide\n\nelements preventing and mitigating accidental releases of regulated substances to the air and minimize the\n\nconsequences of such releases if they do occur by emphasizing preventative measures for those chemicals, which are believed to pose the greatest risk. HEC's programs focus on accident prevention efforts primarily at the local level, where the risk is found, with the goal of government and the public working with industry to reduce risk. Among the provisions of section 112(r) included in HEC's programs are the identification of hazards within a facility, which could result in a release, the design, and maintenance of a safe facility, and the development of response actions to be taken in the event of a release. Sources subject to section 112(r) requirements must submit, a risk management plan (RMP) which includes an offsite consequence analysis, a five-year accident history and a compliance certification.\n\n\n\n4. The Five Year Accident History: There have been no releases of the RMP regulated hazardous chemicals since facility operations began in 1998.\n\n\n\n5. The Emergency Response Plan: An Emergency Response/contingency plan has been developed to provide a\n\nformal emergency preparedness program that protects human health and property for both the employees\n\nand surrounding community in the event of an emergency such as: Fire; Explosion; Release of Highly Hazardous Chemica"
