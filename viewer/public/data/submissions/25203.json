If an emergency should happen, we would notify the Vinton Fire Department to respond to the empergency.\nThis facility is farm cooperative.  We offer fertilizer, chemicals, feed, seed, fuel, and grain storage to the farm community in north Benton county.  Anhydrous Ammonia is one of the fertilizers we offer to our growers.  We have a 30,000 gallon storage tank with twenty-two 1,000 gallon nurse tanks and valves, pipes, and hoses to go with them.\nThe worst case scenario is failure of our 30,000 gallon storage tank when filled to capacity, resulting in vapor explosion.  The distance to the end point is 4.4 miles.  There are department stores, office buildings, schools, and private homes within this distance.  The population within this end point is about 5,000 people.\nThe Anhydrous Ammonia system is maintained in accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38 and state law.  Our facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and state and local regulations.\nIn the past five years, we have never had an accident involving Anhydrous Ammonia that caused death, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, or evacuations.\nIn the event of an emergency involving our Anhyrous Ammonia tank it is our policy to notify the Vinton Fire Department.  We have discussed this policy with our fire department.  Our fire department inspects our facility once a year.\nWe have installed cement barriers around the outside of storage tank and posts filled with cement next to exposed valves. We have locks on the main storage tank and a light that comes on at dusk and goes off at dawn. We also have incorporated the use of valve locks on all nurse tanks with the help of our local sheriff's department. \nAn Alternative Scenario would be if a hose were to break, we have emergency shutoff valves on both ends of the hose.
