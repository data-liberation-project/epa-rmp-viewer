      "SummaryText": "To comply with Federal Chemical Accident Prevention Regulation (40 CFR Part 68) and California Accident Release Prevention Program (CalARP, CCR Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5), Trinity Consultants Inc.(Trinity), under contract with Hexion Specialty Chemicals, Inc. (Hexion), prepared this Risk Management Plan (RMP) document for its facility located at 2801 Lynwood Road in Lynwood, California. The RMP for a covered process at the Lynwood facility was previously submitted by Eastman Chemical Company (previous owner) in 2004.  The regulated substance, Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI), was subsequently phased out of the facility in 2006.  The formal letter requesting for de-registration was submitted on April 24, 2007.  This RMP is prepared due to the proposed reinstatement of the TDI application at the facility and the related changes for the covered process involving storage tank No. 35.\n\nThe Lynwood facility manufactures resins for use as plastics and coatings. The production process involves combining of batches of various feedstocks to prescribed proportions in a reaction vessel, and also blending the generic resin product with additives like colorants, curing modifiers, thinners, etc. to meet the customer and product specifications. The production process that involves the use of TDI is for the production of Urethane Acrylate (UA) resin for plastics and coatings. In this process, TDI is used as a cross-linking agent (which is applied in closely-controlled quantities) to produce the desired mechanical properties (hardness, flexibility, strength etc.) in the cured product. The maximum amount of TDI stored at the facility is 56,000 lbs.  \n\nBased on the data collected and federal RMP and CalARP guidelines, the facility is subject to Program level 1 requirements because the offsite consequence analysis that was performed by Trinity indicated no offsite impact from the TDI process.  Additionally, there has been no accident with offsite consequences within the last five year"

      "SummaryText": "s. \n\nTo improve the safety at the facility, Hexion has developed a written emergency action plan that is available for view at the facility.  The plan has been coordinated with the primary local emergency responder- Los Angeles County Fire Department.  Hexion has conducted TDI safety training periodically to the employees who are involved in the TDI process.  Currently, Hexion is evaluating the installation of a TDI detecting sensor as an additional safety measure."
