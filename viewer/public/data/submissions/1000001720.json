The majority of the chemicals are non-hazardous.  Of the hazardous chemicals only one qualifies for the RMP A?Worst Case ScenarioA?, chlorine.  The plan has been reviewed and updated in 2004.  The risks imposed with our process is minimal.\n\nSlack Chemicals \"Worst Case Scenatio A? Emergency Response Plan\" is not for a stationary source but because of the quantity of chlorine handled and on hand it falls under the RMP as a process.  The chlorine is in ton and 150# cylinders (150# cylinders is the alternate release scenario) and are located in warehouse 'E'. At any one time there could be 24,000+ pounds of chlorine on hand.  Slack Chemical does not use the chlorine but houses/stores it to ship to customers who use it in their processes.  Worse case scenario plans are located at the entrance door to warehouse 'E', the receptionist desk, and the Director of Regulatory Compliance office.  The Company policies, plans and responses are explained in the \"Worst Case Scenario\" plan."
