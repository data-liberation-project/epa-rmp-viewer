CF will employ multiple closed-loop ammonia refrigeration processes each of which is under the Risk Management rule threshold and are separated by distance.  CF is participating in the RMP Program regardless, due to its commitment to the safety of the facility, community and environment.  This Risk Management Plan will consider refrigeration operations as one closed loop process according to co-location, although separate processes will be brought online separately over a period of time.\n\n\n\n1    EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\n1.1  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe Cool Fresh LLC (CF) Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies are simply not to have accidental releases or emergencies.  The Company endeavors to execute this policy through the daily implementation of its Safety Programs, which includes both the EPA Risk Management Program and OSHA's Process Safety Management Programs.  CF has developed their RMP / PSM Manual to document policies addressing the implementation of the regulations governing these programs.  The Process Safety Management (PSM) sections pertain to the prevention of accidental releases and include the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), procedures for operating, training, maintenance, emergency response, and others.  The RMP sections pertain to management systems, accident history and include the Hazard Assessment (Offsite Consequence Analysis-OCA) Report.  Nuances between the RMP & PSM Programs have been integrated according to Guidance documents published by USEPA.  \n\n\n\nThe PSM Program is an integrated approach to the safe operation of processes using Regulated Substances, and forms the Program Level 3 Prevention Program component of the RMP.  The PSM Program is specifically designed and intended to prevent accidental releases, and to deal safely with emergencies if and when they do happen.  It is the prima"

With this in mind, the priorities of protection of life, the environment, and then property have been established.  Only when these goals are achieved may the focus shift to resumption of business operations.\n\n\n\nCF has adopted an overall \"Non-responding facility\" policy; has established an Emergency Action Plan and is taking the steps necessary to be included in the community emergency plan.  An Emergency Coordinator has been established and coordination with the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC), Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and Fire Department will be performed on an ongoing basis.  Emergency response pre-planning is coordinated and kept current through the annual submittal of appropriate Reports, and periodic tours of the facility by the Fire Department.  CF and affiliated Western Precooling Systems (WPS) support the Yuma Area Ammonia Safety Day, which has also been instrumental in coordination with local emergency responders.  As a new facility permitted by the City of Yuma, the Fire Department has been involved in the development of the facility and its fire & life safety systems. \n\n\n\nCF & WPS policy includes maintaining appropriate emergency capabilities and to deal with emergencies safely if and when they do happen.  CF Personnel are trained per its Emergency Action Plan.  Key WPS employees attend 1910.120 (q) Emergency Response training that is refreshed annually.  WPS emergency equipment is maintained under the control of WPS.  CF emergency equipment is maintained under the control of CF.  \n\n\n\nEach company strives to execute its emergency response policies through skilled employees that are provided with adequate and appropriate equipment and training (CF employees and contracted production workers are trained for their emergency actions.

      "SummaryText": " Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Cool Fresh LLC facility is in a commercial/light industrial area, in an industrial area of Yuma, located at 4193 South Avenue 3 ? E just east of the Marine Corp Air Station. It is immediately surrounded by other cooling facilities and local farms. The overall site occupies 10 acres; with a total building space of 44,880 square feet which includes 39,800 square feet dedicated to cold storage & 2,200 square feet for pressure pre-cooling. This facility is designed for seasonal fresh produce vacuum cooling, pressure pre-cooling, short-term temperature-controlled storage and shipping, and utilizes a portable high-side compressing / condensing trailer to support the Cooler.  Several independent, portable closed-loop vacuum cooling plants will also be utilized which is a configuration common to the industry. The primary commodities handled will include leafy greens. The stationary portions of the facility are new and slated to begin operation in late October of 2018; the facility is permitted by the City of Yuma.  Fire and life safety systems are engineered directly into the Plant as part of its design and building permit code compliance requirements.  Land, buildings and stationary equipment are owned by WPS.  Cool Fresh LLC is the operating entity and is owned WPS 50% and Gary Anthony 50%.  Portable equipment is either owned in partnerships and leased to Cool Fresh; or leased from WPS.  WPS is a regional, well-known & reputable supplier of portable refrigerating equipment.  \n\n\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is the refrigerant utilized in the systems described above, which consists of the stationary facility and portable high-side compressing/condensing trailer, plus the portable closed-loop vacuum cooling plants which are independent from the Cooler.   Most of the ammonia equipment is located outside (Compressors, Vessels, Condensers).  Cold Room evaporators are located inside refrigerated space; however, their as"

The portable ammonia-handling equipment is moved on and off site seasonally as needed for the local produce season, which is common in the industry. The portable equipment is designed for this service.  The busy season is from late November through mid-April annually.\n\n\n\n1.3  General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nA comprehensive Process Safety Management (PSM) Program has been established in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.119.  The PSM Program is specifically intended to prevent accidental releases & promote the safe operation of ammonia-handling equipment and processes.  PSM is an integral part of daily Plant operation.  The written PSM document is maintained in the site's online RMP/PSM Management solution called WBBM (Web-based Business Manager).\n\n\n\nMonitoring and maintenance of the refrigeration equipment is a coordinated effort. CF personnel are responsible for day-to-day monitoring and operational maintenance.  WPS is the company that performs technical inspections & maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration equipment.  WPS has developed comprehensive written procedures for the operation and maintenance of ammonia-handling equipment, including the steps to be taken in the event of a release or threatened release.  The written procedures include necessary safety precautions for Plant operation, from installation and start-up to daily operation, to tear down and removal of portable equipment.  As equipment maintenance needs are determined, the need is expressed at the workload meetings conducted by the WPS Area Manager.  The specific repair task or upgrade for the expressed need is decided by the WPS Area Manager and entered into the work order system. Tasks are tracked through the work order system.  Through this regular routine of inspect, discuss, assign and confirmation of completion, CF and WPS have reduced equipment op"

Technicians only perform tasks for which they have been pre-qualified.\n\n\n\n Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nOver the years it became apparent in the industry that a mishap while draining oil from the system is one of the most common incidents to occur.  Special self-closing valves are now installed as a permissive for oil drain flow.  If a release were to develop during an oil-draining task, the mechanic simply releases the handle of the self-closing valve and flow is terminated.  The facility has installed these types of valves at system oil drain points.\n\n\n\nOther release prevention steps taken at Cool Fresh, LLC:\n\n\n\n?    Automatic Cutouts and Isolation Valves: Pressure and temperature controls are installed in accordance with appropriate standards. Refrigerating equipment includes automated cut-outs and isolation valves. The cut-outs are designed to shut down equipment prior to out-of-tolerance conditions being met. Isolation valves would help limit the impact of a release scenario.\n\n?    Monitoring & Alarm System: refrigerated building space is equipped with ammonia sensors and a monitored alarm system.\n\n?    Ammonia Diffusion System: Stationary system Pressure Relief Valves (PRV) are piped to an ammonia-water diffusion system.  If a PRV were to operate due to an over-pressure situation, the ammonia would be captured in the water tank.\n\n?    Fencing & gates around the facility help prevent unauthorized entry; \n\n?    Entrance to the facility is closely monitored and limited.   \n\n?    Refrigerating equipment is protected via barriers and equipment placement (siting) practices\n\n?
