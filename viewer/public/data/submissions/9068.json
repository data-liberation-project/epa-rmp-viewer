We deal in agricultural commodities and inputs including anhydrous ammonia.  Dahlen Farmers Elevator & Oil has extensive safety, maintenance, and inspection programs in place.  It is our intention to handle this substance in a safe manner and we are constantly on the lookout for methods and equipment that can improve our process.  Any equipment or procedure improvements are implemented as soon as they become available.\n\nDahlen Farmers Elevator & Oil has never had an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  In the unlikely event of an accidental release, we have planned for and have coordinated with local emergency responders to adequetely respond to any accidental release that we forsee could happen at our facility, from a simple hose break to the release of the entire contents of our largest storage tank.\n\nDahlen Farmers Elevator & Oil Co. wants to insure the public that the use of anhydrous ammonia is safe.  All of our equipment meets or exceeds North Dakota safety standards and has been inspected within the past two years.  Our company annually spends a great deal of time, money, and resources to insure that this substance is handled legally and safely."
