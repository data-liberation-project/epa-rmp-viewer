Directors, Management, and employees have a strong commitment to providing a safe and healthful workplace and business for all employees, customers, owners, and to the community.  These policies are provided and explained to each employee prior to an initial assignment.  The policies are reviewed periodically and revised and updated as necessary to reflect changes in policy, facilities, processes, regulations, safety requirements, or as new information becomes available.\n\nThe Company is committed to the prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia and other hazardous chemicals.  In the event that an accidental release does occur, the company is prepared to work with the local fire department and/or designated contractors and local authorities to mitigate the release and minimize the impact of the release on the facilities, personnel, and to the community and environment.\n\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity of Farmers Elevator & Supply Co. is the purchase, receipt, storage, and sale of grains and beans.  Secondary activities include the storage, sale and application of some farm inputs and supplies, which include: feed, seed, fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides, equipment, and other farm supplies.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received by transport truck, unloaded into a storage tank, then distributed seasonally to farm wagons for sale and delivery to local farmers, where it is used as fertilizer to crops such as wheat, corn, and milo.\n\nThe maximum quantity stored at Farmers Elevator & Supply Company's Fertilizer facility is 217,562 lbs. in a 30,000 gal. capacity storage tank and 15, 1000 gal. (850 gals. net each) nurse tanks.  The maximum quantity handled at any one time would be the unloading of a transport truck holding 50,000 lbs. to a storage tank.\n\n\n3.  Worst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios\n\n(a)  The worst case release scenario"

      "FacilityID": 23584,
      "SummaryText": "would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank within a 10 minute time period.  The maximum quantity released would be 145,041 lbs., which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85% capacity, which is limited by regulation due to the expansion of anhydrous ammonia from changes in ambient temperatures.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion under an atmospheric stability class F in rural environment has been determined to be 7.1 miles.\n\n(b)  The alternative release scenario based on reports of industry incidents, is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The quantity released would be 1,883 lbs. and the distance to the endpoint for a 1 minute release under an atmospheric stability class D in a rural environment has been determined to be 0.82 miles.\n\n\n4.  The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K661.1-1989 published by the American National Standards Institute and OSHA standards published in 29CFR 1910.111 \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n\n5.  Five Year History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past 5 years that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; or to our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n6.  Emergency Response Program\n\nFarmers Elevator & Supply Co. will not respond to a release and does not have an emergency response plan, but has coordinated with the local LEPC.\n\nFarmers Elevator & Supply Co. has:\n(a) a written Emergency Action Plan in accordance wiht the OSHA standard 29CFR 1910.38 which includes plans for evacuation.\n\n(b) provided state and local authorities with emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III.\n\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nIn accordance with Farmers"
