Founded in 1924, VW&R supplies the food industry, chemical compounders, pharmaceuticals, mining, forest products, oil and gas producers, electronics, coatings and many other key industries with the chemical raw materials required to produce or refine products used in numerous end-use markets.\n\nVan Waters & Rogers Inc. is a member of the National Association of Chemical distributors (NACD) and complies with the Responsible Distribution Process (RDP), an environmental, health and safety improvement initiative.\n\nSome of the products stored and handled by VW&R are subject to EPA's Risk Management Program rule (40 CFR Part 68).  A key requirement of this rule is the preparation and submission of an RMP Plan, contained herein.  The contents of the RMP Plan are prescribed by EPA, including this Executive Summary.\n\nCORPORATE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE APPROACH\n\n1. Prevention Program\n\nThe processe that is regulated under EPA's RMP rule is subject under Program 2 Prevention program.  Van Waters & Rogers Inc. has documented the Prevention Program in its Process Safety Management Manual.  Briefly, this program includes provisions and requirements for:\n\n* Safety  Information\n* Hazard Review\n* Operating Procedures\n* Training\n* Maintenance\n* Compliance Audits\n* Incident Investigation\n\n2. Emergency Response Approach\n\nVan Waters & Rogers Inc. has an Emergency Contingency Plan in place.  This Plan is shared with local emergency responders who have access to VW&R facility personnel (and up-to-date phone numbers).  VW&R responds to minor incidents but will call in professional emergency responders in the event of all other incidents.\n\nVW&R invites and encourages local emergency responders such as the fire department to visit and familiarize themselves with VW&R pr"

We have one regulated substances present at our facility.  This substance is  Ammonia Aqueous 30%.\nListed below are the way the two RMP regulated substances are stored/handled on site and the maximum inventories present at any one time.\n\n1. Ammonia Aqueous 30% is repackaged into 55 gal and 330 gal containers and moved into storage for distribution to our end use customers. The estimated maximum inventory of Ammonia Aqueous 30% onsite at any one time will be 31,740 lbs.\n\n\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO & ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n(including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.)\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the \nLook-up, tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2  substance as a class involves a catastrophic release from the RMP substances in inventory onsite. The RMP liquid is assumed to be immediately released to form a pool of 1 cm height, from which evaporation takes place. The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated over 10 minutes. By using Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed. Listed below are the maximum distances in miles and the corresponding toxic endpoint of mg/L for the individual RMP substance inventoried onsite using the above conditions. For each Alternate Release Scenario onsite Emergency Response Personnel and Equipment were considered for active mitigation. RMP COMP software was used for modeling purposes.\n\n1.

This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nSafety Information\n\nVan Waters & Rogers Inc maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nHazard Review\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the \"What-If\" technique. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Van Waters & Rogers Inc maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\n\nVan Waters & Rogers Inc has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes."

Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others;  storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nVan Waters & Rogers Inc conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nVan Waters & Rogers Inc promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nContractors\n\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Van Waters & Rogers Inc has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.
