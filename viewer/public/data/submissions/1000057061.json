ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY POLICIES\n\n\n\nCayuga Operating Company recognizes management's responsibility in protecting its employees, equipment, property, and the environment against the hazards of an unintentional ammonia release. The safety and health of all employees and the public is very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the facility.  The Cayuga Operating Company PSM/RMP program assigns and documents the specific responsibilities for developing, implementing and integrating the OSHA PSM and the EPA RMP standards into its safety program.  The Cayuga Operating Company PSM/RMP program focuses attention on \"Making PSM/RMP the way we manage\" our ammonia based process rather than a project we expect to complete and put on the shelf when the filing date has passed.\n\nCayuga Operating Company believes that Employee Participation is the key to a successful program.  Operating level employees, particularly the Operators and Maintenance personnel, will be deeply involved in the PSM/RMP program development, implementation and integration and they will assume a major responsibility for operating the ammonia process safely.  The Cayuga Operating Company Emergency Response Program has been developed with the complete cooperation and support of the Lansing Volunteer Fire Department.  All Cayuga Operating Company employees have received documented emergency action training.\n\n\n\nII.  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nCayuga Operating Company operates a Fossil Fuel Power Generating Station.  Ammonia is used to control NOx emissions in their stack gas.   Anhydrous Ammonia is the only Hazardous Material on site in amounts above the threshold quantity.\n\n\n\nIII.  SUMMARY OF WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n\n\nWorst case scenario and alternative case scenario data can be viewed onsite by request.\n\n  \n\nIV.

Facility tours and risk management discussions are scheduled and conducted upon written request.\n\n\n\nV.  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENTAL RELEASE HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no releases of ammonia that resulted in an injury, or that had an off-site impact, or that resulted in significant property damage either on-site or off-site.\n\n\n\nVI. Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nFacility employees have been trained to act in the event of an accidental ammonia release.  The site emergency plan has been coordinated with the community emergency plan under the jurisdiction of the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) and the Lansing Volunteer Fire Department.\n\n\n\nVII.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nCayuga Operating Company recognizes that (even though their Ammonia release and injury experience has been excellent) their PSM/RMP program will provide much needed improvement to their safety effort. The PSM/RMP program is considered to be a set of \"living\" documents and procedures that will require constant attention, development, and revision before \"Safety\" becomes second nature.\n\nCayuga Operating Company expects to improve safety performance by emphasizing all of the elements of their P"
