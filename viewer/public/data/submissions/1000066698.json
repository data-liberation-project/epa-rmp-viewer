      "SummaryText": "Facility Description\n\nThe AmeriGas John Young Parkway Terminal located in the northwestern part of the city of Orlando, Orange County, Florida. This terminal is propane storage and distribution facility. The facility includes six (6) above-ground storage tanks with 30,000 gallon capacity each. It also has two Compressors and two Liquid Pumps.  The terminal has a siding with two (2) rail towers designed to hook to rail cars and unload product to storage tanks using a system of Compressors with vapor from the Storage Tanks. The facility also has two trucks load stations and one transport load station.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release and Emergency Response Policy\n\nThe same properties that make propane valuable as a fuel also make it necessary to practice certain safety precautions in handling it to prevent leaks, spills and accidents. First and foremost, in our operations, efforts are undertaken to ensure employee and contractor safety while on site as well as to minimize the risk of exposure to the surrounding communities. It is our company policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations. The Facility has Logistics Managers, a Terminal Operations Supervisor who are able to immediately respond to a serious incident and provide technical expertise to emergency response agencies as needed at the scene of the incident. AmeriGas also maintains an around the clock Emergency Communications Center (ECC), which handles all after-hours and emergency calls from around the country. The ECC has the ability to contact AmeriGas field personnel, as well as Chemtrec, on any type of incident encountered at any AmeriGas location or by AmeriGas customers.\n\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nWorst Case Scenario \n\nThe worst case scenario that was considered was catastrophic release of propane from a 30, 000 Gallons Tank. Using EPA RMP Comp, the calculated worst case distance to 1 psi overpressure end point for vapor cloud explosion is 0.4 miles.\n\n\n\nAlternative "

      "SummaryText": "Release Scenario\n\nFor alternative release scenario, release from transfer hoses at the facility was considered. The active mitigation devices were assumed to work as designed, limiting the release to the contents of the hose. Using equation from Appendix C1 (EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis), the calculated distance to 1 psi overpressure end point for vapor cloud explosion is 0.02 miles.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nThe facility maintains an Emergency Action Plan (EAP). The plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire, law enforcement and medical organizations. \n\nNotification of potentially affected neighbors would be coordinated through the fire department or law enforcement after consultation with site personnel. If an actual incident occurs, the plan gives guidance to employees on how to respond if it is a minor problem and easily controlled on site. Larger emergencies require assistance from the local emergency response organizations and employees are knowledgeable as to when that outside assistance is required. \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe facility has no plans at the present time to make any changes.\n\n"
