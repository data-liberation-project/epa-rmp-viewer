DESCRIPTION OF THE AMERIFREEZE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n     Amerifreeze has established a service contract with  Allegheny County Emergency Management which includes an annual employee training and response exercise  to practice, train and update the Amerifreeze Emergency Response Program.\n\n    Amerifreeze conducts an annual PSM/RMP implementation progress audit of the entire PSM/RMP prograr to identify strengths and weaknesses and make improvements.  Amerifreeze considers the PSM/RMP manuals to be active documents that must be updated and revised regularly to maintain their viability.\n\n     Amerifreeze emphasizes and insists on  employee participation from the contracted refrigeration system operators in all aspects of the developent, implementation, and integration of their PSM/RMP program.\n\n     Amerifreeze maintains a pro-active open-door policy toward neighbors and concerned community citizens."

FIVE YEAR ACCIDENTAL RELEASE HISTORY\n\n     There have been no releases of ammonia that resulted in an injury, or that had an off-site impact, or that resulted in significant property damage either on-site or off-site since operations began at Amerfireeze.\n\nVI.  Emergency Response Program\n\n     Contracted facility employees have been trained to respond defensively to an accidental ammonia release.  The site emergency plan has been coordinated with the community emergency plan under the jurisdiction of the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) and the Local Emergency Response Unitt.\n\nVII.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n     Amerifreeze recognizes that (even though their Ammonia release and injury experience has been excellent) their PSM/RMP program will provide much needed improvement to their safety effort. The PSM/RMP program is considered to be a set of active documents and procedures that will require constant attention, development, and revision before Safety becomes becomes second nature.\n\n     Amerifreeze expects to improve safety performance by emphasizing  the following elements of their PSM/RMP Program\n\n          (1)   Employee Participation is the Key to a successful program. The Refrigeration Contractors have been deeply involved in Verifying the P&ID's, Developing and updating the Standard Operating Procedures, and performing the documented Preventive Maintenance Inspections.\n\n          (2)    The Amerifreeze Cold Storage Co.will complete the Integration of the following features into their RMP Program: (a) includes one-on-one involvement with specified and qualified trainers,  (b) written to minimize redundancies in paperwork and maximize documentation, and   (c) written to be understood and used by the Refrigeration System Operators. \n\n          (3)   All recommendations developed during the PHA were designed to improve the safety performance of the"

The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the facility.\n\n     The Amerifreeze RMP program assigns and documents the specific responsibilities for developing, implementing and  integrating the  EPA RMP standards into its safety program.  The Amerifreeze RMP program focuses attention on managing risks as an integral part and key to the way we manage our ammonia based refrigeration system rather than a project we expect to complete and put on the shelf when the filing date has passed.\n\n     Amerifreeze Cold Storage believes that Employee participation is the key to a successful program.  Operating level employees, particularly the Ammonia Refrigeration Contractors and the Contracted Refrigeration System Operators, have been deeplly involved and they assume the major responsibility for operating the Amerifreeze facility safely.\n\n     The Amerifreeze Emergency Response Program is being developed with complete cooperation and support from the Allegheny County Emergency Management Team.  All Ammonia Refrigeration System Operators have received documented emergency response training.\n\n\nII.  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n     Amerifreeze Cold Storage is a Public Refrigerated Warehouse.\n     The refrigeration system contains no more than 14,000 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia. \n      Anhydrous Ammonia is the only Hazardous Material on site in quantities above the threshold quantity.\n\n\nIII.  SUMMARY OF WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n     The WORST CASE release scenario involves the complete rupture of the High Pressure Receive.\n     A maximum of 14000 pounds of ammonia over a 10 minute period was considered.\n     Under worst case weat"
