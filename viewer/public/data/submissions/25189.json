FACILITY POLICY\n\nTHE OWNER, MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES OF GENEVA ELEVATOR CO. ARE COMMITTED TO THE PREVENTION OF ANY ADCIDENTAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.  IF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE FRANKLIN COUNTY EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY, LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT AND OTHER AUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACTS OF THE RELEASE TO THE PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT.\n\n2. FACILITY INFORMATION\n\nTHE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THE FACILITY IS THE RESALE OF FERTILIZER TO AREA FARMERS.  ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECEIVED AND STORED AND DISTRIBUTED FOR DIRECT APPLICATION AS A NUTRIENT FOR CROP PRODUCTION.  THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY STORED WOULD BE 160,000 POUNDS IN THE STORAGE TANK AND NURSE TANKS.\n\n3. WORST-CASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nA. THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF THE STORAGE TANK RELEASED AS GAS OVER A PERIOD OF 10 MINUTES.  THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 53,000 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE LARGEST STORAGE TANK AT 85 PERCENT CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS AND ADMINISTRATION CONTROLS.  THE DISTANCE TO THE END POINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PARTS PER MILLION, OR PPM) IS .75 MILES.\n\nB. THE ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO, IS A RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A 1-INCH TRANSFER HOSE FOLLOWED BY RELEASE OF AMMONIA FOR 2 MINUTES BEFORE AN EXCESS FLOW SHUT-DOWN VALVE INTERVENES OR REMOTE MANUAL SHUT-OFF IS CLOSED AND STOPS THE FLOW OF AMMONIA.  THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 2,900 POUNDS.  THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS .22 MILE.\n\n4. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nTHE FACILITY IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF \"SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA, K-61.1\", PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARDS INSTITUTE, INC. (ANSI), AND THE STANDARDS OF THE U.S. OCCUPATIO"
