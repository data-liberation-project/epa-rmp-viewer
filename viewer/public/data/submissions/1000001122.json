The system\nincludes ammonia detection devices, an emergency shutdown switch located outside the\nmain mechanical room, high- and low-level switches in pressure vessels, and safety relief valves to avert serious system overpressure.  Periodic maintenance on the refrigeration system is ensured via the use of a computerized maintenance management system.  Annual physical system audits are performed by an external refrigeration contractor to ensure system integrity.\n\n5.   Five Year Accident History\n\nDuring the past five years this facility has had no significant accidental releases of\nammonia.\n\n6.   Emergency Response Program\n\nThis food processing facility has procedures in place to respond to the release of a\nhazardous substance.
