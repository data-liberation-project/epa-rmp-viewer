              "Description": "Republic Plastics has developed this Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management Program (RMP) to address the requirements set forth by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for processing highly hazardous chemicals:\n\n\n\n?    29 CFR, 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals \n\n?    40 CFR, Part 68, Risk Management Program \n\n?    Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions\n\n\n\nEach of the referenced standards requires facilities that produce, handle, process, distribute, or store highly hazardous chemicals to develop a PSM and RMP program.  To simplify the implementation process and improve program maintenance efficiency, the requirements of both the PSM and RMP programs have been addressed in a single compliance program.  \n\n  \n\nThe PSM / RMP Programs are designed specifically for the Republic Plastics, Inc. facility located on 5428 N. National Drive in Knoxville, TN 37914.  Republic Plastics is a polystyrene foam product manufacturer listed under the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) 326140 that makes foam plates and bowls for wholesale distribution.  As part of its process, plastic foam pellets are heated to become liquefied, a t which point they are injected into an extruder along with Isobutane liquid and carbon dioxide.  The by-product of this process is formed into a foam sheet where it is then transferred to an oven and heated to a temperature where to sheet can be thermoformed or molded into the shape of the desired product.  The product is then transferred to a mechanical press where the products are cut and sent to an assembly for packaging.   \n\n\n\nRepublic Plastics? process involves the handling of a highly flammable material, Isobutane, in excess of the 10,000 pounds threshold quantity (TQ) designated by OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 and EPA 40 CFR Part 68.  \n\n\n\nThe K2 facility maintains and operates one (1) 18,000-gallon American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) code stamped horizontal above ground storage tank containing Isobutane or Dimethyl Ether (DME) Aeropres 31 (A-31).  The maximum capacity of the Isobutane tank is approximately 84,518 pounds; however, the maximum intended inventory has been established at 71,840 pounds.   \n\n\n\nThe purpose of the PSM / RMP Program is to reduce the risk of potential injury and/or health issues derived from the incidental release of chemicals exposing employees, the public, and the environment.  To simplify the management of the requirements of both regulations, Republic Plastics has combined the applicable OSHA and EPA compliance programs into a single document.  This combined document is referred to as the ?Process Safety Management / Risk Management Program (PSM / RMP)?. \n\n\n\nA critical part of the PSM / RMP Program is the implementation of a Management System which develops a systematic approach for identifying hazards, developing procedures or other corrective actions to mitigate and/or control potential risks, and managing the process to ensure the safe execution and continuous improvement of this program.  In addition, this program strives to ensure all Republic Plastics personnel who play an integral part in the PSM / RMP Program fully understand the various program element requirements, procedures and training for ensuring the continued safe operations, employee roles and responsibilities, periodic assessment, and recordkeeping requirements associated with the program.

The facility is designed to manufacture polystyrene products which involve the use and storage of Isobutane and polystyrene pellets, the pressurization of Isobutane gas in a high pressure building, extrusion, roll storage and aging, thermoforming and stamping, and fluff reclamation.  The equipment associated with the production of foam products consists of extruders, thermoformers, pellet feed silos, fluff surge hoppers, and associated storage and packaging areas.  In accordance with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Plan (RMP) definition for a process, the facility is defined as the Isobutane tank located outside, and the associated piping and pumps leading up to the high pressure building and distribution of the Isobutane to the extruders.\n\n\n\nSection 112 of the Clean Air Act applies to the Republic Plastics facility in Knoxville because the facility handles and stores Isobutane, a RMP-regulated flammable gas, in excess of the threshold quantities. Two (2) requirements of this section specifically apply to operations at the plant:\n\n\n\n1.  Purpose and General Duty Clause - The essence of the general duty clause is that an owner/operator that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has a fundamental obligation to ensure a safe operation and to have plans in place in the event of an accident to appropriately manage the situation.  Republic Plastics is committed to ensuring the safe operation of its Isobutane facility, as well as all of its other operations, to ensure a safe workplace for our employees and a safe location for our neighbors in the community.  Republic Plastics, therefore, has procedures in place to prevent accidents and is committed to emergency preparedness both for the facility and community-wide by coordinating with the local Fire Department.\n\n\n\n2.
