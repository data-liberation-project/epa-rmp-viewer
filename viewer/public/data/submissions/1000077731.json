Chlorine is the most hazardous substance that we handle and any release will set the emergency response plan in motion.\n\n     The Water Filtration Plant uses chlorine for an oxidating agent as well as a disinfectant.  The chlorine is contained in metal cylinders, which hold 2,000 lbs. each.  The maximum number of containers on site will be four.  The cylinders are housed in a chlorine room, which is attached to the filtration plant.  A window between the filter plant and the chlorine room allows us visual inspection of the chlorine containers and feed apparatus.\n\n     A worst case scenario would involve a one ton cylinder being dropped during handling and rupturing, causing the contents to spill onto the ground, which would immediately start vaporizing.  The cloud of chlorine gas would move with the wind close to the ground as it is heavier than air.  If the wind was from a southerly direction, the gas would envelop nearly the entire community of Worthington, necessitating the evacuation of nearly 13,500 people.  At this point the emergency response plan would be set in motion.\n\n     An alternate release scenario would involve chlorine gas coming from a leaking lead gasket between the container main valve and the chlorine pressure-regulating valve in the chlorine room after a new container is connected.  In this case, the gas would not be detected and the entire tank would empty overnight.  The toxic end-point would be reached at about 0.1 mile from the plant and would involve little offsite impact.  Leak reporting will be required at this point\n\n     General accidental release prevention at the site includes a warning system with a chlorine gas detector that is mounted in the plant on an adjacent wall to the chlorine room. All conections and piping are che"

Training is required of all employees on the handling of chlorine and the safety programs involved with chlorine.\n\n     There has been no accidental releases of chlorine at the water filtration plant up to the present time.\n\n     The emergency response program involves coordination with the Nobles County Operation Plan during a chlorine release.  The Nobles County Emergency Management Coordinator would direct required responses of the various units of government involved.  The plant has an emergency plan on site for step by step procedures that will be taken depending on the severity (level one or two) of the release.\n\n     The improvement of the safety programs at the plant will be continually reviewed and any new control equipment will be looked at and evaluated. Training will be an ongoing program involving personal protective equipment (PPE), classroom training and policy reviews."
