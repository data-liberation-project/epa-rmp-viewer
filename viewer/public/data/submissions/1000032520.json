      "SummaryText": "CenterPoint Energy Field Services (CEFS) has a long-standing commitment to workers and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of facility processes. The CEFS policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.\r\n\r\nCEFS operates the Weyerhaeuser Plant located in St. Helena Parish, Louisiana. The Weyerhaeuser Plant is located in a remote area and is not normally occupied. The Weyerhaeuser Plant is a newly constructed refrigeration facility that receives natural gas. The liquids generated from the refrigeration process are temporarily stored in a 30,000 gallon bullet tank stored on site and are then trucked offsite. Reside gas is flared onsite.\r\n\r\nA total rupture of the 30,000 gallon NGL tank resulting in a vapor cloud explosion would pose the worse-case scenario for the Weyerhaeuser Plant. The 30,000 gallon tank has been evaluated for total tank rupture using the RMP*Comp offsite consequence analysis resulting in a distance to endpoint of 0.4 miles. Because no public receptors are within a 0.4 mile radius of the NGL tank and the facility is not normally occupied, this RMP has been evaluated for a Program 1 Level RMP under 40 CFR 68. Since the facility is newly constructed, there is no accident history to report. If an emergency involving the NGL product tank occurs, the CEFS policy is to notify the St. Helena Parish sheriff's office and request that they respond to the emergency."
