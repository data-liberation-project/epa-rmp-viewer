      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe Helena Chemical Company (Helena) Garden City Facility has submitted this updated electronic RMP in compliance with the provisions of the Clean Air Act 112 (r) as codified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency at 40 CFR Part 68.  This electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the Garden City Facility located at 1004 N. Anderson Road, Garden City, KS 67846.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Garden City Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Garden City Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release (even though a release is unlikely) will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\nHelena has updated this RMP to include four different covered processes: (1) a temporary ammonia storage process (Railcar or Commercial Truck); (2) a temporary fertilizer reacting process (Mobil); (3) an on-site Tank Storage and Filling; and (4) an on-site reacting process (Stationary).  All covered processes have changed from Program 2 to Program 3.  Helena is resubmitting this RMP as a change in covered processes.  As part of the update, Helena updated the off-site consequence analysis for the worst case and the alternative case release scenarios for each covered process.\n\nFACILITY\n\nThe Garden City Facility is a retail agricultural chemical facility.  Anhydrous ammonia is transported to the Facility via commercial truck and possibly railcar.   Anhydrous ammonia is either (1) temporarily stored in the transportation container (i.e. Railcar or Commercial Truck) until it is reacted with phosphoric acid in a mobile pipe reactor and then diluted with water, or (2) stored in the onsite 30,000-gallon storage tank until it is transferred and reacted with fertilizer, water, and clay in the Stationary Reactor and then sold as fert"

Helena does not own or operate the Mobil reacting process, but does operate the tank storage and Stationary reacting process.    \n\nThe Mobil reacting process and its ancillary unloading procedures (i.e. from a railcar, commercial truck, or on-site tank storage) are performed by an Independent Fertilizer Reacting Contractor (IFRC).  After the reacting process is complete, any residual anhydrous ammonia is stored in the transportation containers until the transportation company removes the container from the Helena Facility.\n\nThe on-site tank storage, transfer, and Stationary reacting process operations are performed by qualified and trained Facility personnel.  Facility personnel conduct the storage, transfer, and reacting procedures in accordance with its Operating Procedures.  \n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nWorst case and alternative case offsite consequence analyses were completed for each covered process (i.e. Railcar, Mobil Reacting, Tank Storage, and Stationary Reacting).  The worst case scenario release for the Garden City Facility assumes that all the contents of the largest single vessel (a single railcar or single storage tank) are released.  The release was modeled as if the railcar or storage tank was punctured on the side at the ground level. The resulting release of ammonia was modeled as a ground level horizontal jet.\n\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario for the Railcar covered process assumes that a vapor valve is leaking or is not fully closed.  (The scenario actually assumes the valve is only 50% closed.)  The alternative scenario for the Mobil Reacting, Tank Storage, and Stationary Reacting covered processes are the same, and assumes that a liquid transfer line up to 3-inches in diameter is severed during the reacting or filling process.  \n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Fertilizer Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Helena facility.  The Fertilizer Manager is assisted by other Helena staff, a"

      "SummaryText": "s directed.  The ammonia storage prevention program is implemented by Helena employees.  Helena employees inspect the markings on transportation containers (Railcar or Commercial Trucks) to ensure that the containers are operated within the U.S. DOT required inspection requirements and they inspect the Bill of Lading to ensure that the containers are not overfilled.  Helena employees also conduct inspections of railcars, commercial trucks, and its on-site storage tank for leaking valves and fittings in accordance with the accident program detailed in the Risk Management Program document.  \n\nThe Mobil reacting process prevention program is implemented by the IFRC because Helena does not own or operate the reacting process.
