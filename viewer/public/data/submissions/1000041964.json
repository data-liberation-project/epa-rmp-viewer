      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - PRIMARY DISINFECTION FACILITY\n\n\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nIrvine Ranch Water District (IRWD) has established a risk management plan according to Federal EPA's (40 CFR Part 68) and California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) regulations to enhance already existing safety and emergency response programs.  IRWD is extremely cautious in the handling of all chemicals and is very diligent about safety for its employees, the communities where its facilities are located, and customers.  IRWD staff is well trained and utilizes modern equipment to monitor its facilities to provide safeguards, while effectively employing these useful chemicals.  These chemicals play an important role in water treatment and water reclamation, enabling everyone to lead healthier lives.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nIRWD has an emergency response plan in effect to handle potential emergency situations at this facility.  This plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n1.) To save lives.\n\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n3.) To protect the environment.\n\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nKey elements of the Emergency Response Plan include:\n\n\n\n - A detailed Emergency Response Action Guide\n\n - Key phone numbers and contact points for the IRWD Emergency Response Team\n\n - Incident Command System (ICS) \n\n - ICS position descriptions w/responsibilities\n\n \n\nThe Emergency Response Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, chlorine and ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated to ensure it is maintained current and to ensure compliance with the Process Safety Management (PSM), Risk Management Plan (RMP), and CalARP regulations.\n\n\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\n\n\nChlorination System\n\nThe chlorine system at Irvine Ranch Wa"

      "SummaryText": "ter District's Primary Disinfection Facility (PDF) is used for the treatment of water at the Dyer Road Well Field pipeline.  Chlorine is stored in the chlorine storage room.  Chlorine gas is supplied from the containers to the chlorinators which regulate the chlorine feed.  Downstream of the vacuum regulators, the system is operated under vacuum as a safety measure.  In case of a break, the vacuum regulator closes automatically minimizing the quantity of chlorine gas that may escape from the system.  Also, the entire system is connected to the gaseous side of the storage container.  This is also an important safety feature.  The system is also equipped with shutoff mechanisms that close the main valves in case of an emergency.  The vacuum is created at the chlorinators by water flow through a set of injectors.  Chlorine detectors are provided for the chlorination building to maximize safety.  The detectors alarm locally and remotely (i.e., notify the duty operator of the plant.)  Also, the signal from the detectors is used to activate the scrubber system.  This system, when activated, draws air from the room where the storage tanks and vacuum regulators are located and passes it through a scrubbing medium that consists of sodium hydroxide solution.  If chlorine is present in the room air, it would react with the solution resulting in table salt and water.\n\n\n\nAqueous Ammonia System\n\nThe aqueous ammonia process at PDF consists of pumping an aqueous ammonia solution from the two storage vessels directly into the pipeline.  The ammonia solution is delivered through use of metering pumps.  Four pumps are present in the ammonia storage room where two pumps remain on and the other two are spares. \n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nIRWD has a PSM program in place to manage the handling of chlorine and aqueous ammonia.  The program includes strict requirements for written operating procedures, personnel training, contractor "

      "SummaryText": "safety, equipment maintenance, incident investigation, process hazard analysis, management of change and periodic review or audit of program elements.  Management of change element addresses proper implementation of system updates to ensure that all changes are reviewed properly by knowledgeable persons, all engineering documents and operating procedures reflect the change, and personnel are trained on the change.   Process Safety Management also requires a pre-startup safety review to ensure that the system is properly reviewed before it is put back into service after a major change.  \n\n\n\nIn addition to PSM, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are strictly followed to ensure safety.  Also, common practices outlined by the Chlorine Institute are implemented in chlorine system design and day-to-day system operation.  \n\n\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe five-year accident history (June 2009 to June 2014) for the Primary Disinfection Facility reveals that there were no reportable accidents for chlorine or aqueous ammonia during this period.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nIRWD is taking additional steps to further public safety.  Several studies have been conducted recently to examine mitigation measures and additional steps to further ensure public safety at the IRWD, Primary Disinfection Facility.  All recommended changes from the technical studies done to establish and update the RMP and PSM have been reviewed and implemented."
