As a requirement of the Clean Air Act Amendments 112(r) Accidental Release of Hazardous Air Substances program, Front Range Energy, LLC. completed a risk management plan (RMP) for any chemical stored on-site that will be above the reporting threshold of 10,000 pounds.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nFront Range Energy, LLC. is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process, specifically pentane as a potential constituent of the natural gasoline used as the ethanol denaturant (flammable) as well as anhydrous ammonia (toxic).  The denaturant is added to the ethanol to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption.  The ammonia is used for pH control directly in the process feed mixture to fermentation.  It is the policy of Front Range Energy, LLC. to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws.

The fuel ethanol production process requires use of a denaturant (natural gasoline) which may contain approximately 40 percent pentane, an RMP regulated substance.  The maximum amount of denaturant on-site is estimated to be 634,000 pounds (total pentane is 253,600 pounds).  The natural gasoline is stored in an above ground tank as a liquid and is introduced to the fuel ethanol in the"

Unleaded fuel may also be used as a denaturant in place of natural gasoline and is not anticipated to contain any regulated constituents above the threshold quantity.  Anhydrous ammonia is also stored on-site and used in the ethanol production process for pH control.  The maximum anhydrous ammonia stored will be 100,800 pounds.
