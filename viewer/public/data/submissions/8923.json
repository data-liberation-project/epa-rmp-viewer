In addition, it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws.\n\nMettler Fertilizer's Corporate Mission states To provide for the safety of our employees, our customers and the general public.  In order to fulfill this mission Mettler Fertilizer Inc. provides EHS group to maintain and administer comprehensive safety and environmental program and procedures.  EHS field safety services supervisors audit and monitor facility compliance with the safety standards of the company.\n\nThis facility maintains approximately 15 1,000-gallon nurse tanks for customer delivery.  Our combined storage capacity in nurse tanks is 70,000 pounds.   Anhydrous ammonia is stored in 1 stationary tank (12,000 gallons) on site.  56,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia is the maximum storage capacity of the stationary storage tank.  There is no rail car storage on site.  Therefore, the total facility anhydrous ammonia storage capacity for our facility is 112,000 pounds.  The largest single storage vessel at our facility contains 56,000 pounds.\n\nThe worst case scenario.  \nOur worst case scenario is the loss of the total contents of the 12,000 gallon storage tank, when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), released as a gas over 10 minutes, resulting in total vaporization.  The maximum quantity release would be 56,000 pounds.  According to DEGADIS modeling, this release (distance to point of dispersion to 200 PPM) would have off site impact.  It should be noted that Mettler Fertilizer Inc. distribution as never had a release of an entire stationary storage tank.\n\nAlternative release scenario \nThe most common alternative release scenario(s) from our facility would not reach an end-point off-site.

These coordinators are given training to monitor the day to day safe work activities, maintain the required regulatory record keeping, conduct monthly safety meetings, conduct employee training and act as the location's contact with the corporate EHS group.  The site safety coordinators act as the location emergency contact.\n\nA description of our facility and the regulated substances handled. \nThis facility is a wholesale farm supply distribution center as such we store and distribute a wide variety of pesticides and fertilizers including Anhydrous Ammonia.  Anhydrous Ammonia is received by truck, is handled and stored on-site and is a regulated substance by the EPA requiring us to comply with the Risk Management Program.  We sell anhydrous ammonia to grower customers in 1,000 gallon nurse tanks.  The customer applies the ammonia into the soil as a source of nitrogen fertilizer for growing agricultural crop.  Ammonia may also be used for blending into mixed grade fertilizer for crop production nutrients.  Training is provided to all employees at least annually, whenever there is a change in the process or whenever competency with the regulations is questioned.  The training consists of classroom lecture, current videos, testing and certification and on the job training.\n\nFive-year accident history. \nThere has been no accidents involving anhydrous ammonia that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage including evacuation on or off-site.\nThe emergency response program.\nIn the event of an emergency involving our ammonia system, it is our policy to notify the local community fire department and request that they respond to the emergency.  In preparation for this, we have coordinated with all of the local response agencies by providing information and facility tours to ensure that they are familiar with and properly prepared for an incident at our facility.

The plan includes public notification, provisions for initial medical care, evacuations and LEPC coordination.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety.  \nWe do not plan to make any changes to the physical site.

The total amount of anhydrous ammonia release in this scenario would be 12,000 pounds.  This release scenario (distance to point dispersion to 200 PPM) would have off site impact.  It should be noted that Mettler Fertilizer Inc. has not had a release of this type from this distribution facility.  \n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\nThe ammonia system is designed, installed and is maintained in accordance with ASTM standards and the ASME codes.  This facility complies with the ANSI K 61.1 standards (1989), OSHA (29 DFR 1910.111), EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule as well as all applicable federal, state, and local codes and regulations. \n\nOur ammonia system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shutoffs and emergency shutoff valves.  The load-out risers used for the purpose of filling the nurse tanks are protected by excess flow valves and fill line breakaways to immediately stop the flow of ammonia if a line or hose fails.  All of the main storage tank valves and the riser load valves are locked when not in use. \n\nOur ammonia system is inspected on a regular basis with maintenance and preventive maintenance scheduled and documented.  Liquid and vapor valves, hoses, excess flow valves, gauges, and relief valves are replaced when necessary and/or according to the guidelines in the ANSI standards.\n\nAll locations are required to conduct their own internal audit utilizing checklist survey forms that are reviewed regularly and updated as necessary to ensure all applicable federal, state and local regulations are covered.
