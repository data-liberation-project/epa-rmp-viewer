A new butane system was constructed in accordance with the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA Code) #58 for Liquified Petroleum Gas Storage, and it is the Stationary Source's policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws/codes.\n\nThis Risk Management Program (RMP) covers the butane system only, including the butane offload station, butane storage tank (30,000 gal), butane transfer pump, and associated butane piping.\nTwo requirements of this section specifically apply to operations at the Stationary Source:\n\n1.\tPurpose and General Duty Clause - The essence of the General Duty Clause is that an owner/operator that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has a fundamental obligation to ensure a safe operation and to have plans in place in the event of a loss of containment to appropriately manage the situation.\n\nETM&T is committed to ensuring the safe operation of the Stationary Source, as well as all of its other operations, to ensure a safe workplace for employees and a safe location for neighbors in the community. ETM&T has procedures in place to prevent accidents and is committed to emergency preparedness both for the Stationary Source and community-wide and coordinates with the Waskom Fire Department.\n\n2.\tRisk Management Plan - The primary function of the Stationary Source is to act as a flammable liquid storage and distribution Stationary Source. Due to the flammable effects associated with butane; it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to employee health, and to minimize the threat and impact to nearby members of the community.

Programs have been established to help prevent any accidental releases and to train personnel for emergency response in the event of a release. NOTE: The Waskom Marketing Terminal \u0093IS NOT\u0094 a responding Stationary Source. ETM&T has implemented safety precautions and procedures designed to prevent and mitigate catastrophic releases. ETM&T has active operating, maintenance, training and inspection procedures.\nETM&T's management is committed to the following:\n\n\u0095\tPreventing loss of containments;\n\u0095\tTraining our employees in correct response procedures in the event of an accident;\n\u0095\tParticipating in community emergency preparedness;\n\u0095\tAddressing any citizen concerns by fully explaining potential hazards associated with ETM&T operations and all steps being taken to prevent and mitigate loss of containments; and\n\u0095\tBeing a good corporate citizen in Delaware County\nThe Waskom Marketing Terminal complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Accident Prevention Rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR Part 1910.119) along with its fourteen (14) compliance elements, and all applicable state and local laws and regulations.

The Stationary Source has available protection systems (site fire extinguishers, emergency shut-off devices) and Emergency Response Procedures. The Waskom Marketing Terminal is a non-responding Stationary Source.\nThe Stationary Source is new and has not had any accidental releases during the past five years that meet the criteria for an accidental release as discussed in 40 CFR 68.42.\n\nIn an effort to improve and promote system safety, ETM&T looks for and seeks employee input on process safety improvements. Additionally, the Waskom Fire Department is contacted regarding participation in site emergency response drills which involve potential releases. \n\nWith these objectives in mind, the Risk Management Plan has been developed to provide information regarding the management of the risks associated with the flammable substance storage process. Above all, ETM&T stresses its commitment to ensuring a safe working environment for employees, visitors and the community."
