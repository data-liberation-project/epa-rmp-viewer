This facility engages in a wide variety of operations including open & closed die forging, manufacture of seamless rolled rings, heat treating, machining, and chemical etching.  Ladish is subject to the EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions due to the on-site presence of  hydrofluoric acid used in solutions to etch titanium alloys.\n     Our chemical etching operations as all other manufacturing processes are operated with quality system standards and procedures that have earned Ladish ISO 9002 certification.  All acid processing tanks and storage areas are equipped with spill containment to minimize the potential of uncontrolled releases to the environment.  Our accidental release prevention program also includes procedures for receiving, on-site transportation, process use, and treatment of spent materials for all acids used on site.\n     Ladish has an emergency response program that includes an off-site spill plan registered with the Milwaukee County Division of Emergency Government, and an on-site Emergency Response Team trained to handle chemical specific spills.  The Cudahy Fire Department is the primary responder in the event of an emergency."
