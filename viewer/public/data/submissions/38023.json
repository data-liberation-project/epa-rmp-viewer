Prevention of accidents, employee safety and emergency response are all operations that have command support and visibility.  Fort Gordon follows applicable regulations, requirements and policies designed to provide a safe work environment. Fort Gordon owns and operates a water treatment plant (WTP) and a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP).  Both the WTP and WWTP use chlorine as a disinfectant in their treatment processes.  Chlorine is stored in 1-ton containers at each location.  The chlorine at the Fort Gordon WTP and WWTP are OSHA PSM covered processes.  As such, the Risk Management Prevention Program at Fort Gordon mirrors the OSHA PSM requirements.  Accordingly the Prevention Program will be maintained by the Johnson Controls Safety Engineer (JCSE) and overseen by the Signal Safety Division under the Directorate of Public Safety/Military Police Activity (DPS/MPA). The Fort Gordon WTP and WWTP have had no documented accidents involving the chlorine usage during the past five years. The Fort Gordon Fire Prevention/Protection Division (FPPD) consists of three engine companies located in two fire stations.  The installation has a total of 34 fire fighters, two prevention officers, and a Fire Chief.  Minimal staffing requirements are at least 13 people on-shift at all times.  The emergency response program is operated and maintained by the FPPD.  Because of the comprehensive operations of the Fort Gordon FPD, no significant procedural changes are expected for the Emergency Response Program, although representative of the FPPD are expected to continue participation and attendance at the EQCC subcommittee meetings. A Risk Management Program has been instituted at Fort Gordon.  This document represents the compendium of program information and procedures, many previously in existence, at the installation.  A review of the procedures resulted in the identification of a number of recommended actions to impro"
