      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  \r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\nThe City of Sunnyvale's Water Pollution Control Plant (Plant) uses chemicals such as chlorine and sulfur dioxide in the disinfection process for treated wastewater to provide water safe for discharge to the environment and for recycled water for uses such as landscaping irrigation. Storing large quantities of these chemicals can be a hazard if they are not handled properly. The Plant takes its safety obligations for storing and using hazardous chemicals as seriously as providing reliable wastewater treatment. This Executive Summary describes the steps taken to prevent an accidental chemical release, to ensure a safely operated plant, and how the Plant responds to an emergency. To date, the Plant has an excellent record in preventing accidental releases. Please feel free to contact Melody Tovar, Regulatory Programs Division Manager at (408) 730-7808 if you have questions.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe Plant implements programs to comply with other accidental release prevention regulations, including California's OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program and the California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP). In the Plant priorities developed by the management team, safety is listed at the number one priority and is not to be compromised for any other issue. All employees are to ensure that both employees and the community are safe at all times from any harm at the Plant. Compliance is the next priority for the Plant and should be planned for as we plan for safety, so that there is never a need to make a choice between the two. Compliance at the Plant means meeting the obligations to various federal, state, and local agencies, as well as protecting the environment and providing an important service to our customers and the citizens of Sunnyvale.\r\n\r\nThe Plant has written Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) established for all plant processes related to PSM and RMP requirements.

The Plant has a Safety Committee consisting of representatives from each section within the Plant that meets on a monthly basis to discuss safety issues and plant operations. Each Plant section has bi-weekly staff safety training meetings to provide training on pertinent operations and plans, with many of the training sessions related to chlorine and sulfur dioxide process safety.\r\n\r\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substances Information\r\n\r\nThe Plant is located at 1444 Borregas Avenue in Sunnyvale, near the southern tip of the San Francisco Bay. The Plant treats wastewater from the City of Sunnyvale, a small section of the City of Cupertino, and a portion of the Moffett Field Naval Air Station, located in Sunnyvale. The facility has a treatment capacity of 29.5 million gallons per day; average flow is currently 14-16 million gallons per day. Plant processes include preliminary treatment to remove large solids and grit, primary sedimentation to remove settleable solids, oxidation ponds as secondary treatment, biological treatment to nitrify ammonia, flocculation and coagulation for algae removal, filtration to remove suspended solids, disinfection for pathogen reduction, and dechlorination of treated water prior to discharge to render chlorine harmless in the final effluent. The Plant is a 24-hour per day/7-day per week operation. A Senior Operator is always on duty at the facility and will initiate established emergency response procedures in the event of an accidental release or other emergency situation.\r\n\r\nThe facility currently stores chlorine and sulfur dioxide, which are regulated substances under the RMP and CalARP rules. These are stored in one-ton cylinders and exceed the RMP and Cal ARP threshold quantities. The facility also produces methane gas in its digesters which is used to power influent pump engines and for the co-generation of electricity in two 800 kW genera"

Calculations maintained at the Plant demonstrate that the amount of digester gas stored does not exceed the RMP or CalARP threshold quantities. In addition, based on 2004 revisions to the RMP rule, methane that is used as fuel at a wastewater treatment plant is no longer covered in the RMP program by EPA.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention\r\n\r\nChlorine is added to the wastewater prior to discharge to kill disease-causing organisms. Sulfur dioxide is used after disinfection is completed to convert chlorine to chloride, which is harmless to fish and other aquatic life in the receiving water. Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are stored, transported, and applied in physically separate but similar systems. The Plant's Risk Management Plan and Process Safety Management Manual are based on the following key elements:\r\n- Management system, levels of responsibilities, and team member roles;\r\n- Comprehensive process safety information that is readily available to staff, emergency responders, and contractors;\r\n- A preventive maintenance and work order tracking program using MAXIMO computer programs;\r\n- A completed process hazard analysis of equipment and procedures with operations and maintenance staff participation and review;\r\n- Use of accurate and effective operating procedures with participation of operations and maintenance staff for review and revision, as required;\r\n- High level of training of operators and maintenance staff; and\r\n- Incident investigation, inspection, and auditing programs using qualified staff.\r\n\r\nProduct Delivery and Storage\r\n\r\nChlorine and sulfur dioxide cylinders are delivered to the facility on flatbed trucks. Twenty-four hour prior notification of the delivery and driver identification is required from the supplier before the truck is allowed onsite to unload"

Once inside the Plant, all chlorine and sulfur dioxide cylinders are immediately unloaded and placed inside storage buildings where they are safety-secured. The containers are never left outside or unattended. After the cylinders are secured in the storage buildings, an intruder alarm system is activated. The intruder alarm system is active when Plant personnel are not working in the storage buildings.\r\n\r\nProcess and Chemical Safety Information\r\n\r\nComprehensive chemical data have been assembled to include regulatory reporting and action thresholds, health hazards, and chemical exposure limitations, as well as detailed physical properties of each regulated substance. This information was compiled from numerous sources prior to conducting the Process Hazard Analysis. It includes MSDS sheets, chlorine and sulfur dioxide background information, and chlorine and sulfur dioxide reaction chemistry.\r\n\r\nEquipment safety information has been compiled on the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes, including maximum intended inventory, safe upper and lower temperatures, safe upper and lower pressures, and codes and standards used to design build, and operate the processes. The Plant also has procedures in place to update safety information if there is a major change that makes existing information inaccurate.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\nPlant staff, engineering, and administrative staff conducted an initial, detailed PHAs for the chlorine disinfection system and sulfur dioxide dechlorination system in December 1993. A revalidation of the PHAs was conducted in December 1999 by a team of maintenance, operations, engineering, and administrative staff using the \"Hazard and Operability\" (HAZOP) method and \"What If\" methods as per acceptable approach guidance from EPA. Another revalidation using the HAZOP and \"What if\" methodologies was completed in 2003 and 2006-2007 using a similar team make-up. The most recent"

In 2012, the Plant converted to the use of sodium bisulfite for dechlorination as part of the disinfection process, eliminating the ongoing use of SO2 at the facility.  As part of a larger infrastructure plan, the Plant will also convert to the use of sodium hypochlorite for disinfection as an alternative to gaseous chlorine.  That project is currently in the planning phase.  When that project is completed, the siting for the sodium bisulfite will also be relocated and sulfur dioxide is planned for use during the transition.  Therefore, even with the conversion to sodium bisulfite, the existing SO2 system currently remains, with maintenance of safety functions and protocols, until a full decommissioning of the SO2/CL2 system is conducted after the new disinfection system is implemented.\r\n\r\nThe Plant will continue to implement and update its Risk Management Plan components.  In 2013, the Plant plans to revise its Emergency Planning components, including coordination with the Department of Public Safety on emergency protocols.  The Plant will also be conducting a program compliance audit in 2013."
