This Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the Butane Blending process which includes two 60,000 gallon butane storage vessels and provisions for truck offloading and direct injection/blending into gasoline.\n\nThe Neville Island Bulk Petroleum Storage Terminal Butane Blending Process was constructed and designed in accordance with National Fire Protection Association Code No. #58 (NFPA 58) - Liquefied Petroleum Gas Code and it is LHT's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and Local codes/laws. In addition, the Butane Blending Process also complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Accident Prevention Rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and associated 14 elements (29 CFR Part 1910.119).\n\nThis Facility is considered a \"non-responding\" facility. As such, if an emergency were to occur, protocol dictates that personnel are to evacuate and notify the applicable emergency response agencies including the Neville Island General Volunteer Fire Department and/or the Allegheny County LEPC through the 911 service. The Facility maintains a written plan meeting the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.38 (Emergency Action Plans) at minimum and emergency response is coordinated annually with the local response agencies. Local response agencies have been invited to participate in initial training sessions for the Butane Blending Process and safety information was provided during those sessions.\n\nAs the RMP reflects a process that has not yet begun operations, Neville Island Bulk Petroleum Storage Terminal has never had an accident involving butane which has resulted in deaths, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\nLHT actively continually evalua"
