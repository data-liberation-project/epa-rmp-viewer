The program addresses each of  the EPA Program Level 3-listed 12 elements, plus  RMP elements needed to implement the program, and the like elements in place for the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  These are maintained in Corning's Process Information Management System (PIMS) document control system.\n1.2. CORNING STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED AT THE WILMINGTON, NC SITE   (b)\nThe Corning Plant employs 1,800 full-time employees engaged in the manufacture of glass fiber optics.  Chlorine is used as part of the manufacturing process.\n1.2.1. SITE DESCRIPTION  (b)(1)\n The site is owned and operated by Corning Incorporated, Telecommunications Products Division.  The site is located at 310 North College Road, Wilmington, New Hanover County, North Carolina.  The 65-acre site is bordered by North College Road on the west, and Smith Creek Parkway on the east and north.\n The Plant has two chlorine storage and distribution systems contained in specially designed process buildings.

REGULATED SUBSTANCE  (b)(2)\n Chlorine is the only regulated substance on site that exceeds the EPA 40 CFR-68 rule threshold quantity.  The chlorine process was installed as part of the process of manufacturing glass fiber optics.  The chlorine is received, stored and used in two processes that distribute it to eight control panels. \n Chlorine is an EPA-and OSHA-listed toxic chemical.  It is an irritant and it is corrosive.  Chlorine is a halogen with the formula Cl2.  It is a chlorinating or oxidizing agent that is not flammable.  It has a 1 ppm OSHA ceiling Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) and a NFPA health rating of 4, severe; with immediate and delayed health hazards.  Chlorine is not a carcinogen.\n1.3. WORST AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS  (c)\nTwo offsite consequence analyses were conducted which include two chlorine release scenarios.  The first is a worst case release.  The second is a more probable alternative release scenario.  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that the facility shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over 10 minutes  due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario.\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling guidance developed by the EPA for waste water treatment plants was used to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to the toxic endpoint.  The EPA selected endpoint for chlorine is 0.0087 mg/l equals 3 ppm.  The  3 ppm endpoint is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which c"

The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance was defined, to estimate the population potentially affected.\n1.3.1. WORST CASE  (c)(1)\n The EPA waste water guidance chlorine toxic end point table for the worst case scenario was used.  It includes all EPA Assumptions.  Results demonstrate a distance of 1.30 miles to the toxic endpoint.  The residential population that could potentially be affected by the release is estimated at 7,024 people.\n 1.3.2. ALTERNATIVE CASE  (c)(2)\n The alternative release scenario involves the rupture of the 1/4-inch high pressure tubing connected to one of the one ton-containers.  Modeling demonstrated the rate of chlorine release is 3.968 lb./min.  The toxic endpoint distances determined is zero (0) miles, or stated another way, no off-site impacts.  No public receptor would be impacted by this release.\n1.4. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM  (d)\nThe Corning accidental release prevention program is based on the OSHA PSM program and EPA RMP Level 3 prevention program.  The PSM program has been in place and effectively used for several years.  It is part of the plant's operating culture.  There are two parts to the program.  The first is the general overall site program.  The second is the chlorine-specific actions within the site program.  This is coordinated with the Hanover County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) through the City of Wilmington North Carolina fire department.\n1.4.1. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM  (d)(1)\n Facility-wide, many elements of the prevention program are used for all operations.  The overviews of these programs are listed below:\n- Corning has detailed process safety information on each of its operations. \n- The PIMS document control system is an integral part of the management of change for all operations on site.  \n- Training is the backbone of employee knowledge,"

In the event of a chlorine leak the vent system doubles the air turnover through the buildings.\n1.4.2.3. Equipment Design\nThe chlorine piping system is made of Hastelloy metal tube.  This tube is both chlorine compatible (not corroded by chlorine) and rated to 1,500 psig.  The maximum pressure of the chlorine is only 150 psig giving a 10 to 1 safety factor.  There is a chlorine monitor that detects the presence of chlorine in the storage building.  The monitor along with other detectors in the plant will alarm to alert employees of a potential chlorine leak.\n \n1.5. FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY  (e)\nCorning has had no accidental releases of chlorine in the past five years per EPA 40 CFR 67.42 (a).\n1.6. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM  (f)\nEmergency response procedures are contained in the Corning Contingency Plan (Emergency Response Plan).  The plan includes an emergency response decision tree and a notification plan.  Emergency response drills and drill evaluations are conducted every month by the operating department and once per quarter by the safety department.  Emergency operation and response procedures are also reviewed at that time.\nThe emergency response program (contingency plan) is coordinated (reviewed by) with the City of Wilmington Fire Department, which is a member of Local Emergency Response Planning Committee (LEPC).  Copies of the program are given to ten key local agencies including:  fire, medical, rescue, waste management, and police departments in New Hanover County. Besides the specific emergency response program, key elements of the prevention programs are incorporated in the operating culture of the Corning plant.\nThe Contingency Plan procedures detail the actions and responses to chlorine spills (releases).  The plan includes training of all chlorine-area operators, a primary response team, and a backup team.  Actions include catastrophic, severe, and moderate lea"
