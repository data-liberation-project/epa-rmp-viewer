In the event of a release, the Axtell facility is prepared to work with the Kearney County LEPC and/or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact to people and the environment.\n\nThe Axtell facility's primary covered process activity is the mixing of fertilizers.  These activities include storage and processing of anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and processed into 10-34-0 non-hazardous liquid fertilizer.  Processing is periodic and usually occurs in the Spring and Fall.  Ammonia mixing with phosphoric acid occurs in a T-reactor. The T reactor is usually a contractor operation that is controlled by the contractor.   Water is used as both a reaction feed material and product stabilizer.  The Emergency Response Procedures for Axtell are coordinated with the Kearney County LEPC.\n\nUnited Suppliers, Inc. ? Axtell, Ne has taken the necessary steps to comply with accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68.  Axtell is also covered by OSHA's Process Safety Management standard.
