This commitment is demonstrated by continually improving both practices and measures to prevent the release of regulated substances.  In the event of a release, the Axtell facility is prepared to work with the Kearney County LEPC and/or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact to people and the environment.\n\nThe Axtell facility's primary covered process activity is the mixing of fertilizers.  These activities include storage and processing of anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and processed into 10-34-0 non-hazardous liquid fertilizer.  Processing is periodic and usually occurs in the Spring and Fall.  Ammonia mixing with phosphoric acid occurs in a T-reactor. The T reactor is usually a contractor operation that is controlled by the contractor.   Water is used as both a reaction feed material and product stabilizer.  The Emergency Response Procedures for Axtell are coordinated with the Kearney County LEPC.\n\nUnited Suppliers, Inc. ? Axtell, Ne has taken the necessary steps to comply with accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68.  Axtell is also covered by OSHA's Process Safety Management standard.  The following briefly describes the prevention program elements in place at this stationary source:\n\nProcess Safety Information:  The unit maintains information describing the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the covered process.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:  Studies are conducted to ensure the hazards associated with process operations are identified, understood and controlled.\n\nOperating Procedures:  Written operating procedures are maintained for covered process operations.  These procedures address the following activities:   initial startup, normal, temporary, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown and startup following a turnaround.\n\nTraining:  "

Affected personnel are informed and trained to deal with authorized system changes.\n\nPre-Startup Review:  Technical and operational reviews will be conducted on new processes and/or modifications to existing covered processes.  Reviews confirm the construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable.  Reviews are completed prior to placing equipment in operation.\n\nCompliance Audits:  Internal audits are conducted on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions specified under the RMP rule are being implemented.  At a minimum, these audits are conducted every three (3) years.  Any determined corrective actions are completed in a timely manner.\n\nIncident Investigations:  Investigations will be conducted to determine the root cause of covered process incidents.  In addition to determination and correction, investigations are directed toward preventing reoccurance.  Investigations become process safety information and are retained for five (5) years.  \n\nEmployee Participation:  Axtell, Ne unit employee(s) actively contribute in the following:  process hazard assessments, operating procedure development, maintenance procedure development, training development and implementation, pre-startup reviews, incident investigations, and compliance audits.
