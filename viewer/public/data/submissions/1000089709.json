We adhere to corporate policies, which can be summarized as \"All safety and environmental incidents can be prevented\".  In addition to this emphasis on preventing accidental releases, we are prepared to respond to any emergency situation that may occur.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\n- A description of our facility and the use of substances covered by this regulation\n\n- A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n\n- An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n\n- A five-year history of accidental releases of chemicals covered by this regulation\n\n- An overview of our emergency response program\n\n- An overview of planned improvements at our facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, or the environment\n\n- The certifications this regulation requires us to provide\n\n- The detailed data elements about our risk management program\n\n\n\n2.0 Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\n\n\nThe Chemours site is located along the Ohio River in Jefferson County, Kentucky just southwest of the city of Louisville in an area known locally as \"Rubbertown\".  We operate one process using a variety of chemicals and processing operations.  The process produces HCFC-22 with HFC-23 and hydrogen chloride as by-products.  The process uses fluorine based technology.  We share the site with a Dupont Vinyl Fluoride manufacturing facility.  The site is fenced and entry is controlled by security personnel at all times.\n\n\n\nIn our processes, we use the following chemicals that E"

The storage of additional rail cars does not impact the facility's controls or consequences evaluated related to Hydrogen Fluoride handling and storage.  On March 22, 2021, the maximum inventory for Hydrogen Fluoride was reduced back to its original amount of 5,300,000 lbs as the site no longer needed extra storage capacity for rail cars.  \n\n\n\n3.0 Key Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\n\n\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\n\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario for the toxic chemicals on our site is the rupture of an anhydrous hydrogen fluoride railcar, releasing the entire contents instantaneously with no mitigation assumed.  According to EPA's RMPComp program for worst case scenarios, this toxic gas release would have an off-site impact on other industry, residential populations, and public receptors.  Rupture of a railcar is very unlikely due to the high-integrity design, including full head shields.   \n\n\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\n\n\nChlorine -- A 1/8\" hole develops "

The leak is assumed to continue for 15 minutes prior to fume mitigation using site emergency response procedures.  Using EPA's RMEComp program for alternative scenarios, this toxic gas release would potentially have off-site industrial impact, but no impact on residential populations or other receptors.\n\n\n\nChloroform -- A leak develops at the base of a storage tank releasing the contents of chloroform into a containment basin.  The leak is assumed to continue until the remaining contents of the tank can be pumped to another vessel or into waste conveying trailers.
