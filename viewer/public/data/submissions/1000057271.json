Ryder Integrated Logistics Rochelle 1 files a Tier 2 Chemical Inventory each year with the Ogle County LEPC and the Fire Department as required by sections 311 and 312 of EPCRA.  The facility's Emergency Action Plan includes procedures for notifying the proper agencies in the event of a reportable release of ammonia.  A release of 100 pounds or more during a 24 hour period must be reported to the National Response Center, the SERC, and LEPC, in accordance with section 304 of EPCRA.  The Rochelle City Fire Department has been provided with a copy of the facility's Emergency Action Plan.\r\n\r\n \r\n1.0\tINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThis plan is prepared to document the preparation of a Risk Management Plan for the ammonia system operated by Ryder and owned by Ryder Integrated Logistics Rochelle 1 at their facility located 975 South Caron Rd.

The Toxic Endpoint for anhydrous ammonia is listed in 40 CFR 68, Appendix A as 0.14 mg/l or 200 ppm.\r\n\r\n3.1\tWorst Case Scenario\r\n\r\nThe worst case scenario is based upon the maximum amount of ammonia to be collected into the largest single vessel in the system.  Overall Intended System Inventory capacity is approximately 30,000 lbs. of ammonia as noted in the PSI information of the PSM Program. The system has five storage vessels, (V-1) high temperature receiver vessel, (V-2) High temperature recirculator vessel and three low temperature recirculator vessels (V-3), (V-4), & (V-5), two thermosyphon vessels (V-6) & (V-7).  The largest single vessel in the facility's system is the Low Temperature recirculator vessel (V-4).  In the case of a system pumpdown, ammonia will be transferred to the low temperature recirculator vessels (V-3), (V-4), & (V-5). The capacity of the low temperature recirculator vessel (V-4) at 100% is approximately 12400 lbs as the Worst Case ammonia quantity.  The design of V-4 low temperature recirculator vessel system pumpdown capacity is approximately 80% of the vessel volume at HLCO vessel equaling approximately 7907.4 lbs.  The worst case scenario is based upon release of 100% volume from the V-4 low temperature recirculator vessel of 1240 lbs in ten minutes (release rate of 680 lbs/minute) due to a catastrophic vessel failure caused by overfilling/over pressurization.  The low temperature recirculator vessel (V-4) is located inside the engine room.  Distance to toxic endpoint is 1.2 miles.  This calculation was performed using the EPA's RMP*Comp Version 1.07 Program.  Vessel volume calculations, data, residential population estimates, receptors, and an RMP*Comp printout is included as Appendix B.  Residential population, receptors, and map information on this scenario was determined using MCDC"

The facility is located at 975 South Caron Road, Rochelle, IL. 61068.The SIC code for the operation is 4222 the NAICS code is 49312.  The facility has approximately 110 full time employees and operates 24 hours/day, 6 days/week, 52 weeks/year.\r\n\r\nThe facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system as part of the process to keep food products fresh.  40 CFR 68.130 lists anhydrous ammonia as a hazardous chemical subject to RMP regulation with a threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds or greater.  \r\n\r\nThe current capacity of the system exceeds 10,000 pounds. The facility has never experienced a significant release incident.  Ammonia is recirculated in the system as a liquid and gas depending on system operating pressures and temperatures.  The refrigeration system is designed, installed and operated in accordance with the applicable guidelines and standards of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR), the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-conditioning Engineers, Inc. (ASHRAE).  \r\n\r\nThe facility has developed and implemented a Process Safety Management Program (PSM) in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  Qualified outside contractors are used for construction and major repairs or modifications to the system.  The facility's PSM program includes provisions for process hazard analyses, management of change, pre-start up safety reviews, safe work practices, inspections, testing, maintenance, comp"

Small bore pipe is located on the roof and inside the compressor room, it is not subject to traffic nor is it easily accessible as is the piping inside the engine room, but is considered to be the a more real life release scenario.  A release associated with a pump seal fail does not apply as the pumps are hermitic which do not have shaft seals, the release scenario from the V-4 operating liquid level catastrophic release was covered in the Worst Case and vessel pad sitting protection was considered, the release from a PRV valve toxic endpoint is minimal; therefore these scenarios were not selected. \r\n\r\nThe alternate scenario release chosen was the outside HPL 3/4 PO valve, (due to the number of locations and possibilities throughout the system with a release rate calculated at approximately 1509.65 lb/min (at 90 psig) for a 8.9 minute duration (due to the overall Intended System Inventory capacity of approximately 30,000 lbs. of ammonia as noted in the PSI information of the PSM Program, the total ammonia charge would be released within 20 minutes).
