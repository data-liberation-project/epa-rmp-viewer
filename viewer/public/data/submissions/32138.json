It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Forest City Fire and Police Departments and request that they respond to the emergency.  Description of faciltiy and regulated substances handled - This is a small, minicipal wastewater chlorination facility.  We treat wastewater from the municipality of Forest City with chlorine to destroy potentially harmful biological contaminants.  Worst-case release scenario - Our worst-case scenario is rupture of a one-ton chlorine storage cylinder containing 2,000 lbs of chlorine liquid at ambient temperature, resulting in the total release of all the chlorine over a 10-minute period.  According to dispersion modeling (ALOHA 5.2) that assumes criteria specified by Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act, the distance to the endpoint is 2.3 miles.  This release would spread within the city limits of Forest City in an area containing 3 schools, 27 churches, municipal offices and business establishments.  The estimated, affected population is 5,900 persons.  Accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.  This workplace complies with OSHA Regulation (29CFR 1910.119) accident prevention rules and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The water chlorination system is designed, installed and maintained in accordance with American Water Works Association Guidelines and state law.  Five year accident history - This facility has not had an accident involving chlorine during the past 5 years.  Emergency Response Program - In the event of an emergency involving our wastewater chlorination process, it is our policy to notify the Forest City Fire and Police Departments and request that they respond to th"

Planned changes to improve safety.  Emerging technologies that may offer the same benefits as wastewater chlorination with the use of less hazardous materials are constantly being evaluated.  If a cost-effective system becomes available, every attempt will be made to implement it."
