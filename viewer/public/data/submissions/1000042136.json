This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with CHATTANOOGA FIRE DEPARTMENT which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Distribution of chemical products.  We have two (2) regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances are Chlorine & Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous).  Chlorine is received into Chattanooga in 180,000 pound railcars.  The product is then repackaged in different  containers for distribution to customers.  Chlorine is also used in the production of Sodium Hypochlorite.  Chlorine related processes are Prevention Program Level 3.  Sulfur Dioxide is received prepackaged in different containers.  Sulfur dioxide storage, warehousing and distribution activities are Prevention Program 2.  Chlorine & Sulfur Dioxide containers are used only for resell to our customers.\r\n\r\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 1,080,000 lbs. while Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) is present at our facility at 50,000 lbs.\r\n\r\nThe facility now intends to store, warehouse and distribute prepackaged containers of Ammonium Hydroxide in amounts that exceed the regulated threshold quantity.  Thus, this substance is hereby added to this submission.  Activities related"

This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA STANDARD 30-1996).  A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.\r\n\r\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of our release prevention program that are in place at our stationary source.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nBrenntag Mid-South, Inc. maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is WHAT IF the studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of three years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Brenntag Mid-South, Inc. maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nBrenntag Mid-South, Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees that are op"

A railcar motion detection system has been installed that will actuate shutoff valves should unexpected movement occur.  Also, a backflow prevention system has been installed on the chlorine railcar padding system to prevent backflow of chlorine into the air compressor."
