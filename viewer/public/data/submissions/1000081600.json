However, if a release does occur, facility personnel will respond to the release to ensure the release is contained and controlled.\r\n\r\nAs a Program 3 source, MAPEI has developed a written PSM Management System to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic events from process related incidents or releases at the West Chicago polymer plant. This includes releases of regulated substances such as vinyl acetate monomer or flammable substances.  The PSM system addresses the following program elements:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tEmployee Participation \r\n\u00bf\tProcess Safety Information\r\n\u00bf\tProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\u00bf\tOperating Procedures\r\n\u00bf\tTraining\r\n\u00bf\tMechanical Integrity\r\n\u00bf\tManagement of Change\r\n\u00bf\tPre-Startup Safety Review\r\n\u00bf\tCompliance Audits\r\n\u00bf\tIncident Investigation\r\n\u00bf\tSafe Work Practices\r\n\u00bf\tContractors.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the requirements for a Program 2 process, MAPEI has developed a release prevention program that applies to processes that use aqua ammonia. The prevention program at consists of the following program elements:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tSafety Information\r\n\u00bf\tHazard Review\r\n\u00bf\tOperating Procedures\r\n\u00bf\tTraining\r\n\u00bf\tMaintenance\r\n\u00bf\tCompliance Audits \r\n\u00bf\tIncident Investigation.\r\n\r\n\tFive Year Accident History\r\nThe RMP regulations require a subject source to compile a five-year accident history.  This is defined as 'all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage' (40 CFR Part 68.42). \r\n\r\nWithin the past five years, the MAPEI West Chicago site has had no accidental releases of vinyl acetate or aqua ammonia that resulted in the consequences listed in 40 CFR Part 68.42. \r\n\r\n\tEmergency Response Program \r\nMAPEI's emergency response plan emphasizes handling of accidental releases of"

      "SummaryText": "The MAPEI polymer plant is located in West Chicago, Illinois. The MAPEI facility manufactures polymers for adhesives, sealants, and structural reinforcements for domestic flooring applications.  The polymers are manufactured from various monomers, including vinyl acetate, which is listed under 40 CFR 68.130 as a regulated toxic substance.\r\n\r\nVinyl acetate is stored in two 13,000-gallon storage tanks located in an outdoor tank farm at the MAPEI facility. One tank can be charged to 90% of its fill capacity (11,700 gallons) in accordance with internal administrative limits. At full capacity, up to 90,000 pounds of vinyl acetate can be stored in the tank. Vinyl acetate is listed in 40 CFR 68.130 as a regulated toxic substance with a threshold quantity of 15,000 pounds  The facility's use and storage of vinyl acetate is therefore a covered process and is subject to the risk management program requirements.\r\n\r\nMAPEI also uses aqua ammonia in concentrations of 28% in its acrylic manufacturing lines.  The ammonia is stored in a 7,250-gallon indoor tank and may be transferred to 110 gallon ammonia day tanks before use. The ammonia storage tank can be charged to 90% of its fill capacity in accordance with internal administrative limits. At full capacity, up to 54,000 pounds of aqua ammonia can be stored in the tank. Aqua ammonia (concentration greater than 20%) is listed in 40 CFR 68.130 as a regulated toxic substance with a threshold quantity of 20,000 pounds  The facility's use and storage of vinyl acetate is therefore a covered process and is subject to the risk management program requirements.\r\n\r\n\tAccidental Release Prevention Program\r\nMAPEI is committed to the safe operation of the subject processes at the West Chicago polymer plant. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources MAPEI has invested in accident prevention, including training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the processes that involve vinyl aceta"
