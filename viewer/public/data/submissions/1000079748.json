Senior management jobs description defined roles and responsibilities to ensure compliance with EHS regulations.    \r\n\r\nBaxter Guayama manufactures three types of anesthesia: Isoflurane, Desflurane, Sevoflurane.  Chlorine and Hydrofluoric Acid are used in the manufacturing reaction process.   \r\n\r\n1)   Hydrofluoric Acid, Anhydrous 100 % CAS No. 7664-39-3:\r\nThis substance is found above threshold limits in the manufacturing process known as Desflurane and Sevoflurane. \r\nThere is a storage tank for the substance (66, 640 lbs. based on full capacity), from this tank each manufacturing process transfer the substance to a Shot Pot (transfer vessel). There is one shot pot for the Desflurane Process and one for the Sevoflurane process. From the Shot Pot the substance is transfer to the Fluorination Reactor. Tanks are connected to an emergency scrubber system. At the Desflurane process there are two Fluorination Reactors although only one can be used at a time in the reaction step. At the Sevoflurane process there is one Fluorination reactor.  Also an Iso-container is included in this process (41,477 lbs) because the iso-contain"

Also safety systems like alarms, fire system are verified as part of the program. Shutdowns are scheduled throughout the year. Mechanical Integrity Testing is conducted based on the requirements by applicable codes, standards and regulations by specialized contractors and onsite personnel. \r\n\r\nCompliance audits are regularly conducted and comply with RMP Program elements. \r\n\r\nIn the past five years Baxter didn't have any reportable accident as per RMP requirement.  Baxter has a program for Accident/Incident Investigation in which incidents are notified and investigated.  Not only incidents/accidents related to environmental release also related to safety, property damage, product loss, security, occupational health and near misses are investigated  as part of the program. \r\nAs part of the report factors that contribute to the incidents are identified.
