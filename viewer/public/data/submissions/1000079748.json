The EHS (Environmental, Health and Safety) manager reports to the Plant Manager and assure that every job, task, project, etc. that will be perform its been evaluate in term of EHS.  \n\n\n\nFor the Process Safety Program and Risk Management Program roles and responsibilities are defined to assure all changes and repairs are completed following Good Engineering Practices. \n\n\n\nBaxter has policies and local procedures that defined programs to prevent accidental release and to respond to any emergency in the case that would be neccesary. Senior management jobs description defined roles and responsibilities to ensure compliance with EHS regulations.    \n\n\n\nBaxter Guayama manufactures three types of anesthesia: Isoflurane, Desflurane, Sevoflurane.

There is one shot pot for the Desflurane Process and one for the Sevoflurane process. From the Shot Pot the substance is transfer to the Fluorination Reactor. Tanks are connected to an emergency scrubber system. At the Desflurane process there are two Fluorination Reactors although only one can be used at a time in the reaction step. At the Sevoflurane process there is one Fluorination reactor.  Also an Iso-container is included in this process (41,477 lbs) because the iso-contain"
