      "SummaryText": "1.0    EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND CERTIFICATION\n\n1.1    SITE INFORMATION\nThe main operation of Delta St. Gabriel is contract chemical packaging, warehousing and distribution.  The facility was completed and began operation in 2010.  The facility is located at 4200 Geigy Access Rd, St. Gabriel, Louisiana 70776.\n\n1.2    ACIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICES\nDelta St. Gabriel Off-site Warehouse is committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, instillation, operating procedures, maintenance and employee training on facility processes. It is Delta's policy to implement appropriate controls to reduce and prevent the release of regulated substances. Delta has trained personnel on site to assist in emergency release response.\n\n1.3     THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\nDelta St. Gabriel Off-site Warehouse primary activity is the warehousing and distribution of chemicals. The regulated substance handled by the facility is listed below.  Delta St. Gabriel Off-site Warehouse receives the regulated substances in 55-gallon drums for storage.  Inventory is dependent upon customer orders and the regulated substance may not always be present onsite. \n\nChemical    CAS No.\nToxic Substances:    \nToluene 2,4 Diisocyanate    584-84-9\nToluene 2,6 Diisocyanate    91-08-7\n\n1.4    THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\nDelta St. Gabriel Off-site Warehouse is the operator of a stationary source that has more than the threshold quantity of a regulated substance in storage, as determined under 40 CFR 68.115 and therefore is subject to 40 CFR Part 68 - Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions. Delta St. Gabriel Off-site Warehouse is a Program 2 level facility.\nTo evaluate the worst case and alternative scenarios, EPA's RMP*Comp program was used to evaluate off-site consequences.  RMP*Comp is based on the look-up tables and equ"

      "SummaryText": "ations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst-case scenarios for the two toxic chemicals involve the dropping of four drums and release of their entire content inside the warehouse (est. 220 gallons). The alternative release scenarios involve the puncture of a drum and release of its entire contents inside the warehouse (est. 55 gallons). Neither one of these scenarios is likely to result in the actual loss of the entire amount of the regulated substances from the vessel because of onsite personnel and other mitigation techniques, but for the worst case and alternative case scenarios these situations were used as potential possibilities that could have offsite consequences, as required by 40 CFR 68.25 and 40 CFR 68.28.\n\n1.5    THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nDelta St. Gabriel Off-site Warehouse has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68. The packaging and warehouse process at the facility is not subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. Delta St. Gabriel is subject to EPCRA Section 313 notification requirements. The following sections briefly describe elements of the release prevention program that is in place at the stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information  \nDelta St. Gabriel Off-site Warehouse maintains a record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the process. There is no transfer of TDI at the facility, only storage.\n\nProcess Hazard Review\nThis facility conducts process hazard reviews to ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled efficiently. The checklist and what if methods are used to carry out the process hazard analyses. The process hazard analysis is undertaken by a team of qualifie"

Changes in the operations such as adding TDI to the storage and distribution mix will cause Delta to reevaluate the process using the prescribed hazard analysis and what if scenarios. Any findings related to the reevaluation will be addressed in a timely manner. \n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within the covered process, Delta St. Gabriel Off-site Warehouse maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after maintenance. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\nTraining\nDelta St. Gabriel Off-site Warehouse has a training program in place to ensure that employees are competent in the operating procedures associated with those processes. New employees receive training before starting work. Operating procedures are reviewed annually and more frequently as needed. \n\nMechanical Integrity \nDelta St. Gabriel Off-site Warehouse carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks include among others; fire system, forklift maintenance and equipment used to ship drums. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices and or contracted out to service companies. Personnel receive specialized on the job training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a timely manner. \n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Delta St. Gabriel Off-site Warehouse to manage changes in chemicals being packaged, technology, equipment and procedures.

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment in operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nDelta St. Gabriel Off-site Warehouse conducts compliance audits to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. These audits will be carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions as a result of the audits will be undertaken promptly. \n\nIncident Investigation\nDelta St. Gabriel Off-site Warehouse promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the root cause of the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the incident from recurring. Reports are retained in the web based CMS system.\n\nEmployee Participation\nDelta St. Gabriel Off-site Warehouse believes that incident prevention is a team effort and involves employees in the incident prevention process. Delta employees have access to the information created as part of facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses. \n\nContractors\nOn occasion, the company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities. Delta St. Gabriel Off-site Warehouse has a policy of informing the contactors of known potential hazards related to the contactor's works. Contractors are also informed of emergency procedures should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n1.6     FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere has been no release of RMP chemicals at the Delta St. Gabriel Off-site Warehouse site over the past 5 years.\n\n1.7    EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\nDelta "

The plan covers the aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notifications of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident return to work procedure. \n\nThe plan is updated regularly to reflect relevant changes taking place within the process that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n1.8    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFTY\nThere are no planned changes to the Delta St. Gabriel Off-site Warehouse with the exception of adding TDI to the chemical storage and distribution list and developing and implementing an RMP Plan for the facility. Delta has a continuous improvement policy in place that includes safety improvement. \n"
