      "SummaryText": "IWI NEWPORT NEWS\n\nRefrigeration System Process Description\n\nOverview\n\nThis system is a single stage configuration utilizing computerized control for system operation.  There are a total of five screw compressors that handle the refrigeration loads. Four of the five compressors operate either the           -25A?aF (low temp) or -40A?aF (ultra low temp) packages.  The fifth compressor operates the +25A?aF (high temp).  Three of the compressors have side ports to help maintain the +25A?aF recirculator.  \n\nThere are three separate suction temperatures that handle refrigeration loads.  The -25A?aF low temperature recirculator is utilized to maintain the freezer.  The -40A?aF ultra low temperature recirculator is utilized to maintain the blast freezers.  The +25A?aF high temperature recirculator is utilized to maintain the cooler and dock areas as well as to supply liquid to the low and ultra low suction levels.  \n\nThere are two rooftop mounted evaporative condensers with remote sumps.  There are also four heat exchangers used for under floor heating (two plate and frame and two shell and tube).  A Hansen auto-purger is used to remove non-condensable materials from the system.  A system dump is also incorporated should a need to purge the system arise. \n\n \nProcess Description\n\nLiquid Side\n\nThe liquid supply for the system starts at the Condensers.  The Condensers change superheated vapor discharged from the Compressors and remove a sufficient amount of heat such that the vapor changes to a liquid (condenses).  This condensed liquid leaves Condenser units EC-1 and EC-2 via a system of 4A!A? inch piping and flows to the thermosyphon header and the Thermosyphon Receiver (V-1).  \n\nThe thermosyphon receiver supplies liquid to each screw compressor for cooling of the oil.  These oil coolers are mounted on the side of each screw compressor unit.  The refrigerant in the oil coolers naturally recirculates to and from the Thermosyphon Receiver when there is a heat load.\n\nThe high-p"

The High Temperature Recirculator is operated at +25A?XF.  The liquid supply to V-2 is controlled by a Hanson level control and solenoid.  The liquid from the High Temperature Recirculator is pumped to the +35A?aF cooler and dock evaporators as well as transferred to the Low and Ultra Low Temp Recirculators.  \n\nThe Low Temperature Recirculator (V-3) is operated at -25A?XF.  A Hanson level control and solenoid device controls the liquid supply to V-3.  The liquid from the Low Temperature Recirculator is pumped to the -15A?X F freezer evaporators.\n\nThe Ultra Low Temperature Recirculator (V-4) is operated at -40A?aF.  A Hanson level control and solenoid device controls the liquid supply to V-4.  The liquid from the Ultra Low Temperature Recirculator is pumped to the    -25A?aF blast freezer evaporators.  \n\n\n\n \nVapor Side\n\nThe Compressors remove the vapors from the High Temperature Recirculator, Low Temperature Recirculator and the Ultra Low Temperature Recirculator vessels.  \n\nScrew compressor C-4 removes vapor from the High Temperature Recirculator and Compressors C-1, C-2, and C-5 remove the vapors from the High Temperature Recirculator using a side port (economizer port).  Screw Compressors C-1, C-2, C-3 and C-5 remove vapors from the Low and Ultra Low Temperature Recirculators. \n\nThe discharge of all the compressors, C-1 through C-5, is sent to the main discharge header, which feeds the Condenser units.  The Condensers change superheated vapor discharged from the Compressors and remove a sufficient amount of heat such that the vapor changes to a liquid (condenses).  \n\nSome of the superheated discharge vapors (hot gas) is sent to the heat exchangers for utilization in the underfloor heat system.  These heat exchangers condense the hot gas and utilize this removed heat for increasing the temperature of glycol.  This wa"

This hot gas removes/melts ice from the evaporator coils to in order to maintain an adequate level of heat transfer.  \n\n \nDefinitions\n\nThermosyphon System\n\nA thermosyphon system is a means by which an uninterrupted supply of liquid refrigerant can be supplied to the compressor units.  This liquid utilizes a shell and tube or plate heat exchanger to keep the compressor's oil cooled and thus allowing the units to operate at the Manufacturer's recommended temperature.  \n\nLiquid ammonia is supplied to the inlet of the heat exchanger.  When a heat load is applied to the heat exchanger, some of the liquid is vaporized.  This vapor-liquid mixture that is less dense than a pure liquid.  The denser liquid (supply) displaces the lighter vapor-liquid mixture thus pushing the mixture out of the heat exchanger and back to the Thermosyphon Receiver.  This difference in density creates a natural circulation.\n\n\nSingle Stage Compression System\n\nA single stage compressor system utilizes one or more compressors to pump the refrigerant vapor from the low-pressure side to the high-pressure side of the refrigeration system.  Each compressor discharges directly to the condenser units via a common header. \n\n\nRecirculator System\n\nA recirculator system is a combination of a vessel, pumps, valves and other components used to feed a refrigeration circuit.  The pumps supply liquid to the various evaporators.  The outlet of the evaporators (consisting of liquid and vapor) is returned to the recirculator vessel for separation of the liquid and vapor.\n\nThe application can be either a low temp or high temp application. The liquid feed can be sub-cooled through an intercooler or fed directly from the receiver.\n"
