      "SummaryText": "The Andersons Poneto RMP Executive Summary\n\nSource and Product Description\nThe Andersons Poneto Wholesale Fertilizer is engaged in the handling, storage, shipping and receiving of bulk agricultural fertilizers (liquid and granular).  The facility began operations in 1976 and was purchased by The Andersons, Inc. in 1987.  Key personnel at the Poneto facility are Bill Wolf - Facility Manager and Randy Grandlienard - Liquid Plant Supervisor.\n\nThe facility manufacturers a liquid ammonium polyphosphate fertilizer called 10-34-0 (N-P-K analysis) which is produced by combining anhydrous ammonia, phosphoric acid and water, in a controlled environment.  While the process is exothermic, the resulting heat is managed through a closed-loop process that virtually eliminates the production of a steam plume.  Production rates average 27,000 tons of 10-34-0 fertilizer per year.\n\nThe facility occupies approximately four acres and is situated four miles west of the intersection of State Routes 1 and 218, on the western edge of the town of Poneto.  There is one residence across the road, on the south side of 218.  The town of Poneto is located on the east side of the facility, across the railroad tracks.\n\nTHe RMP-regulated material involved in this fertilizer manufacturing process is anhydrous ammonia.  An 18,000 gallon tank is used for bulk storage of  the material. When filled to the maximum 85% capacity, this tank can hold 15,300 gallons of anhydrous ammonia.  This material is a gas at ambient temperature and pressure.  It is a liquid when stored under pressure inside the tanks.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is not a poison, but it is an inhalation / respiratory hazard.  Ammonia is a toxic material but it has no cumulative toxic effects on the human body.  However, it is acutely corrosive when it comes in contact with mucous membranes, in particular.  Anhydrous ammonia is a non-flammable gas.\n\nSummary of Major Hazards\nThe principal causes of ammonia emergencies is ruptured hoses and defective"

Flexible hoses must be connected properly.  Hoses on tank trucks are date-stamped are replaced by the transporter in advance of the expiration date or when defects are observed.  All transfers of ammonia are observed by Anderson personnel.\n\nTransfers from the storage tanks to the processing system occur inside fixed steel pipes and are automated from the control room.  No hoses are utilized in the operation.  Mass meters are used to indicate the rate of flow.\n\nWith elevated temperatures that occur during mid-to-late summer, the ammonia gas inside the bulk storage tank can expand, and possibly cause the relief valve to open in order to equalize the pressure inside the tank.  The relief valve will reseal itself when pressure is relieved.  These \"events\" are very short in duration - a few seconds at the most.\n\nA complete failure or burst tank is highly unlikely.  The bulk storage tank was built under strict guidelines established in the ASME pressure vessel code.  The tank is protected by concrete traffic barriers.  All welding and structural work done on the tank or appendages are performed by certified welders.  \n\n\nConsequences of Failure to Control the Hazards for Anhydrous Ammonia\nThe worst case scenario for this facility was created using EPA's RMP Comp software.  A complete release of the tank contents (78,795 pounds -- creating a gas / vapor cloud) in a 10 minute period, using worst case atmospheric conditions, results in a distance to endpoint of 3.30 miles.  The estimated exposed population is 500 people.  This distance would encompass the village of Poneto.  No hospitals, prisons or sensitive environmental receptors would be affected.  There are no passive mitigation systems available for this type of scenario.\n\nIt is our belief that the risk of a complete release of the tank contents is infi"

The tank is in a protected location, and all transfer appendages are protected by concrete barriers.\n\nA more probable release situation is expressed by the alternative release scenario.  We believe that a more likely release could occur from a tanker truck transfer hose failure.  Prior to the excess flow valve being activated, we estimate that the maximum amount of ammonia that could escape to the atmosphere is ~ 7,789 pounds. A release of this nature would likely last for about ten minutes.  Utilizing an average wind speed of 3.0 m/sec and atmospheric stability class D,  the resulting distance to endpoint would be 0.20 miles.   In this more realistic scenario, the only potential exposed receptors would be the residences directly across the railroad track from the facility.  \n\nExplanation of How Hazard Releases are Prevented.\nPassive mitigation refers to equipment, devices, or technologies that function without human, mechanical or other energy input.  Passive mitigation systems in place at the Poneto facility are:\n? Secondary containment dikes that meet or exceed regulatory standards.\n? Bulkhead breakaway units located on the connection point to the storage tanks. If a truck driver were to drive off without disconnecting from the tank, the steel structure would cause the hose to break at the outside of the connection point.  At this point, active mitigation would take effect and an excess flow valve, just to the inside of the breakaway would prevent the tank from emptying to the atmosphere.\n \n Active mitigation refers to equipment, devices or technologies that require human, mechanical or other energy input to function.  Active mitigation systems in place at the Poneto facility are:\n? Excess flow valves are located on all outgoing liquid and vapor valves on the storage tanks.  They close automatically if the volume of gas or "

      "SummaryText": "liquid flowing through the line exceeds the normal flow rate.  They won't reopen until the downstream shutoff valve is closed and the pressure equalizes on both sides of the valve seat.  Two principal causes of the excess valve closing are a ruptured hose or a broken pipe or shutoff valve downstream that is opened too quickly.\n? Back check valves are located on the unloading lines of delivery trucks and are designed to ensure that the flow goes in one direction only.  This prevents anhydrous ammonia from flowing to a transport tank from the storage tanks.\n? Pressure-relief valves (four) are located on the top of the bulk storage tank, fixed steel piping and on the vaporizer to relieve pressure that is too great.  This can be caused by elevated temperatures in the summer or overfilling.  They open directly to the atmosphere at 250 psig and close when the pressure inside the tank drops below this pressure.\n? An emergency shutoff switch, located along the side of the ammonia storage tank activates the emergency shutoff valves on the discharge side of the ammonia pump. \n? An ample supply of water is available near the bulk storage tank from a nearby water tank and a nearby 25,000 sq. ft. pond to help knock down a vapor cloud.  There is also an adjacent water well.\n? Spill control kits are located at the facility and include sorbent material, shovels, PPE and disposal containers.\n? Operator and truck drivers supervise all anhydrous transfers to and from the bulk storage tank\n\nPrevention Program\nPreventive maintenance is an integral piece of this facility's hazard management program.  All hoses, tanks, valves and storage units are inspected at least monthly, and usually daily during the production season.  A good PM program is our strongest defense against a release of anhydrous ammonia.  All hose replacements are documented in the maintenance files.  Records of all maintenance tasks performed on the tank or appendages are also on file.\n\nThis facility uses Paul Akars, Inc"
