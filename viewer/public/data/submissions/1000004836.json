As part of this commitment, Osram has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  Toward that end, Osram operates within a Quality Management System, certified under ISO 9002, and an Environmental Management System, certified under ISO 14001.  A non-Osram, independent party audits both systems.  Another system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at Osram and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at Osram.  This plan is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirement of the RMP rule (\u00c2\u00a768.150 through \u00c2\u00a768.185) and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at Osram.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES: Osram is committed to the safety of Osram workers and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Osram implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  In the event of an accidental release, Osram controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injury to the public or the environment.\n\nOSRAM, WELLSBORO FACILITY and REGULATED SUBSTANCES: The Osram, Wellsboro plant processes raw materials by melting them to form glass envelopes for the lighting industry.  The energy required to turn the raw materials into molten glass is provided by natural gas, with propane as a back-up energy sou"

      "SummaryText": "rce.  The Osram Company also processes glass envelopes and uses hydrofluoric acid and aqueous ammonia in its glass etching process.  The etching process produces frosted lighting envelopes.  \n\nHydrofluoric Acid: HF acid at solution concentrations of 50-weight % or greater is regulated by the RMP rule.  Although only dilute (about 28 weight %) HF solutions are used in an etching process; HF acid at a solution concentration of 70-weight % is stored in a large tank at the Osram facility for use in the process.\n\nA maximum of 5,330 gallons of 70-weight % HF acid is stored in one 5,922-gallon tank located at the Osram site.  The weight of HF acid in 5,330 gallons of 70-weight % solution exceeds the RMP rule threshold quantity for HF acid in a process (1,000 lb.)  Because the HF acid storage process is not covered by requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u00c2\u00bfs process safety management regulation and because the potential exists for offsite consequences resulting from an accidental release of HF acid, the process falls under the RMP Program 2 prevention program.\n\nIn calendar year 2003, a large bulk tank with a capacity of 12,000 gallons of 30% weight aqueous Ammonia was decommissioned, removed, and replaced with a smaller, 5,623 gallon, tank. The Ammonia storage process is below the threshold quantity, and Ammonia has been removed from this RMP.\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS: A summary of the offsite consequence analysis (OCA) for the worst-case and alternative release scenario is no longer required to be included in this Executive Summary. OSRAM has completed the OCA worst-case and alternative release scenarios for 70% HF. \n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM and CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS: The RMP rule requires a Program 2 prevention program for the aqueous HF process.  The following paragraphs describe the prevention program elements at Osram that apply to this unit.\n\nSafety information: Osram maintains a variety of technical docume"

Material safety data sheets document the physical properties of hazardous substances handled at Osram, including HF acid.  The engineering design documents include the operating parameters, the design basis and configuration of the equipment in the covered process, and references to applicable codes and standards.\n\nHazard review: Osram performs and periodically updates a hazard review of the covered process to help identify and control process hazards.  Checklists are used to guide the hazard review.  These checklists include items to help ensure that Osram operates and maintains the equipment in a manner consistent with the applicable design specifications, codes, standards and regulations.\n\nOperating procedures: Osram develops and maintains operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be performed.  The operating procedures are used to (1) train employees and contractors and (2) serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.  All operating procedures, instructions and records fall within the Quality Management System, certified under ISO 9002, or the Environmental Management System, certified under ISO 14001.\n\nTraining:  Osram trains personnel in the operating procedures to help ensure safe and effective performance of their assigned tasks.  A training documentation file is maintained to help ensure that refresher training is provided as necessary.  All training procedures, instructions and record keeping fall within the ISO 9002 or ISO 14001 systems.\n\nMaintenance:  Osram properly maintains the process equipment.  The Osram maintenance program includes ISO 9002 or 14001 procedures to (1) safely guide workers in their maintenance tasks, (2) train workers in the maintenance procedures, and (3) inspect and test equipment and processes to identify deterioration and damage before the equipment fails.\n\nCom"

      "SummaryText": "pliance audits: Osram performs periodic compliance audits, of the covered process to verify that the process is operating in compliance with the requirements of the RMP rule.  A compliance audit checklist is completed during each audit, and any deficiencies noted by the audit are corrected in a timely manner. \n\nIncident investigations: Osram investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment.  Osram trains employees to identify and report any incident requiring investigation.  An investigation team is assembled, and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.\n\nProcess-specific prevention steps: Industry standards are followed at Osram to help ensure safe handling of aqueous HF.  The vendor for this material supplies it via Department of Transportation (DOT) approved tank trucks, and follows DOT standards when loading the Osram storage tank.  The covered process storage tank design and construction are consistent with American National Standards Institute standards.  All employees receive documented annual training in Right-to-Know and Emergency Response Procedures at the Awareness Level.  Workers who perform operations involving the covered process receive training emphasizing safe handling procedures developed by Osram.  An Osram HAZMAT Team of certified technicians is available for material releases.\n\nFive-year Accident History: Osram maintains a 5-year accident history that fulfills the requirements of the RMP rule (\u00c2\u00a768.42).  No releases of regulated substances have occurred from Osram in the last 5 years that have resulted in consequences of interest, or that had the potential to result in consequences of interest.\n\nEmergency Response Programs: Osram has established written response plans that comply with the RMP rule and with other f"

This plan has been communicated to local emergency response officials through the Tioga County Emergency Management Agency, and the Wellsboro Fire Department.  Regular dialogue is maintained between Osram and the Tioga County Local Emergency Planning Committee through the Osram Environmental Engineer, who is the vice Chairman of the LEPC.  Osram provides appropriate information to the Wellsboro fire chief, and a lock-box with the Facility Off-Site Response Plan is kept at the plant entrance, for the fire chief.  Osram periodically conducts emergency response drills, including drills coordinated with the fire department and the LEPC.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety: Osram constantly strives to improve the safety of the processes through both the incident investigation program and a program soliciting safety suggestions from the workers.  The following changes to improve process safety are planned or have been recently completed:\n\u00c2\u00b7\tAll 70% HF piping was replaced from the bulk tank to the use points.\n\u00c2\u00b7\tThe concrete containment was coated with a proprietary compound to increase impermeability in the event of a tank leak.\n\u00c2\u00b7\tA new HF unloading station, with spill containment, was built to accommodate truck deliveries of 70% HF.\n\u00c2\u00b7\tThe bulk 70% HF tank was replaced in 2004 with a new tank of the same capacity."
