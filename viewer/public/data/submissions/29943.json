The facility is located along the south side of 4th Street (Highway 16), and has been at this location since 1969.  The nature of the business involves swine slaughter and processing of pork products for commercial distribution.  The Holton pork processing facility has very few hazardous or toxic chemicals on site.  Our facility's refrigeration system uses anhydrous ammonia as refrigerant.\n\nOldhams LLC is committed to maintaining our ammonia equipment in safe condition, and to providing our personnel with training in safe operating procedures.  This facility has never had an accidental release of ammonia from our facility which resulted in adverse health effects to the public or to our employees, or in property damage.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nOldham's LLC is dedicated to maintaining our ammonia refrigeration system in a safe manner.  We have clear lines of authority and responsibility with respect to all aspects of our release prevention program, leading directly to the Plant Manager.  We maintain current safety information on ammonia and our ammonia refrigeration equipment, and review any potential hazards that may be associated with the storage and use of ammonia at our facility.  \n\nWe train both our operating and maintenance personnel in our procedures and safe practices.  New employees are trained before being allowed to work on ammonia equipment without close supervision, and periodic refresher training is provided.  Any time significant changes occur in equipment or processes which could potentially impact the storage or use of ammonia, affected employees are retrained.  We inspect and audit the ammonia refrigeration system, using both in-house staff and experienced professionals from outside the company.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\nBecause ammonia is a toxic substance above EPA\u00bfs Clean Air Act Risk Management Program threshold"

The plan designates specific actions and procedures to be followed in the event of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia, and designates primary and secondary incident commanders.  It also includes contact information for responsible Oldhams\u00bf personnel and emergency response agencies."
