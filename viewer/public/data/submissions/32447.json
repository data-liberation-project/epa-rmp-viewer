      "SummaryText": "The Velsicol Chemical Corporation's Memphis Tennessee plant has prepared this Risk Management Plan (RMP) in accordance with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) regulations under the federal Clean Air Act.  The elements of this RMP, dealing with the safe handling and management of chemicals, have been in place and in practice at the plant for many years.\n\nPolicies and procedures regarding the prevention of accidental releases of chemicals, as well as those describing how we respond to accidental releases and other types of potential emergencies, are well established at the plant.  These are described in detail in the Plant Emergency Control Plan.\n\nThe chemical substances handled at the plant addressed in this RMP (i.e. \"regulated substances\") are chlorine and hydrazine.  Velsicol has no flammable chemicals covered by the rule.  The areas in the plant where these two chemicals are handled in the largest quantities (i.e. \"covered processes\" as defined in 40 CFR 68.3) are:\n   1.  One or two 90 ton chlorine railcars located at the chlorine unloading area on the east (Warford Street) side of the plant and the associated 9 ton chlorine storage tanks.\n   2.  One 4500 gallon storage tank of hydrazine adjacent to the chlorine unloading area in the central part of the plant.\nFor these specific regulated substances and covered processes, the rule requires that a single \"worst case release scenario\" analysis be prepared.  The rule further requires preparation of an \"alternate case release scenario\" for each of these chemicals and covered processes.\n\nA comprehensive program described in a number of manuals and procedures designed to prevent accidental releases of any chemicals used at the plant has been in place for many years and includes:\n   1.  Process safety information located throughout the plant;\n   2.  Process hazard reviews conducted on all manufacturing processes;\n   3.  Detailed written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for safe"

      "SummaryText": "operation of each process;\n   4.  Regular employee training on process operating procedures, safety, emergency operation/shutdown, and chemical hazard communication;\n   5.  Maintaining mechanical integrity of process equipment through regular inspection, testing, and preventive maintenance;\n   6.  Management of changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures to insure continued safe operation;\n   7.  Pre-startup safety reviews for new or modified processes;\n   8.  Periodic compliance reviews to evaluate whether procedures and practices to prevent accidental releases are adequate and are being followed;\n   9.  Routine investigation of any incidents which resulted in, or could have resulted in, a release of chemicals;\n   10.  Employee participation in process hazards analyses, development of process safety procedures, and full access to all information required under RMP.\n\nOver the past five years, the plant has had no accidental releases from processes covered in this RMP that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on or off the plant site.  In the event of an accidental release, the plant would activate its Emergency Control Plan.  This plan specifies actions to be taken in response to any release.  The plan includes procedures for making notifications to parties outside the plant and is fully coordinated with the local Emergency Management Aency's plan.\n\nThe plant continuously strives to improve the safety of its operations through its Central Safety Committee which meets on a regular basis."
