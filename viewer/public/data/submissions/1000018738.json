      "SummaryText": "To ensure employee safety and reduce the potential for exposure to the public, Allegheny County - North Park Pool takes several steps.  All employees are trained on the hazards of chlorine and safe handling of hazardous materials in the facility.  The stationary engineers (operators) working with the chlorine gas are trained in safe operating procedures, proper safety equipment use and care and maintenance operations.\n\nChlorine gas is used to treat the pool.  The gas is kept on-site for the summer months only (June-August of each year).  The process is only in operation during the day, only when the Stationary Engineer is present.  Chlorine gas is used rather than solid form due to the unusually large  of the pool.  The chlorine is located inside the pump room in four one ton cylinders.  Two cylinders are used for chlorination and two are kept off-line in reserve.\n\nIn the case of a catastrophe, the worst case scenario would involve the release of the contenets of two cylinders in a twenty minute period.  According to the EPA's RMP Guidance for Waste Treatment Plants Reference Tables, the contents of one cylinder would be released in ten minutes at a rate of 200 lbs. per minute.  The release would have an impact on the environment and population up to a distance of 1.3 miles in an urban setting.  Since the cylinders are located in an enclosed building, the impact would be less.  A more likely occurrence would involve a leak in the cylinder, valves, connectors, or piping involved in the process.  According to the RMP Guide, if damage was done to a cylinder during the loading or unloading procedure, the impact would cover 0.1 mile.\n\nNorth Park Pool has implemented a prevention program to reduce the protential for an accident.  The process equipment is measured against best practice and complies with OSHA and NFPA guidelines.  Equipment manual are used to set up maintenace and inspection schedules.  Operators are trained on procedures, safe handling of chlorine, and ins"

All employees are also trained in evacuation procedures, use of safety equipment and public notification procdures.  Employee training and retraining will be conducted and documented according to SARA Title III requirements.  Scheduled and preventative maintenance procedures will also be documented to ensure that the potential for failure is reduced.\n\nThe fcaility emergency response plan has been approved by the Local Emergency Planning Committee of Allegheny County.  A Chlorine gas detector is installed to notify the operators of a leak.  This detector also has a direct phone line to the fire department, which notifies the Hazmat team immediately.  An audible and visual alarm will notify employees of an emergency.  Barry Bristow, Lead Stationary Engineer, may be contacted at (412) 935-1950 during daytime hours and (412) 369-7501 on his mobile phone.  In the case of an emergency, he will notify the Allegheny County Police Department, McCandless Township Fire Department, Allegheny County Hazmat Silver team, SARA, PA Emergency Response Commission, Emergency Medical Services, and National Response Center, if necessary."
