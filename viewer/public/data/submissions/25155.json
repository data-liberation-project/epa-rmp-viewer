If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the\n Rowan Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nDescription of Facility:\n This facility is a retail farm supplier. We sell anhydrous ammonia to famers for the purpose of crop\n production. On site we have a 30,000 gallon and an 8,000 gallon storage tank for anhydrous ammonia.\n These tanks are filled to a amximum of 85% capacity to allow for product expansion.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario:\n Our worst case scenario is a gas release from one of the storage tanks. According to EPA's RMP Comp\n the distance to endpoint is 3.20 miles. There are residences within the distance to endpoint, with a total\n of 267 peolpe being affected.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario:\nOur alternative release scenario is a transfer hose failure. According to EPA's RMP Comp, the distance to end point is 0.20 miles. There are residences within the distance to endpoint with a total of one person being affected.\n\nThis facility has excess flow valves and emergency shutoffs in place to minimze the chances of an accident. All personnel are trained annually in the safe operation of the equipment and facility. We have also installed concrete barricades in traffic pattern areas in an effort to eliminate the threat of vehicular accident.\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable federal, state and local codes\n and regulations. This facility is annually inspected by in-house personnel and by the Iowa Department\nof Agriculture.\n\nFive-Year Accident History:\n We have never had an accident involving anhydrous ammo"
