The smaller radius shown represents the alternate-case scenario.  Maps were created using ARCGIS 8.3 2000 census data was used to generate the population data for the areas within each radius of concern.\n\nThe worst-case scenario is based on a catastrophic failure of the chlorine holding tank due to corrosion, impacts, or structural failure.  The entire 2,000 pound tank capacity is assumed to disperse at a rate of 200 pounds per minute for a period of ten minutes.\n\nWorst-case distance to toxic endpoint for 2,000 pound chlorine release is 1.3 miles.\n\nThe modeled distance to the toxic endpoint for chlorine under the alternate-case scenario is as follows:  92 pounds of chlorine to a distance of 0.1 miles.\n\nSid Copeland, Superintendent at the City of Louisville Water Treatment Plant is a qualified individual with overall responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the RMP.  He has the authority to commit resources required to implement the Risk Management Program.\n\nThe City of Louisville Water Treatment Plant is a non-responding facility and emergency responses permissible by the City of Louisville Water Treatment Facility personnel are responses to incidental releases of hazardous substances where the substance can be absorbed, neutralized, or otherwise controlled at the time of release, as well as releases of hazardous substances where there is no potential safety or health hazard (i.e., fire, explosion, or chemical exposure) by employees in the immediate release area and by maintenance personnel.\n\nThere have been no reportable accidents involving chlorine at the water treatment plant within"
