Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at Chemtura Taft.\nThe facility is committed to ensuring the safety of the St. Charles Parish Community by the rigorous implementation of the accident prevention and emergency response procedures.  Chemtura?s Taft Facility adheres to the Responsible Care Codes, and is ISO14001 certified for its Environmental Management Systems.  Chemtura Corporation follows its Environmental Health and Safety Policy which dictates senior management?s commitment to protecting its employees and the surrounding community.\n\n2.  Regulated Substances Handled at Chemtura's Taft Facility.\nThe facility employs 273  people who live and work in the St. Charles Parish area.  Chemtura has been in business at the same location since 1966. The facility produces plastic additives including epoxidized vegetable oils, organo-tin stabilizers, sulfur compounds, and mixed metals stabilizers.   Our products are used in Louisiana and globally in the production of plastics and polymers used on a daily basis.  The facility has three toxic chemicals in threshold quantities affected by the RMP rule - ammonia (anhydrous and aqueous), methyl chloride, and carbon disulfide.\n\nThe covered processes arethe DMT process and SCN/MMP/Tin Stabilizer Process.  SCn MMP, and Tin Stabilizers are treated as one covered process because they all utilize a single anhydrous storage vessel, inconnected by process piping.\n\n3. Accident Release Prevention Program and chemical-specific prevention steps. \nThe facility implements OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) rules to minimize chemical process accidents. The key to these process management practices are:\n\n   Collection and maintenance of good process safety information\n   Process hazard analysis studies conducted by the employees\n   Mechanical integrity testing of the process equipment\n   Operating procedures and training\n   Management of change\n   P"

      "SummaryText": "re-startup safety reviews\n   Emergency response procedures and incident investigation\n\n4. Five year accident history.\nChemtura is required to compile an accident release history for the RMP listed chemicals for the past five years.  According to the RMP rule, an accidental release is defined as one that resulted in death, injuries, significant property damage, evacuations, shelter-in-place, or environmental damage.  The facility has had no RMP releases over the past five years. \n\n5. Emergency Response Program. \nChemtura has documented emergency response procedures to respond to various emergency situations, including fire/explosion, hazardous material releases, severe weather, bomb threats, etc.  One of the key features of the facility response program is the dedicated phone system tied to the St. Charles Parish Department of Emergency Preparedness (DEP). This Department can call in assistance from the Parish Police, Fire Department, Hospitals and adjacent chemical facilities to mitigate and control emergency situations. The Department can also alert the community as to the steps to take in response to emergency situations. \n\n6. Planned Changes to improve safety.\nThe facility is currently relocating Methyl Chloride storage to a less populated area of the facility.  The equipment, which includes a tank and vaporizers, is located near our Tin Unit control room.  By moving this equipment to a relatively unpopulated area, less employees will be affected if there is an accidental release and/or explosion."
