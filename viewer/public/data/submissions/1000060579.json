WinCo currently operates 8 retail grocery stores in the State of Texas that will be supplied out of WinCo's newest Distribution Center (DC) located in Denton, TX, which is scheduled to open January 2017. WinCo's Denton DC will employee approximately 120 and will utilize anhydrous ammonia  for refrigeration of perishable grocery products in storage. Anhydrous ammonia is subject to EPA Regulation under 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Risk Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals. \n\n\n\nPursuant to RMP Regulations and OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations, WinCo has developed a comprehensive RMP/PSM written program to protect employees and the surrounding community from exposure to hazardous chemicals (anhydrous ammonia) located on site. the facility completed a process hazard analysis (PHA) for the ammonia refrigeration system using the industry standard What-If Checklist Analysis developed through the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR). The PHA was completed using the Refrigeration Contractor that was building the system, the general contractor, the refrigeration contractor retained by WinCo to operate and maintain the refrigeration system, Facility Maintenance Managers from WinCo's other ammonia refrigerated DC's, WinCo's Warehouse Manager for the Denton DC and WinCo's Director of Environmental Compliance.  The PHA was facilitated by an experienced RMP/PSM refrigeration engineer from Republic Refrigeration.\n\n\n\nWinCo's implementation of the RMP/PSM program includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce employee and community exposure to accidental releases. The Plan includes a regular preventative maintenance program (Mechanical Integrity) for the ammonia refrigeration system components, and a program for both pre-startup safety reviews and management of change (MOC) to the ammonia refrigeration system."

Facility Management is involved in the operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system and its compliance with all applicable regulations.  WinCo's employees are involved  in the development of the facilities RMP/PSM program. WinCo management is committed to working with local agencies and the community to educate the public regarding the hazards of ammonia and to ensure a safe environment.
