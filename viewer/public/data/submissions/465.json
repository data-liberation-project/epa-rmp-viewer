The Facility processes corn and sorghum to produce fuel grade ethanol, grain neutral spirits, carbon dioxide, and a high protein cattle feed.  Anhydrous Ammonia is used in the process to adjust and control pH during the initial breakdown of starch to sugar.  Ammonia also provides essential nutrients to the yeast that process sugar to alcohol.  Anhydrous Ammonia is stored at the facility in quantities no greater than 140,000 lbs.\n\nThe process design, process technology, process changes, operational and maintenance activities and procedures, non-routine activities and procedures, emergency plans and procedures, training programs, and other elements that effect the process are all considered in this plan.  Through this plan we intend to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic chemicals as these releases could result in toxic hazards and cause harm to persons or the environment.\n\nChemical Safety Statement\n\nHigh Plains Corporation owns and operates a manufacturing plant converting corn and sorghum grain into fuel ethanol and kindred spirits.  At the York Ethanol Facility, safety is a way of life both on and off the job.  Personal injuries can be prevented and no job is so important that it should be performed in an unsafe manner.  Safety at this plant is the responsibility of all employees.\n\nManagers and Supervisors are responsible for the safety of all persons who report to or are assigned to them.  This responsibility is carried out by assuring that a sound Safety Program is in place including designing, maintaining and operating equipment in a safe manner, assuring training and education is completed for"

We continue with training programs that inform employees of standard operating procedures, safe work practices, emergency evacuation, safety procedures, routine and non-routine work authorization activities, confined space entry, lockout/tagout, and many other areas as necessary to protect the employee and process. \n\nOur training uses many aspects of current training techniques: these include hands-on, classroom, on-the-job, video programs, written materials and any other technique necessary to provide clear and effective training to our employees.  Employees are fully informed as to the goals and objectives of the training and what is considered acceptable performance for duties they are to perform.  All employees are tested or quizzed to assure their competence and knowledge in each area of training.\n\nSpecific training in the operating procedures, control, precautions, pre-startup, mechanical integrity, inspection, testing, quality assurance, hot work permits, management of change, and emergency planning and response is provided for all employees working and involved with highly hazardous chemicals at our facility.  \n\nRefresher training shall be provided as determined.  We shall assure that the employee involved understands and adheres to the current operating procedures of the process.  Once training has been completed and the employee is \"on the job\" there will be an evaluation of the employee's performance. If this evaluation is below acceptable performance levels we will further train the employee to provide the described results and resolve any deficiency.  This training shall be provided as often as necessary but in no case will it be less than once e"

This record contains the identity of the employee, the dates of training, and the means used to verify that the employee understood the training.\n\nIncident Investigation:\n\nThe intent of the High Plains Corp. incident investigation is to identify the underlying causes of these incidents and implement steps to prevent similar events from occurring.  We perform these incident investigations to learn from past experiences and thus avoid repeating past mistakes.  Incidents are events that are sometimes referred to as \"near misses,\" meaning that a serious consequence did not occur, but could have.  For this reason we intend to investigate all incidents and especially those which resulted in, or could have resulted in a catastrophic release of a highly hazardous chemical in the workplace.\n\nAll incident investigations will be promptly documented and shall never be initiated later than 24 hours following the incident.  Time is of the essence when performing an incident investigation so that facts do not become confused with the passage of time.\n\nInitiation of the incident report is the responsibility of the supervisor in charge.\n\nEmployees in the process area where the incident occurs will be consulted and interviewed.  Their knowledge of the events represents a significant set of facts about the incident that occurred.  The cooperation of employees is essential to an investigation.  The focus of our investigation is to obtain facts, and not to place blame.  The investigation process will clearly deal with all involved individuals in a fair, open, and consistent manner.\n\nThe report prepared at the conclusion of the investigation will include the following at a minimum: Date of incident, time and date investigation began, a complete description of the incident, all factors that contributed to the incident,"

These plans include emergency evacuation as per current OSHA guidelines (29 CFR 1910.38). Annual training and drills are conducted to ensure that our employees are equipped to act promptly and professionally to an emergency.  Full details of the emergency action plan are maintained in the company safety manual, copies of which are accessible to all employees and contractors.  Included in the emergency action plan are procedures that will ensure prompt and accurate notification of local emergency response personnel.\n\nWe also have supplied the local emergency response planning committee with information regarding our hazards, site plan, and facility layout, as well as information pertaining to our worst case and alternative scenarios. High Plains is part of the community emergency respnce plan.\n                                                                                                                                                                        Compliance Audits:\n\nHigh Plains Corp. will use compliance audits as a technique to gather sufficient facts and information, to verify compliance with current standards.  A team will be used to perform audits of the process safety management system and risk management program.  These audits will be conducted at least every three years to verify that the procedur"

Team members will have expertise in process engineering and design; process chemistry; instrumentation and computer controls; electrical hazards and classifications; safety and health disciplines; maintenance; emergency preparedness;  and process safety auditing. The team will compare what is actually done or followed with the written PSM/RMP program.\n\nThe audit will include a review of the relevant documentation and process safety information, inspection of the physical facilities, and interviews with plant personnel.  The review will evaluate the written training program for adequacy of content, frequency of training, effectiveness of training in terms of its goals and objectives as well as how it fits into meeting the programs requirements.  Through interviews, the team will determine employee's knowledge and awareness of the safety procedures, duties, rules, and emergency response assignments.  During the inspection, the team will observe actual practices such as safety and health policies, procedures and work authorization practices.\n\nThe audit team, through systematic analysis, will document areas that require corrective action as well as where the process safety management and risk management program system is effective.  This will provide a record of the audit procedures and findings and serves as a baseline of operational data for future audits.\n\nCorrective action includes identifying deficiencies, planning follow-up, and documenting the corrections.  Corrective action will begin with a management review of the audit Findings.

Management of change procedures will be used, as appropriate.  While many of these changes may be minor, some may require engineering studies or more detailed review of actual procedures and practices.  All actions taken, including an explanation when no action is taken on a finding will be documented.\n\nIncident History:\nHigh Plains Corporation, York Ethanol Facility has had 2 uncontrolled releases in the past 5 years.  Both releases were caused by poor operating procedures and operator error.  As a result of these incidents, operating procedures have been revised and an operator training program has been instituted.  High Plains Corp. also has installed additional excess flow valves to reduce the duration of a release if another incident were to happen.  These changes, along with compliance to the Process Safety Management and Risk Management Plans, give us great confidence that the risk of release is low.\n                                                                                                                                                               Release Scenarios\n\nHigh Plains Corporation analyzed the impact of a worst case scenario and an alternative in compliance with the Risk Management Plan. The EPA approved the model used.\n\nThe results of the worst-case model indicated a toxic endpoint of 7.33 miles.  This worst case scenario indicates that a catastrophic release could impact the City of York, Nebraska, and/or the Villages of Thayer and Waco Nebraska.  There are no environmental receptors within the 7.33 mile radius.\n\nThe results of the alternative scenario indicated a toxic endpoint was 0.47 miles.  The estimated population within this distance was 13 people.  The primary use of the land in the vicinity is agricultural.  There are no environmental receptors within the 0.47 mile radius."
