      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nEAGLE CHIEF GAS PLANT\n\n(a)\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response.  Public and employee safety, as well as environmental protection, are primary issues of concern to Hiland Operating L.L.C.  Accidental release prevention is a key factor in the design, construction and operation of all Hiland facilities.  Hiland facilities are constructed in accordance with applicable codes/ standards and are evaluated to ensure that the equipment complies with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.  Hiland facilities are equipped with many engineering safeguards (i.e.:  pressure relief valves, shutdowns, alarms, etc.) that are designed to prevent situations that would require an emergency response.  This plan is provided to applicable outside agencies that might be called upon for assistance in an emergency situation (i.e.:  police department, fire department, etc.).\n\n(b)\tStationary Source and Regulated Substances.  The Eagle Chief Gas Plant is a stationary source as defined in 40 CFR 68.3.  The regulated substance at the facility is a flammable chemical mixture, Natural Gas Liquids (NGL), which is an aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon mixture.  The mixture includes N-pentane, isopentane, N-butane, isobutane, propane, ethane and methane.  These chemicals have an RMP regulated threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.  The facility has an aboveground storage tank for NGL\u00bfs (NGL Product Storage Tank) that has a maximum controlled capacity of 58,000 gallons.\n\n\n(c)\tWorst-Case Release Scenario and Administrative/Mitigative Controls.  The worst-case release scenario (WCRS) would be a rupture of the NGL Product Storage Tank.  Such a release has the potential of the formation of a vapor cloud that could explode when exposed to an ignition source.  Using the EPA\u00bfs RMP*COMP program, the WCRS distance/endpoint was calculated to be .4 miles from the tank.  Based on this calculation, it was determined that no public receptors"

      "SummaryText": "were within the WCRS.  Various administrative and mitigative (engineering) controls have been implemented/installed as safeguards to prevent deviations outside safe operating limits.  Administrative controls include utilizing a well-trained operation and maintenance staff that periodically visit and inspect the facility.  Mitigative (engineering) safeguards include such things as high pressure/overpressure relief valves, high-pressure shutdowns, high temperature shutdowns, high level shutdowns, etc.\n\n(d)\tHazard Communication Program.  Hiland has developed and implemented a Company Hazard Communication Program that ensures:  1) an MSDS is on file for all hazardous chemicals used or stored in the facility; 2) all applicable containers of hazardous chemicals are properly labeled/marked; and 3) employees receive annual training on the Company\u00bfs Hazard Communication Program.\n\n(e)\tFive Year Accident History.   The Eagle Chief Gas Plant has not had a regulated flammable chemical release in the previous five years.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety.  Hiland is always looking for ways to improve their safety program.  Hiland believes the effectiveness of the safety program is directly proportional to employee involvement and senior management support.  Two tasks are being performed:  1) current training programs are being evaluated and 2) monthly safety inspection performed by the people who operate and maintain the facility is being implemented."
