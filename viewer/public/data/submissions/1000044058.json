Nucla Station is owned and operated by Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, Inc. (Tri-State).  As a Tri-State facility, Nucla Station operates under the direction of the Tri-State Board of Directors.  The Tri-State Board of Directors has developed environmental health and safety policies requiring compliance with all applicable regulations.  These policies have been implemented for the protection of the employees, the public, and the environment.  To further the goals of the board policies, Tri-State management has also implemented a company-wide Environmental Management System (EMS), which is used to help set and achieve environmental goals, as well as to ensure environmental compliance.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to the compliance policies of the board of directors and the EMS, Nucla Station also developed an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) to prepare for and provide a coordinated response to emergency situations.  The integrated approach is used to coordinate all aspects of emergency planning and response to provide for a comprehensive response to emergency situations.  The Risk Mangement Plan is incorporated into the ICP to insure that Risk Management Plan requirements are taken into consideration in the facility emergency planning and response efforts.  Additional information on the ICP can be found in the Emergency Response Program section below. \r\n\r\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\r\nThe primary function of the Nucla Station is to generate electric power for use throughout the region. Steam electric power generation invloves the burning of a fuel source to heat water and produce steam.  The steam produced is used to spin a large turbine, which in turn rotates a generator that converts the mechanical energy of the turbine into electrical energy for use by consumers.  The primary"

      "SummaryText": "fuel used at Nucla Station is coal with propane used as a start-up fuel.  \r\n\r\nWater is used at Nucla Station as an integral part of the power production process.  The majority of the water used by the station is for cooling with a portion being treated to produce potable water and process water.  Raw water for the plant is taken directly from the nearby San Miguel River.   The water then undergoes treatment to make it suitable for the required processes.\r\n\r\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\nChlorine is the only regulated substance present at Nucla Station in amounts greater than the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) and EPA Risk Management Plan (RMP) thresholds, 1,500 pounds and 2,500 pounds respectively.  Chlorine is used at the station to disinfect the water and prevent biological growth within the water systems.  The use of chlorine in the circulating (cooling) water system helps to increase the efficiency and lifetime of the process, as well as to reduce the maintenance demands of the system.\r\n\r\nThe circulating water treatment system is the only regulated process at Nucla Station.  The circulating water treatment system draws chlorine gas from a one-ton cylinder through an isolation valve and gas filter into the supply manifold.  The supply mainfold is equipped with an additional isolation valve.  From the supply manifold the gas is fed into a gas feeder equipped with a drip leg heater to evaporate any liquid chlorine that may have condensed in the line.  The final portion of the chlorine system from the gas feeder to the chlorine ejector is operated under a vacuum. A vacuum type system is used to minimize the need for pressurized lines.  The elimination of pressurized lines minimizes the potential for a large release and helps ensure the safety of the employees and the surrounding community.  For additional safety, only one cylinder is valved into each process at any one time to prevent the possibility of a release from multiple containers.\r\n\r\nPREVENTION PROGRAM 3\r\nThe"

      "SummaryText": "circulating water chlorine process requires a level three prevention program due to applicability of the OSHA PSM standard to the process.  To meet this requirement Nucla Station has developed an integrated PSM/RMP for the circulating water chlorine system. Due to the similarity of the RMP and PSM rules, an integrated approach was used to ensure compliance, eliminate redundancy, and simplify documentation.  \r\n\r\nThe Nucla Station RMP/PSM Prevention Program includes detailed information on the following topics:  program management, employee participation, process safety information, process hazard analysis requirements, standard operating procedures, training, contractor safety, pre-startup safety reviews, mechanical integrity, hot work permits, management of change, incident investigation, and audits.  Each of the prevention program elements listed above is included as an integral part of the RMP/PSM program and the facility Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP). This approach ensures that the chlorine system requirements are considered during emergency planning and response activities at the station.  Portions of the PSM/RMP prevention program are also integrated into the facility work management system to insure that PSM/RMP activities and considerations are addressed during routine maintenance activities at the station.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\nNucla Station is committed to ensuring the safety of its workers, the safety of the surrounding community, and the protection of the environment.  To this end, Nucla Station maintains relationships and/or written agreements with the local fire departments and the local emergency planning committee.  In addition, Nucla Station has developed an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) to meet all OSHA and EPA emergency response requirements.  The ICP assists in the evaluation of risks and in the preparation for and response to all types of emergencies.  The ICP sets forth procedures for emergency response and notification of the"

The ICP also details the emergency response organization, the training requirements, and the required maintenance and testing of emergency response equipment.\r\n\r\nACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nThere have been no accidents at the Nucla Station in the past five years that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. \r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nAt this time there is one significant change planned for the Nucla Station circulating water chlorine system. Nucla Station is planning to replace the current gaseous chlorine system with a less hazardous sodium hypochlorite system which would drop the system and the site below both the PSM and RMP reporting thresholds for gaseous chlorine.  This change to the system is expected to uccur in 2014 or 2015."
