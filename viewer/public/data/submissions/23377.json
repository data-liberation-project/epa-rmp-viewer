Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nCentennial Farms recognizes management's responsibility in protecting its employees, equipment, property, and the environment.  The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the Atlanta facility.\n\nTo accomplish the company's goal in controlling accidental losses, the facility has established a Plant Safety Program.  The objectives of the Plant Safety Program are to: maximize efficiency and safety performance, eliminate human suffering resulting from injuries and accidents and reduce losses associated with damage of property.\n\nOne of the activities associated with the Plant Safety Program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response programs which are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119), and EPA's Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).\n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs is to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs help prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices, which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\nIn addition to the Plant Safety Program,"

Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nCentennial Farms is part of the Kroger Company.  It is a fluid milk and juice processing facility.  To provide cooling and freezing capabilities, the facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system. The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in the system is in excess of 10,000 pounds.  The maximum inventory in the system is approximately 14,000 pounds.  Since an ammonia release from the system could pose a risk of offsite public and/or environmental impact and the system is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's RM program.\n\n\nC.   Summary of Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\nThe worst-case release scenario at the Centennial Farms facility involves the release of 7,064 pounds of ammonia over a 10 minute period due to the failure of the high pressure receiver.  This quantity represents the full capacity of the vessel, which is a conservative assumption as it could only be full following a substantial system pump-down.  These pump-downs, however, are required very infrequently.  Under worst-case weather conditions, ammonia could travel 1.0 mile before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public. This distance has been calculated based on the method provided in the Risk Management Program (40 CFR 68) Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is unlikely for the following re"

Under alternative release weather conditions, ammonia could travel 0.1 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  This distance has been calculated based on the method provided in the Risk Management Program (40 CFR 68) Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n  Industry standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of the pressure relief devices;\n  The system is operated at considerably lower pressures compared to the PSV's relief pressure setting;\n  Ammonia is not corrosive in this service;\n  The facility has a preventive maintenance program"

Employees are also to be involved when a process hazard analysis is conducted.
