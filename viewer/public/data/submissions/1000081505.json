Since 2016, Pentane usage has decreased steadily.  Pentane usage for 2018 was only 70,104 lbs. (5,842 lbs. per month average.)  So far, 2019 monthly usage is averaging 4,738 lbs.  Due to this low usage rate, Carpenter-Conover management has decided to allow the Pentane level in the storage tank to drop and permanently remain below the 10,000 lb. threshold allowing its removal from this Risk Management Plan.  On July 30, 2019, the Pentane inventory level dropped below the 10,000 lb. threshold and will be held below 10,000 lbs. using administrative controls.

      "SummaryText": "Risk Management Plan.   \r\n\r\nRegulations in 40 CFR Part 68 requires an RMP resubmittal, if significant changes within the process occurs.  Also, a mandatory resubmittal is required every five years.  Since 1999, Carpenter Company-Conover Plant has had several process changes that resulted in a resubmittal of the RMP.  The first RMP resubmittal was in 2004, the five year anniversary of the original 1999 submittal.  In 2006, a new foam pouring line, (Hennecke line) was constructed and began producing foam on July 12, 2006.  Due to some lacking process knowledge, at that time, the old pouring line was kept in operation to produce several specialty foams that could not be poured on the new pouring line.  This new Hennecke line, which incorporated carbon dioxide as the primary blowing agent, stemmed an RMP resubmittal.  This RMP change was resubmitted in March, 2007.\r\n\r\nAs a result of new chemistry and technology breakthroughs, the Hennecke line was updated to pour all of the foam recipes.  The old pour line was scrapped after its last pour on April 3, 2009.  The old line used Pentane as its primary blowing agent, while the Hennecke line uses mostly carbon dioxide. On July 9, 2009, the remaining Pentane was removed from the storage tank.  Under RMP rule, the removal of Pentane initiated a significant change, therefore, a resubmittal of RMP occurred on September 4, 2009.  Pentane was not used for the next year. \r\n\r\nDue to technological advances, Carpenter-Conover began experimenting with Pentane on the Hennecke line to produce new foam recipes.  These new foams were very successful.  Their success led to the need to inventory Pentane again in quantities above the 10,000 pound threshold.  To take advantage of more attractive prices, Carpenter-Conover began exploring the possibility of bringing in full railcars of Pentane once again.  Before these larger purchases could occur, the RMP had to be updated, for this, another significant process change.  On March 24, 2011, Carpe"

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary---Risk Management Plan for Carpenter Company, Conover, NC---40 CFR 68.155\r\n\r\nIn 1948, E. Rhodes Carpenter began distributing cushioning materials to the furniture industry.  By 1956, Carpenter's company began manufacturing the flexible foam that it marketed to the furniture and home furnishings industries.  In 1962, Carpenter built the first continuous foam pouring line in Richmond, VA.  Due to Carpenter's hard work, honesty, and integrity his company grew rapidly.  In 1972, Carpenter opened his fourth polyurethane foam manufacturing facility in Conover, North Carolina.  Carpenter Company, Conover, NC has been a major supplier to the furniture, bedding, and home furnishings industries for over 44 years.  In addition to polyurethane foam, the Conover Plant produces polyester fiber products for similar cushioning properties as found in the polyurethane foam.  The polyurethane foam manufacturing process has seen numerous changes over the years in respect to chemistry, chemicals, government regulations, and the ever changing needs of our customers.  It is this polyurethane foam pouring process that is subject to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Plan Rule.\r\n\r\nThe original Risk Management Plan (RMP) for Carpenter Company-Conover Plant was submitted in 1999, the year that the Clean Air Act mandated the EPA to publish regulations and guidance on chemical accident prevention at facilities that use certain hazardous substances.  These regulations and guidance are contained in their Risk Management Plan (RMP) rule.\r\n\r\nThe information required from facilities under the RMP rule helps local fire, police, and emergency response personnel prepare for and respond to chemical emergencies.  Making RMPs available to the public also fosters communication and awareness to improve accident prevention and emergency response practices at the local level.  The RMP rule requires companies that use certain toxic and flammable chemicals to develop a"
