Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Steps.\n\n       The facility complies with the OSHA Process Safety Management rule.  A process safety management plan was written for the facility which include all of the required elements.  Since the process is storage only, the practices important to the prevention program are the proper storage and handling of the chlorine  cylinders.  Dry, isolated and fire proof storage spaces are provided where the temperature of the vicinity of the cylinders never reaches 140 degrees Fahrenheit.  Proper loading and unloading of cylinders from trucks are very important to prevent cylinders from falling and cause possible damage to the valve area.  Training and careful work practices are the key to preventing accidental damage to the cylinders.\n     \ne.     Five Year Accident History.\n\n       The facility has not experienced any accidents during the past five years.  This is understandable because the process is storage only with minimal handling of the chlorine cylinders.\n\nf.     Emergency Response Program.\n\n       The facility emergency response plan covers both accidental releases and natural disasters.  The plan set forth policies and procedures for responding to emergencies and incorporate the following:\n\n      1.  Personnel roles, lines of authority, training and communication (including notification requirements).\n      2.  Site maps, security and control measures, refuges, evacuation routes and decontamination\n           stations when required.\n      3.  Emergency medical treatment and first aid.\n      4.

Natural disasters are coordinated with the State and Kauai County Civil Defense agencies.\n\n     Personnel receive chlorine response, HAZWOPER and HAZMAT training.  Chlorine response and HAZWOPER training are conducted annually and the HAZMAT training is conducted every three years.\nWeekly tailgate safety meetings are also held covering various safety topics.  These meetings are short, 15-20 minute meetings.\n\n     The alert system is basically the use of interplant buzzer, air horns and messengers.  Truck drivers away from the facility will be contacted by cellular phone.  The plant superintendent is the Incident Commander and determines the level of emergency condition.  The following are the various levels of emergency conditions:\n                          \n     Level I is a potential emergency condition which is limited to a confined area and can be controlled by \n     a  first responder.

Notifications are also\n    made to the Oahu and State Civil Defense agencies, the State Department of Land and Natural\n    Resources,  the State Department of Transportation,  and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\n\n    Level III is a full em"

Cleanup activities will be initiated and written reports will be submitted to the\n    appropriate agencies.\n\ng.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\n       There are no plans to change the present operation for chlorine primarily because the process is storage.  Chlorine use in the state, especially by swimming pools and sewage treatment plants are being eliminated and substituted with bleach or hypochlorite in powdered or tablet form depending on the size of the facility.  This will enable Brewer Environmental Industries, LLC to reduce the chlorine inventory."

      "SummaryText": "a.     Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies.\n\n       C. Brewer and Company, Limited, the parent company, issued a policy guide on October 9, 1992 for all subsidiaries to follow.  The policy is a commitment to environmental compliance which assigns the responsibility of implementing the policy to the Chief Executive Officer of the company, or designated individual or individuals to ensure compliance.  The purpose of the policy is to provide employees with a safe and healthy environment and at the same time protect, preserve and improve the environment.\n\n      The facility's overall approach to chemical safety begins with the premise that safety is everyone's responsibility.  Preventing injuries and incidents is good business and working safely is a condition of employment.  Workplace hazards are minimized through preventive measures such as facility and equipment design, purchase of less hazardous products and development of standard operating procedures.  Control measures include facility inspections to discover potential problems, employee reports of hazardous conditions through a Stop Card program, training and a safety award program.  Effective April 1, 1999 a new safety recognition program was established.  The program consist of quarterly incentives (the longer a team is accident free, the better the awards) for each team that is accident free.\n\n     There is a strong senior management commitment to safety and the implementation of safety  programs.  However, there is an effort to get management more involved in day to day safety activities through participation in Tailgate safety meetings and emergency response team activities.\n\nb.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substance.\n\n     The Brewer Environmental Industries, LLC - Puhi facility is located at 3-1480 Kaumualii Highway, Lihue, Hawaii.

The site is bounded on the north by Kauai Nursery and Landscape, a foliage company, and agricultural land (sugar) to the east, west and south.\n\nc.     Release Scenarios.\n\n1.      Worst Case.\n        \n        The release scenario is the total release of the largest quantity of a one ton chlorine cylinder.  There is no passive mitigation and the release occurs under the worst weather conditions (F stability, wind speed at 1.5 meters per second).\n\n        The offsite consequence analysis was conducted for chlorine.  The process is storage only and the OCA Guidance was used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint which is 7.4 miles.  There will be offsite impact on residential population, and public and environmental receptors.\n\n        There is no administrative or mitigation systems to limit the quantity of releases.  There are operational procedures for storage and handling of cylinders to minimize the possibility of causing damage to cylinders and making the worst case release unlikely.\n         \n2.     Alternative Scenario.\n\n        The alternative scenario of a valve leak was selected because that is the most likely area vulnerable to damage due to dropping or mishandling of a cylinder and is most likely to occur than the worst case scenario.  There is no passive mitigation and the release conditions selected were D stability class with wind speed of 3.0 meters per second.  The OCA Guidance was used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint which is 0.74 mile.  There will be impact on residential population, but not on public or environmental receptors.\n\n         Active mitigation is the use of Chlorine Institute Emer"
