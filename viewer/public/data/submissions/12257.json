The facility is a contributor to the community by protecting the plant and neighbors from damaging effects of emergency situations.  The facility design, maintenance, operating procedures, and training provide for risk minimization before an accident can occur.  In spite of all these things, emergencies can arise, sometimes through forces beyond control.  The emergency response plan, along with training and drills, is designed to prepare the facility to recognize emergency situations of various types and react promptly and correctly to minimize any ill effects.  Local, state, and federal safety rules dictate that the facility study and understand the principles and specifics covered in this preplanning effort and fully understand all roles in the plan.\n\nThe purpose of the Ferndale emergency plan is to provide a cohesive procedure for coordinating effective response procedures by all plant personnel in order that danger to employees, contractors, the general public and the environment m"

The Process Safety Management Superintendent is responsible for upkeep of the Risk Management Plan and Hazard Assessment, and all supporting documentation.  The individual departments assigned in above implement each element of the Prevention Program.\n \nPlanned Enhancements to Safety\n\nThrough the use of prevention programs such as Management of Change and the Process Hazard Analysis revalidation program, Tosco is constantly re-evaluating the current safety systems.  As a result of these, and other safety and risk management initiatives, improvements to the safety of the workers and the surrounding community continue to occur.  \n\nThe following is an example of the types of modifications planned at the Tosco Ferndale facility:\n\n1.  HF laser detectors.  To facilitate quick detection of a hydrofluoric acid release, Tosco is installing unit perimeter laser detectors in the acid section of the Alkylation Unit.  These detectors are calibrated to alert operations personnel of a release of HF.  This equipment, combined with the currently installed video monitoring system in the control room, will provide operations staff with the best available technology for detecting HF leaks. This early warning system will assist operations and emergency response personnel in quickly mitigating the release to prevent any offsite consequences, or onsite injuries.\n2. Acid inventory management system.  This emergency system, to be implemented in the Alkylation Unit, will allow operators to transfer hydrofluoric acid from the process unit equipment to single safe storage location.  If a leak were to occur within the process equipment, the operator would activate the emergency acid inventory management system (AIMS), to reduce the duration of an acid release, and to store the acid in a safe loca"

Once activated, a series of emergency operated valves (EOVs) would systematically isolate the process equipment, at the same time transferring any acid in the system to a dedicated Emergency Acid Storage Tank.  The emergency tank is adequately sized to store the process inventory of acid.  When the system has been repaired, the acid in the emergency system can be safely transferred back into the process, without requiring any disposal of material.  \n3.  Y2K task force.  Tosco recognizes the importance of the potential impact of the Year 2000 (Y2K) on the facility.  To ensure that the date change does not result in safety or environmental impacts, Tosco has convened a Y2K task force, which consists of engineering, operations, information technology, and managerial staff.  The group was tasked to perform an internal audit to identify and remedy all potential failure situations arising as a result of the computer bug. Issues that the Y2K task force is addressing include:\n7 Y2K compliance from equipment and software vendors\n7 loss of utilities, such as water, natural gas and power\n7 inoperability of control system computers or inadequate feedback to control room operators\n7 reduced community emergency response capabilities\n7 emergencies at neighboring facilities / outside the plant limits\n\nMany of these issues had previously been addressed during the unit PHA studies.  As such, redundant or back-up systems, such as a temporary emergency power supplies, field instrumentation, or manual controls are already in place to mitigate against such occurrences.  The operations staff in each unit is trained to handled emergency situations, and will make use of emergency shutdown procedures, if necessary.

      "SummaryText": "Ferndale Refinery RMP: Executive Summary\n\nThe federal Risk Management Program requires Tosco Refining Co.  to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for any processes containing regulated substances above threshold quantity (TQ) at the Ferndale Refinery.  The Ferndale Refinery handles hazardous materials onsite, and recognizes a responsibility to safely operate the facility in order to protect the surrounding community, employees, and the environment.  The facility has taken a proactive stance to promote the overall safe operation of the processes, with programs to prevent accidents from occurring, planning for emergencies, and maintaining the equipment needed if an emergency does occur.  The RMP formalizes existing programs and procedures so that these programs may be reviewed more efficiently.\n\nThe Ferndale Refinery processes oil into gasoline and refining products.  The facility receives oil from many sources via ship or pipeline, stores it in tanks onsite, then processes the oil into products to be shipped elsewhere by pipeline, railcar, barge or truck.  The refining process separates the crude oil into five products: gasoline, diesel fuel, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), heavy fuel oil and sulfur.  The sulfur is generated because oil contains significant quantities of sulfur that must be removed to produce clean burning gasoline and diesel.  The fuel products are also stored in onsite storage prior to shipping, and any non-hydrocarbon products e.g. sulfur are also stored prior to shipping.  The facility also has the utility and support systems required to provide for safe operation of the facility.\n\nThe RMP consists of two parts required for submittal:\n7 RMP executive summary, prevention program summary, and management system\n7 RMP data elements\n\nThe RMP effort at the facility was divided into three phases.

A summary of the hazard assessment is provided in Section 2.  Finally, phase III of the RMP effort is provided in this document.  It contains the executive summary of the overall RMP effort at the facility, a synopsis of the prevention program, a five year accident history and an organizational chart of the management systems in place to implement and maintain the facility's risk management measures.\n\nThe executive summary and data elements are submitted to Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the federal government as part of its Risk Management Plan.\n\nFerndale Refinery Hazard Assessment-   Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Summary\n\nThe objectives of this hazard assessment are twofold: (1) satisfy the requirements of the RMP regulation and (2) provide OCA information that will help local emergency planning officials improve community emergency response in the event of an accidental release at the refinery.\n\nFor all covered process units, the facility is providing a worst case and alternative release scenario for each regulated toxic substance held in the covered process, and the same scenarios for flammable substances in covered process units.  The Fernale Refinery has one regulated toxic compound: hydrofluoric acid (also known as HF acid).

Within this program, each process unit is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  The PHA team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nWritten operating procedures provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities in the refinery.
