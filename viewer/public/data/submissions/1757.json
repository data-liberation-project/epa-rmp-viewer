This care is demonstrated by  the following:\n     Measuring its health, safety, and environmental performance\n     Integrated management systems which protect people from injury and ill health\n     Integrated management systems which safeguard the environment, and \n     Continually improving its health, safety, and environmental performance.\nThe President, Directors, and management are committed to  maintaining these standards.\nBudd Chemical Company manufactures Urea Plastic Molding Compound mainly for use in the electrical industry.  The facility is a 15,000 square foot building on a 17 acre lot located in rural, Carneys Point, in Salem County New Jersey.  Part of the manufacturing process involves the storage and handling of formaldehyde solution.  The solution is stored in an outside containment vessel which holds up to 90,000 lbs.\nRelease scenario  impact was determined using the OCA Guidance modeling and is summarized as follows:  \n     Worst-Case Release Scenario-  The outside formaldehyde storage tank is located inside a 100% containment dike.  This limits the exposed surface area in the event of equipment failure, thus reducing the release rate to 0.8 lbs/min. offisite  impact would be exposure to formaldehyde fumes for a limited number of local residences.\n     Alternative Release Scenario-  Valves and piping from the outside storage tank feed to process kettles located inside the building.  A small release is possible (0.6 lb/min) in the event of leaking or rupture and will be minimized by closing isolation valves throughout the system.  Offsite impact could be exposure to formaldehyde fumes for a limited number of local residences.\n     Budd Chemical Company complies with OSHA PSM rule and has performed a Process Hazard Analysis for all parts of the manufacturing process where formaldehyde is handled.

      "SummaryText": "esults of the PHA have prompted the installation of various alarms and control devices throughout the system to further prevent the possibility and minimize release consequences.  All operators are trained in procedures concerning this part of the process including emergency shut down.  All maintenance personnel are trained on the Mechanical Integrity Program for inspection and prevention.\n     There has been one (1) accidental release at this faciltiy in the last 5 years.  A transfer hose used in the offloading of a tanker developed a leak, spraying fromaldehyde on the ground and tanker driver.  The driver was taken to the hospital for precautionary measures and released the same day.\n     Budd Chemical Company has an Emergency Planning and Response Program according to OSHA 29 CFR 1910-38.  All employees are trained in this program and its procedures.  Local Fire and Rescue companies as well as a contracted outside emergency responder have been given facility tours and process overview to better prepare them for effective response.\n     Budd Chemical Company constantly evaluates all safety programs and process controls for applicability and potential improvement.  Training is routinely scheduled and performed to further ensure the purpose for the company safety programs, which is to save lives and protect the environment."
