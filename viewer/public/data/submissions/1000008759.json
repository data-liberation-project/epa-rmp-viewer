This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES \n\nHunt Southland's Vicksburg terminal is located along the Yazoo diversionary canal and is used primarily for the transfer of petroleum products as well as caustic soda and sodium hydrosulfide.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nWhile threshold quantities of toxic and flammable substances are not met for any of Hunt Southland's processes other than storage of light naphtha, we have developed process safety guidelines for processes that represent the greatest risk to Hunt Southland employees, the public, and the environment. In addition to these process safety guidelines, Hunt Southland has numerous other programs that incorporate accident prevention and loss control. \n\nEmployee participation takes place on both an informal and formal basis. Informally, safety suggestions and concerns are relayed to management through supervisors or directly. The safety manager also collects suggestions during safety walk-throughs. Incident investigations are conducted with hourly employees participating in the investigation team. \n\nProcess safety information is kept with several departments at the refinery including the EHS, maintenance, and analytical laboratory departments. In addition to typical hazard communication information, documents are also kept on key process parameters, chemical mixture, technical manuals for key equipment, and industry guidelines for s"

      "SummaryText": "afe operations in petroleum refineries. \n\nAs the storage tank for light naphtha has few \"process\" controls, a \"what-if\" hazard analysis was developed to address process hazards. The light naphtha storage tank has an internal floating roof that is the key component that could fail and significantly increase the risk of a VCE. The storage tanks are also gauged daily. During this gauging, the tank is inspected for problems or weakened components. \n\nHunt Southland Refining Company has historically experienced a very low employee turnover rate. As a consequence, refinery personnel are quite knowledgeable and effective. Additionally, all employees are trained under OSHA's 24 hour Hazardous Waste Operator Standard and at the state fire academy for fire brigade training. Refreshers are conducted annually for Hazwoper and semi-annually for fire training (two days). \n\nHunt Southland Refining Company has historically used the same contractors for construction and maintenance within the facility. Contractors are expected to know and follow Hunt Southland's safety standards and to work under the oversight of a Hunt Southland supervisor at all times while within the refinery facility.\n\nMechanical integrity of the storage tank is focused on the proper operation and maintenance of the internal floating roof and the gauging for thickness of the steel shell. During all maintenance operations, standard safe work practices are utilized including lockout/tagout, line breaking procedures, confined space safety, hot work permits, and static electric spark minimization. \n\nWhile terminal operations would not change much over time, management of change is still considered critical if changes are made. Incident investigations are conducted whenever there has been an accident, near miss, or other incident.  An audit is conducted on the storage tanks during annual inspections for the floating roof tanks. \n\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS \n\nThe key element of release containment, control, and"

External monitors and other fire suppression equipment are stored near the vicinity of the tank. \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \n\nIn reviewing the OSHA 200 logs for the last five years show were no accidents or incidents related to the naphtha storage process.\n \nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION \n\nHunt Southland Refining Company maintains written emergency response programs for a variety of regulatory programs. The programs include: TIER II reports for EPCRA, emergency action plans, emergency response plans, SPCC plans, pipeline spill response plans, and process safety management plans. \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY \n\nHunt Southland Refining Company plans to extend the supply line for the foam chamber at the light naphtha storage tank from its current location to a more accessible location for supplying foam in the event of a fire."
