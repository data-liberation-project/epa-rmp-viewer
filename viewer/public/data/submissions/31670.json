The nearest residential area is approx 0.5 miles to the NW.\n\nNiacet is a major producer of metal organic acid salts such as calcium propionate,sodium acetate, and sodium phenoxyacetate (SPA) which is used in the fermentation of penicillin. Niacet produces monochloroacetic acid which is used to manufacture SPA, and is also sold on the merchant market. Chlorine is used to make monochloroacetic acid. Ethyl ether is used in the manufacture of SPA and also several anionic surfactants.\nChlorine is received via railcar and transferred through a vaporizer into one of two reactors for the production of monochloroacetic acid. Niacet can have up to two railcars on site for a total of 360,000 lbs. Safety systems include chlorine sensors, automatic shutoff valves, and video monitors.\nEthyl ether is received via tank truck, and stored in one of two 14,000 gallon storage tanks. In total the two tanks can store up to approximately 170,000 lbs. Ethyl ether is used in the manufacture of SPA, and anionic surfactants. The ethyl ether is a processing aid which is recycled and reused in these processes. Safety systems include hest sensors that activate a deluge system, and LEL air monitors/alarms.
