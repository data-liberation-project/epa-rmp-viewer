      "SummaryText": "This Risk Management Plan (RMP) was submitted by United Farmers Coop (UFC) to address storage of anhydrous ammonia at our facility at Bradshaw, Nebraska.  This RMP was prepared following EPA's RMP SUBMIT User's Manual (EPA 550-B99-001), and this executive summary contains the elements required under Chapter 2 of the Manual. This site was previously registered under the name, Cargill AgHorizons.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Emergency Response Policy.  United Farmers Coop considers chemical safety a top priority.  In the unlikely occurrence of a chemical release, UFC's Emergency Action Plan would help minimize the impact on human health and the environment, and the damage to property.  The Emergency Action Plan incorporates the local fire department as emergency responders.\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances Handled.  The anhydrous ammonia is stored in two tanks, an 18,000 and 30,000-gallon aboveground containers, with the combined capacity to contain 244,800 pounds each of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nWorst-Case Scenario.  The worst case toxic release scenario was evaluated using the RMP Comp Model.  The scenario involves the release of 140,020 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, liquefied under pressure, which represents release of anhydrous ammonia in an amount equal to the maximum capacity of the container.  Default assumptions for the RMP Comp Model were used: 77 degrees F, 3.4 MPH wind speed, and stability class F.  In addition, an urban setting was used (based on actual site conditions), and no mitigation measures were included.  The release duration was 10 minutes.  The toxic endpoint for this scenario is 4.40 miles (7.10 kilometers).   758 people reside within this distance from the anhydrous ammonia container.\n\nAlternative Scenario.  The alternative toxic release scenario was also evaluated using EPA's RMP COMP software (Ver. 1.06).  The scenario involves the release of 600 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, liquefied under pressure.  The assumed release"

      "SummaryText": "duration is 10 minutes.  Assumption for this scenario are based on RMP COMP default assumptions and a tranfer hose failure.  Default assumptions for the RMP COMP software were used: 77 degrees F, 6.7 MPH wind speed, and stability class D.  In addition, an urban setting was used, based on the actual site conditions.  The toxic endpoint for this scenario is 0.1 miles (0.2 kilometers).  There are no residents within this distance from the anhydrous ammonia container.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps.  Anhydrous ammonia storage vessels and the associated safety equipment undergo inspections and requalifications according to the schedules outlined in 29 CFR 1910.111 and the applicable ANSI standards.  All storage vessels are equipped with relief valves, check valves, and manual shutoff systems.\n\nFive Year Accident History.  No reportable releases of anhydrous ammonia have occurred at this facility within the last five years.\n\nThe Emergency Response Program.  This facility has an Emergency Action Plan specifically tailored to this site.  The local fire department is familiar with the facility and will respond in the event of an emergency.  Site personnel receive annual mandatory training that covers proper equipment operation and emergency action.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety.  No changes are planned at this time"
