Starrett Company (Starrett) stores up to 66,528 pounds of propane at the 121 Crescent Street site in its 18,000 gallon propane storage tank for heat treating and general building heating.  Starrett is required to address the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Chemical Accident Prevention (CAP) Regulation 40 CFR 68 and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration(OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation 29 CFR 1910.119 because they exceed the 10,000 propane regulatory threshold and the propane is used as a feedstock in the heat treat process (special atmosphere furnace).\r\n\r\nA 5,500 gallon methanol storage tank and two, 250 pound ammonia storage containers, are also located at the facility.  Ammonia , methanol , and nitrogen are also used in the heat treat process.  These chemicals are not required to be reported according to the EPA CAP Regulation.  However, these chemicals are regulated under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation 29 CFR 1910.119. The EPA RMP regulation requires that facilities subject to OSHA PSM regulations be categorized as Program 3 facilities. There are also a number of other chemicals used at the facility which are addressed in The L.S. Starrett Company Emergency Response Plan.\r\n\r\nThe Plan contains the Policies and Procedures used at The L.S. Starrett Company to assure continued compliance with the CAP regulations.  Most of the documents that are part of this plan follow a standard format that includes the purpose organization, responsibilities and authorities, as well as general step-by-step"

The manual is available for review by any employee at any time.  Any recommendation to improve a document's accuracy or effectiveness in assuring employee, visitor and contractor safety can be directed to management.\r\nThe goal of the RMP is to prevent accidental releases of substances that can cause serious harm to the public and the environment from short-term exposures and to mitigate the severity of releases that do occur. The 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act (CAA) require EPA to issue a rule specifying the type of actions to be taken by facilities to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals into the atmosphere and to reduce their potential impact on the public and the environment. \r\n\r\nThe phrase \"Risk Management Plan\" refers to this document as well as the registration information submitted to EPA.  In general, the RMP requires that:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tCovered facilities must develop and implement an RMP and maintain documentation of the program at the site.  The RMP will include an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release, a five-year accident history, a release prevention program and an emergency response program.\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tCovered facilities also must submit registration information (RMP Submit), to EPA no later than June 21, 1999 or the date on which the facility first has more than a threshold quantity in use or stored at the site, whichever is later.

The RMP will be available to Federal, state and local government agencies, the public and facility staff.\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tCovered facilities also must continue to implement and update their RMPs periodically or when processes change, as requ"

This section discusses various duties that must be addressed in order to fulfill the intent of the Plan.  This section also describes the employee responsibilities associated with each duty.  The facility has a designated Risk Management Program Coordinator (RMPC) which is identified in the plan and in the RMP Submit.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3 - Hazard Assessment\r\n\r\nA major component of the Plan is the assessment of impact associated with the accidental release of the hazardous material(s) in question.  This section evaluates both the worst-case release as well as alternative releases that are specific to the site.\r\nThe analysis focuses on the impact to neighboring areas called receptors.  Receptors include residences, schools, parks, prisons, commercial buildings, etc.  Graphic as well as tabulated exhibits help to define the impact of accidental releases.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 4 - Process Safety Information\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information (PSI) is a repository for information related to the safety of a process.  Three major subjects addressed in this section are:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tThe hazards of the chemicals and the process (physical properties, toxicity and exposure limits, fire and explosion characteristics, reactivity data, thermal and chemical stability, corrosivity data).\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tThe process technology (process chemistry, process flow diagrams, safe operating limits, maximum intended inventories, consequences of deviation).\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tEquipment information (piping and instrumentation diagrams, material and energy balances, safety systems involved, materials of construction, electrical classification, relief system design and design basis, ventilation system design and design basis, design codes and standards employed).

PHAs must address the hazards of a process, previous incidents having potential for serious consequences, engineering and administrative controls, facility siting, human factors and an evaluation of the range of exposures if controls fail.  If there is more than one process, a schedule for completing PHAs must be formulated and be based on the extent of process hazards, the number of potentially affected employees, the age of the process and the operating history of the process.  Employees must have input into the prioritization of PHAs and this schedule must be fully communicated to applicable employees.  PHAs must follow a standard methodology, such as a What If/Checklist Analysis and be performed by a cross-functional team with at least one person who is familiar with the process, at least once every five years.  A system for addressing, resolving, documenting and communicating all recommendations in a prompt manner must also be in place.\r\nTypical documentation should include information on how PHA studies were prioritized, employee briefings on the PHAs, a copy of each PHA file index and evidence of how PHA recommendations were completed.  These PHA files include the pertinent process safety information.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 6 - Operating Procedures\r\n\r\nOperating procedures are instructions that outline how to safely operate a process consistent with Process Safety Information.  They must be appropriate, clear, consistent and well communicated.
