The Process Safety lead and the Process Safety Committee meet regularly and participate in a Corporate network of Process Safety leader s from other plants in the company to discuss best practices.  Process Safety information and internal metrics are discussed once a month by the site Process Safety lead at a meeting with the Plant Manager and site managers.  At this monthly meetings, the results of internal audits on each Program 3 component is presented at least once a year.  The purpose of these audits is to check compliance against regulatory requirements and relevant internal standards and procedures. The site Process Safety leader holds an annual review with the Plant Manager, the Process Safety Committee and other plant managers to assess the effectiveness of the Program 3 Prevention Program.\n\n\n\nThe site has identified which process segments are subject to RMP regulations, and is in compliance with the requirements of all the elements of a Process 3 Prevention Program:  40 CFR 68.65 (Process Safety Information), 68.67 (Process Hazards Analysis). 68.69 (Operating Procedures), 68.71 (Training), 68.73 (Mechanical Integrity), 68.75 (Management of Change), 68.77 (Pre-Startup Review), 68.79 (Compliance Audits), 68.81 (Incident Investigation), 68.83 (Employee Participation), 68.85 (Hot Work Permit), 68.87 (Contractors), 68.90 (Emergency Response), 68.93 (Emergency response coordination activities).\n\n\n\nFive-Year accident history\n\n\n\nThe success of the site's RMP Prevention Program (and related activities in compliance with OSHA Process Safety Management Regulations at 29 CFR 1910.119) can be gauged by the fact that in the past five (5) years, there have been no accidental releases that resulted in OSHA recordable injuries or off-site shelter-in-place notifications or evacuations of neighbors.

The plant is located on a 2,417-acre site; however, only about 348 acres are developed.  The Delisle Plant manufactures a single product, Titanium Dioxide (TiO2), under the trade name TiPure(TM).  Titanium dioxide is manufactured via the chloride-ilmenite process in which naturally-occurring ilmenite (TiO2) is directly chlorinated to make Titanium Tetrachloride (TiCl4); the TiCl4 is subsequently re-oxidized to yield pure TiO2. \n\n\n\nThe DeLisle Plant has two production lines.  Both were constructed prior to the date of applicability of OSHA PSM regulations (29 CFR 1910.119) on March 26, 1992.  Line I started operations in September, 1979 and Line 2 in March, 1991.  \n\n\n\nEPA RMP regulations came into effect on June 21, 1999.  The Titanium Dioxide process is the only process on site.
