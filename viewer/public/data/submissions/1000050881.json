The anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) refrigeration system is used to control the temperature for beef processing and packaging.  The entire system contains approximately 20,000 pounds of ammonia in various physical states (gas, liquid, and saturated vapor).  Most of the ammonia equipment is located indoors.  The condensing towers and some piping are located outdoors.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at the Huisken Meats facility is a two-stage system consisting of a high-pressure side and a low-pressure side.  The low side (i.e., low pressure) is intended to quickly freeze product, while the high side (i.e., high pressure) is intended to refrigerate the product.  Equipment and piping carry the necessary gas, liquid, and saturated vapor throughout the system.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.\tACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\t\r\n\r\nThe facility has carefully considered the potential for accidental releases of ammonia.
