We are committed to\r\noperating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and\r\nresponsible manner, as demonstrated by the resources we\r\ninvest to prevent accidents.  As a member of the American\r\nChemistry Council, we adhere to the principles of\r\nResponsible Care.  In addition to ensuring that our\r\nemployees have the best training in the operation of our\r\nprocesses, we demand that safety be the first priority in\r\nthe design, installation, operation and maintenance of our\r\nprocesses.\r\n\r\n     We have implemented maintenance and inspection programs\r\nthat help ensure site integrity.  Our policy is to implement\r\nreasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of\r\nregulated substances.  Examples of controls to prevent\r\nreleases include (1) installation of pressure relief valves\r\nto prevent rupture of vessels due to overpressurization, (2)\r\nroutine visual inspection and thickness checks to ensure\r\nvessels and piping are in good condition, (3) using\r\nmaterials of construction that are compatible with the\r\nprocess chemistry, (4) vessel pressure and temperature are\r\ncontinuously monitored and (5) use of carbon and water\r\nscrubbers to remove small amounts of emissions.\r\n     \r\n     However, should a release occur, trained personnel will\r\nrespond to control and contain the release.  Mitigation\r\nmeasures that have been included in our design include\r\ninstallation of isolation valves, fire suppression systems\r\nin areas where flammable chemicals are present and fire\r\nfighting equipment in all process areas, a fully implemented\r\nemergency response plan, appropriate PPE and an alarm system\r\nfor early notification of a release.

There are strict requirements for choosing and\r\nmodeling worst-case release scenarios; as a result, these\r\nscenarios are often exceedingly conservative and are quite\r\nunlikely to occur.  The purpose of the alternative release\r\nscenarios is to provide emergency planners with more\r\ninformation about the chemicals we handle and their relative\r\nhazards.  The alternative release scenarios are more\r\nrealistic than worst-case scenarios, but are still unlikely\r\nto happen.  Following are brief summaries of these\r\nscenarios, including information about the key\r\nadministrative controls and mitigation measures that limit\r\nexposure distances.\r\n\r\n     The worst-case release scenario representing the toxic\r\nsubstances handled by Vulcan Performance Chemicals- Smyrna\r\nis a catastrophic rupture of a phosp"

Each process is examined in\r\ndetail to ensure that all hazards are identified and that\r\nappropriate controls are in place to manage those hazards.\r\n\r\n     A hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis is typically\r\nused for our process hazard analyses (PHA's).  A team\r\ncomprising personnel with engineering, operations,\r\nenvironmental and maintenance experience systematically\r\nexamines each hazard in each section of the process and\r\nidentifies potential causes and a range of possible\r\nconsequences.  The team then compares the hazard to the\r\nexisting set of prevention and mitigation measures designed\r\nto contain that hazard, making further recommendations when\r\ndeemed necessary.  These recommendations are resolved and\r\nprioritized by management and tracked until they are\r\nimplemented.  We update and revalidate each PHA every five\r\nyears or whenever a significant change is made.
