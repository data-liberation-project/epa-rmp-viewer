We are committed to\n\noperating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and\n\nresponsible manner, as demonstrated by the resources we\n\ninvest to prevent accidents.  As a member of the American\n\nChemistry Council, we adhere to the principles of\n\nResponsible Care.  In addition to ensuring that our\n\nemployees have the best training in the operation of our\n\nprocesses, we demand that safety be the first priority in\n\nthe design, installation, operation and maintenance of our\n\nprocesses.\n\n\n\n     We have implemented maintenance and inspection programs\n\nthat help ensure site integrity.  Our policy is to implement\n\nreasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of\n\nregulated substances.  Examples of controls to prevent\n\nreleases include (1) installation of pressure relief valves\n\nto prevent rupture of vessels due to overpressurization, (2)\n\nroutine visual inspection and thickness checks to ensure\n\nvessels and piping are in good condition, (3) using\n\nmaterials of construction that are compatible with the\n\nprocess chemistry, (4) vessel pressure and temperature are\n\ncontinuously monitored and (5) use of carbon and water\n\nscrubbers to remove small amounts of emissions.\n\n     \n\n     However, should a release occur, trained personnel will\n\nrespond to control and contain the release.  Mitigation\n\nmeasures that have been included in our design include\n\ninstallation of isolation valves, fire suppression systems\n\nin areas where flammable chemicals are present and fire\n\nfighting equipment in all process areas, a fully implemented\n\nemergency response plan, appropriate PPE and an alarm system\n\nfor early notification of a release.

The alternative release scenarios are more\n\nrealistic than worst-case scenarios, but are still unlikely\n\nto happen.

This review ensures that safety\n\nfeatures, procedures, personnel and the equipment are\n\nprepared for service before the process is restarted.  A pre-\n\nstartup safety review will generally include field\n\nverification of new construction and also serves a quality\n\nassurance function by verifying that accident prevention\n\nmeasures are implemented correctly.  Generally, a pre-\n\nstartup review will ensure that (1) construction and\n\nequipment are consistent with design standards, (2) adequate\n\noperating, safety and maintenance procedures are in place,\n\n(3) training for all affected employees is complete and (4)\n\na Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) has been performed, if\n\nnecessary.\n\n\n\n\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\n\n\n\n     The Smyrn plant trains its employees to promptly\n\ninvestigate each incident that resulted in, or could have\n\nresulted in serious injury to employees, the public or the\n\nenvironment.  Incident investigations are designed to\n\ndetermine the facts, identify the root causes and provide\n\nrecommendations for ensuring that the incident does not\n\nrecur.  Corrective actions resulting from an incident\n\ninvestigation are tracked until they are resolved.  Incident\n\ninvestigations are conducted in accordance with our Safety\n\nStandard 201 and utilize Non-Conformance Notices (NCN's)\n\nthat are define through our ISO Problem Elimination\n\nProcedures (AP-010).\n\n\n\n\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\n\n\n     The Smyrna plant encourages employees to be involved in\n\nevery aspect of process safety management and accident\n\nprevention.  Employees are routinely asked to participate in\n\nPHA's, incident investigations, management of change hazard\n\nanalyses and all other aspects of the prevention program.\n\nEmployees have access to all information developed as part\n\nof the prevention program and are specifically infor"

The various\n\nways employees are involved in the prevention program are\n\ndocumented in a written plan.\n\n\n\n\n\nSAFE WORK PRACTICES\n\n\n\n     The Smyrna plant has established safe work practices\n\nthat ensure the safety of our employees.  Examples of these\n\nprocedures include (1) hot work permits designed to control\n\nspark or flame producing activities, (2) a permit and\n\nprocedure to control confined space entry and (3) a\n\nlockout/tagout procedure for isolating energy sources during\n\nmaintenance.  These procedures and permits ensure that\n\noperations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n\n\nCONTRACTORS\n\n\n\n     The Smyrna plant uses contractors for various\n\nactivities such as maintenance and construction.  All\n\ncontractors are evaluated to ensure that they are well\n\ntrained and are able to perform their job function in a safe\n\nmanner.  A contractor's safety record and performance are\n\nreviewed during the selection process.  Once a contractor is\n\nselected, the plant provides training and procedures to\n\nensure that contractor employees (1) perform their work in a\n\nsafe manner, (2) are aware of the hazards associated with\n\nthe area in which they will be working, (3) understand the\n\nemergency response procedures and (4) report any hazards\n\nthey find during their work.

Audits are performed by a team that is\n\nknowledgeable in our processes, but is independent of our\n\nfacility to ensure a thorough and complete evaluation.  The\n\naudit team systematically evaluates each aspect of the\n\nprevention program, ensuring both compliance with the RMP\n\nrule and effective hazard prevention.  The results of"

This management system helps prevent hazards\n\nassociated with equipment failures and human error.  In\n\naddition to the prevention program, the Smyrna plant has\n\nsafety features built into the design of our facility that\n\nhelp to ensure safe process operation for our employees, the\n\npublic and the environment.  These features may contain or\n\ncontrol a release, detect a release or reduce the\n\nconsequences of a release.  They may also prevent a release\n\nby providing strict design standards for process equipment.\n\nThe following types of safety features are used in various\n\nprocesses in our facility:\n\n  -    Release detection monitors\n\n-    Procedures require that a plan employee be present\n\nduring loading and unloading operations\n\n-    Valves to permit isolation of the process\n\n-    Automated notification systems for some process\n\nparameters, (e.g., high level, high pressure)\n\n-    Manual shutdown systems located in the control room\n\n-    Diked areas designed to contain a release and prevent\n\nits spread\n\n-    Pressure relief valves and rupture disks that discharge\n\nsafely to the atmosphere\n\n-    Fire suppression equipment\n\n-    Trained emergency response personnel\n\n-    Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)- protective\n\nclothing, self-contained breathing apparatus\n\n-    Spill clean up equipment\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\n     Our five year accident history has shown that the site\n\nhas had a number of minor releases of RMP chemicals.\n\nHowever, only one of these has resulted in any off-site\n\nconsequences that involved any injuries.
