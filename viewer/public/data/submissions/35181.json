This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with ASME, Section 8, 1955 and 1979 editions.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n3.1\tProcess Safety Information\n\nCherokee Nitrogen maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n3.2\tProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is HAZOP.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of every five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 11/30/2001.\n\n3.3\tOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Cherokee Nitrogen maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the"

This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n2.0\tCherokee Nitrogen Company and Regulated Substances \n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the manufacture of ammonia and related processes. Ammonia is a natural part of the life process.  It is produced internally by all humans and mammals to process essential proteins. Ammonia is one of the most widely used industrial chemicals in the world, and is commonly used to purify water and refrigerate foods.\n\nThe company is a supplier to the fertilizer industry by manufacturing fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate, ammonium nitrate solutions, and other fertilizer products.  Cherokee Nitrogen markets its fertilizers to distributors, dealers, national farm retail chains, regional farm cooperatives, and other fertilizer producers for ultimate sale and delivery to farmers. \n\nWe have two regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include anhydrous ammonia and aqueous ammonia. Anhydrous ammonia is used to manufacture nitric acid (<80 percent).  Aqueous ammonia is contained within the urea and ammonium nitrate solutions.  Typically, the facility manufactures two types of ammonium nitrate solutions: industrial-grade (83 weight percent) ammonium nitrate solution, and a high pressure solution consisting of 24 to 25 percent ammonia and 69 to 70 percent ammonium nitrate. The industrial grade ammonium nitrate is used as a primary building block for commercial explosives and blasting agents.  Without this"

Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\n3.5\tMechanical Integrity\n\nCherokee Nitrogen carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  \n\nMaintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n3.6\tManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Cherokee Nitrogen to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  The most recent review/revision of Management of Change procedures was performed on 05/17/2004.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\n3.7\tPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Cherokee Nitrogen.  The most recent review was performed on 10/08/2003.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n3.8\tCompliance Audits\n\nCherokee Nitrogen conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.

These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n3.9\tIncident Investigation\n\nCherokee Nitrogen promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of five years.\n\n3.10\tEmployee Participation\n\nCherokee Nitrogen truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\n3.11\tContractors\n\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Cherokee Nitrogen has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n4.0\tChemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n4.1\tAnhydrous Ammonia\n\nSeveral process controls are in place to prevent and/or mitigate accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.
