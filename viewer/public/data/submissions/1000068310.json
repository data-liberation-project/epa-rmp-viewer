Therefore, this Facility is subject to the Risk\r\nManagement Plan (RMP) requirements codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 (40 CFR 68) administered by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA).\r\n\r\nUpper Hill is also subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119). Upon completion of modeling, Smith & Burgess found there were off-site receptors identified using EPA MARPLOT that could be\r\nimpacted by the RMP scenarios. Therefore, Upper Hill is subject to Program 3 requirements as stated in 40 CFR 68.10. OSHA's PSM standard closely parallels requirements outlined in US EPA's RMP Rule. All elements required by US EPA's 40 CFR 68 - Program 3 Prevention\r\nProgram are also required by OSHA's PSM.\r\n\r\na) The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source \r\nUpper Hill employs one (1) full-time employee on-site who will ensure the proper operation and maintenance of the Facility.  Upper Hill maintains a policy of safe condensate handling operations, reducing to the greatest extent possible hazards associated with the extraction processes, and reducing subsequent risk to the surrounding community, employees, and the environment.  Upper Hill has procedures in place, including both on-site activities and coordination with offsite responders that are to be followed in the event of a flammable material release. This Facility is submitting its first RMP to the US EPA.

Therefore, Upper Hill is classified as a Program 3 Facility.\r\nThe processes at the plant are interconnected by piping and fit the EPA's definition of a stationary source in 40 CFR part 68.  The plant boundaries of the stationary source begin at the pig receiver at the plant inlet and end at the pig launcher plant discharge just after the 10 block valve tied to ESD-3000. This plant is designed to receive natural gas from a pipeline. The gas process begins with inlet separation to\r\nremove any pipeline liquids. These Y-Grade liquids are stabilized as a condensate to remove any materials that are not atmospheric stable liquids, sent to storage and can then be trucked off site. The remaining gas is then compressed to pipeline pressures and goes through a dehydration process to ensure most of the water is removed from the gas before being exported offsite.  The Upper Hill Compressor Station was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded a defined threshold quantity. The listed flammable substances that are stored above threshold quantities at Upper Hill are natural gas, unstabilized condensate, stabilized condensate, and natural gas liquids. The flammable components of these substances include methane, ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes, hexanes, and heavier alkanes. This Facility is subject to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 (40 CFR 68) administered by the US EPA.\r\n\r\nc) The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps \r\nUpper Hill employs 1 full-time employee on-site who will ensure the proper operation and maintenance of the Facility.

Furthermore, the Facility has coordinated the emergency response with the local fire department. For these reasons, Upper Hill meets the\r\nexceptions listed in 40 CFR 68.90(b), and therefore the Facility is not required to have the Emergency Response Program as described in 40 CFR 68.95. As such, the Facility is non responsive.\r\n\r\nf) Planned changes to improve safety\r\nThe Facility last completed a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) during design of the Facility in 2016 to assess potential areas to improve safety at the Facility. The final action item from the PHA was completed before startup. Pre-startup safety reviews (PSSRs) are conducted on a regular basis whenever changes are made to the process. The Facility will update and revalidate the PHA every 5 years as per OSHA PSM and EPA RMP regulations."
