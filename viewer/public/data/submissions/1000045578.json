This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Processing and storage of fruit (Blueberries).  We have 1 regulated substance present at our facility.  Anhydrous Ammonia (anhydrous) is used as a refrigerant for the flash freezing and storage of frozen blueberries.\n\n\n\nThe maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) at the Cherryfield facility is 19600 lb. The largest system hold approximately 9,000 gallons.\n\n\n\n3.The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenarios( including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario)\n\n\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for the Cherryfield facility, we have used the EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration  Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Ammonia Refrigeration.  In this scenario 9,000 lb.(largest single system)of Ammonia (anhydrous) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 1.7 mi"

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nJasper Wyman & Son maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If/Checklist (combined) and HAZOP.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of every 3 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 3/23/2010.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Jasper Wyman & Son maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nJasper Wyman & Son has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every year and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nJasper Wyman & Son carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.

Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Jasper Wyman & Son  to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on 05/30/2013.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Jasper Wyman & Son C&D Division.  The most recent review was performed on 05/30/2013.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nJasper Wyman & Son conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.
