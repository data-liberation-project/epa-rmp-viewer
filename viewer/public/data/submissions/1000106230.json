Following is a description of some of these safety features.\nThe Linde Gas & Equipment - Portland Warehouse has extensive personnel and process monitoring to detect gas releases or out-of-control processes. Upon reaching certain thresholds set at or below American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) levels, alarms will sound throughout the facility prompting a site evacuation if necessary. In addition to the engineering controls mentioned above, administrative controls consisting of personnel attendance is conducted at preset locations within the site. Following a site evacuation, trained first responders from the Linde LEAP program will be deployed to investigate and take appropriate action to mitigate any incident. An investigation is conducted following the incident with corrective action to prevent reoccurrence.\n\n4. Five-year accident history:\n\nLinde Gas & Equipment - Portland Warehouse has not had an accident involving release of Hydrogen chloride since beginning of operation in February 2022.\n\n5. Emergency Response Program:\n\nLinde has an emergency response program in place to minimize the effects of accidental release of regulated substances on employees, the public, and the environment. In the event of an emergency accidental release involving our Hydrogen chloride, it is Linde\u0092s policy to immediately notify the Portland Fire Depart"
