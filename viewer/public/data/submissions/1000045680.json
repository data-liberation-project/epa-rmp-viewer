The responsibility of the RMP has been assigned to the WWTP operator who will review the program at least on an annual basis.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information A\u00bf The Shasta Lake WWTP has developed and maintains written safety information about the chlorination and de-chlorination process and the technology of process equipment used.  The operation of this facility adheres to the guidelines of the Chlorine Institute and to the OSHA regulations regarding Process Safety Management.  Process Safety Information is readily available to all personnel and is updated when changes are made.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) A\u00bf A PHA review was conducted in June 2014 appropriate to the complexity of the chlorination process that identified, evaluated, and controlled potential hazards using the A\u00bfWhat-If ChecklistA\u00bf and A\u00bfHazard Review ChecklistsA\u00bf processes.  These processes include the analysis of hazards due to equipment malfunction and human error.  It describes steps used to detect and monitor releases.
