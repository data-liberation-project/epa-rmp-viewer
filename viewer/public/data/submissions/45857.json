Our facility regularly meets with outside responders, local fire departments, and the local emergency planning committee in order to establish emergency response procedures necessary to protect our surrounding public and the environment.\n\nOur facility and the regulated substances handled:\n\nThe Solo Cup facility in Federalsburg, Maryland produces food grade disposable tableware and packaging.  The Solo Cup facility has a Program 3 covered process due to the onsite storage and use of difluoroethane (CAS # 75-37-6).  Difluoroethane is used at the facility as a blowing agent in extruded polystyrene foam for disposable food service and packaging products.  \n\nThe worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario:\n\nOne worst-case release scenario was modeled for the difluoroethane covered process using USEPA's RMP*Comp, version 1.06.  Our facility stores difluoroethane in a single 6,550 gallon storage tank.  The USEPA requires that the entire contents of the largest vessel be used for the worst-case release scenario.  This scenario is highly unlikely and has never occurred at our facility.  The facility has an agreement with the supplier to maintain the maximum level in the tank at 85% of its capacity, which is an administrative control.  The worst-case release scenario for difluoroethane potentially has an offsite impact.\n\nOne alternative release scenario was modeled for the difluoroethane covered process using the same guidance document as stated above.  Per USEPA guidance, the alternative release scenario is intended to be a more reasonable or likely event than the worst-case release scenario, however, it is still very conservative in nature.  The alternative release scenario modeled was a complete one-inch and one quarter inch"

      "SummaryText": " unloading hose break at the tank wagon unloading header.   The flow would be limited by an excess flow valve, integral to the tank wagon and the difluoroethane storage tank. The excess flow valve on the storage tank is rated at 66gpm and the excess flow valve on the tank wagon is rated at 400 gpm.  A Solo Cup employee and the delivery driver are present during the entire delivery, therefore, potential releases could be shut off within 5 minutes, from one of three remotely actuated shut off points.  The event modeled has never occurred at our facility.  This event was chosen based on the impact distance compared to other postulated scenarios that would have a much smaller impact distance or none at all.  The alternative release analysis does have the potential for offsite impacts.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThis facility is covered by both USEPA's Risk Management Program rule, as well as, OSHA's Process Safety Management Rule for the difluoroethane covered process.  This facility implements one combined Process Safety and Risk Management Program.  This program consists of a written management system that complies with both USEPA's and OSHA's requirements.  The backbone of the program is the Management of Change Procedure.  This procedure enables the facility to initiate and complete process changes associated with the difluoroethane system while maintaining the Process Safety and Risk Management Program requirements at the facility.  \n\nBoth the worst-case and alternative release scenarios were modeled based on equipment failure, therefore, the mechanical integrity element of the program is key in preventing releases from the difluoroethane process.  This facility utilizes a computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) to implement the preventative maintenance, testing and inspection of the difluoroethane system.  The CMMS supports the routine preventative maintenance program, which in combination "

The emergency response plan indicates that the 911 system be utilized to summon outside emergency responders.  The Caroline County LEPC will be contacted to alert the general public.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nSolo Cup has reviewed employee training programs and operating procedures and has made changes as necessary to increase safety awareness among our employees.  The facility will continue to make improvements as identified through our employee participation and internal auditing programs."
