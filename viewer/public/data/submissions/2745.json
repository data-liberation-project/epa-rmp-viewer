ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe emergency response procedures for the facility are included as part of the \"Training Programs\" manual and the Injury and Illness Prevention Program document.  These procedures were designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1. To save lives.\n2. To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3. To protect the environment.\n4. To minimize property damage.\n\nThe emergency response procedures provide the reporting and notification procedures, evacuation procedures, and mitigation procedures that may be implemented to ensure operators respond effectively to an emergency situation.  This manual is distributed to all plant personnel upon initial employment and is readily available at the facility. \n\nB.  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe F&A Dairy facility is located at 691 Inyo Street, in Newman, California.  This location is situated along Inyo Street, approximately one kilometer (0.62 miles) east of Highway 33.  The immediate area is primarily industrial and commercial with residential areas to the east.  The facility manufactures various dairy products.  The facility operates the ammonia refrigeration system in order to maintain appropriate temperatures for process and storage conditions.  The facility was originally built in 1985.  The facility currently covers approximately 2.5 acres ( 10,900 square feet). \n\nAmmonia is used as the refrigerant in the refrigeration process.  The system, consisting of piping, valves, and process equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold storage rooms and process equipment.\n\nChanges in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature: lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature.  Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat.  Removal of ambient"

      "SummaryText": " heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize.  Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid.  Typical operating conditions range from approximately 5 psi on the low pressure side of the system to 165 psig on the high side.\n\nThe total ammonia inventory is 13,750 pounds.\n\nC.  HAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\nWorst Case Release:\n\nThe worst case release for this facility was that of the maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored in a single vessel. The largest vessel at this facility is the high pressure receiver which is sized to hold the entire charge, 13,750 pounds, of ammonia.  This vessel is located outside, therefore, no passive mitigation measures were used.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used: 1.5 meters/second wind speed, and F stability.  The facility is located in a rural setting.  The SLAB dispersion model was used to determine the maximum downwind distance reached by 200 ppm. The release reaches off-site and may affect population receptors.  No environmental receptors are affected by this potential release.\n\nAlternative Release:\n\nThe alternative release was that of a 0.25 inch diameter leak of high pressure liquid ammonia for one hour.  The quantity of ammonia released in one hour at this rate is 6000 pounds.  This scenario represents a small leak that could occur at a valve connection, flange seal, or pump seal.  The meteorological conditions used were 3 meters/second wind speed, and D stability.  The facility is located in a rural setting.  The SLAB dispersion model was used to determine the maximum downwind distance reached by 200 ppm. The release reaches off-site and may affect population receptors.  No environmental receptors are affected by this potential release.\n\nD.

FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no reported releases of ammonia at this facility over the last five years (June 21, 1994 through June 21, 1999).\n\nF.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe following summarizes the emergency response and notification procedures at the facility.\n\n1. In the event of a spill, release, near miss, or threatened release involving ammonia, evacuate the immediate area and report the situation to the area supervisor.\n\n2. Area supervisor will contact the Plant Manager and the Chief Engineer.  If both are not available (e.g. off-site), then the highest ranking supervisor on-site is contacted at the front office.  If needed, the Plant Manager and Chief Engineer are contacted using pagers and/or telephone calls.  The Plant Manager, Chief Engineer, or the highest ranking on-site official can authorize a plant evacuation.\n\n3. When the evacuation horn sounds, all employees should follow the evacuation procedures and evacuate the plant to ensure their safety. Currently, the facility evacuates its employees by the use of an alarm system and personal communication.  It is the responsibility of the management and supervisory staff to notify all employees of the need to evacuate.\n\n4. Call 911 to ensure public safety and have the emergency response team (trained to use SCBAs) readily available.  The Chief Engineer or his designated alternate will evaluate the situation and determine appropriate response measures (e.g. use"

Within 30 days of the release, the Emergency Release Follow-up Notice Reporting Form must be completed and sent to the Chemical Emergency Planning and Response Center (CEPRC) Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) in Sacramento.\n\nG.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThere were several recommendations resulting from the development of the PSM/RMP document including recommendations from the Process Hazard Analysis and Off-Site Consequence Analysis studies.  These Teams made several procedural/managerial recommendations to improve safety at the facility.  These recommendations are expected to be implemented by June 1999 and are listed as follows:\n\nHIGH PRESSURE RECEIVER\n\nR01  Correct drawing to include the king valve.  Update all piping and instrumentation diagrams so that they may reflect the current ammonia refrigeration system accurately.\n\nR02  Install a solenoid king valve on the main liquid feed line close to the receiver and ammonia sensors in the area.  The sensors should be interlocked to close the solenoid valve.  Allow the compressors to run in the event of an emergency.  In addition, install two remote shut off switches near the maintenance shop exits that will close the solenoid king valve.\n\nR0"

Automatically replace any relief valve that unseats.\n\nR05  Consider placing sensors at the end of the pressure relief header throughout the system.\n\nR06  Insulate or paint all exposed piping and equipment.
