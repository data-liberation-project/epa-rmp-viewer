      "SummaryText": "Zippo Manufacturing Company has recently constructed a new facility in Custer City, Pennsylvania that will allow our company to expand its manufacturing capabilities and continue to provide our customers with other high quality products.  This facility will add a butane filling operation where consumer butane cans will be filled and sold to the marketplace.\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\nThe newly constructed facility was built following all applicable codes including, but not limited to: NFPA 54, NFPA 58, NFPA 70 & 70E, National Liquefied Petroleum Gas Code, along with any and all building construction codes.  Upon preparing for operations, this new facility also is equipped with state-of-the-art fire suppression systems, gas detections and surveillance and security systems.  Zippo Manufacturing Company prides itself on our commitment to safety and has put in place rules, guidelines and procedures to adhere to any and all federal, state and local regulations.   As well, all employees have underwent extensive training in Liquefied Petroleum Gas Safety, Hazardous Materials and Emergency Action and Response Procedures, fire prevention and fire extinguisher operations-to name a few.  Zippo Manufacturing Company also has an exceptional working relationship with local and county emergency agencies.  Zippo has also conducted LPG training to these agencies to help familiarize them  with our facility, hazards associated with our processes and our extensive safety devices and procedures already in place, should an emergency arise.  \n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances:\nThis facility holds a can filling operation that consists of respective process equipment along with an 18,000 and an 1850 gallon butane storage tank.  This facility is secure and under surveillance twenty-four hours per day.

      "SummaryText": "Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\nAgain, Zippo Manufacturing Company strives for safety excellence.  Release and accident prevention are our top priority in regards to this new process.  Extensive safety training has been given to all employees who may play any role in this facility.  Along with training, precise programs and procedures have been put in place to avoid any accidents or releases.  A multitude of safety devices have also been installed on all effected equipment including, but not limited to: safety pressure relief devices, automatic shutting valves, emergency shut off valves, breakaway bulkhead piping, dual (redundant) fire suppression systems, gas detection systems and emergency HVAC evacuation systems.\n\nFive-Year Accident History:\nSince this facility and processes are new, accident history is not applicable.\nEmergency Response Program:\nAn Emergency Response Program has been implemented at this facility.  As part of this program, all employees have been trained in specific procedures to allow them to react safely to an emergency situation.  All employees have been trained on how to operate all emergency devices within the facility (i.e., emergency shut off valves, fire extinguishers, First Aid/AED equipment, fire alarm systems, electrical emergencies, etc.).  Also, as part of the emergency plan, coordination has been had with local and county emergency agencies.  These agencies have toured our facilities and have conducted pre-plans for training purposes.  This will allow them to be prepared ahead of time, should an actual emergency arise.  During an actual emergency, procedures are in place to allow communication with local television, radio and newspaper companies to better educate the public.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\nAlthough this facility is newly constructed and operational, Zippo Manufacturing Company continues to monitor for improvements.  \n\n\n"
