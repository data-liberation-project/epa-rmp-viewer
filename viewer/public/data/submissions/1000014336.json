Release and accident prevention are our top priority in regards to this new process.  Extensive safety training has been given to all employees who may play any role in this facility.  Along with training, precise programs and procedures have been put in place to avoid any accidents or releases.  A multitude of safety devices have also been installed on all effected equipment including, but not limited to: safety pressure relief devices, automatic shutting valves, emergency shut off valves, breakaway bulkhead piping, dual (redundant) fire suppression systems, gas detection systems and emergency HVAC evacuation systems.\n\nFive-Year Accident History:\nSince this facility and processes are new, accident history is not applicable.\nEmergency Response Program:\nAn Emergency Response Program has been implemented at this facility.  As part of this program, all employees have been trained in specific procedures to allow them to react safely to an emergency situation.  All employees have been trained on how to operate all emergency devices within the facility (i.e., emergency shut off valves, fire extinguishers, First Aid/AED equipment, fire alarm systems, electrical emergencies, etc.).  Also, as part of the emergency plan, coordination has been had with local and county emergency agencies.  These agencies have toured our facilities and have conducted pre-plans for training purposes.  This will allow them to be prepared ahead of time, should an actual emergency arise.  During an actual emergency, procedures are in place to allow communication with local television, radio and newspaper companies to better educate the public.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\nAlthough this facility is newly constructed and operational, Zippo Manufacturing Company continues to monitor for improvements."
