The Alternative Release Scenario for chlorine is a 3/8\" pipe break resulting in a release of 1,704 pounds over a 60 minute period.

The distance to the flammable endpoint (3.3% volume-LFL) is estimated to be 0.06 miles.  The impact from the alternative release scenario for hydrogen is limited by emergency shutdown procedures.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program:\nThe Woodward Plant has a comprehensive Process Safety Management (PSM) Program and is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's standard for process safety management of highly hazardous chemicals found in 29 CFR Part 1910.119.  Key elements of the PSM program include:  1) stringent design standards of equipment which incorporate substantial safety factors and include state of the art monitoring and control instrumentation; 2) extensive process safety information that is accurate and up to date; 3) well trained operating, maintenance, and contract personnel; 4) written operating and maintenance procedures and safe work practices; 5) mechanical integrity procedures for process equipment inspections and quality control; 6) management of change and pre-startup safety review procedures; 7) periodic, detailed evaluations of each process area by a team utilizing HAZOP methodology; 8) regular PSM program audits; and 9) employee participation in every element of the PSM program.\n\nFive-Year Accident History:  A release of 50 pounds of anhydrous ammonia occurr"

The employee immediately closed the valve and sustained an ammonia burn on his abdomen during the event.  The employee was transported to the Woodward, OK. Hospital Emergency Room for treatment.  The injured employee received a prescription medication for the burn and was off work for three days with an additional four days of restricted duty.  No off-site impacts occurred.\nA release of 796 pounds of ammonia to the atmosphere occurred at the Terra Woodward Plant on May 1, 2007 at 8:00 am.  The leak source was a tanker truck that was being loaded with ammonia solution (approximately 26%).  While being loaded, the tanker built up enough pressure to rupture a seal on the hatch on the top of the tanker.  The tanker subsequently depressured and released the ammonia vapors to the atmosphere.  No off-site impacts occurred.  As a precaution, approximately 160 plant employees and contractors were evacuated from the immediate area to the front gate of the facility until it was determined the ammonia plant was safe to re-enter   \n\nEmergency Response Program:\nThe Woodward Plant has a comprehensive Emergency Response Program which includes a written plan that is coordinated with local authorities, a 60-plus member emergency response team, and emergency notification system that utilizes both in-plant sirens and the Community Alert Network telephone system.  Woodward Plant personnel are active members of the Woodward County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  The plant exercises its emergency response plan annually and also participates in countywide drills that are staged by the LEPC and other local emergency response authorities.\n"
