(Kraft) facility in Springfield, Missouri has a good record in preventing and minimizing releases of anhydrous* ammonia.  The Kraft facility has a thorough emergency training program for on-site emergency responders.  The facility has implemented the SAP electronic preventive maintenance system that uses a real time database to track training and inspection dates and issue reminders to responsible groups.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response policies at the Kraft facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage 24 hours - 7 days per week.  There are also provisions for coordination with outside agencies such as the Springfield Fire Department in the event of an emergency.\n\n\n\n*From this point in the Executive Summary, anhydrous ammonia will be synonymous with ammonia.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.0    PROCESS DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nAt this location Kraft manufactures and produces dairy products.  The NAICS code for the primary process at this facility is 311514.  This facility is capable of producing various dairy products including cheese for consumer intake.  Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to preserve the dairy products.  Some of these areas include coolers, chillers, storage tanks, and some processes.  The plant also produces some pasta products  \n\n\n\nKraft has one regulated substance under 40 CFR Part 68: ammonia.  Ammonia is used as a cooling agent in the refrigeration of the foods in the various areas described above.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia threshold for triggering applicability to 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds. The quantity of ammonia stored on-site is approximately 109,212 pounds.  Thus, 40 CFR Part 68 is applicable to the Kraft plant in Springfield, MO.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.0    Worse-Case & Alternate Scenarios\n\n\n\nThe \"RMP*Comp dispersion model was used to complete an off-site consequence analysis of ammonia dispersion to determine the radius (end-point) of impact on th"

The RMP*Comp is a computer model developed by the USEPA.\n\n\n\nWorst Case: The largest potential release of ammonia would occur with a catastrophic failure of the\n\nhigh-pressure receiver.  Taking the specific definition of the worst-case from 40 CFR\n\n68.25, the largest quantity of ammonia that can be stored in a vessel is in the high\n\npressure receiver during a pump-out condition.  The total quantity of ammonia that can be\n\nstored in the high-pressure receiver is 23,138 without administrative controls. \n\nSince the vessel is located outdoors, it is assumed that the entire 23,138 pounds is released into the atmosphere in 10 minutes.  The release rate is 2,313.8 lb./min. Refined computer modeling using the SLAB model was used to obtain the distance to endpoint which is 0.9 miles.\n\n\n\nAlternate Case: An alternative scenario was selected for reporting which has a relatively high probability of occurrence and has a distance to endpoint that extends off-site: an ammonia release from the PRV's on the high pressure receiver which is located approximately 200 ft from the fence line.  This produces a horizontal jet release.  There is no applicable administrative controls or passive mitigation.  Active mitigation of the release is human intervention (PRV is shutdown at 10 minutes from the start of the release). The ammonia vapor cloud was calculated to be above 200 ppm on the ground level at a distance of 0.1 miles.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.0    GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nKraft has developed an OSHA PSM program for their ammonia refrigeration systems. At Kraft, ammonia falls under the RMP Program 3 prevention program which is identical to the OSHA PSM program.  EPA has said that if the process is in compliance with OSHA PSM, then it is in compliance with RMP Program 3.  Thus, Kraft's ammonia PSM has been reviewed and determined to be complete for the RMP document.  \n\n\n\nThere are several aspects of the ammonia preventi"

      "SummaryText": "on program that are key:\n\n\n\n1.  The Utility Service Area design (USA) serves as an excellent safeguard for plant personnel because it greatly reduces the amount of ammonia piping inside occupied rooms.  Since most of the pipe work is out of the way of people and machinery, there is less of a chance of an ammonia release.\n\n2.     The plant maintains good training, certification, and employee awareness of operating procedures.\n\n3.    An electronic control monitoring system and emergency shut down system is in place for the entire engine room process.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.0    FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nAccording to 40 CFR Part 68.42(a), there have been no accidental releases at this facility.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.0    EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nAs mentioned earlier, this facility has developed an emergency response plan in which plant employees are divided into various management and response teams.  There are nine in-plant contacts for an emergency, a list of these contacts can be found in the Emergency Response Plan (SPCC).  There are also back-up personnel in the event that the primary incident response personnel cannot be contacted.  The emergency response plan includes information about the frequency of employee emergency response training, as well as a detailed description of the training content.  There are also specific procedures to follow in the event of a fire and ammonia emergency.  Response team members participate in a mock spill cleanup annually.  All trained ER team members have pagers/phones that can be activated.\n\n\n\nAt the discretion of the Incident Commander, the Springfield Fire Department will be called to provide emergency responders and equipment.  The Springfield Fire Department will also be called for all fire related emergencies.  \n\n\n\n\n\n7.0    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nA 5 year revalidation of Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for ammonia was conducted on the ammonia system at Springfield MO from 2/23/12to 3/10/12. The PHA team reviewed all past PHA recommendations, valid"

There are numerous examples of safety improvements as a result of the PSA results.  These improvements include:\n\n\n\nRecommendation #1: Hard pipe the ammonia compressor thermosyphon heat exchangers to the oil \n\nmanagement still for emergency evacuation.\n\n    Analysis: Current practice is to use a flexible hose (approved for ammonia) for emergency evacuation of ammonia refrigeration system piping and equipment. The current evacuation process is considered a safe method of ammonia evacuation. \n\n    Corrective action: Confirm that existing standard operating procedures include emergency evacuation procedures using flexible hose and develop where they do not exist. \n\n    \n\n    Recommendation #2: Install a communication link between the ammonia sensors in ammonia chill roll surge vesel & pump rooms to the central compressor room control room alarm system. \n\nAnalysis: The ammonia sensors currently activate local emergency exhaust systems and alarm locally. Due to \n\nthe fact that these surge systems experience high temperature process heat loads and are equipped with multiple hermetic ammonia pumps, immediate notification of an ammonia release is important. Corrective action: Install communication link to central control and alarm system as recommended. \n\n    \n\n    Recommendation #3: Install a larger exhaust fan in Old Slice surge room. \n\n    Analysis: The existing emergency exhaust fan provides inadequate evacuation (sufficient air changes to prevent explosive conditions). \n\n    Corrective action: Install a new (larger) exhaust fan in the old slice surge room as recommended. \n\n    \n\n    Recommendation #4: Provide guarding to prevent product from being stacked up against 107 cooler unit evaporators or surge drum assemblies. \n"

      "SummaryText": "\n    Analysis: The plant does not currently require refrigeration in the 107 area and no definite plans are in place to re-start the refrigeration evaporators. \n\n    Corrective action: In lieu of additional guarding, evacuate the ammonia refrigerant from all evaporators until such time as evaporators for refrigeration are required in the area. At that time, reassess evaporator location relative to room use to determine proper equipment guarding. \n\n    \n\n    Recommendation #5: Plant currently has Hansen Gas rated safety relief valves on oil pots and compressor oil coolers. Identify and replace all gas rated safety relief valves with liquid rated safety relief valves. \n\n    Analysis: Liquid Rated safety relief valves are not available in appropriate s or capacities to facilitate this recommendation. \n\n    Corrective action: None \n\n    \n\n    Recommendation #6: Add a door into the surge room in the old slice vestibule to allow safe access to ammonia valves. \n\n    Analysis: The ammonia isolation valves between the chill rolls and ammonia surges vessels must be operated routinely as part of a weekly maintenance function. Operation of the valves requires the refrigeration mechanic to enter a confined space not easily escaped from in the event of a significant valve packing leak or other ammonia release. \n\n    Corrective action: Install an access doorway from the vestibule to back side of surge drum room as recommended. \n\n    \n\n    Recommendation #7: Plant currently has approximately 20 SRV headers that do not meet ASHRAE 15-2001 code. Develop project to  SRV headers in accordance with ASHRAE standard. \n\n    Analysis: Safety relief valve vent headers do not meet the ASHRAE standard. \n\nCorrective action: Perform engineering to identify required vent header modification and install or modify as needed. \n\n    \n\n    Recommendation #8: Implement proper documentation of daily rounds through the Business Units by making daily check sheets. \n\nAnalysis: The daily refrigeration system inspections are currently being performed p"
