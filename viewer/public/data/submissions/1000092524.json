Both are present in quantities that exceed the threshold quantity for applicability of EPA's Accidental Release Program. Ethylene oxide ( a toxic chemical), and trimethylamine (a flammable chemical) are utilized at this facility for the manufacture of nutritional supplements, animal food products for the poultry, beef, dairy, and companion animal industry, and also in the oil well production industry. Ethylene oxide is also repackaged for use in the sterilization of medical implements and spices. BCP Ingredients commitment to providing a safe and healthy work environment for employees, as well as providing a safe and healthy environment for the surrounding community is supported by the incorporation of the latest technology in process controls, active mitigation, passive mitigation, and monitoring and detection systems. BCP Ingredients adheres to all applicable Federal, State, and local safety and environmental regulations for the prevention of releases of these and all chemicals. All information regarding BCP Ingredients Risk Management Plan has been submitted to EPA utilizing EPA's RMP eSubmit Software.                                                                                                                                                               \r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program:\r\n\r\nBCP Ingredients complies with the Process Safety Management Rule of OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.119 for the prevention of hazardous chemical releases, and is therefore subject to the requirements of EPA's Program 3 instead of Program 2. It should be noted that no data is reported for Program 2 in the RMP eSubmit data because BCP Ingredients is subject only to Program 3.
