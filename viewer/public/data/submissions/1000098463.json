The Opelika Gas Plant site has an active safety program covering both employees and contract workers. This program encompasses promotion of safe work practices to prevent personal accidents, and incidents that would adversely affect the community. XTO recognizes their commitment to accident prevention through continuing programs including personnel training. Consideration is also given to safety in the design, installation, and operation of natural gas production and gathering systems and modifications to the Site. The safety commitment is also carried forth as evidenced by an aggressive maintenance program. Reasonable controls have been implemented to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. In the unlikely event that a release does occur, arrangements have been made within the local community to provide response and control of any catastrophic releases. Passive mitigation, such as vents, is present at the site to manage any overpressure conditions that may occur. \r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES \r\n\r\nThe facility is located at 10117 CR 3519, Murchison TX. Inherent with the operation of a natural gas gathering and liquids extraction, utilizing a Mechanical Refrigeration Unit (MRU), and stores regulated flammable substances above the threshold quantity. These flammable substances are addressed throughout the RMP, and may include ethane, propane, pentane(s), and butane(s), which are all components of the Natural Gas Liquids Product (NGLP). \r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS \r\n\r\nXTO maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the Site's processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inve"

Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known concerns. For specific operations areas, the Site has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters, such as temperature, level, and composition. The Site ensures that each process is maintained within approved limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel, and automated shutdown systems. Operations at the Site have hazards that are managed to ensure continued safe operation. The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the location. \r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \r\n\r\nThe Site maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety, as well as to protect the environment. The program consists of procedures for contacting responders for mitigation of a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address aspects of emergency response by outside experts and include proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and any decontamination requirements. Employees receive appropriate training in procedures necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties which includes contacting trained responders.

However, there is a system in place to investigate any incident that could result, or could reasonably result in, a fire/explosion, flammable gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of an investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to management for resolution. Corrective actions potentially taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations will be tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation will be documented, and the investigation results reviewed with all employees and contractors who could be affected by the findings."

This coordination includes periodic meetings, which include local emergency response officials, and local government officials. The Site contacts local emergency responders annually with regard to the hazards of regulated substances at the Site. XTO has implemented an Emergency Response Plan (ERP), elements of which overlap those of the RMP. The ERP provides the following information: \r\n\r\n- Procedures for informing the public and offsite emergency response officials of a release.  \r\n\r\n- The individuals and groups contacted, the means by which they will be contacted, the time frame for notification, and the information that will be provided is included in the ERP. \r\n\r\n- The proper procedures for first aid and medical treatment for employees, first responders, and members of the public exposed to a release. \r\n\r\n- Safety precautions for injured parties and detailed information for medical professionals \r\n\r\n- Information regarding who is likely responsible for providing appropriate treatment (e.g., an employee, an employee with specialized training, or a medical professional). \r\n\r\n- Procedures for emergency response in the event of a release of a regulated substance, including descriptions of actions to be taken by employees and other individuals onsite over the course of the release event such as: \r\n\r\n- Selection of response strategies and incident command structure \r\n\r\n- Use of response equipment and other release mitigation activities \r\n\r\n- Post-release equipment and personnel cleanup and decontamination. \r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY \r\n\r\nNo changes are currently proposed for the Site.
