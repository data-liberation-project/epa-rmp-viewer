This Executive Summary is intended to satisfy those requirements.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nSimplot Frozen Vegetables, LLC. is located in Pasco, Washington off Highway 12 in Franklin County.  This facility processes, freezes and stores vegetables and uses anhydrous ammonia in the refrigeration process. The facility employs approximately 280 full time staff and an additional 250 seasonal employees. The facility has residential subdivisions to the west with other surrounding areas used for industrial or agricultural purposes.  \n\n\n\nThe Simplot Frozen Vegetables, LLC. refrigeration process requires the use of one substance currently listed in the RMP rule.  This substance is anhydrous ammonia.  Simplot Frozen Vegetables, LLC. uses anhydrous ammonia in quantities exceeding the rule applicability threshold limits, therefore requiring the facility to develop a Risk Management Program and submit an associated plan.  Because the regulated substance is also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM)standard and not eligible for Program 1, the refrigeration process is a Program 3 process under the RMP rule.   \n\n        \n\nUnder the OSHA PSM Regulation, the facility is required to develop a process safety management program, which is near equivalent to the prevention program required by the Risk Management Program rule. Simplot Frozen Vegetables, LLC. developed and implements both programs concurrently in accordance with both the EPA Risk Management and OSHA PSM requirements and OSHA interpretations.  The program for the covered refrigeration process establishes a multi-element program and management policies and procedures which facilitates the prevention of accidental releases and minimizes any potential release.

Each employee receives initial training appropriate to the job when hired. \n\nThe following prevention program elements inherent in the Process Safety Management (PSM) program have been implemented and decrease the likelihood of a release:\n\n(1)    Mechanical Integrity is a preventative maintenance program that includes inspections and tests that assures the structural integrity of process vessels and piping.\n\n(2)    Hot Work Permits are required to prevent fires in areas where ammonia would be present.\n\n(3)    Process Hazard Analyses are performed every 5 years.\n\n(4)    Management of Change procedures are followed to help prevent failure due to improper engineering of modifications, ensure Process Safety Information is used and up to date, and personnel receive additional training, as required.\n\n(5)    Operating, Maintenance and Emergency Procedures are in place and refrigeration technicians are trained on these procedures.\n\n(6)    Incident Investigations are done on any refrigeration releases to find possible changes that can be made to prevent future releases.\n\n(7)    Emergency Response and Planning prepares facility employees to respond to a release of ammonia if such an event were to occur.\n\n(8)    Pre-Startup Safety Reviews are done on all new or modified processes.\n\n(9)    Compliance Audits of the PSM / RMP programs are conducted every three years by independent contractors or corporate representatives.\n\nIn addition to these PSM/RMP common program elements Simplot Frozen Vegetables, LLC. is committed to be a responsible community partner through an effective emergency planning and response as required by the RMP rule. Emergency plan actions are based on the most recent Off-Site Consequence Analysis (OCA). The OCA is available for review at the Simplot Frozen Vegetables, LLC. processing facility.
