The management and employees of the Dothan facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of Acetylene. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate the any release and minimize the impact of the release to the community and the environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The facilities primary operation is the storage and distribution of Chlorine Gas. Chlorine is delivered in trailers containing a large number ofcylinders manifolded togethe.  Cylinders are removed from the trailer and placed into storage for shipment.
