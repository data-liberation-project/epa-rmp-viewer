Accidental Release Prevention and Emegency Response Policies.\n\nFoothill Orange Coast Chemical stores and repackages which is considered a hazardous material that is a regulated subtanceand is considered in the Risk Management Plan (RMP). The properties of chlorine make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent human exposure, and to reduce the threat tothe facility's workers and nearby members of the community. It is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the safe procedures used to handle chlorine; the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of the pertinent personnel.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nFoothill Orange Coast Chemical provides chlorination services to swimming pools. Chlorine is repackaged at the facility from one ton chlorine containers to 20 pound capacity service cylinders. The 20 pound service cylinders are used by Foothill Orange Coast Chemical service staff to chlorine customer swimming pools. The facility operates five days per week (M-F), ten hours per day for fifty weeks per year.\n\nThe facility consists of two separate buildings. One building is a dedicated office building and the other building is used exclusively for the repackaging of chlorine.  The driveway and yard area provides adequate room for the delivery and parking of delivery vehicles during the off-loading of full one-ton containers and the loading of the empty one-ton containers.\n\nThe amount of chlorine repackaged per month is seasonally dependent. The summer months, for \nobvious reasons, are the busiest time of the year. Consequently, the quantity of chlorine on site is \nhighest during this period. Foothill Orange Coast Chemical stores a maximum of 11000 pounds of chlorine. This amount includes the contents of 3 one- ton containers, 150 twenty pound cylinders, and the 1 one ton container in the repacka"

The one -ton containers, up to a maximum of 4 are stored in the Chemical Building (Fill Yard).\n\nChlorine is repackaged as a liquid from one ton containers into twenty pound net capacity, D.O.T. approved, cylinders. Any residual chlorine in small diameter, short length piping is directed to a Liquid caustic absorption scrubber. The twenty pound cylinders are transported by company services \npersonnel to customers' swimming pools where the services personnel dispense the chlorine as a gas \ninto the pool. The twenty pound cylinders are owned by the company and maintenance is performed in \naccordance with the Chlorine Institute's Pamphlet 17 Cylinder and Ton Container Procedures for \nChlorine Packaging.\n\nOff-loading of the one ton chlorine containers from the commercial delivery vehicle is accomplished with\na hoist. The one- ton containers are placed on the rails in the chlorine building (Fill Yard). The one- ton \ncontainer are then manually rolled to the desired rail location and chocked to prevent movement.\nEmpty and full twenty pound cylinders are segregated and are chained or strapped in place in an upright\nposition. The company has administrative procedures in place that limits the amount of chlorine at the \nfacility to no more than 4 one- ton containers and 150 twenty pound cylinders for a total of 11000 pounds.\nThe procedure, in part requires, the owner/operator to verify existing chlorine inventory to ensure that an\norder and delivery of a one- ton container will not cause the aggregate quantity to exceed 11000 pounds.\n\nThe entire facility is fenced with a locking gate.

Container storage and handling is per Sections 2.6, 2.7, and 2.8 of the Chlorine Institute's Chlorine Manual.\n\nThe Major repacking system components are the D.O.T. approved one- ton chlorine container,the proprietary tranfer piping assembly, the twenty pound capacity D.O.T. approved cylinders, the pan scale for weighing the cylinders during the filling operation, and the chlorine adsorption system.\n\nA proprietary tranfer tube assembly is attached to the lower (liquid level) angle valve on the operating one- ton container and an empty services cylinder is brought into place on a pan scale and attached to the other end of the transfer assembly. Filling commences by opening the one- ton container liquid valve. \nThe cylinder valve, and the other in-line valves in the tranfer assembly. After filling, which is indicated by \nweight on the scale reaching the desired valve, the cylinder valve and the liquid chlorine valve on the \ntransfer assembly are closed. And the transfer tubing is evacuated by means of the eductor in the chlorine\nabsorption system prior to disconnecting the full service cylinder. The caustic solution, comprising the\nabsorption medium is prevented from being sucked back into the system by the unique design of the \nproprietary and confidential part of the chlorine packaging system.\n\nBatch filling of cylinders is accomplished by placing up to two cylinders on separated pan scales and \nattaching the cylinders to the appropiate transfer assembly connectors. The repackaging system is operated under pressure from the chlorine container. The portion of the system on the scrubber side of \nthe normally closed in-line valve is under vacuum at all times.
