The Facility Policy:\n\nThe Facility owner, management, and employees of Gavilon Fertilizer, LLC are \ncommitted to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  Local \nresponders are encouraged to visit the Facility to gain first hand knowledge of the site. \nEmployees are required to hold monthly safety meeting and include sections of the \nmanagement plan in those meetings.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is \nprepared to work with local fire departments, and authorities to mitigate any release, and \nto minimize the impact of a release on the population and environment.\n\nII.   Facility Information:\n\nThe primary activity of the Facility is to provide agricultural fertilizer for the farming \nindustry in the area.  Part of the fertilizer comes in the form of Anhydrous Ammonia.                                                      Ammonia is received, store, and used for production of  liquid fertilizer solutions.                                                           Ammonia is an important source of nitrogen for agricultural crops.\n \nThe maximum quantity that can be stored in the stationary vessel is 131,325 pounds. \nThere are times that rail cars of ammonia are received and unloaded as the product is \nproduced.  An ammonia rail car typically holds 150,000 pounds. It is not a practice to \nhold the car(s) any longer than necessary. The typical method of receiving ammonia is by \ntruck transport containing 40,000 pounds. The process is considered a batch process and \nis not operated continously but as required by customer requirements.\n\nII.  Accidental Release Prevention:\n   \nThe Facility has an internal written emergency plan to us as a guidance. The Facility \ntakes guidance from material published by the American National Standards Institute \n\"Safety Requirements  for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" K61.1, and \nComp"

The Facility tries to minimize the amount of ammonia held or \nstored at the facility through management  judgment. The Facility continues to review \nand look for means to improve operating and best management practice to increase \nsafety. The Facility is routinely inspected by the Illinois Department of Ag for                             \ncompliance to State ammonia regulations.\n\nIV. The Five Year Accident History:\n       \nThere have been no accidental releases of ammonia related to the operation of this facility \nin the past five years.  There have been no deaths, injuries, or significant property damage \nat the Facility.  To the best of our knowledge, no off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, \nsheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage has occurred due to the \noperation of this facility.\n\n\n\n\n\nBibliography / References:\nTechnical Inc. prepared for NIOSH, HAZOP of  \"Anhydrous Ammonia Use in \nAgricultural\" 1991.\n\nClements Associates, Inc., Fairfax, VA;  \"Health Effects for Ammonia, prepared for The \nFertilizer Institute.\n\nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency  \"Chemical Emergency Preparedness and \nPrevention Advisory A?
