In 2008, Hercules Incorporated was purchased by Ashland Incorporated.  Hercules Incorporated continues to operate under the name of Hercules Incorporated as a wholly owned subsidiary of Ashland Incorporated.  \n\nHercules Incorporated purchased the Brunswick Plant in 1920 from the Yaryan Rosin Company.  The plant is situated on three hundred fifty (350) acres within the City of Brunswick.  With approximately three hundred (300) employees, the plant operates around the clock, seven days a week.\n\nThe Hercules-Brunswick Plant is nearly the only one of its kind in the world today that transforms abandoned pine stumps into industrial chemicals ultimately used in hundreds of consumer products, such as adhesives, sealant, chewing gum, toothpaste, citrus drinks, cleansers, and many other goods.\n\nIn making these products, the facility uses and stores (2) chemicals subject to the EPAA?s Risk Management Program Rule.  These chemicals are hydrogen and trimethylchlorosilane.  Carbon disulfide and hydrazine are also used at the site but are stored in quantities below the RMP threshold.  Hydrogen is used to hydrogenate (add hydrogen atoms to) the resins extracted from the pine stumps.  Trimethylchlorosilane is used as a processing aid in the production of polymeric terpene resins.\n\nHydrogen is stored in a bulk storage tank with a maximum capacity of 12,400 pounds.  This tank is owned and maintained by Air Products Corporation but is located on Hercules property.  \n\nTrimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) is handled in portable containers weighting 725 pounds.  While the number of TMCS containers onsite may vary at any one time, with the maximum number of containers exceeding the RMP threshold quantities, only one container is connected to the p"

All of us are responsible and accountable for adhering to the letter and spirit of this policy.  All of us must incorporate safety, health, and environmental considerations into our daily business activities.  It takes a total team effort to truly be a Responsible Care company.\n\nWorst-Case Scenarios:\n\nFollowing the process detailed in the EPAA?s Off-Site Consequence Guidance, the off-site impacts were determined for each regulated substance utilized at Hercules-Brunswick Plant.   The Hercules-Brunswick Plant has one toxic chemical, Trimethylchlorosilane, and one flammable chemical, hydrogen that are in considered covered processes under the RMP rule.  The facility examined worst-case and alternative case scenarios for both chemicals using the EPAA?s RMP*COMP program.  The chemical or substance that resulted in the most significant off-site impacts under the worst-case release scenario was Trimethylchlorosilane.  A hydrogen worst-case release scenario was also reported but its impacts were less than the toxic chemical. \n\nThe worst-case scenario for Trimethylchlorosilane is the instantaneous release of a 725-pound cylinder.  The impact of such a release using the EPA specified meteorological conditions would result in a vapor cloud that would reach off-site receptors.  No active or passive mitigation efforts were considered for the scenario.  \n\nAlternative Case Scenarios:\n\nThe alternate case scenario for Trimethylchlorosilane involves the release of half the contents of a cylinder (360 pounds).  More typical meteorological conditions for the Brunswick area were used such as those used by the alternative case guidance specified by EPA.  Such a release would result in minimal off-site impacts, just beyond the Hercules fence line.   \n\nThe alternate case scenario for Hydrogen would was a vapor cloud explosion that was rel"

Such a release would result in minimal off-site impacts, just beyond the Hercules fence line.   \n\nAccident Prevention Program:\n\nEach of the processes, which uses one or more of the regulated substances, is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and has a complete process safety management system in place.  This includes the use of process hazard analyses to identify and address potential hazards, management of change to control modifications, mechanical integrity procedures for minimizing mechanical failures, detailed operating procedures for process control, operator training for the personnel involved in the process and contractor safety assessments to closely monitor activities by non-Hercules personnel.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nIn the past five years, the Hercules-Brunswick Plant has not had any accidental releases of hydrogen or trimethylchlorosilane that have resulted in on-site injuries or any off-site impacts.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nThe Hercules-Brunswick Plant has an emergency response program in place to minimize on-site, as well as off-site, impacts from the release of any of the regulated substances or any chemical utilized in the plant processes.\n\nWhile significant efforts are practiced to prevent all releases, Hercules is cognizant of the fact that they can and do occur.  To prepare to respond to a release, the plant has a very detailed emergency response program in place.  The key elements of this emergency response program are:\n\n-Written emergency response plans that provide a written step by step procedure for responding to the various types of emergency situations that may arise (fire, spills, hurricanes, etc).\n\n-Emergency Response Contractors that provide twenty four hour, seven day a week response to spill or releases.
