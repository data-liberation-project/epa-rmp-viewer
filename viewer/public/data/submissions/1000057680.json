LS Power operates as an electric power generation facility.  To reduce the emissions NOX from the combustion turbines, LS Power uses a 29% aqueous ammonia solution as the reductant for the selective catalytic reduction (SCR)system.  The facility has a maximum storage capacity of 33,260 gallons within 2 identical, cross connected vessels. \n\nThe regulated substance at the University Park facility, covered by 40 CFR Part 68, is 29% aqueous ammonia. The facility utilizes aquaeous ammonia as integral part of its Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system, which consists of two storage vessels, piping and atomizing units at each ammoinia skid in order to maintain NOx emissions below CAAP Permit limits. The total system capacity of aqueous ammonia on-site is 73,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nAs a concerned member of the community, the company takes its role as a responsible corporate citizen very seriously. All LS Power facilities are operated to protect employees, contractors, and the public from injury and illness, and to minimize environmental impact. A company-wide safety and wellness program stresses safe conditions and safe practices. LS Power's policy is to inspect, maintain and operate equipment and facilities to prevent accidents, including release of hazardous materials; and to train employees in prevention, as well as to prepare them to respond rapidly and effectively should an accident occur.\n\n\n\nLSP University Park, LLC has developed and implemented Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures (SPCC) as part of an overall chemical management program. LS Power conducts regular safety meetings and provides a variety of environmental, health, and safety training to its employees.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe operation and maintenance perso"

As part of the program, trained personnel routinely inspect the aqueous ammonia system and conduct routine maintenance, as needed.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe LS Power University Park facility has not has an accident involving aqueous ammonia that caused death, associate injuries, and property or environmental damage within the last five years.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our aqueous ammonia system, the facility has a well-defined incident command system. The written Emergency Response program includes procedures to safely evacuate the facility, minimize and/or contain the release and notify the appropriate local fire department and LEPC officials. LS Power continues to train our employees on hazardous responses and awareness, and conduct mock drills routinely. Plant management has discussed the company's response program with our local LEPC and fire department representatives.\n\n\n\nProactive materials about disclosure information, how the company is prepared to deal with an incident, how the community should respond, and a process for announcing that an incident has occurred (to be used as needed) are being prepared. In addition, training and information materials for Perdue managers and employees, community officials, civil groups, media, environmental groups, emergency response personnel and the public in general will be available.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nAs part of LS Power's continual improvement philosophy, the University Park facility continues to identify and update system components and techniques to ensure safety and quality.\n\n\n\n"
