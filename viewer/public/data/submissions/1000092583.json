Our fire departments are fully trained to handle all emergencies pertaining to our anhydrous plant, including all necessary inhalation gear and safety suits. They understand all shut off systems and the dangers involved with this gas. All employees of New Century Ag. Noonan Ag station have been thoroughly trained in handling anhydrous ammonia in our bulk systems.  We are constantly checking valves, gauges, hoses, bearing, and pins to make sure they meet the highest in safety standards. We keep the area free of all flammable debris and make sure hoses are not in a position to be ran over or caught on vehicles passing through load out areas. All safety signs and water baths are in place, as well as safety goggles and gloves. Everything is readily available in case of an emergency. We are continually training our employees on all safety aspects. We have an independent consulting firm (NORTH DAKOTA GRAIN DEALERS SAFETY PROGRAM)  inspector (HAL GREIVES) that constantly monitor our plants to make sure we are in compliance with all OSHA  safety standards."
