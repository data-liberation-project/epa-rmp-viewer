California Health and Safety Code, Section 25531 through 25534\n\nThe purpose of this document is to:\n\n?    Increase the protection of public health, the environment, and facility employees by ensuring proper emergency response and mitigation procedures when handling regulated substances.\n\n?    Assist U.S. Growers and local government agencies in their communication and coordination efforts to improve facility safety while handling ammonia.\n\nThis document addresses U.S. Growers administrative and operational programs established to prevent regulated substance-related accidents and reduce potential risks.  The regulated substance of concern and focus of this document is ammonia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDOCUMENTATION\n\nThis Process Safety Management/Risk Management Program document consists of two volumes.  Volume I includes the management programs in place at the facility to ensure safe operations of the ammonia system and Volume II includes the technical studies performed prior "

This Plan is reviewed and updated at lease once per year.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and Cal ARP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe U.S. Growers facility is located at 3141 East 44th Street in Vernon, California.  Areas 1 and 2 utilize the same engine room. The maximum intended inventory of ammonia at the U.S. Growers facility is 18,000 pounds at the Areas 1, 2 & 3 plant.  These plants are connected, therefore the total inventory in this single process is 18000 pounds of ammonia.  The three areas are connected via a common liquid and suction header\nThe ammonia refrigeration process is a closed system that cycle the refrigerant, or ammonia, from liquid to gas and back again.  The processes, consisting of vessels, piping, valves, and process equipment, cycle ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for product and process equipment.\n\nChanges in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature; lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature.  Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat.  Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system to vaporize.  Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid.  Typical operating conditions range from approximately 7 inches Hg on the low pressure side of the system to 160 psig on the high side.  The ammonia equipment and its location is listed in Table 1.\n\nTABLE 1 Ammonia Refrigeration Equipment\n        Equipment            Location            State\n                    \n    Equipment                Location                State\n                                                             Area 1 E"

Scenario Description:  The liquid Recirculating Unit #1 is the largest vessel in the system (with the capacity of 4000 gallons of ammonia, equivalent to 22,000 pounds of ammonia) and is assumed to contain the total charge of the Areas 1 & 2 system (18,000 pounds of ammonia) for the worst case scenario.  The liquid recirculating unit is in the Engine Room, which is indoors and would enclose the release.  Thus, passive mitigation effects were taken into account for the worst case scenario.    The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used:  1.5 meters/second wind speed, and F stability.  The EPA?s RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants was used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint.\n\n?    Distance to Toxic Endpoint: 0.1 miles, based on the EPA?s RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants.\n"

The release rate of ammonia due to the pressure of the tank is 126 pounds per minute.  No passive mitigation effects wee taken into account, as this rupture could occur outside.  The meteorological conditions used were 3 meters per second wind speed, and D stability.  The EPA?s RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants was used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint.\n\n?    Distance to Toxic Endpoint: 0.1 miles, based on the EPA?s RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS.\n\nU.S. Growers has a Process Safety Management program in place to manage the handling of ammonia.  In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.\n\nThe U.S. Growers facility, including the ammonia system, was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety features include ammonia sensors in the machine room as well as sensors in selected cold storage areas.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine room and just outside of the machine room (condensers).\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility will operate in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines.  In particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, ?Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems.?\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nSince the initial PHA Study conducted on June 1, 1993, there have been no releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds.  In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe U.S. Growers has an emergency action plan in ef"
