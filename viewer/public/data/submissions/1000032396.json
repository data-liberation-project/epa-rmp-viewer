The facility accomplishes this by separating constituent gasses of the atmosphere, Nitrogen, Oxygen and Argon by process of distillation. The facility manufactures Hydrogen by process of catalytic reformation.\n\n\n\nDuring the process of manufacturing Hydrogen, Propane is combined with steam at high temperatures, which causes a reaction releasing Hydrogen. The Propane is chemically changed, not burned. \n\n\n\nThe stationary source located at 13140 TI Blvd, Dallas, TX, includes a 18,000 gallon (single wall, vertical) tank of flammable gas and additional flammable gases within the process.\n\n\n\nThe chemical specific accidental release and accident prevention steps are those to mitigate risk from flammable gases.\n\n\n\nThis facility complies with EPA?s accident prevention rule, the OSHA PSM standard, and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. The covered bulk tank was designed / installed and is maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law.\n\n\n\nAir Liquide's TI Boulevard location utilizes the following accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source:\n\na) Management of change to ensure the covered process is not altered without a safety review\n\nb) Gauges and internal piping to ensure the bulk tank contains a maximum of 85% capacity\n\nc) Overpressure relief valve on the top of the tank\n\nd) Backflow prevention on the fill line\n\ne) Fail-closed emergency shut-off valves (Valves are held open by propane backpressure delivered through a consumable tubing system. The tubing will burn in case of fire, isolating the tank.)\n\nf) Liquid"

In conclusion to our most recent Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), Air Liquide?s TI Boulevard location plans to:\n\n1. Add low pressure alarm to propane tank\n\n2. Investigate why HX105 will not collapse from vacuum with Hydrochem\n\n3. Add alarm to TI-231 to indicate propane flow is liquid\n\n4. Lock V425 open to ensure "
