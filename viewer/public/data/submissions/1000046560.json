This plan specifically identifies the risks and mitigation measures applied in a Chlorine Chemical Environment. This plan also includes but is not limited to a Chlorine Environment specific formal Operator Training Program, SOP's, Hazard Analysis/Risk Assessment Review, and Accident History Review.  We have had (1) accidental releases of chlorine in the past five years the largest was less than 2 lbs. There was no offsite impact. There were no injuries or offsite impacts. The Emergency Response Program is a written plan specifically for a chlorine environment which consists of but is not limited to SOP's for Responders, On-site Emergency Responder Training Program, Responder Specific duties, Responder equipment inventory, and Accident/Drill reporting Procedures. Citywide drills are conducted on an annual schedule. The Emergency Response Plan is distributed to Fire, Police, and Emergency MedicalPersonnel.  Process hazard analysis and risk assessment review is conducted by the Water Treatment Plant Superintendent, Asst. Water Treatment Plant Superintendent, Maintenance Personnel, and Operating Personnel as well as consulting engineer. The total process experience of these individuals exceeds 80 years. Operating procedures are written and tracked by the Water Treatment Plant Superintendent and Asst. Water Treatment Plant Superintendent. Training is formulated and tracked by the Water Treatment Plant Superintendent and Asst. Water Treatment Plant Superintendent. Training is accomplished in the classroom and on the job by the Operator Training Committee which consists of supervisory personnel and certified EHS operators. Understanding of the training is assured by written tests, oral tests, and demonstration. Training is tracked by a database and hardcopy records. The mechanical maintenance program is delegate"

      "SummaryText": "d to the Asst. Water Treatment Plant Superintendent. The program consists of equipment lists and specifications, equipment history, preventive maintenance procedures, and a demand work order system. The equipment history is analyzed periodically for equipment reliability. The Management of Change Program is assured by the Asst. Water Treatment Plant Superintendent. Compliance audits are conducted once per year by the program implementers. The incident investigation program follows City policy for fact determination, root cause system analysis, and recommendation implementation. System update schedules are monitored by the program implementers. Employee participation is incorporated in each element program description. The contractor procedure follows a City contractor policy. The program implemented by the contractor coordinator. Trenton Water works Filtration Plant treats raw water from the Delaware River. During the treatment process chlorine is used to disinfect the water. The liquid chlorine is evaporated into gas, and injected into the water. There is never more than 2000 lbs available to the system at any time. A Hazard Analysis and Risk Assesment Review conducted on 7/24/96 and revalidated on 7/01 and 7/06 and 6/11 demonstrated that with the actual release prevention mechanisms and mitigation measures incorporated at this facility, the worse case scenarios are implausible. Trenton Water wors plans no immediate safety improvements at this time because state of the art design, operation, and inherently safe technology are currently implemented."
