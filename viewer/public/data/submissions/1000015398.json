Today, these two areas are operated as a fully integrated petroleum refining complex capable of processing 350,000 barrels per day of crude oil into various petroleum products including: gasoline, home and industrial heating fuels, jet fuel, liquefied petroleum gases (LPG), residual fuel and a number of petrochemicals such as Benzene, Propylene, and Cumene.  \n\nThe types of processing units in operation at the refinery include: atmospheric and vacuum crude distillation, fluid catalytic cracking, catalytic reforming, distillate desulfurization, alkylation, sulfur recovery, petrochemical recovery, and gasoline treating and blending.  In support of these processes, the refinery also operates steam generation, water treating, wastewater treatment, tank car and truck loading facilities, and numerous intermediate and finished product storage tanks.  \n\nSunoco also owns and operates the 211-acre Schuylkill River Tank Farm (SRTF) located on the west bank of the Schuylkill River, opposite the refinery property.  The facility functions as a product storage and shipping area and contains no refining units.  On-site are numerous intermediate and finished product storage tanks, an API-type separator, gasoline blending facilities, and an LPG tank car and truck loading area.\n\nIn our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant off-site consequences in the event of a major accidental release:\n\nToxics\n\nCHEMICAL                  USE\nHydrogen Fluoride (HF)         Alkylation Unit Catalyst\nModified Hydrogen Fluoride (HF)     Alkylation Unit Catalyst\n\nFlammables\n\nCHEMICAL              USE\nPropane             Commercial Fuel\nButane             Gasoline Blending\nIsobutane             Gasoline Blending/Intermediate Feedstock\nFlammable Mixture         Petrochemical Feedstock\n(Contains:"

Our accidental release prevention programs and emergency planning and response programs help us effectively manage the hazards posed by these chemicals to our employees, the public, and the environment. \n\nB. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION MEASURES\n\nThe centerpiece of Sunoco's accidental release prevention program is Process Safety Management (PSM).  Sunoco has implemented a management system for PSM, which assigns responsibilities to specific individuals. The fourteen (14) elements of PSM, which are outlined below, constitute the framework by which process safety and accident prevention are managed in the refinery.  \n\nPSM Prevention Program Elements \n\n     1. Employee Participation\n\nEmployee participation is based on the principle that employee involvement in various areas of PSM is key to maintaining a Process Safety system that has an \"our\" attitude. Our employee participation plan helps ensure that all employees have appropriate involvement in developing and implementing PSM. Employees are involved in Health and Safety committee activities, safety meetings, Process Hazard Analysis studies, pre-startup safety reviews, incident investigations, and the development of operating and maintenance training and procedures.\n\n     2. Process Safety Information\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI) is compiled for each process covered by PSM and is made available to all personnel involved with or affected by that process via an internal computer-based Intranet.  PSI includes information pertaining to the hazards of the highly hazar"

This information is essential for supporting all of the other elements of our PSM program. \n\n     3. Process Hazard Analysis\n\nProcess Hazards Analyses (PHAs) are performed by experienced employee teams for each process covered by the PSM regulation. Our PHA teams are composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a trained PHA team leader. Studies are conducted according to an established schedule, and each study is updated/revalidated at least every five years (or more often if necessary because of process changes). These comprehensive studies systematically review each unit to identify and assess hazards in the design or operation of the units.  Additional controls are recommended for any unmitigated hazards that are identified. Results of the PHAs are documented in reports that are made available to personnel. The Sunoco PHA methodology has now incorporated the Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA) technique which provides a semi-quantitative tool to analyze risk.\n\n     4. Operating Procedures\n\nWritten operating procedures are developed and implemented for all refinery processes.  The procedures, written by experienced operating personnel and reviewed by a technical committee, describe the detailed steps to carry out the principal modes of operation and are designed and implemented for a safe, reliable and environmentally sound operation. Procedures are used to (1) train our personnel before they perform tasks in the field, (2) serve as reference guides for personnel performing tasks, (3) specify what to do if a process upset or operating emergency occurs and (4) provide reference guides in the startup and shutdown of equipment. \n\n     5. Training\n\nEmployees who are responsible for safe operation of the process units are provided with initial training and periodic refresher"

This training includes a general overview of the process, properties, safety and health hazards of chemicals in the process, as well as a detailed understanding of the process operating procedures and safe work practices. Training is conducted using a combination of classroom training, computer-based training, and on-the-job training. Written, verbal and hands-on testing is performed to validate that training requirements have been met.\n\n     6. Mechanical Integrity\n\nThe Mechanical Integrity of process equipment is maintained to ensure that the potential for spills and releases is minimized. Programs include an inspection and testing program, a preventive maintenance program, and a quality assurance program.  Procedures describe the methods used to perform inspections, tests, and preventive maintenance tasks of existing process equipment, to verify the proper fabrication and installation of new process equipment, and to properly document all activities. The procedures follow generally accepted engineering practices that employ both industry and company standards. Personnel performing MI activities are trained on the procedures and in the hazards of the process to ensure that job tasks are performed safely. \n\n     7. Management of Change\n\nPermanent or temporary changes can inadvertently introduce new hazards or compromise safeguards built into the original design of a process. A written Management of Change procedure has been established and implemented to manage changes to process chemicals, technology, and equipment.  The procedure provides guidance, designates responsibilities and establishes steps to implement changes in the refinery. This program helps ensure that inadvertent or unintended changes are prevented, that any safety and health impacts are addressed, that affected procedures are updated, and that employees are informed of and trained in the approved changes.

Results of the Management of Change process are documented and maintained in the software program, and made available to all personnel.         \n\n     8. Pre-startup Safety Review\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews are performed by experienced teams as a final check to ensure the safety of new or modified process facilities before they are placed in service. The review ensures that the following requirements are confirmed prior to start-up: construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications; safety, maintenance, operating, and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate; PHAs have been performed on new processes and all recommendations have been resolved; PSI documentation has been properly updated and made available to personnel; MOC requirements have been satisfied for modified processes; and training has been completed (and documented) for affected employees.\n\n      9. Compliance Audits\n\nThe Process Safety Lead is responsible to ensure that the procedures and practices developed under the PSM system are being followed. A formal evaluation and certification of the PSM system is conducted at least every three years by a corporate audit team. The compliance audit team seeks to confirm that PSM and RMP practices are consistent with written programs, that the programs adequately address all requirements of the PSM/RMP regulations, and that management systems are in place to ensure continued compliance. Refinery management promptly reviews the audit findings, determines an appropriate response for each finding, assigns responsibility for implementation of a corrective action, and tracks all findings until they are resolved.\n\n     10. Incident Investigation\n\nAn experienced team promptly investigates incidents (within 48 hours) that result in, or could reasonably have caused, a catastrophic release, fire or injury.

The investigation team then recommends and implements additional controls in order to mitigate hazards associated with the incident.  Incident causes are tracked, trended and published by the Process Safety and Safety Departments.  The published reports are shared with employees and relevant findings are communicated throughout the Sunoco organization.\n\n     11. Hot Work Permit\n\nHot work permits are issued for any work that could create a source of ignition on or near a PSM-covered process unit. The hot work permit program ensures that OSHA's fire prevention and protection precautions, specified in 29 CFR 1910.252(a), are in place before hot work (work involving electric or gas welding, cutting, brazing, or similar flame or spark-producing operation) begins on or near a process. The permit describes work being performed, authorized dates and all fire prevention and protection requirements.       \n\n     12. Contractors\n\nContractors are employed to supplement the refinery's work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. A contractor screening procedure is used to help ensure that contractors are hired who accomplish the desired job tasks without compromising the safety and health of employees, the public, or the environment.  Safety regulations are sent with all bid packages, and an evaluation of the contractor safety record and training program is used in selecting a contracting company.  The safety regulations require contractors to train their employees in the safe work practices and safety rules of the refinery. The program also includes a refinery overview video that is shown to all contractor employees to familiarize them with the type of operations and associated hazards in the areas in which they will be working.\n\n     13.

The Emergency Response Plan is an integrated set of actions that start at the incident source, and initiates actions throughout the facility as appropriate.  Additional details about our Emergency Response Program are presented later in this summary.\n\n     14. Trade Secrets\n\nOSHA PSM requires the refinery to make available all information necessary to those persons responsible for compiling the process safety information, those assisting in the development of the process hazards analysis, those responsible for developing operating procedures and those involved in incident investigations, emergency planning and response, and compliance audits, without regard to possible trade secret status of such information. Our facility openly provides this necessary information to all responsible persons to comply with these requirements.\n\nThese fourteen (14) individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standards required by these management systems.  In addition to the above prevention program elements, we also have specific prevention measures that are employed as part of our operating procedures and engineering and administrative controls to help contain/control a release, quickly detect a release, and reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  These are briefly summarized as follows: \n\nGeneral Risk Reduction and Safety Measures\n    \n* Engineering and construction in accordance with recognized industry and company standards \n* Equipment properly designed with protection from overpressure (pressure safety relief valves, flare stacks, etc.)\n* Updated technical drawings, Piping & Instrument Diagrams and Process Flow Diagrams\n* Operating systems monitored and controlled 24 hrs a day by trained Operators\n* Computerized monitoring and control of process operation\n* Redundant control systems with battery back-ups\n* Automatic and manu"

FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Sunoco Philadelphia Refinery keeps records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility. During the past five years, we have had two accidents resulting from the chemical release of materials covered under EPA's RMP rule. These accidents are deemed RMP-reportable because the releases resulted in onsite personnel injuries that required medical treatment, resulted in significant property damage onsite or resulted in property damage offsite.  No offsite injuries occurred due to these incidents. For each of these incidents, we have conducted a formal incident investigation to identify and correct the root causes of the events and to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. The following is a brief summary of these incidents and the investigation results.\n\nOn March 20, 2007, a propylene release occurred during loading operations.   The vapor release occurred for approximately 3 seconds when the hose disconnected from the truck during loading operations.  Conduit and supports adjacent to the loading rack were damaged, apparently by significant force as the hose swung away from the truck. Although no ignition occurred during this event, a third party contract truck driver was treated at the hospital for 1st degree cold burns. The immediate root cau"

Action items following the investigation included tailgating of operators and truck drivers, a revision to truck loading procedures to eliminate use of hammers as a tool for connecting hose couplings, and to increase the frequency of hose testing. \n\nOn February 3, 2009, an explosive flash fire event occurred at 431 unit during maintenance activities. The DIB tower was shutdown and was de-inventoried prior to maintenance work being performed. Maintenance began filling the exchanger with water to begin the pressure test to identify the leaking tube(s). During the filling process, the mechanics in the area of the de-isobutanizer reboiler heard a roar that became progressively louder coming from the immediate area and some saw vapors coming from beneath the reboiler. It was decided collectively at that time by the crew to vacate the area. The valve was being isolated when the vapors found an ignition source, combusted violently and generated a concussion wave and fire. Two Sunoco, Inc. employees were injured at the time of the event. After conclusion of the investigation it was determined the immediate root cause was failure to comply with procedure. Action plans included communication refinery wide of proper procedure practice and a development of what if drills at the affected operating units. \n\nOn March 17, 2011, At the HF 433 Unit, an operator was hooking up a nitrogen hose to a pipeline bleeder to purge HF acid from the feed line to the Rerun Tower Acid Vaporizer during a unit shutdown procedure. When the temporary hose was energized, it disconnected and the operator was sprayed with material containing residual HF acid. The operator secured the bleeder valve, reconnected the hose to the piping, re-energized the hose and alerted his fellow operators.

When an emergency communication is received at the Communications Center (staffed 24/7), the dispatcher has the ability to activate alarms that signal refinery personnel to take action.  An alarm received by fire pull box is a general area alarm.  First responders will normally utilize their radio to communicate the details of the emergency once they arrive on the scene.  The level of response to the emergency is then adjusted to reflect the complexity of the incident.  The dispatcher at the Communication Center has the ability to pick up a direct dial telephone to the City of Philadelphia Fire Department to request assistance or brief them on the status of an emergency. The Fire Department and the Police Department are provided with the most factual information available.  They will utilize that information to assist them in making decisions regarding the evacuation or shelter-in-place of communities in the affected area.  In addition, the refinery has a system of ten (10) sirens located throughout the neighborhoods nearest to the facility to alert residents in the event of a catastrophic release of an extremely hazardous substance.  The system is computer controlled and self-supervising and is test sounded on the first Saturday of each month.\n\nA vitally important part of the plant emergency organization is the Emergency Response Team (ERT).  The ERT is made up of full-time emergency response employees, as well as employee volunteers from various refinery departments.  The ERT provides the personnel resources for a rapid and effective emergency response.  While most refinery employees receive an \"incipient responder\" level of emergency response training, ERT members train and drill on a monthly basis.  Training and drill sessions include instruction and hands-on practice in the use of fire extinguishers, advanced i"

This equipment includes portable fire extinguishers, breathing apparatus, encapsulated chemical protective suits, rescue and medical equipment, spill response boats and fire fighting apparatus capable of delivering high volumes of water and fire fighting foam.  An inspection, testing and maintenance program is in place for emergency response equipment.  Examples of equipment and systems included in the program are as follows:\n\n* Fire extinguishers - Inspected monthly and receive annual maintenance per the international fire code,\n* Class A chemical suits - Inspected before and after each use, pressure tested annually,\n* Fire hoses - Inspected and pressure tested each year per the fire code,\n* Stationary fire water pumps - Inspected weekly and performance tested each year per the fire code,\n* Fire apparatus - Inspected weekly and performance tested each year,\n* Water spray systems - Inspected and flow tested annually per the fire code.\n\nInspection reports for emergency response equipment are filed with the City of Philadelphia.\n\nWhile we rely on the ERT to respond to both minor and significant events in the refinery, we also maintain a close relationship with the City of Philadelphia and neighboring municipal Fire Departments.  Tours and drills with members of these emergency response organizations are held routinely.  These tours and drills enable the public emergency responders to become familiar with the hazards, equipment, resources and personnel in the refinery.\n\nE. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nWe continually strive to make the Sunoco Philadelphia Refinery the safest and most reliable workplace possible for our employees, our neighbors and our community.

For example, we revalidate the Process Hazard Analyses for approximately six (6) process units each year.  These analyses generate additional prevention and mitigation recommendations that result in on-going modifications to the facility.  In addition to the Process Hazard Analyses recommendations, the following improvements are being planned to help us prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\n\n* Safety Integrity Level (SIL) studies to ensure compliance with ISA S84.01\n* Upgrades to emergency response apparatus and other fire protection systems\n* Improvements to the facility Evacuation Procedures\n* Improvements to instrumentation and computer systems\n* Structural steel fireproofing upgrades\n\nThe ultimate goal of the Sunoco Philadelphia Refinery is to demonstrate continuous improvement in our health, environmental and safety performance.  In addition, we work cooperatively with the local community to address any concerns.
