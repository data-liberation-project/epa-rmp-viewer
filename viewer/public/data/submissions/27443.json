THROUGHOUT WILBUR-ELLIS A COMPREHENSIVE SAFETY PROGRAM IS IN EFFECT WHICH INCLUDES TRAINING, INSPECTIONS, SAFETY MEETINGS AND MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTABILITY.  THIS FACILITY PROVIDES END-USE AGRICULTURAL CHEMICALS IN SEALED CONTAINERS TO DEALERS AND DISTRIBUTORS FOR RESALE, AND DIRECTLY TO GROWERS FOR FINAL USE.  THIS FACILITY ALSO PROVIDES BULK FERTILIZERS.  GIVEN THE FACT THAT THIS FACILITY DOES NOT PROCESS ACUTELY HAZARDOUS MATERIALS, THE ALTERNATE CASE INCIDENT IS EITHER A FIRE OR A 1-GALLON SPILL OF EACH OF THE LIQUID ACUTELY HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS STORED.  THE DRY CHEMICALS WERE NOT MODELED BECAUSE THE VAPORT PRESSURE IS NEGLIGIBLE AND IT IS ASSUMED THE SPILLS TAKE PLACE IN THE WAREHOUSE WITHOUT APPRECIABLE DUST DISPERSION.  THE WORST CASE SCENARIO INVOLVES THE INSTANTANEOUS LOSS OF LARGEST CONTAINER HANDLED.  THE OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE WILL INVOLVE THE IMMEDIATE ARE AROUND THE PLANT.  THIS WAS DETERMINED USING THE ALOHA MODEL.  THIS FACILITY IS COVERED BY OSHA REGULATIONS AND IS VISITED ANNUALLY BY VARIOUS OTHER AGENCIES.  THERE HAVEN?T BEEN ANY ACCIDENTS OR INCIDENTS IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS INVOLVING ACUTELY HAZARDOUS MATERIALS.  OCCASIONALLY JOINT EXCERCISES WITH LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT ARE HELD ONSITE.  THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN IS REVIEWED AND TRAINED ANNUALLY.  WILBUR-ELLIS SAFETY TRAINING IS AN ONGOING PROCESS EACH YEAR AND EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS PLANS ARE SHARED WITH LOCAL AND COUNTY AGENCIES."
