EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe Marathon Ashland Petroleum's Illinois Refining Division (hereafter referred to as \"IRD\") is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for IRD workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, IRD has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One part of these systems is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at IRD and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) rule 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at IRD.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan executive summary requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at IRD.\n\n\n1.1  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIRD is committed to the safety of its workers and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. IRD implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. In the event of a significant accidental release, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain such releases.  IRD evaluates each situation, evacuates workers as necessary and responds based on our capabilities and training.  If necessary, outside emergency responders, including the local fire department would be contacted to assist in controlling and containing the release and to prevent and/or reduce the consequences of the release.  IRD, the local emergency planning committee (LEPC), and the fire department have also established a system to use for warning the community if an accident occurs that could threate"

However, the specific responsibilities for certain aspects of that program have been delegated by the Division Manager to other personnel who report either directly, or through other management personnel, to the Division Manager.  Those relationships are depicted on the division organization chart maintained by the Division Manager's staff.  Specific responsibility for the implementation of the division process safety management (PSM) and accident prevention program has been delegated to the Division PSM Coordinator, who is responsible for the RMP hazard assessment and risk management plan.  The division emergency response program, including compliance with the RMP aspects of that effort, is the responsibility of the Division Safety Supervisor.  In keeping with our policy that safe operation is part of everyone's job, many other division personnel are also involved in RMP activities on an ongoing basis.\n\n\n1.2  IRD Regulated Substances\n\nIRD is a full range refinery and petroleum products facility located in Robinson Illinois.  We use crude petroleum as our feed material and make a variety of petroleum-based products, including gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, heating oil, petroleum coke, and liquefied petroleum gases such as propane and butane.  Many of these products are flammable substances that EPA has specifically listed in the RMP rule and are present in our process units above the EPA threshold quantity of 10,000 lb.  In total, we have 15 processes that are covered by the RMP rule because of their flammable process materials.  These processes are listed in the RMP data included with this summary (Section 1.17 of the RMP Data Elements).\n\n\t\tIn addition to coverage because of flammable materials, IRD also handles one toxic substance regulated by the RMP rule.

This unit is covered because it contains more than the EPA RMP threshold quantity of hydrofluoric acid.\n\n\n1.3  Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nIRD performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance that could affect the public or the environment. The offsite consequence analysis consists of evaluating both worst-case scenarios and alternative release scenarios. IRD does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur. An alternative release scenario represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility like IRD. Alternative release scenarios can be used to help the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) improve the community emergency response plan. We have submitted release scenario analyses to EPA and have shared that information with the LEPC and other organizations involved in emergency response activities. It is also available to local residents and businesses. The paragraphs below briefly describe some of the scenarios we analyzed and are the scenarios for which we have included detailed information in our risk management plan.  Please recognize that none of these events have occurred at our facility. Also, for some of these events, we have emergency mitigation systems that should help reduce the consequences of the events if they occurred. In all cases, if such events occurred, we would activate our emergency response plan to respond to the event, notify local authorities, and take appropriate actions to protect both our employees and people in the community.\n\n\n\t\tWorst-case Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case scenario associated with toxic substances in RMP-covered processes at the refinery is a failure of the hydrofluoric (HF) acid storage tank in our HF Alkylation Unit. If such a failure released the maximum inventory of the tank (410,000 pounds), the HF acid would vaporize, resulting in a"

As specified by EPA, this analysis assumes that all of the HF acid is released to the air and no credit is taken for operation of our HF acid vapor mitigation system (i.e., a water spray system to reduce the amount of vapor that leaves the unit if released).\n\nThe worst-case scenario associated with a release of flammable substances in RMP-covered processes at the refinery is a vapor cloud explosion, involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank containing a mixture of butane, isobutane, and isopentane. The analysis assumes that the maximum possible inventory of 4,200,000 pounds is released, completely vaporizes, and ignites, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. Because there are some public receptor locations just outside the refinery property, this event could affect members of the public at those closest locations.\n\n\t\tThere are no Program 1 processes at the refinery; therefore, no additional worst-case analyses are reported in this risk management plan.  Also, we did not identify any worst-case scenarios that would affect public receptors other than the receptors affected by the scenarios reported above.\n\n\t\tAlternative Release Scenarios\n\nWe analyzed numerous release scenarios for toxic materials. The single toxic release scenario we are reporting as part of the risk management plan involves a release of HF acid from a hose failure during tank truck unloading. This would result in a release of 4,617 pounds of HF acid in the time required to isolate the truck and the acid storage tank, thereby stopping the release. The analysis indicated that the resulting HF vapor cloud could result in toxic exposures to people outside the refinery boundary.\n\nThe alternative release scenario in our risk management plan for flammable substances at the refinery is a vapor cloud explosion from a failure of a transfer hose during propane truck loading.

If you are interested in this information, please contact the IRD Environmental & Safety Manager at (618) 544-2121.\n\n\n1.4  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the IRD.  Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) standard,  and because the OSHA PSM requirements are very similar to the EPA RMP requirements for refineries, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements.  The PSM program at this facility has been extended by  IRD, where necessary, to satisfy EPA's Program Level 3 accident prevention program requirements.\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nIRD encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of  process hazard analysis (PHA), incident investigation, and compliance audit teams. Employees have access to all information created as part of the IRD accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at IRD and addresses each accident pr"

These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety. The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nIRD keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within IRD are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, IRD has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in a Critical Process Variables Document.  IRD ensures that the process is maintained within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). \n\nIRD also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment,"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage those hazards.\n\nIRD primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques available.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\nThe PHA team recommendations are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of safety improvements in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  They ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved safety improvements being implemented in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, IRD periodically updates and revalidates the PHA results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be"

The results and recommendations from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the recommendations is documented and retained.\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nIRD maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  Procedures are maintained current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made to the process.  In addition, IRD operating procedures provide guidance on how to respond to events that result in exceeding safe operating limits for specific process or equipment parameters.  The written operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, IRD has implemented a company training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in IRD operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.

All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nIRD uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, IRD has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform IRD personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work, and (5) work permit process (i.e. hot work, confined space, etc.).  In addition, IRD evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  IRD personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews\n\nIRD conducts a pre-startup safety review for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the review is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.

The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.
