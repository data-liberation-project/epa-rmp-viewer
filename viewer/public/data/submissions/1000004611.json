Facility Information\nOur plant consists of one Amhydrous Ammonia storage tank.  Our maximum inventory report is on file in the compliance manual and has been shared with the local emergency responders to use for training and pre planning.\n\n3. Worst case scenario and alternate releaswe scenario\nThe worst case and the alternate release scenarios have been evalusted and shared\nwith our local first responders as part of and on-going training program. More\nimportantly our employees have been trained in their respective emergency actions,\nincluding the emergency meeting place and each of their individual responsibilities\nregarding an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n4.Accidental Release Program\nThe facility strives for compliance with the provisions of the US Occupational Safety and Health\nAdministration, 29 CFR19140.11, Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia. This facility\nis also in compliance with the provisions of the Kansas Fertilizer Law.

We require that each employee\nthat loads ammonia be trained every three years at a state sponsered training school.\nAnd yearly trained in operating and safety proceedures. And a given ammonia plant.\nAll employees are trained to inspect the ammonia plant before filling procedures and before use do a visual inspection of all hoses and valves to make sure there has not been a failure of equipment since the last time it was used. Employees are reminded to follow start up procedures before filling and during fill"
