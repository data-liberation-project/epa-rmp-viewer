If an accidental\nrelease should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and or\nother authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people\nand the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\nOur plant consists of one Amhydrous Ammonia storage tank.  Our maximum inventory report is on file in the compliance manual and has been shared with the local emergency responders to use for training and pre planning.\n\n3. Worst case scenario and alternate releaswe scenario\nThe worst case and the alternate release scenarios have been evalusted and shared\nwith our local first responders as part of and on-going training program. More\nimportantly our employees have been trained in their respective emergency actions,\nincluding the emergency meeting place and each of their individual responsibilities\nregarding an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n4.Accidental Release Program\nThe facility strives for compliance with the provisions of the US Occupational Safety and Health\nAdministration, 29 CFR19140.11, Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia. This facility\nis also in compliance with the provisions of the Kansas Fertilizer Law. The OHSA Standard\nis refenenced in the RMP registration form in section 8.3(b)\nThere are many hazards associated with anhydrous ammonia. We require that each employee\nthat loads ammonia be trained every three years at a state sponsered training school.\nAnd yearly trained in operating and safety proceedures. And a given ammonia plant.\nAll employees are trained to inspect the ammonia plant before filling procedures and before use do a visual inspection of all hoses and valves to make sure there has not been a failure of equipment since the last time it was used. Employees are reminded to follow start up procedures before filling and during fill"

Five year accident history\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that\nhave caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility, not to our knowledge has there been any accidental releases resulting in off site deaths, injuries,evacuations, property damage or envirnomental damage.\n\n6. Emergency action plan\nA. A written action plan, in acccordance with OSHA standard 29 cfr 1910-38\n\nB. Provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community\nright to know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA)\n\nC. If a large release of anhydrous ammonia takes place at the facility, the required\nresponse action is to evacuate the area of the spill and call 911 and all applicable\nemergency response numbers.\n1. Wiithin 15 minutes of determing the amount of the release would be over 100 pounds\nthe emergency coordinator will notify: The National Response Center (800-424-8802)\n\n2. Within 24 hours of determining the amount of release would effect the envirnoment\nthe emergency coordinator will notify: Kansas Bureau of Environmental Remediation\n(785-296-1679) or after normal hours (785-296-0614) and the Kansas Department of\nof Emergency Management (785-296-3176) and in all cases the Kansas Department\nof Agriculture (785-296-3301).\n\n3.
