The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.)To save lives.\n2.)To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.)To protect the environment.\n4.)To minimize property damage.\n\nTri-County Pool Service, Inc. maintains an emergency plan which provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, chlorine health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nStartup of the chlorine system occurred in 1960.  The process is located at 5012A Salida Blvd., Salida, California 95368.  The chlorine system for Tri-County Pool Service, Inc. consists of chlorine one-ton containers which are the storage vessels.  Chlorine gas is drawn from the ton container to 20 pound cylinders.  Below provides a list of the chlorine equipment.\n\nChlorine Tanks (one ton containers)\n(2 - Operational and Maximum Amount)\n\nFilling Manifold\n\nScrubber Sytem\n\nThe maximum quantity of chlorine that can be stored on site for the Tri-County Pool Service, Inc. is 4,000 pounds.\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\nWorst Case Release Result Summary\nScenario Description: Release of the maximum quantity of chlorine that can be stored in a vessel - 2,000 pounds in 10 minutes.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used: 1.5 meters/second wind speed, and F stability. The reference table from the EPA's RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants was used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint of"

No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release.\n\nAlternative Release Result Summary\nScenario Description: A release of chlorine gas from 5/16 inch diameter leak.  The release rate of chlorine due to the pressure of the tank is 72 pounds per minute.  The meteorological conditions used were 3 meters per second wind speed, and D stability.  The reference table from the EPA's RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants was used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint of 3 ppm.  This release reaches offsite and may affect public receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nTri-County Pool Service, Inc. has a Process Safety Management program in place to manage the handling of chlorine.  In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices outlined by the Chlorine Institute.  In addition to the Management Programs, there is a scrubber system that is used in conjunction while transferring chlorine.  A manual alarm is located near the chlorine fill station which can be activated to warn employees in the case of a chlorine release.  The area is secured with crash posts and the ton containers are secured to stands in case of an earthquake.\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no releases of chlorine at the Tri-County Pool Service, Inc. within the last five years (June 1994 through June 1999).\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nIf a release of chlorine were to occur, Tri-County Pool Service, Inc.'s response plan is to call 911 in order to reach the Fire Department's HAZMAT team.  Tri-County Pool Service, Inc. has a B-kit available at the facility for the HAZMAT team's use in order to mitigate a chlorine release.  Employees will evacuate the facility to a point"

This plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provided the mitigation measures outlined below to improve safety at Tri-County Pool Service, Inc.  The PHA was comprised of one session that included a \"What-if\" analysis, and a series of checklists.  The following recommendations were made during this study and will be completed by June 2000:\n\nR01) Verify that procedures in place state that only the president and the manager perform chlorine deliveries with the vendor.\n\nR02)  Consider installing a chlorine detector near the chlorine fill station which is tied to an outside alarm company who will notify the proper personnel/authorities of an alarm.\n\nR03)  Coordinate with the Fire Department (HAZMAT team) that a B-kit and SCBAs are available in case of a chlorine release, and the necessary contact phone numbers in order to reach a responsible person at the facility.\n\nR04) Post a chlorine health diamond on the building or gate.\n\nR05)  Verify that the operating procedures in the Process Safety Management program are a correct representation of those used at Tri-County Pool Service, Inc.\n\nR06)  Verify that the Mechanical Integrity section in the Process Safety Management program is a correct representation of Tri-County Pool Service, Inc.'s maintenance program.\n\nR07)  Install a wind sock so that is visible from all locations of the building.\n\nR08) Post emergency phone numbers (business phone number, chlorine vendor's phone number) on the front gate so that emergency responders (HazMat team) can contact a responsible party."
