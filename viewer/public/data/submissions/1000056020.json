Due to drastically smaller usage than in the pre-2006 era, Pentane is received at the facility in tanker trucks, instead of the former railcars.  These tanker trucks are unloaded while parked in a dedicated, secondary containment concrete pad that could contain the entire contents of the tanker truck.  The Pentane storage tank is a 30,000 gallon commercial, horizontal tank.  This tank sits in a concrete secondary containment structure that could hold the entire contents of the tank.  While the Pentane tank can hold 30,000 gallons (157,800 pounds), Carpenter-Conover's average inventory is 32,812 pounds (approximately 6,238 gallons.)

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary---Risk Management Plan for Carpenter Company, Conover, NC---40 CFR 68.155\r\n\r\nIn 1948, E. Rhodes Carpenter began distributing cushioning materials to the furniture industry.  By 1956, Carpenter's company began manufacturing the flexible foam that it marketed to the furniture and home furnishings industries.  In 1962, Carpenter built the first continuous foam pouring line in Richmond, VA.  Due to Carpenter's hard work, honesty, and integrity his company grew rapidly.  In 1972, Carpenter opened his fourth polyurethane foam manufacturing facility in Conover, North Carolina.  Carpenter Company, Conover, NC has been a major supplier to the furniture, bedding, and home furnishings industries for over 44 years.  In addition to polyurethane foam, the Conover Plant produces polyester fiber products for similar cushioning properties as found in the polyurethane foam.  The polyurethane foam manufacturing process has seen numerous changes over the years in respect to chemistry, chemicals, government regulations, and the ever changing needs of our customers.  It is this polyurethane foam pouring process that is subject to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Plan Rule.\r\n\r\nThe original Risk Management Plan (RMP) for Carpenter Company-Conover Plant was submitted in 1999, the year that the Clean Air Act mandated the EPA to publish regulations and guidance on chemical accident prevention at facilities that use certain hazardous substances.  These regulations and guidance are contained in their Risk Management Plan (RMP) rule.\r\n\r\nThe information required from facilities under the RMP rule helps local fire, police, and emergency response personnel prepare for and respond to chemical emergencies.  Making RMPs available to the public also fosters communication and awareness to improve accident prevention and emergency response practices at the local level.  The RMP rule requires companies that use certain toxic and flammable chemicals to develop a"

Other hourly employees, located throughout the plant, as well as some members of management, have also been trained at the Technician Level.  \r\n\r\nIn the event of a fire, Carpenter-Conover's maintenance personnel make up a Fire Brigade, whose sole purpose is to assist the Conover Fire Department.  This fire brigade operates the facility's fire suppression, alarm, and security systems.  These fire brigade members have been trained at the First Responder Operations Level of the HAZWOPER standard.\r\n\r\nF)\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety \r\n\r\nThe Reinhart Technical Center (RTC), in Richmond, VA, is Carpenter Company's state-of-the-art Research and Development Center.  At RTC, chemists, chemical engineers, and other highly skilled personnel are constantly reviewing and re-inventing the foam pouring process.  RTC personnel has developed and refined the many recipes that Carpenter's pouring plants produce every day.  Foremost at RTC is the safety of Carpenter's employees, our plant's neighbors, and the environment that we live in.  Most of our safety procedures have been developed by RTC experts.  RTC strives daily to make the polyurethane foam pouring process more safe.  \r\n\r\nAt Carpenter-Conover, we recognize that the post-9/11 world that we live in calls for prudent measures in regards to plant security.  To ensure and maintain a secure facility, Carpenter-Conover has implemented the following:\r\n\u00bf\tThe entire manufacturing facility is fenced.\r\n\u00bf\tThere is a security guard at the entran"

      "SummaryText": "Risk Management Plan.   \r\n\r\nRegulations in 40 CFR Part 68 requires an RMP resubmittal, if significant changes within the process occurs.  Also, a mandatory resubmittal is required every five years.  Since 1999, Carpenter Company-Conover Plant has had several process changes that resulted in a resubmittal of the RMP.  The first RMP resubmittal was in 2004, the five year anniversary of the original 1999 submittal.  In 2006, a new foam pouring line, (Hennecke line) was constructed and began producing foam on July 12, 2006.  Due to some lacking process knowledge, at that time, the old pouring line was kept in operation to produce several specialty foams that could not be poured on the new pouring line.  This new Hennecke line, which incorporated carbon dioxide as the primary blowing agent, stemmed an RMP resubmittal.  This RMP change was resubmitted in March, 2007.\r\n\r\nAs a result of new chemistry and technology breakthroughs, the Hennecke line was updated to pour all of the foam recipes.  The old pour line was scrapped after its last pour on April 3, 2009.  The old line used Pentane as its primary blowing agent, while the Hennecke line uses mostly carbon dioxide. On July 9, 2009, the remaining Pentane was removed from the storage tank.  Under RMP rule, the removal of Pentane initiated a significant change, therefore, a resubmittal of RMP occurred on September 4, 2009.  Pentane was not used for the next year. \r\n\r\nDue to technological advances, Carpenter-Conover began experimenting with Pentane on the Hennecke line to produce new foam recipes.  These new foams were very successful.  Their success led to the need to inventory Pentane again in quantities above the 10,000 pound threshold.  To take advantage of more attractive prices, Carpenter-Conover began exploring the possibility of bringing in full railcars of Pentane once again.  Before these larger purchases could occur, the RMP had to be updated, for this, another significant process change.  On March 24, 2011, Carpe"

It is the polyurethane foam pouring process that incorporates the two RMP regulated substances.  These two substances, toluene diisocyanate (TDI) and Pentane are inventoried above their 10,000 pound threshold, thus requiring RMP inclusion.\r\n\r\nToluene diisocyanate (TDI), an 80/20% mix of the 2, 4 and 2, 6 isomers, is used as a reactant in the foam pouring process.  TDI is received primarily via railcars that contain approximately 190,000 pounds of product.  These railcars are queued on the track at the outdoor holding area until needed.  When required, the railcar is moved indoors to the railcar unloading area.  Transfer hoses and related equipment are connected and the unloading process begins.  TDI is transferred from the railcar to three 12,000 gallon storage tanks located in the interior tank farm.  From these three tanks, the TDI is transferred to a 32,875 gallon tank which feeds the pouring line.  These four TDI tanks are seated in concrete secondary containment structures that can completely capture the tank's content in the event of a total tank failure.  TDI is pumped from the 32,875 gallon storage tank through a strainer, filter, and heat exchanger before arriving into the mixing head.  In the mixing head, TDI is blended with polyol, water, carbon dioxide (CO2), pentane (used in specialty foams), pigments, fillers, and other minor components.  The resulting chemical reaction produces polyurethane foam.\r\n\r\nPentane, used in relatively small quantities, supplements the carbon dioxide (primary"
