We realize that our workforce is our most important asset and that the environment around us is what provides much of the quality to our lives.  In maintaining both of these assets we will thrive both in our industry and in our community\n\nTwin Rivers is a manufacturer of vegetable oils and tallow fatty acids.  These products meet kosher, food-grade and non-food grade standards for secondary manufacturing users such as detergent, soap and lubrication companies.  Three processes shape the Twin Rivers manufacturing organization, hydrolyzation, distillation and hydrogenation for the manufacture of whole cut and blended products and fractionation for well-defined fractionated fatty acids. Twin Rivers receives raw materials via semi-tanker, railcar and ocean tankers at its on-site rail, truck and deep-water terminals.  Finished products are primarily shipped to customers over Twin Rivers rail loading and delivery system, although semi-truck tankers make some deliveries.  To support these operations, Twin Rivers has a workforce of highly trained technicians and managers that conduct manufacturing operations as well as support groups of environmental, laboratory, utilities and logistics technicians continuously on duty.  The Twin Rivers workforce conducts operations at the facility twenty-four hour, seven-day, year round (with the exception of maintenance shutdowns).  Additional support comes from Twin Rivers security services that control site access and monitor the facility on a continuous basis.\n\nAs natural oil refinery environmental and safety risks are managed in three ways.  First, the manufacturing systems are designed to operate in a manner that minimizes hazardou"

A system of berms, relief valves, rupture disks, interlocks, manual and automatic shutoffs, alarms, isolation walls, deluge systems as well as other safety apparatus are all used to keep any situation from becoming critical and keep technicians aware of the condition of manufacturing systems at all times.\n\nSecond, Twin Rivers provides complete and appropriate training and education to its workforce to minimize human failure.  This includes an (approximately) three-month apprenticeship and internal process qualification for all perspective employees prior to being released to conduct manufacturing operations.  Third, Twin Rivers has a staff of environmental health and safety professionals that train, inspect and correct any conditions that could become hazardous to the workforce or the surrounding environment.  This group includes the Director of Environmental Safety Systems; the Health and Safety Manager, Process Safety Inspectors and a staff of licensed and certified environmental technicians.  The Director of ESS is responsible for regulatory compliance and reporting, administrative management of the environmental technicians (qualifications, licensing etc.), safety training, and implementing new programs to mitigate unsafe conditions or actions.  The Health and Safety Manager is responsible for conducting job safety analysis, on-site inspections, hazard mitigation, safety training and safety procedure development.  The Process Safety Inspectors manage the PSM program that includes pressure vessel inspections, process change and material change review.  The environmental technicians are responsible for the operations of the wastewater treatment and air scrubbing systems as well as hazardous materials handling, hazardous waste handling and spill response.  These technicians are also trained as emergency responders for confined space entry work and have received both first aid and CPR training.  \n\nThe most frequent hazard encountered at Twin Rivers is"

Most injuries are from contact with steam heat tracing and small steam leaks.  No injuries have been attributed to 800-pound steam releases at Twin Rivers.  Hazardous chemicals, such as sodium hydroxide and hydrogen peroxide, are stored on site are stored in relatively small quantities (under RMP reportable thresholds) in bermed or protected areas with controlled access.  Other chemicals include fuel oils (#6 & #2) used for boilerhouse operations for steam generation.\n\nThe use of gaseous hydrogen at Twin Rivers considered the most potentially serious hazard.  To provide more stable and less hazardous storage media, Twin Rivers has begun construction of a liquid hydrogen storage area to replace the existing gaseous storage system.  This will be located at the furthest point from the Fore River Bridge and has been inspected by the local fire department and complies with all safety and environmental standards.  The new storage area is protected in many of the same ways that the existing system.  For instance, fire walls, traffic ballards, and relief valves are all used but additional protection has been added and includes a sprinkler curtains, low pressure stops, magnetic and thermal trips, fusible links, automatic shutoffs and tank pressure and level indicators and alarms will all be utilized.  This area is also located at the point of use and will minimize the risk of a transmission line leak or failure that the current system is now subject.  The present storage location for gaseous hydrogen utilizes protected trailers and transmits it to process via a pipeline to its production areas.  The total maximum storage at this transmission point is 1539 lbs., well under the ten thousand pound threshold outline in the RMP Guidelines.  The new system will contain a maximum of 11,840 pounds of liquid hydrogen.  Using the RMP Comp program the worse-ca"

No residential or other sensitive human receptors lie within that radius and the nearest receptors are located across the Fore and Town Rivers from the facility.  The rivers surfaces lie 5-10 feet below grade (depending on tide) and would not likely be impacted due to hydrogen gaseous nature in ambient air.\n\nChemical Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies For Twin Rivers Technologies\n\nThe Twin Rivers chemical storage policy requires that only qualified individuals handle hazardous chemicals and that those chemicals be stored in bermed or protected areas with controlled and limited access.  \n\nTwin Rivers presently stores all its raw materials, process materials and finished products in one of two tank farms.  These tank farms are bermed systems are designed to hold up to 300% of the capacity of the largest storage tank.  Twin Rivers also receives raw material via its deep-water ocean terminal.  All other chemicals stored on site (mostly for wastewater treatment, maintenance and utilities) also are stored in either bermed or protected areas.  \n\nEmergency Response policies are outlined in Twin Rivers three response plans.  These plans are the Spill Prevention & Control Countermeasures Plan (SPCC), a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SPPP), and an Oil Pollution Act (OPA 90) Plan.  The SPCC outlines the actions to be taken in the event of a chemical spill from the plant, and the necessary emergency response and regulatory agencies to notify.  The SPPP defines the necessary procedures and actions to take to insure that no discharge is released through the NPDES outfall that are active during rainfall events.  The OPA 90 Plan addresses oil spill prevention and response for all spills that can negatively impact groundwater aquifers, navigable waterways, estuaries or any other receiving waterbody.

This process provides a review for the impacts that any chemical may have on the environmental controls systems, personnel health, and defines proper storage, personal protective equipment and chemical compatibility prior to receipt.\n\nRegulated Substance Handling\n\nAlthough only hydrogen will exceed the reportable threshold for the Risk Management Plan, Twin Rivers has several substances that are regulated under various environmental health and safety regulations.  Hydrogen is presently stored in a secured location that is remote to our process operations and has various control features that insure safe handling and operations.   All hydrogen deliveries are handled by the supply-company (Air Products) that uses only specially trained workers to insure safe operations.\n\nOther regulated substances stored on site include sodium hydroxide, hydrogen peroxide, ferrous sulfate, sulfuric and hydrochloric acids, methylene chloride and etc.  Uses of these chemicals vary from wastewater treatment additives to laboratory reagents.  Twin Rivers manages these chemicals and the resultant wastestreams in accordance with all federal, state local regulations.\n\nRelease Scenarios\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\nThe worst-case scenario, as defined by the RMPComp software package, anticipates a 13628-pound release of hydrogen.  This release also requires a maximum evacuation area of .05 miles.  However, the RMP threshold limit and the minimum evacuation zone allowed is .1 miles, this figure can be considered to be artificially large.  \n\n\tAlternative Release Scenario\nLeaking Line / Valve / Fitting\n\nA leak from the Hydrogen System would result in the ignition of hydrogen as it escaped to the atmosphere."

      "SummaryText": "In a worst-case scenario, the leak would be detected as a pressure drop or as a heat source after ignition.  In each situation the detection system would automatically close the control valves and stop the flow of hydrogen from the main storage tank.  This would happen immediately, but if these systems did not actuate the control valve on duty operators would activate the manual shutdown system.  \n\nFrom the time of the leak beginning, allowing for some recognition time, to system shutdown, no more than 15 minutes would likely pass.  Assuming a major line rupture or equipment failure, TRT anticipates that no more that 10% (1840 lbs), of the contents of the hydrogen tank could be lost to the atmosphere.  The affected area, projected by RMPComp is .2 miles from the source.  Fifty percent of the immediate area is shielded by concrete walls.  Production vessels adjacent to the area are protected by a water curtain deluge system.  The remaining bordering area is made up of two waterways, the Fore and Town Rivers that limits access and isolates the area.\n\n\nBLEVE\n\nA BLEVE situation would result in the instantaneous release of all product, (11,840 lbs when at capacity), from the Hydrogen System.  The resultant failure would result in the ignition of hydrogen as it escaped to the atmosphere.  In a worst-case scenario, the BLEVE would be detected as a pressure drop and as a heat source after ignition.  In each situation the detection system would automatically start the deluge system and initiate an emergency response by the QFD.  \n\nThe loss of all product would empty the main storage tank of all hydrogen.  TRT anticipates 100% (11,840 lbs), of the contents of the hydrogen tank would be lost to the atmosphere.  The affected area, projected by RMPComp is .3 miles from the source.

It is TRT operational practice to shutdown operations, including those in the hydrogen system if severe weather threatens to breach the outer containment bulkhead of the facility.   In these cases, the Hydrogen System would be shutdown until the severe weather subsided.  \n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nTwin Rivers has had a total of four coconut oil releases since 1994.  These releases were directly related to a fault in the facility's NPDES discharge line.  The largest of these spills was approximately 50 gallons.  The balance of this material was captured in a sea-boom however, some of this material was released into the Town River.  Twin Rivers immediately dispatched its two response boats and plant response personnel for collection and control of the material.  Three similar coconut oil releases of lesser quantity occurred during the same time period.  During 1998, the investigation at the time revealed the NPDES discharge line fault that was immediately remediated.  Since that time, no other discharges have occurred.  Twin Rivers does continue to maintain the sea-boom as a precautionary measure.  The former owner, Proctor and Gamble MFG Co., experienced a petroleum oil discharge that was found to be part of an underground plume that is part of an ongoing remedial effort.  To stop any continued discharge, Twin River and the former owner of the site constructed a subsurface slurry wall, a groundwater recovery system and installed a sea-boom system similar to the one at the NPDES discharge location. \n\nAll reportable, lost time and worker related injuries are reported to OSHA and the appropriate state and local agencies as required.\n\nThe Emergency Response Program\n\nSee: Chemical Release P"
