This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training.  It is Evans? policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, Evans personnel and external professional responder are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  \n\n2.The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nThe Evans Houston facility's primary activities are repackaging and warehousing of chemicals. Evans either repackages or warehouses up to two RMP regulated substances.  These substances are listed below.  Evans receives the regulated substances in bulk and packages the products for customer distribution.  Drummed products are then warehoused or shipped depending on customer specifications.  Inventory is dependent upon customer orders and not all regulated substances are present onsite at a given time.  \n\nChemical                        CAS No.\nToxic Substances:\n\nToluene 2,4 diisocyanate        584-84-9\nEthylenediamine                 107-15-3\n\n\n3.The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), include administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.  Evans Houston is a Program 2 level facility.  \n\nTo evaluate the worst case and alternative scenarios, Evans used EPA's program RMP*Comp to calculate the off-site consequences.  RMP*Comp is based on the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.\n\nScenarios for Toxic Substances\n\nThe worst-case release scenario "

Evans is subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place.\n                                                                                                                                                                                           Process Hazard Analysis\nEvans? facility has no process chemistry.  Periodic hazard reviews are conducted to ensure hazards associated with operations are identified and controlled effectively.  The checklist methodology used to carry out process hazard analyses are from the Chemical Manufactures Association Assessment guides (CMA).  Evans also used the EPA Compliance Guide Checklist as well its own hazard reviews.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within covered operations, Evans maintains written standard operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after maintenance.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nEvans Houston has a training program in place to ensure that employees are competent in the operating procedures. New employees receive training and are tested for competency before starting work and continue on the job training under supervision.  Refresher training is provided on a regular basis and more fr"

Process equipment examined by this program includes among others; pressure valves, transfer hoses, abatement vent systems, shutdown systems and weighing mechanisms.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nStart Up Reviews\nSafety reviews related on all new chemical transfers are conducted. These reviews are conducted to confirm that equipment and appropriate PPE are suitable for all new chemicals.\n\nCompliance Audits\nEvans will conduct audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits will be carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits will be undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nEvans promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nAt Evans safety is not a departmental function.
