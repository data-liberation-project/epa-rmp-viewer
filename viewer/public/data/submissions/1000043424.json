      "SummaryText": "KIK (Houston) Inc.\n\n2921 Corder\n\nHouston, Texas 77054\n\n\n\nI.EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nThe KIK Corporation is a manufacturer/packager/shipper of consumer household cleaning products for retail outlets.  KIK also has a plastics blow-molding operation; making all of the containers for their products.  There are several chemicals stored in bulk at the facility; Caustic, Chlorine, High Density Polyethylene, and miscellaneous waste water treatment products in drums.  The finished products are typically stored in polyethylene bottles, and packaged in cardboard cases for shipment to retail outlets.  These cases are palletized for ease of handling and shipment.  KIK also has an on-site wastewater treatment facility for the management of miscellaneous aqueous streams.\n\n\n\nThe only chemical meeting the threshold quantity as determined under 40 CFR 68.115 is Chlorine.  KIK receives bulk chlorine.  This chlorine is used to make the varying grades of household bleach.   KIK has a chlorine monitoring system and an automatic shut-off system.  These systems consist of five (5) chlorine monitoring devices, four (4) automatic shut-off valves (Avs), five (5) chlorine expansion chambers, and associated relays and signal lines.  The automatic valves are air activated and automatically close in the event of a power failure.\n\n\n\nThe monitors are an electrolytic cell design.  Spare cells are maintained at the facility.  The monitors are located at each bleach unit, the two rail car unloading stations, and on the chlorine line near the middle of the length from the rail cars to the bleach unit.  The chlorine line monitor is co-located with the automatic shut-off valve.  The other automatic shut-off valves are located at the bleach unit and at the rail car stations.  The two chlorine expansion chambers are located on the chlorine line on either side of the automatic shut-off valve.\n\n\n\nThe monitors are set to activate the automatic shut-off valves at 0.05 ppm and sound an alarm at or above a concentra"

      "SummaryText": "tion of one (1) part per million (ppm) of chlorine.  Each monitor at the rail cars and the monitor at the chlorine line are designed to shut down the system.  Scenario #1:  If one monitor at a rail car senses chlorine at or above a concentration of one (1) ppm, the automatic shut-off valves activate at both rail car locations and at the chlorine line.  Scenario #2: The monitor at the bleach unit activates only the automatic shut-off valve at the bleach unit.  The purpose of this arrangement is to take advantage of the expansion capacity of the rail car and the bleach unit.\n\n\n\nThe chlorine expansion chambers built into the chlorine line are also provided to allow for gas expansion in the event of an automatic system shut down.  Each chamber is d to manage the chlorine gas contained within 125 feet of line.  The total length of the line is 160 feet.  The devices have internal rupture discs to allow the gas into the chamber.  Spare rupture discs are maintained on site.\n\n\n\nThe Chlorine line/System is constructed of one (1) inch schedule 80 pipes.  Three hundred (300) pound fittings are used at all pipe junctures.  The system operates at 110 to 120 pounds per square inch (psi); the piping is over designed to prevent any pipe or fitting failure.  The entire system is inspected weekly and qualified maintenance personnel perform preventive maintenance quarterly.  The entire system is built to the recommendations of the Chlorine Institute. Automatic high temperature shut-offs are in place, in addition to redundant sensors and alarms.  As an added safeguard, KIK employs local pressure indicators on the chlorine tank car and feed line.  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Department of Transportation mandates in 49CFR179.102 DOT specification 105A500W, that a tank car is to be constructed of two steel shells.  The internal shell is the pressure vessel holding the material and is to be constructed of 1-11/16\" steel plate with a minimum bursting pressure of 1,250 pounds per square inch (49CFR179.101-1). "

      "SummaryText": " In subsequent tank testing, a pressure of 500 psi is to be held by the tank car with \"no signs of leakage or distress\" for a period of 10 minutes as set forth in 49CFR 179.100-18.  Between the internal shell and the external shell there must be a 4\" minimum thickness of either cork board or 2\" minimum of 4 lb/cubic foot dense polyurethane foam insulation (49 CFR 179.102.2).  The external jacket is to be of not less than 11 gauge steel as set forth in 49 CFR179.100-4.  Safety valves are to have a maximum flow rating of 412 psi and be vapor tight at a minimum of 300 psi.  The typical pressure used as padding by KIK is 120 psi.   This padding pressure is significantly below the designed vapor pressure for the valves.  Again, the system is over designed to insure employee and public safety.\n\n\n\nKIK follows the procedures and safety measures recommended by the Chlorine Institute for the safe handling and use of chlorine.  The facility has written procedures for the unloading of Chlorine tank cars.  The employees managing the Chlorine unit are specifically trained in the proper connection and disconnection protocols for rail cars.  A C-kit is on site in the event of a leaking valve, line, or leaking shipping container.  The operators responsible for the Chlorine system are trained annually in the proper usage of a C-kit.          \n\n\n\nKIK has been in operation at the Corder Street Address since July of 1996.  The site was previously owned by Labbco/Lastec.  This site has been in operation, manufacturing bleach, using Chlorine as a raw product since 1971.  There have been no mishaps regarding this process."
