If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Dover Fire Department and the Wabaunsee County LEPC or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact ot the release to people and the environment. the primary activity of the Maple Hill Anhydrous Ammonia facility is the storage and distribution fo Anyhdrous Ammonia fertilizer to the agricultural customes we serve. Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored and distributed for the direct application of the product as a plant nutrient. The maximum quantity stored would be 40,163 pounds in our 9,000-gallon storage tank. The maximum quantity released would be 40,163 pounds released as a gas over 10 minutes which represents the volume of the storage tank at our facility at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.6 miles. The alternative release scenario is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to he endpoint (point of dispersion to 200ppm is .06 miles). The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\" published by the America National Standards Institute, inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".There have been no accidental releases of Anhydrous Ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. The facility has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38. We have provided state and "
