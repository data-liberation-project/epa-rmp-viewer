      "SummaryText": "Schenectady International, Inc. (SII) has programs in place to insure identification and response to emergencies.  These programs include training drills in emergency preparedness, HAZMAT training, medical response, a written emergency response plan, and fire-and-rescue techniques.  SII is a chemical complex that manufactures various alkylphenols and is required to submit a Risk Management Plan due to the use of isobutylene and butylene as raw materials.  The EPA RMP regulation requires the worst-case release scenario to assume that the entire contents of the largest vessel is released.  This event is highly unlikely and has never occurred at our facility.  Based on our calculations using EPA-approved methods, the worst-case release scenario could potentially affect offsite receptors.  SII has never had an accident involving the release of a regulated substance that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuation, of sheltering-in-place.  SII is operated in strict accordance with written operating and maintenance procedures.  Our programs insure strict attention to changes in the operations with a thorough review of potential incidents that could lead to accidental releases."
