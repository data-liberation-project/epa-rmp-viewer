The basic raw materials are tallow and grease, by-products of the meat packing industry, and vegetable oils including coconut oil and soybean oil. Additional raw materials include ammonia, hydrogen, methyl chloride, acrylonitrile, and formaldehyde solutions.\n\nThe major process units at the site include a fat splitter, a nitrile unit, continuous and batch hydrogenation units, nitrile treatment, amine and fatty acid distillation units, amine esterification unit, and a quaternization unit.\n\nThe site has five regulated substances that are covered by the Risk Management Plan . These substances are acrylonitrile, ammonia, formaldehyde solutions, methyl chloride, and hydrogen.\nThe maximum quantities of these materials handled in a process at the site at anytime are as follows: Acrylonitrile (toxic) - 399,168 lbs\nAmmonia (toxic) - 989,808 lbs\nFormaldehyde Solutions (toxic) - 477,521 lbs of solution with 50% Formaldehyde\nMethyl Chloride (toxic) - 1,026,246 lbs\nHydrogen (flammable) - 10,130 lbs\n\nThese quantities represent the maximum storage capacity of tanks and the maximum number of full delivery containers present onsite in a worst case.
