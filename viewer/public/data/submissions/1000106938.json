This plan was developed specifically to address the requirements applicable to the use of anhydrous ammonia at the Boar\u0092s Head New Castle South facility located in New Castle, Indiana.  Each of the following sections provides a general overview of the facility requirements and defines design attributes, documentation, and actions that are established to comply with those requirements. Boar\u0092s Head has already developed measures and systems that provide compliance with 40 CFR Part 68 rules as a results of other regulatory programs and requirements.  This document does not replicate that information but rather provides cross-references to the applicable existing documents.  In those instances, where information was developed specifically to comply with Part 68 requirements, that information is contained in that document.  \n\n1.1 Commitment to Safety\nThe health and safety of our partners, contractors and visitors is the most important aspect of our operations which include the protection of the environment and our surrounding communities. Our commitment to safety is more than words; it is the core value we live and work by at Boar\u0092s Head Provisions Company, Inc. The success of our safety culture and environmental commitment is based on our belief that every partner must and will be actively engaged both in safety and the protection of the environment.  \n\n1.1.1\tIt is the policy of Boar\u0092s Head to: \n1.1.1.1\tProvide safe working conditions, proper tools and personal protective equipment. \n\n1.1.1.2\tComply with all federal, state and local occupational health and safety laws and regulations. \n1.1.1.3\tProvide and sustain a high level of commitment to ensuring that all employees have a safe and healthy work environment in which to work. \n\n1.1.1.4\tEnsure, through"
