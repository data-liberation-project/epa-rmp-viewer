The Tuscarora facility actively manages all operational permits and safety programs such as Nevada Department of Environmental Protection Air Quality, Chemical Accident Prevention Program, Underground Injection Control as well as OSHA's Process Safety Management. In addition, Ormat is ISO 14000 and 9001 certified and undergoes several audit processes to ensure all facilities are aggressively pursuing the highest quality, safety and environmental standards. Ormat is committed to handling the n-pentane systems in a safe manner to protect the environment. Copies of emergency response, process hazard analyses, Chemical Accident Prevention and process safety management plans and all technical drawing (P&IDS) for process equipment are maintained onsite for reference.\r\n\r\nFacility Description\r\nThe Tuscarora Geothermal Power Plant (Tuscarora) is wholly owned by Ormat Nevada Inc. (Ormat),\r\nwhich is a division of Ormat Technologies, Inc., a publicly traded company. The Tuscarora Project is located in Elko County and encompasses approximately 10,667 acres of public and private lands. The physical plant is located on approximately 20 acres located about 70 miles northwest of Elko off of Highway 226. The leased acreage covers the defined geothermal resource area and receptive injection zones.\r\n\r\nThe physical address is: HC 32 Box 200, Tuscarora, NV 89834\r\n\r\nThe Tuscarora Plant is a geothermal electric power generation facility with two 12.7 MW generator\r\nnameplate, water-cooled Integrated Two Level Unit (ITLU - LI/LII) Ormat Energy Converters (OEC), and associated facilities. Geothermal fluid is supplied from three production wells to a binary system consisting of two OEC's. Spent geothermal fluid is injected back into the subsurface reservoir via four injection"

The Eastern NV-Operations Group (ENOP) is comprised of management, administration, maintenance, engineering and operations personnel. ENOP operates three eastern Nevada power generation facilities owned by Ormat.\r\n\r\nThe Tuscarora facility operates continuously, 24 hours per day and 365 days per year (excluding scheduled maintenance downtime or plant upsets).  \r\n\r\nRegulated Substance Handled\r\nTuscarora stores n-pentane (CAS # 109-66-0) as the motive fluid used in the Ormat Energy Converter (OEC) units. In addition to the inventory present in the OECs, the plant has two n-pentane storage tanks that  each have a nominal capacity of 30,000 gallons (maximum fill capacity of 27,000 gallons). The maximum total projected amount of n-pentane stored on site is 428,630 pounds (reflects the inventory in two operational OECs and one storage tank filled to the maximum). The use of n-pentane in a process in a quantity greater than 10,000 lbs requires compliance with PSM (29CFR1910.119), RMP (40CFR68) and CAPP (Nevada Administrative Code 459.952 to 459.95528).  \r\n\r\nWorst Case Scenario: Worst case scenario assessment has been made and potential off-site consequence\r\nanalysis (OCA) was undertaken. However, in conformance with Office of Emergency Management guidance, the OCA for worst-case and/or alternative release scenario(s) has not been included in this Executive Summary because of security concerns.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices: Safe work practices have been developed and implemented to provide for the control of hazards during work activities such as lock out/tag-out, confined space entry, opening process equipment or piping, and control over entrance into a facility by maintenance, contractor, laboratory or other support personnel. These safe work practices apply to both employees and contractors.\r\n\r\nMaintenance Procedures: A Mechanica"

The MIP adopted a maintenance concept for periodic preventative and corrective maintenance of the OEC system at Tuscarora. The preventative maintenance tasks include visual inspection, lubrication of\r\nrotating parts, system cleaning, replacing liquids and filters, and periodic tests to verify that the system is in proper operating condition. Preventative maintenance tasks and procedures are scheduled to be undertaken over a series of maintenance intervals.\r\n\r\nAlarm system maintenance is determined using a combination of regulatory requirements, manufactures\r\nrecommendations, plant operating experience and best practices. Standard Safety Procedure #23, and\r\nStandard Maintenance Procedures (SMP's) will identify system maintenance procedures, frequencies and\r\nrecommended spare parts.\r\n\r\nTraining: Initial training for personnel is given before that employee is allowed to either handle n-pentane,\r\noperate or work on the facility's process area or on process equipment.

Refresher training for all personnel shall be conducted annually at a minimum.\r\n\r\nSafety Training: Some equipment at the Tuscarora Geothermal Power Plant poses potential fire, explosion, and electrical hazards that could cause serious personal injuries and costly property damage if safety procedures are not followed correctly. Safety training, conducted monthly and required of all employees, identifies the different hazards to be found on the sites. These subjects include Emergency Action Plan (EAP), motive fluid hazards, fire prevention and hot work, lock out and tag out procedures, hazard communication, confined space, hearing conservation, personal protective equipment, accident, injury and incident reporting. Safety training is supplemented by the use of the Standard Safety Procedures.\r\n\r\nn-Pentane system: Deviation from the design limits of operation for the n-pentane transfer system will not normally occur since the individual components are rated beyond the highest achievable values of pressure, temperature, and flow within the system.\r\n\r\nOEC Units: The OEC units are controlled and monitored by their own dedicated HMI Programmable Logic\r\nController (PLC). The PLC receives all discrete (logic) and analog signals from the input devices (e.g. switches and measuring sensors), processes the signals according to pre-loaded Ormat software, and then outputs logic and analog command signals to local and field devices. All parameters needed for proper operation of the OEC units, such as pressure, temperature, voltage, current, power, speed, etc. are measured by the proper measuring instruments. Deviation from the operating parameters will immediately be detected by the PLC and the PLC will initiate correction or automatic shutdown of the related OEC unit. Under normal circumstances, no releases or other dangerous situations are expected to result from these automatic actions. Appropriate manual override is provided.\r\n\r\nRelief system design: Relief valves ar"
