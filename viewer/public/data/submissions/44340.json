The plant is located 7 miles North of Foss,Ok. On the east side of Foss Reservoir this a\nrural area.Chlorine is the only Regulated Toxic Substance at the treatment plant.The area is posted Authorized Personnel only.\nAlso we have a Chlora - Alert alarm system in place that monitors the air in this area continually,if a leak is detected a alarmwill sound with a light flashing,also the alarm will go to the main plant alarm system and call some one out to check on on alarm.\nThe plant has a Emergancy Respose plan in place.If aleakis detected plant personal will trt to locate the problem and if leak can not be stoped the plan will be put in action. I event of a worest-case scenarios a 2 mile area around the plant will have to be evacuated. The er plan calls for the county sheriff to be notified to help with the evacuation also the local park Ranger. It was found that only 47 pepole live in the 2 mile area. Plant employees have had training in the usd of a B kit to repair a leak in a ton cylinder, there is a B kit on site. The local Fire Department will also be callwd to help.Also the Custer County Emergancy Manager will be calledin to help coorinate the emergency operations. Many new security measures have been put in place in the last few years. The main gate is locked at all times so there is very limited access to the project.
