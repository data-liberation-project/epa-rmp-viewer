Subsequent to that PHA three others were held to go over operation procedures and these were finalized in November 2019.  All critical issues identified during that review were addressed and resolved.  The railcar system was commissioned (received LPG) in May 2019.\r\n\r\nAnother PHA to cover the propane dehydration/refrigeration system was completed in August 2019 after those system's drawings and P&Ps are finalized.  Those systems are expected to be commissioned in May 2020.\r\n\r\nQuantities of propylene are planned to increase above the PSM and RMP 10,000 pound threshold quantity in early 2020."

DESCRIPTION OF THE SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\n\r\nThe Sea-3 Terminal in Newington, NH imports and stores fully refrigerated liquid propane (LPG) at -45 degrees Fahrenheit (\u00b0F) atmospheric pressure by ship or barge.  Refrigerated LPG is stored in two refrigerated storage tanks.  The terminal processes refrigerated LPG by heating it to +40 \u00b0F and storing it at pressure and ambient temperatures in our Day Tank.  \r\n\r\nPropane liquefied under pressure is received by railcar and stored in three pressurized ambient temperature storage tanks.  Liquid from these tanks can be transferred to the Day Tank for truck loading.  It also can be dehydrated, refrigerated and transferred to the two atmospheric refrigerated storage tanks.   \r\n\r\nLPG liquid under pressure is loaded onto transport trucks for shipment to customers.  \r\nEthyl mercaptan, an odorizing agent, is received and stored and then added to LPG being loaded into tank trucks and distributed from the terminal.  .  \r\n\r\nPropylene is used as a refrigerant in the railcar refrigeration system.  It is received in pressurized containers and transferred to the refrigeration system.\r\n\r\nPropane, ethyl mercaptan and propylene are regulated flammable RMP and PSM substances held above their threshold quantity  The terminal is absent any other RMP or PSM listed flammable or toxic chemicals at or above threshold quantities.\r\n\r\n3.

The complete list is included in Section 1 Accident Release Prevention Program.\r\n\r\n4. FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nIn the five-year reporting period, there have been no propane or ethyl mercaptan releases that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\r\n\r\n5. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nEmergency planning and preparedness are covered in the Sea-3 Contingency Plan which details responses by facility employees, the Newington Fire and Police Departments, and the US Coast Guard.  These agencies were involved in the development of the plan which is available to all cognizant officials in the pamphlet Sea-3 Emergency Procedures.  The sections involving facility employees were developed by Sea-3 management in conjunction with the operating staff and outside consultants.  All new employees are given initial training in health safety and emergency and operation procedures.  \r\n\r\nEmployees receive refresher training on an ongoing basis.  This training is documented in accordance with the training records requirements of OSHA's Process Safety Management program and EPA's Risk Management Program.  Sea-3 staff receive Fire School classroom and live fire training.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Sea-3 Emergency Procedures noted above, emergency response is also covered in the Sea-3 US Coast Guard Operating and Emergency Procedures Manual.  The US Coast Guard also maintains its own written operating and emergency plan, Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) Contingency Plan issued by the USCG Marine Safety Office in Portland, Maine.\r\n\r\n6.
