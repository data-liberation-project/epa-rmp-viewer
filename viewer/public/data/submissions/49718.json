HIGH STREET\nHEBRON, OHIO\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Facility\nRenosol Seating, LLC endeavors in all its activities to promote a better environment. Renosol Seating, LLC recognizes that our activities have impacts on our employees and the surrounding community. It is our desire to reduce adverse impacts of our business by:\n\n?\tContinually reviewing norms and practices relative to their effect on health, safety and the environment; and\n?\tTaking measures to prevent pollution and injury, conserve resources, minimize waste, improve working conditions, and comply with applicable environmental laws, regulations and other requirements.\n\nRenosol Seating, LLC is a member of the Suppliers Partnership for the Environment, a trade association comprised of automotive and vehicle suppliers who work in partnership with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n\nThree of Renosol Seating, LLC\u00bfs manufacturing plants in Michigan and Alabama have been registered to ISO-14001:1996, the worldwide environmental management system standard. These same practices are utilized at the Hebron, Ohio facility. While Renosol Seating, LLC has always taken care to ensure compliance to environmental standards and to protect the health and safety of its employees, ISO-14001 provides important guidelines for continuing to examine and improve its environmental management systems. Through these and other initiatives, Renosol Seating, LLC has implemented a system that holds each employee accountable for the safety and environmental performance of the company.\n\nThe Renosol Seating, LLC Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled\nThe Hebron, Ohio facility produces liquid polyurethane systems and polyurethane seating, headrest, armrest and console cushions for the automotive industry. Two types of foam lines are utilized at the facility\u00bfan MDI line (Methylenebis(phenylisocyanate)) and a TDI (Tolu"

The TDI is transferred into two 6,500-gallon indoor storage tanks from tanker trucks. From the indoor storage tanks, TDI is transferred via hard plumbed lines to smaller retaining tanks for daily use.\n\nThe TDI foaming line consists of a multi-station race track design line with each station containing one bench seat or two bucket seat molds. At the first station, the foam (mixture of TDI and polyol) is mechanically poured into the mold. The lid to the mold is then immediately closed and clamped shut. The foam is cured as it rotates through the various stations. The lid is then opened and the foam seat is removed. The mold is vacuumed clean and a wax release agent is applied to the mold so that it can be used again.\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe Renosol Seating, LLC Hebron, Ohio Plant complies with a variety of environmental and safety programs including waste management, air emissions controls, storm water pollution prevention, spill prevention, community right-to-know programs (EPCRA), hazardous materials management, emergency response and many others. Although the Hebron Plant is not certified to the ISO14001 Standard, Renosol Seating, LLC has exceeded minimum efforts to comply with these requirements by implementing an Environmental Management System. Central to these efforts is a consistent effort to prevent incidents and accidents, including chemical spills.\n\nOver the years, Renosol Seating, LLC has invested in equipment, employee training programs, procedural improvements, and made various facility improvements to support these prevention efforts. With respect to prevention of chemical-related incidents, Renosol Seating, LLC has made several investments.

Strict procedures are also followed when materials are unloaded including the requirement that a person observes the unloading of the delivery tanker truck.\n\nFixed air monitoring equipment is installed within the building to provide an early warning of any TDI release. These monitors are inspected and tested on a regular basis to ensure their accuracy and functioning ability. The principle of detection is based on a chemical reaction caused by the presence of TDI on a chemically impregnated paper tape. A sample of plant air is drawn through the tape by a pump. When TDI is present in the sample, it causes a stain to form on the paper tape. The intensity of the stain is proportional to the concentration of TDI in the sample. A photo diode monitors the stain intensity as a chemical reaction occurs on the paper. If the intensity of the stain is above a pre-set level, the alarm relays are initiated and an indication is shown on the LCD display. The display shows flashing bells to indicate that the instrument is in alarm mode. The alarm condition persists until a reading below the alarm set point is reached. No employee is allowed back into the area until a reading of below the set alarm is reached (5 ppb is the alarm level).\n\nThe Five-Year Accident History\nThere have been no incidents involving TDI in the last five years. \n\nThe Emergency Response Program\nRenosol Seating, LLC has made a significant effort to communicate the elements of its response program with local emergency responders. Members of the local fire department and Local Emergency Planning Commission have visited the facility. The Corporate Health, Safety and Environmental Manager maintains his 40-hour HAZWOPER training, among other emergency response training updates and requirements. Facility personnel involved with the TDI process receive regular training on pollution prevention and emergency response. This training includes participating in an emergency drill which is documented. Alert system"
