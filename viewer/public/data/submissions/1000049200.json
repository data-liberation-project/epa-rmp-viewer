Plant Policy Concerning Chemical Safety\n\n\n\nIt is the policy of LEDVANCE LLC, St. Marys Plant to conduct its operations and to manufacture quality lamps in a manner which is protective of the environment and the health and safety of our employees, our customers, and the public.  In furtherance of this policy, the Plant is committed to:\n\n\n\n*  Being good, responsible corporate citizens in our community.\n\n\n\n*  Meeting or striving to exceed all applicable environmental laws, regulations and requirements of federal, state and local governments, all all other LEDVANCE LLC requirements.\n\n\n\n*  Identifying the actual and potential environmental impacts of the plant's facilities, activities, products and services, and minimizing and eliminating them whenever reasonably possible.\n\n\n\n*  Contributing to pollution prevention and to the efficient use of resources.\n\n\n\n*  Continually improving its environmental management system and performance by periodically establishing, reviewing, and updating meaningful objectives and targets relating to prevention of pollution and the Plant's identified significant environmental impacts and applicable requirements.\n\n\n\n*  Providing appropriate employee and management training and implementing programs designed to achieve the Plant's established environmental objectives and targets.\n\n\n\n*  Periodically monitoring, auditing, and evaluating the Plant's environmental performance as it relates to applicable environmental requirements and established objectives and targets.\n\n\n\n2.  Facility Description\n\n\n\nThe LEDVANCE LLC St. Marys, PA facility manufactures incandescent and halogen lamps (SIC code 3641).  Sulfur dioxide is used in the glass formingand cutting process.  Eight (8) full 2,000-pound cylinders are used to store the sulfur dioxide.  All cylinders are connected via valves to a common header. Only one cylinder is valved onto the system at any time. Empty cylinders are stored in their connected state until a total of 6 are empty. Then they a"

      "SummaryText": "re replaced with 6 full cylinders. All eight cylinders are stored inside one room. The current cylinder storage arrangement allows access to the total cylinder store via a crane and monorail system. In the event of an incident, the LEPC can use the crane to put the cylinder in a position such that it can be plugged (or the release point stopped). Training was done with the LEPC. The basic set up of the room has remained the same since approx. 2005. The St. Marys facility has been in continuous operation since 1955 without any incidents involving the sulfur dioxide.\n\n\n\n3.  LEDVANCE LLC Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe sulfur doxide tanks and assoicated piping are subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  LEDVANCE LLC complies with the requirements of PSM and has reviewed its program during preparation of this plan. The facility had implemented and maintains procedures for changing out empty for full cylinders at delivery, shutting off empty cylinders and bringing full cylinders on-line and plant response.\n\n\n\n4.  Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nLEDVANCE LLC has had no accidents involving the sulfur dioxide system during the past five years.\n\n\n\n5.  Emergency Response Plan\n\n\n\nLEDVANCE LLC employees are not trained to be first responders for emergency situations involving the sulfur dioxide system.  In the event of an emergency, LEDVANCE LLC's emergency coordinators would notify proper authorities including the Crystal Fire Department, the Elk County Hazmat Team, and the St. Marys Police Department. This facility and this process are inluded in the LEPCs off-site emergency response planning.\n\n\n\n6.  Planned Changes\n\n\n\nNo changes in the process are planned at this time."
