The first scenario is defined by EPA, stating that,  the owner or operator shall assume that the...maximum quantity in the largest vessel...is released as a gas over 10 minutes due to an unspecified failure.  The Alternative Scenario is defined as more likely to occur than the Worst-Case Release Scenario.  The Offsite Consequence Analysis for the 44th Street WTP was conducted with the use of the EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants.\n\t1.\tBased on the tables and information provided for a worst-case chlorine release, the following was determined:\n\t\ta.\tThe Worst-Case Release Scenario, as defined by EPA, would be for three 150 lb cylinders of chlorine to release, as a gas, in a ten minute period.\n\t\tb.\tThe toxic endpoint for Cl2 gas is 3 ppm.\n\t\tc.\tPassive mitigation can be expected from the building housing the chlorine and this will reduce the release rate by 45%.\n\t\td.\tThe distance from the release site to the toxic endpoint is 0.45 miles.\n\tIt should be noted that the design of the chlorine feed system and the chlorine leak detection system make the possibility of the EPA described worst-case scenario practically impossible.\n\t2.\tThe Alternative (Release ) Scenario was evaluated with the use of the EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants.  For the 44th Street WTP a possible alternative release scenario would be a release through a 1/8 inch i.d. Cl2 gas stainless steel flexible connector.  Such a leak would not have an impact outside the facility boundaries.  The reason for this is because of the passive and active mitigation measures that are in place.  These are:\n\t\ta.\tBuilding enclosure providing 45% reduction of release rate\n\t\tb.\tChlorine leak detection and alarm system.\nD.\tThe general 44th Street WTP accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are based on the Town of Ocean City's program and consi"

All applicable procedures of the US EPA Prevention Program are adhered to.  The Division of Public Works continues to evaluate and improve its procedures and practices with regards to its accidental release prevention policy.\n\n\tThe Division of Public Works response policy involves the preparation of response plans which are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n  \nB.\tSystem Description and Regulated Substance Handled\n\tThe 44th Street Water Treatment Plant provides the Town of Ocean City with potable (drinking) water.  The 44th Street Water Treatment Plant (WTP) is located on 44th Street  in Ocean City, Maryland.  Disinfection of water is part of the water treatment process required by the Safe Drinking Water Act and the State of Maryland.  At the 44th Street Water Treatment Plant (WTP), disinfection is accomplished with chlorine treatment. \n\tChlorine liquid is stored and handled at the 44th Street WTP for the disinfection process.  The water treatment plant chlorination system has a chlorine storage room and a chlorination room.  Equipment at the facility includes liquid chlorine containers, chlorine gas manifolds, a vacuum feed system, chlorinators, safety equipment, and chlorine leak detectors.\n\tTypically, twenty (20) 150 lb cylinders of chlorine are on site.  Six of the twenty cylinders  are on-line.  The water treatment plant is normally unmanned.  Water treatment plant operators visit the facility daily, and respond to any trouble alarms which may occur.\n\nC.\tOffsite Consequence Analysis\n\tThe Offsite Consequence Analysis includes the consideration of two chlorine release scena"

The program includes an organizational structure of emergency responders and their responsibilities.  Emergency response to a leak at the 44th Street WTP would include selected personnel of the Town of Ocean City Division of Public Works, who have specific knowledge and training for chlorine-leak response.  Emergency-response drills and emergency-procedure evaluations are conducted regularly.\nG..\tPlanned Changes to Improve  Safety \n\tPlanned changes to improve safety of chlorine-handling at the facility have been approved and are expected to be implemented within the next year and include:\n\t1.\tInstallation of an emergency scrubber system that is sized to handle the simultaneous release of all, on-line, chlorine gas.\n\t2.\tNew leak detectors in the chlorinators that alarm to the Town of Ocean City Communications Center, as well as provide locally audible and visible alarms."
