              "Description": "3.0    Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe transload process at TRANSFLO has a NAICS Code of 48211 and is considered a Program 3 level prevention program as described in Subpart C of 40 CFR 68 (68.48 through 68.60).  This terminal utilizes a series of terminal specific work instructions and procedures for the daily operations including the transload of LPG products.  Specific documents referenced in the RMP are found in an electronic operating procedures manual accessible to the terminal management and employees.  Written copies of work instructions are available at the terminal but are not considered controlled documents.  The seven requirements for the prevention program are described below and will be implemented on a daily basis at the North Haven terminal.\n\n\n\n3.1    Safety Information (40 CFR 68.48)\n\n\n\nRMP safety information requirements include compiling written information concerning equipment and processes.  Compiled information must address:\n\n\n\n    Safety Data Sheets (SDS)\n\n    Maximum inventory\n\n    Storage and Process limits\n\n    Equipment Specifications\n\n    Codes and Standards\n\n\n\nTRANSFLO maintains a current MSDS for LPG products in the in the terminal managers office and in the terminal Hazard Communication station as required for 29 CFR 1910.1200.   Maximum inventory is limited to the capacity of a single rail tank care.   There is no fixed storage of LPG at the terminal.\n\n\n\nThe transfer unit is supplied by Superior Energy Services, Inc. of Berea, OH.  All replacement equipment is supplied by SES, Inc.   The transfer unit was designed and constructed to meet the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA Liquefied Petroleum Gas Code- NFPA 58- 2004 and 2008 edition.    Copies of the transfer unit equipment specifications, a process flow diagram and other technical information are maintained on the TRANSFLO Intranet portal for terminal and employee use. \n\n\n\nThis process is also subject to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals (PSM).   Process Safety Information for the transfer operation, equipment and products is maintained as per the requirements of 1910.119\n\n \n\n3.2    Process Hazard Analysis- PHA (40 CFR 68.50)\n\n\n\nAn initial hazard review was conducted on the transfer process and equipment by TRANSFLO personnel, the equipment supplier and outside safety professional consultants during the normal TRANSFLO new business development process. The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) using a What If/Checklist as recommended using EPA A?Risk Management Plan Guidance for Propane Storage FacilitiesA? was conducted on October 6, 2008 at the Toledo, OH terminal.  Attending were Greg Rhoads, CSP (PHA team leader); Bill Young, SES Inc. (equipment designer and NFPA 58 expert); John Thomas, SES Inc. (equipment technician); and Jeff Bechtel, TRANSFLO REM and LPG unit operator and maintenance technician. \n\n\n\nA Process Hazard Analysis was conducted on October 7th, 2008.  Process Safety Information (PSI) developed for this process was reviewed by a team familiar with the operation. The PSI and PSA documentation is maintained electronically on the Transflo Intranet. The Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) was conducted on December 10th, 2008 by TRANSFLO HS&E staff and a HS&E consultant, GR&A Inc, familiar with PSSR requirements and the process safety information.\n\nTransfer Employee Training was also conducted at this time.\n\n\n\nA comprehensive PHA Revalidation Study was conducted in October 2014 by TRANSFLO and involved operations, engineering and safety personnel and used a Failure mode Effects Analysis (FMEA) method to assess the process .  the FMEA included sitting review, deviation from operating procedures and human factors.  The PHA was reviewed with terminal personnel.  All findings from that PHA have been completed.\n\n\n\nTo prevent / control the catastrophic release of LPG, the following controls are integrated into the transfer process:\n\n\n\na.    Railcar-\n\n    Double shelf couplers (to prevent tank punctures during car handling)\n\n    9/16\" tank shell and 11/16\" tank heads\n\n    Enclosed valves and fittings in a protective dome.\n\n    Safety relief valve for tank car. \n\n\n\n\n\nb.    Terminal Physical Plant\n\n    Bonded and grounded track\n\n    Transfer area marked off during active transfers to limit adjacent traffic \n\n    Lighting in transfer area\n\n        Track protection (blue flags and derails)\n\n\n\n\n\nc.    Transfer Unit\n\n    On board self proving ground system (Sculley)\n\n    Emergency shutoff valves (ESV)  \n\n    Remote electrical shut of capability\n\n    Closed loop vapor recovery system\n\n        Break away hose connections.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3    Operating Procedures (40 CFR 68.52)\n\n\n\nTRANSFLO operating procedures address the steps for each operating phase, operating limits and safety system and their functions.\n\n\n\nSpecific requirements are as follows:\n\n\n\n    Initial start up\n\n    Normal operations\n\n    Temporary Operations\n\n    Emergency Operations\n\n    Normal Shutdown\n\n    Start up following a turnaround or emergency shutdown\n\n    Consequences of deviations\n\n    Equipment inspections\n\n\n\nTransfer process work instructions were developed for this unit and are used as the basis for training employees who will be operating the system.  These procedures will be maintained at the terminal office and will be used for employee evaluation and audit purposes. \n\n\n\nIn addition to the transfer work instruction, the terminal operator follows established TRANSFLO procedures for the inspection of inbound railcars, inbound cargo trailers and general health, safety and environmental procedures.  \n\n\n\n3.4    Training    (40 CFR 68.54)\n\n\n\nAs required under 40 CFR 68.54, training requirements for new operators at TRANSFLO include training on operating procedures and must cover health and safety hazards, emergency operations, and safe work practices applicable to the employee normal job or function.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years.  The facility also determines that each operator has received and understands the training requirements and keeps a record of complete training for each employee with the date of the training and the method used to verify that the employee understand the subject matter.\n\n\n\nThe training program includes classroom and on job instruction with emphasis on safety and health hazards and emergency response procedures.  These materials are maintained in the terminal managers office.  Verification that the operators understand the materials is accomplished through written tests, verbal questioning and hands-on demonstrations.  More detailed training documentation and information is given in Attachment 3-4.\n\n\n\n3.5    Mechanical Integrity /Maintenance  (40 CFR 68.56)\n\n\n\nAs required by the regulations, TRANSFLO implements a maintenance program that includes the preventative maintenance, inspection and testing of the LPG transfer unit.

All liquid hoses were replaced with LPG service hoses. \n\n\n\n3.6    Pre-Start Up Safety Review (PSSR)\n\n\n\nA Pre-start Up Safety Review was be conducted prior to the start of LPG operations, with the terminal operators, management and TRANFLO field personnel.  The PSSR included the following subjects:\n\n\n\n    Review of the MSDS and hazards for propane\n\n    Training on the work Instructions for transfer of propane \n\n    LPG railcar and truck fittings and design\n\n    Review of terminal EAP and emergency action for a propane release\n\n    Transfer unit inspection and maintenance procedures\n\n    Management of change requirements and process\n\n\n\nThe Process Safety Information was reviewed and the location of this information discussed. \n\n\n\n\n\n3.7    Management of Change\n\n\n\nNo changes to the transfer unit equipment or configuration will be allowed without approval by the Director of Operations and the Director of HS&E using the attached form.  Replacement in kind for worn or damaged equipment such as hoses, swivels, sight glass, electrical components or nitrogen hoses is permitted without MOC form submittal.\n\n\n\nThe latest Work Instructions which, document the transfer procedures and sequence, are available to all affected persons but cannot be changed without following the MOC process using the attached form.  Any changes to the Work Instructions must be approved by both the Director of Operations and the Director of HS&E.   Approval of any WI changes will be communicated to the terminal management, Asset Manager, Operations Manager and HS&E Document Control file.  Once approved, the HS&E department will make any changes. \n\n\n\nThese requirements were discussed in the PSSR with affected parties. \n\n\n\n3.8    Compliance Audits (40 CFR 68.58)\n\n\n\nTRANSFLO is required to conduct compliance audits at least every 3 years from the date of RMP submission.  The audit must include an evaluation of the design and effectiveness of risk management program elements and a field inspection of the safety and health conditions and practices to verify that systems are effectively implemented and operational.  The compliance audits will be conducted by at least one person knowledgeable in the LPG products transfer process.  TRANSFLO will comply with the following document requirements:\n\n\n\n    The employer must certify the compliance audits\n\n    A written report of the findings of the audit shall be developed.\n\n    The employer shall promptly determine and document an appropriate response to each of the findings of the audit.\n\n    The employers shall document that any deficiencies have been corrected.\n\n    The employer shall retain the most recent compliance audits reports.\n\n    The compliance audits shall be made available to employees and their designated representatives.\n\n\n\nAs required, TRANSFLO will undergo an audit every 3 years.  In addition to the scheduled RMP specific audit, TRANSFLO has an active terminal operation audit system that includes a review the following:\n\n\n\n    Terminal HS&E regulatory compliance\n\n    Terminal employee training\n\n    Transfer operations including compliance with Work Instructions, procedures and polices\n\n    Terminal physical plant maintenance and documentation\n\n    Transfer equipment inspection, maintenance and documentation.\n\n\n\nTRANSFLO Operations and HS&E personnel conduct these audits.  The Director of Operations reviews the results of these audits and items of nonconformance are the responsibility of the Operations Manger and the contract operator for correction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.9    Incident Investigation  (40 CFR 68.60)\n\n\n\nIncident investigation is the process of identifying the underlying causes of incidents and implementing steps to prevent similar events from occurring.  The RMP requires the investigation of each incident that resulted in, or could reasonable have resulted in a catastrophic release of regulated substance, employee injury or off site impact.\n\n\n\nThe specific requirements of the incident investigation are as follows:\n\n\n\n    Initiate an investigation promptly, no later than 48 hours after the incident.\n\n    Establish an investigation team with at least one team member knowledgeable in the transfer process.\n\n    Summarize the investigation in a report, including:\n\n             Date of incident\n\n            Date investigation begin\n\n             Description of the incident\n\n            Factors contributing to the incident\n\n                Root cause of the incident\n\n             Any recommendations to prevent future incidents\n\n\n\nAddress and resolve the team's finding and recommendations\n\n    Document resolutions and corrective actions\n\n    Review the report with affected personnel and contactors where applicable\n\n    Retain the report for five years.\n\n\n\nTRANSFLO has established incident investigation procedures for the LPG transfer process as follows:\n\n\n\n1.    The facility maintains an updated comprehensive Emergency Action pan (EAP) for injuries, spills, fires and other credible terminal threats.  All employees are trained on the  \n\n        activation of the EAP and their roles.  An annual response exercise is held and includes an invitation to the local fire department to attend using the EAP.\n\n2.    All product releases are reported following the incident reporting procedures list in the EAP.\n\n3.    Upon completion of the emergency phase of the incident, a formalized incident investigation process is initiated using the documented investigation process.\n\n\n\nTRANSFLO holds an incident review conference call or on-site investigation meeting within 5 days of any spill or incident with employee injury, evacuation or off site consequence.

The TTSI terminal provides transloading services of bulk products between rail and truck transportation modes.  The North Haven TRANSFLO terminal has been in operation since 1990.  The terminal is located at 110 Universal Drive, North Haven, CT.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\n\n\nTRANSFLO is committed to protecting the health and safety of its employees, contract operators, the surrounding community and the environment; therefore it is TRANSFLO policy to maintain compliance with 40 CFR 68.\n\n\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe TRANSFLO North Haven operations involve two covered process which are separate and unique from one another.  Both process involve the transfer of bulk chemical products from a rail car to a highway cargo container but each uses specialized non-inter changible equipment. \n\n\n\nEach process is for transloading product from railroad tank cars into highway cargo trailers in quantities in excess of 8,000 gallons per cargo trailer which will exceed the 10,000 pound threshold quantity listed in 40 CFR 68, Appendix A.\n\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\n\n\nAs required by 40 CFR 68 Subpart B, TRANSFLO has evaluated a worst-case release scenario for LPG and TDI products using the parameters specified by the EPA.  TRANSFLO's worst-case release scenario is the rupture of a single railroad tank car with subsequent product release over a 10-minute period.  In developing the release parameters of the worst-case scenario, TRANSFLO has not considered any passive mitigation measures.  Using the EPA's RMP*Comp software program, it "

The worst-case release scenario was developed following EPA regulations and is considered to have an extremely low probability of occurrence.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\n\n\nTRANSFLO also evaluated several other release scenarios considered to have a higher level probability of occurrence (although a very low probability) based upon a review of over 10 years of incident data from chemical transloading operations.  This 10 year period included the safe handling of over 500,000 rail to truck chemical transloads.  After a careful review of both the worst-case and alternative release scenarios, TRANSFLO has decided to include one alternative release scenario into the RMP document.  \n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario identified by TRANSFLO is the failure of a product transfer hose.  In developing the parameters of Alternative Release Scenario 1, TRANSFLO considered the average response time of terminal personnel to control the release and safely shut the transfer unit down.   Using the EPA RMP*Comp software program and EPA's RMP offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance Document, the distance to the flammable endpoint in the alternative release scenario has the potential to result in minor site consequences at a distance much less than the worst-case scenario and would largely be limited to terminal property itself.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nTo prevent and mitigate accidental releases of covered process chemicals, TRANSFLO has implemented several precautionary measures:\n\n\n\n    TRANSFLO has developed standard operating procedures (SOP'S) for the Transloading of these products from railcar to highway cargo tank for use by trained and qualified personnel.\n\n    TRANSFLO encourages contract operator employees to voice concerns, offer suggestions and contribute to procedures, policies and processes involving this product.
