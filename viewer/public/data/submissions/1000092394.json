A primary aspect of this commitment is the City of Faribault Water Treatment Plant to help ensure the safe operation of the water chlorination process.  Our commitment is also demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process, as well as, extensive training of our operating personnel. \n\n\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the City of Faribault Water Treatment Plant has procedures that are designed to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for our employees and will help prevent injury to the public and the environment.  The City of Faribault Water Treatment Plant's emergency response personnel receive thorough training in handling accidental releases.  An emergency response coordinator has been assigned to oversee response activities and to coordinate response efforts with local emergency agencies.  Communications with the Local Emergency Management Agency have been ongoing throughout the preparation of this plan and policies.\n\n\n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, the City of Faribault Water Treatment Plant established a management system headed by the Water Quality Supervisor to ensure the proper implementation and effectiveness of our Risk Management Program.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.0  City of Faribault Water Treatment Plant and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe City of Faribault, Minnesota serves more than 21,100 customers with an average demand of 3.1 MGD and a peak water demand of 7.0 MGD.  The City obtains all its water supply from five wells and it is pumped to a one million gallon low-level reservoir.  The raw water entering "

Chemicals added include chlorine gas, ammonia, hydrofluosilicic acid and polyphosphate.  All chemicals are housed in the high service pump building.  Water from the low level reservoir is pumped into the distribution system by four (4) high service pumps.\n\nThe Facility and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThis is a local government owned and operated facility for the production of potable water for the City of Faribault. The only reportable regulated substance for the RMP plan is chlorine. No more than two tons of chlorine is stored at this facility in ton cylinders. Normally only one cylinder is online at one time. The online tanks are on isolated regulators that reduce the chlorine pressure to 26.6 PSI. Chlorine feed equipment supplies a vacuum to the tanks allowing the release of chlorine to the feeders. The tanks are shut off with a manual valve and all residual chlorine is evacuated from the lines when the plant is off. No flammable substances or other restricted items are stored in the chlorine tank rooms. The room has a chlorine detector connected to an alarm panel, and autodialer. All unacknowledged alarms initiate the autodialer, which calls all on duty and off duty personnel till acknowledged. If the alarm is acknowledged and the condition exists after an hour it again starts calling operators out. All alarms and autodialers are on back up battery power supply.\n\n\n\nProcess Description: Chlorination\n\nProgram Level: 3\n\nRegulated Substance: Chlorine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.0  Hazard Assessment Results\n\n\n\nThe City of Faribault Water Treatment Plant performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential impacts of accidental releases of the Chlorine from our process.

The alternative release scenario represents a more realistic potential for occurrence and is based on historical data from our process or other similar processes.  By identifying these potential releases, the City of Faribault Water Treatment Plant has developed an extensive program to prevent such an occurrence.  This program is discussed in detail in the Prevention Program section of this plan.\n\nThe primary objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public and/or the environment as a result of an accidental release.  This point is called the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances farther than the endpoint, the effects would be less.\n\n\n\n3.1  Hazard Assessment - Toxic Substances\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with Regulated Toxic Substances is a failure of a full, one ton (2000 lb) cylinder of liquid chlorine.  A toxic cloud formed by the evaporating chlorine would reach offsite endpoints and public receptors.\n\n\n\nAn alternative release scenario (ARS) for chlorine releases is a release from a vessel leak.  The modeled release lasted for 30 minutes before it is stopped.  A toxic cloud formed by the evaporating chlorine would reach offsite endpoints and public receptors.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.0  Accidental Release Prevention Program - Program 3\n\n\n\nThe City of Faribault Water Treatment Plant Chlorination Process is covered by the OSHA Process Safety Management standard.  The requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management standard are nearly identical to the RMP Rule Program 3 Prevention Program requirements.

Within this program, the Chlorination Process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nTo perform the PHAs, City of Faribault Water Treatment Plant primarily uses the \"What-if/Checklist\" technique.  The PHAs are conducted using a team of people with experience in engineering and Chlorination Process operation and a leader with experience in process hazard analysis techniques. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and/or mitigation measures, when appropriate.  The team then prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations ranked according to relative risk ratings assigned by the team.  Responsibility to resolve the recommendations is assigned to the EHS Committee and is tracked through completion.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the City of Faribault Water Treatment Plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.
