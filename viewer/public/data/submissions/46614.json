The brewery complies with these regulations, as well as others, to ensure that the risks involved in handling, use and storage of ammonia and other potentially hazardous chemicals are minimized. Our corporate environmental, health, and safety (EHS) policy and requirements promote overall facility, employee, and public safety. In support of this policy, process risk reduction programs provide assurance for the safe management of process risks to prevent environmental, health and safety incidents and to protect the workplace, the community and the environment. These programs enable the brewery to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of ammonia.\n\nIt is Anheuser-Busch's policy to conduct our business in accordance with all applicable EHS laws, regulations and permits and to promote a healthful, safe and protected environment.  Each employee is mandated to comply strictly with this policy; neither production goals nor financial objectives shall excuse noncompliance.\n\nAlso, it is Anheuser-Busch's policy to assume a position of leadership in EHS management.  We are committed to the spirit as well as the letter of our EHS policy and promote, throughout the organization, responsibility and accountability for strict compliance with that policy.  Anheuser-Busch employees whose actions in the performance of their duties may affect the environment and/or public health are trained sufficiently to permit them to comply strictly with our EHS policy.\n\nIn conducting our businesses, we continue to seek and implement cost effective methods to reduce the EHS impact of our operations.

We maintain dialogue with relevant authorities and local communities concerning EHS incident prevention and preparedness.\n\nLos Angeles Brewery facility recently decided to replace two old cellars and upgrade the beer processing equipment. It was also decided to build a new cellar and install new beer processing tanks in the new cellar building (SH8). The cellar building required a cooling system and anhydrous ammonia from the existing Los Angeles Brewery facility is being used for this cooling system. The cooling system in the cellar building and other modifications made at the Los Angeles Brewery are now in operation. The ammonia charge was initiated in SH8, on March 25, 2006, and the ammonia system was fully charged and operational on April 4, 2006. \n\nFederal RMP regulations require that the owner or operator of a stationary source shall revise and update the RMP within six months of a change that requires a revised process hazard analysis. In addition, California RMP regulations require that the owner or operator shall revise and update the RMP within 60 days from the date of the modification (start-up) if the modification may result in the significant increase in the risk of handling a regulated substance as compared to the amount of risk identified in the stationary source RMP. Anheuser Busch, Inc. prepared and submitted the RMP for the Los Angeles Brewery facility (anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system prior to the modification) in June 2004.  This RMP is the update of the 2004 RMP. \nAmmonia System\n\nAmmonia is used in the refrigeration system of the brewery.  As part of the brewing process, the beer is cooled to ensure its consiste"

To ensure our beers maintain the many positive qualities that cold brewing imparts, we refrigerate our beers as part of the production process.  The beer packaged in kegs also is stored in a refrigerated area in our facility until it's shipped.   Due to the hazards of ammonia, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in order to prevent unnecessary human and environmental exposure, both within the brewery and the surrounding community.\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe brewery has a comprehensive prevention program in place.  This program includes the following elements:\n\n*  Process hazard analysis and review, including corrective action follow-up requirements;\n*  Standard operating procedures for the system that all operators must follow;\n*  Formal operator training;\n*  Preventative maintenance to ensure mechanical integrity (inspection, testing, repair);\n*  Procedures to ensure proper management of changes to the system;\n*  Safety review prior to startup of new or modified equipment; \n*  Audits of the PSM and RMP programs;\n*  Incident investigations;\n*  Employee involvement in risk reduction programs;\n*  Contractor safety procedures;\n*  Hot work permit requirements;\n*  Process safety information; and\n*  Emergency planning and response.\n\nThe brewery additionally complies with the requirements of the OSHA PSM standard (40 CFR 1910.119), the EPA RMP rules (40 CFR 68), and the ANSI/IIAR 2-1992 standard for Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigerating Systems.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe brewery has had no releases that have caused offsite injuries, deaths, or property or environmental damage.  In fact, the brewery has never had releases with these impacts since it began operation in 1954. \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe brewery's emergency response program is based on OSHA's requirements for emergency action plans (29 CFR 1910.38) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120).

Local agencies determine if the public needs to be notified. If it is determined that the public needs to be notified, the local agencies perform the notification task.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nABI's Los Angeles Brewery ammonia refrigeration system is periodically modified to improve safety.  In 1998, the ammonia refrigeration pressure relief valves were all inspected and upgraded, when necessary. A PHA was performed on January 30, 2006 for the facility modification (Stockhouse Number 8).  A few additional changes were recommended by the process hazard analysis (PHA) team to further improve the safety of the Stockhouse Number 8.  All of these recommendations have been implemented."
