              "Description": "Safety, health, and environmental responsibilities must be managed by line management as they manage their other responsibilities including production, quality, cost, and personnel relations. The same basic management techniques are used to manage safety, health, and environmental requirements as for production and quality management. These include planning, organizing, leading, and controlling assigned responsibilities.\n\nResponsibility for protecting people, property, and the environment begins with the ranking facility manager and extends through all levels of the line management organization including employees. Each person in the line organization from the ranking manager to the employees has specific safety, health, and environmental responsibilities that they cannot delegate to others. They must effectively discharge their personal responsibility for protecting people, property, and the environment to achieve a safe and healthful working environment.\n\nOne important part of the City of Blytheville safety and health program involves the prevention of unwanted releases of hazardous chemicals into locations which could expose employees and others to serious hazards as well as the environment and people in the surrounding community.\n\nThis Risk Management Program (RMP) describes the management system for protecting people, property, and the environment from catastrophic releases of hazardous substances in the workplace. This is accomplished by systematically evaluating the process using approaches to assess the effectiveness of the process design, technology, operations, maintenance, non-routine activities, procedures, emergency preparedness, training, and other process elements. These are described in more detail throughout this RMP Prevention Program.\n\nThis RMP Prevention Program complies with EPA standard 40 CFR 68, Risk Management Program.\n\n",
