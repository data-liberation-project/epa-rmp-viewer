THE FACILITY POLICY\n\nTHE OWNERS, MANAGEMENT, AND EMPLOYEES OF CHANDLER COOP ARE \nCOMMITTED TO THE PREVENTION OF ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS\nAMMONIA. IF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY \nIS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT, OR OTHER AUTHORITIES,\nTO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE TO PEOPLE AND\nTHE ENVIRONMENT.\n\n2. FACILITY INFORMATION\n\nTHE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THE FACILITY IS THE STORAGE AND BLENDING OF FERTILIZERS\nFOR SALE TO FARMERS, AND AMMONIA SALES AND DELIVERY.\n\nANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECEIVED, STORED AND DISTRIBUTED FOR DIRECT APPLICATION.\nANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS USED FOR CROP PRODUCTION NUTRIENTS.\n\nTHE MAXIMUM QUANTITY OF AMMONIA STORED WOULD BE 130,000 POUNDS IN OUR 18,000\nGALLON TANK, 30,000 GALLON TANK, AND ROLLING TANKS. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY HANDLED\nWOULD BE THE UNLOADING OF A TANK TRUCK HOLDING 40,000 POUNDS.\n\n3. THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\n\nA. THE WORST-CASE RLEASE SCENARIO FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA WOULD BE THE RELEASE\nOF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF A STORAGE TANK RELEASED AS A GAS OVER TEN MINUTES.\nTHE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 130,000 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME\nOF THE STORAGE TANK AT 85 PERCENT CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS. THE DISTANCE\nTO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS 1.12 MILES.\n\nB. THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA BASED ON THE HAZARD\nREVIEW IS A 2 MINUTE RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A 3 INCH PIPE. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT\n(POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS .78 MILES.\n\n4. THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nTHE FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STORAGE\nAND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA, K-61.1, PUBLISHED BY THE AME"
