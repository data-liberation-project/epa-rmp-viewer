It was conclusively determined that the RMP regulations did apply since the facility had received several RMP regulated chemicals since August 19, 1996 in quantities that exceeded the threshold levels.  The facility manages hazardous waste derived fuels which are inherently heterogeneous in nature.  The facility has decided to prepare and submit a RMP Plan to maintain future operational flexibility.\n\nToxic chemical Vinyl Acetate and Flammable chemicals Isopentane, Isoprene, Pentane and Propane were selected to be addressed in the RMP Plan preparation based on applicability determination and historical information from similar facilities under the ownership of the parent company.  The process involved at the facility includes handling, storage and blending in tanks and transfers from containers such as tank trucks and rail cars.  The facility was not eligible for Prevention Program Level 1 since screening level modeling, using highly conservative assumptions showed the potential for offsite consequences owing to the proximity to other industrial sites and offices.  The facility is not covered by the OSHA PSM regulations or one of the nine designated SIC Codes and thus excluded from Prevention Program Level 3.  Consequently, the facility was deemed to be under Prevention Program Level 2.\n\nModeling results from worst case release scenarios using highly conservative assumptions, such as a full tank of 39,000 USG of pure chemical spill within secondary containment, provided a toxic endpoint distance of 1.1 mile for Vinyl Acetate and 0.48 mile distance to 1 psi overpressure vapor cloud explosion for the flammable chemical, Isoprene.

A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was conducted on May 07, 1999.  The facility meets or exceeds the Prevention Program Level 2 requirements for Safety Information, Hazard Review, Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Compliance Audits and Incident Investigation.\n\nThe facility is regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act as a commercial hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal facility.  The existing Contingency Plan meets and exceeds the RMP regulatory requirements for the written Emergency Plan.  Local emergency planning agencies have been cognizant of the facility activities, reviewed the Contingency Plan and agreed in writing to provide assistance in the event of an emergency."
