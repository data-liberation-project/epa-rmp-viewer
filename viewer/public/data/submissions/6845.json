      "SummaryText": "The Municipal Sanitary Authority of the City of New Kensington sewage treatment plant is designed  to treat an average of 6.0 MGD.  Wastewater treatment processes include chlorination for disinfection purposes.  Chlorine usage ranges from 25-120 pounds per day depending on flow conditions. The maximum amount  of chlorine maintained at the site is 8,000 pounds.  A total of four full cylinders of chlorine may be onsite.   A worst case release scenario for the facility involves the rupture of a 2,000 pound cylinder releasing chlorine to the atmosphere.  Results of ALOHA air modeling indicate offsite receptors within a 2.5 mile radius may be affected by a worst case release.  An alternate release scenario involves a broken valve on the cylinder which may result in offsite receptors within a 0.2 mile radius being affected by a release.  The facility has a risk management policy that requires at least two employees to be present during all chlorine handling procedures including delivery of chlorine cylinders and exchanging of chlorine cylinders at the feed system.  All equipment associated with the chlorination feed system is inspected daily by employees.  The  facility has an Offsite Response Plan prepared in conjunction with the Westmoreland  County LEPC.  There have been no reportable accidents involving chlorine at the facility.  Changes planned to improve safety at the  facility include implementation of this Risk Management Plan."
