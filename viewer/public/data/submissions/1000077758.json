Given the quantity handled, anhydrous ammonia is considered a hazardous substance by EPA. Many of the properties that make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also requires that precautions and procedures be in place to protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical emergency.  It is the policy of Umpqua Dairy to be in compliance with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.\r\n\r\nSafety at our facility is inherent on the manner in which anhydrous ammonia is handled.  While the design of the facility incorporates a multitude of safety devices, safe handling procedures combined with appropriate training of our personnel are key aspects to maintaining safety at our facility.\r\n\r\nWe have a written Process Safety Management (PSM) plan that complies with the regulations stipulated by OAR 1910.119.  A crucial component of this plan is the Emergency Response Plan, developed in compliance with the Emergency Response provisions of OAR 1910.120.  The Emergency Response Plan includes preemergency planning and coordinating with outside parties.  This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events.\r\n\r\n1.20 Facility Description And Substances Handled\r\n\r\nUmpqua Dairy is a manufacturing facility that processes milk, ice-cream, and other dairy products.  Production requires the use of a refrigeration system to preserve the integrity of our products.  This refrigeration process uses ammonia as a refrigerant.  Access to the facility is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, and contractors.\r\n\r\nThe regulated substance handled at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system maximum inventory is 12,558 pounds of anhydrous amm"

Offsite receptors were defined using ESRI ArcMap 10.1 in conjunction with Goggle Maps.  This system estimates residential population within the circle defined by the endpoint of the worst-case and alternative release scenarios. \r\n\r\n1.40 General Accidental Release Prevention Program And Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nUmpqua Dairy complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. The design and construction of this facility was in accordance with published standards, tests or recommended methods of trade, industry or governmental organizations.\r\n\r\nUmpqua Dairy's written PSM plan incorporates many policies and procedures to ensure safe operation and maintenance of this facility.  Plan elements essential to safe operation of the refrigeration system include employee participation, process hazard information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, contractor safety, pre-startup safety review, mechanical integrity, management of change, hot-work permits, incident investigation, emergency response and planning, and compliance audits.  \r\n\r\nTraining is provided to ensure that each employee involved in operating a process has been trained in an overview of the process, the operating procedures, and safety considerations.  This training uses guidelines developed by the Refrigeration Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA).  Only qualified maintenance personnel operate and interact with the refrigeration system.  This minimizes the chances of inadvertent error in operation that cou"

It complies with the provisions of OR-OSHA Emergency Response regulations, OAR 1910.120.  The Emergency Response Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties.  This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events. This plan has been reviewed with the Roseburg Fire Department and the Oregon State Hazmat Region 1 Team.\r\n\r\nThe approach in the development of this plan has been to identify the ammonia emergencies most likely to occur at Umpqua Dairy and establish precautions and procedures to protect life safety and health during an emergency.  The refrigeration process has back-up prevention systems to keep processing malfunctions from becoming ammonia release emergencies.  If an emergency does occur, the following response personnel, facilities, and equipment are in place:\r\n\r\nEmergency Alarm and Communication System\r\nEvacuation Plans and Assembly Points\r\nPersonal Protective Equipment\r\n\r\nThe role and procedures for obtaining external emergency assistance have been formally established with the Roseburg Fire Department and the Oregon State Hazmat Region 1 Team. \r\n\r\nAll Umpqua Dairy personnel will be trained to fulfill their designated responsibilities in an emergency.  Mock emergency drills will be held periodically to maintain familiarity with response actions and identify plan elements requiring improvement.\r\n\r\nThis plan will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary by the Umpqua Dairy Director of Administrative Services"

Mock emergency drills will be held periodically to maintain familiarity with response actions and identify elements requiring improvement.\r\n\r\nHigh priority items identified in the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) and Priority List of Recommendations are scheduled to be completed by July, 2016.  These recommendations include improving oversight of the ammonia delivery contractor and addressing high-priority recommendations related to the mechanical integrity inspection.  Lower priority items are scheduled for completion by July, 2018.  These items include formalizing mechanical integrity inspections for several components and addressing lower-priority recommendations related to the mechanical integrity inspection."
