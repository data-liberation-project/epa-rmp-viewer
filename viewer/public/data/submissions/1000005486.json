If a contractor is to work in or adjacent to any hazardous chemical, a safety briefing, to make the contractor aware of the plant\u00c2\u00bfs RMP/PSM plan requirements, must be conducted before work begins. \nPre-startup Review\nA pre-startup safety review must be conducted for any new process that uses a regulated substance under RMP, or for significant modifications to the existing chlorine process that necessitate a change in the process safety information.

This plan is referred to as the Risk Management Plan (RMP).\nChlorine is stored in quantities above the regulatory thresholds at which a RMP is required.  This RMP document summarizes our existing safety systems, policies, procedures, and on-going actions that are designed to prevent or minimize impacts of accidental releases of chlorine to the environment. \nThe CHMP has a detailed and comprehensive emergency response plan to handle accidental releases.  In addition, MWW staff was closely involved in the formation of the Fridley Community Awareness and Emergency Response (CAER) unit in 1993.  The group has since expanded to include several surrounding communities and is now referred to as North Metro CAER.  The purpose of CAER is to integrate existing emergency response plans and procedures of local industries and public safety organizations.  The North Metro CAER organization includes the Columbia Heights Membrane Plant and the Columbia Heights Fire Department.  The organization maintains updated emergency databases, plans drills and special events, develops training programs, and shares information to improve response procedures.  \nThe CHFP has been handling chemicals since 1911.  To date, no chlorine releases causing a safety or health hazard affecting the surrounding community have occurred.  Minor releases that have occurred at the plant have been safely remedied using existing emergency response procedures and techniques.  \nUnderstanding the Chemicals Used at the Columbia Heights Membrane Plant\nThe Columbia Heights facility, operating since 1911, is located at 4500 Reservoir Blvd. in Columbia Heights, Minnesota.

These conservative assumptions were set by EPA to ensure public notification and ensure that local emergency response planning takes into account the greatest possible impacted area surrounding the release point.\nThe scenario used for chlorine at the CHMP is the rupture of a 1-ton container, resulting in a release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine over a 10-minute duration.  Building mitigation is applied to this scenario because the 1-ton containers are stored in an enclosed building. The hazard assessment requires that the \u00c2\u00bftoxic endpoint\u00c2\u00bf or distance from the point of release to a location at which the chemical concentration equals or exceeds a certain concentration must be determined. The distance to the toxic endpoint was estimated using the EPA-designed RMP*comp software. That concentration is defined as the maximum airborne concentration below which individuals could be exposed for up to 1 hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects, or symptoms that could impair an individual\u00c2\u00bfs ability to take protective action. \nIn practice this type of total release of a bulk tank would be unlikely and probably never occur during the lifetime of the plant. The results of the dispersion modeling analysis for the chlorine worst-case release scenario indicate that the release extends to a 0.9-mile radius. \nAlternative Scenario\nThe RMP rule also requires that at least one alternative release scenario be evaluated for chlorine. The alternative scenario reflects a type of release that is more likely to occur compared to the worst-case scenario. Unlike the worst-case scenario, the alternative release scenario may consider \u00c2\u00bfactive\u00c2\u00bf mitigation such as shutoff valves and a more realistic release quantity and release rate.

The scenario for chlorine assumes that a full 1-ton chlorine container is damaged during container loading or unloading, resulting in a leak.  The scenario does not consider building mitigation since the storage room doors are open during loading and unloading.  Under this scenario, chlorine would be released at an estimated rate of 154 lb/min. The same modeling approach was used as for the worst-case release scenario, except meteorological conditions were adjusted to more likely local conditions.  \nThe results of the dispersion modeling analysis for the chlorine an alternative case release scenario indicates that the release extends to a 0.2 mile radius. \nPrevention Program\nThe Prevention Program consists of 12 elements designed to improve the system safety and decrease the likelihood of a release.\nEmployee Participation \nThe participation of the MWW staff in preparing the RMP/PSM program was critical to the program\u00c2\u00bfs successful implementation. Employee participation is valuable because it increases the safety awareness of the staff and it allows the staff\u00c2\u00bfs experience in operating and maintaining the processes to be incorporated into the plan.\nPlant staff participated in the development of the Prevention Program through a series of meetings and workshops.

The MWW treats an average of approximately 70 million gallons of water per day from all of their treatment plants.  The CHMP has a chlorination system that uses chlorine gas fed from liquid chlorine storage containers. \nChlorine is delivered to the plant in 1-ton containers by a chemical supplier.  Gaseous chlorine is withdrawn directly from the 1-ton containers and delivered to the disinfection process. The CHMP uses state-of-the-art equipment to maximize the safety for plant staff and the community at large.  Some of the specific features are as follows.  Chlorine leak detectors continuously monitor for leaks in the bulk storage areas and in the chlorine process areas.  Leak alarms activate an audible alarm throughout the plant and the alarms sound at the central and local control panels. \nTo further improve safety an automatic cylinder valve closure system is provided for each on-line container that automatically closes if chlorine is detected in the room.  \nThe 1-ton container chlorine storage room is enclosed in a building.  The building is equipped with an emergency ventilation system that activates a scrubber when chlorine is detected in the room.  The scrubber neutralizes the chlorine gas and discharges treated air to the atmosphere.  The scrubber is sized to treat the entire contents of two 1-ton chlorine containers. \nThe chlorine feed room is enclosed in a building and the process area is equipped with a ventilation system.  The process area includes an automatic ventilation system that operates when the chlorine leak detector de"

Access control systems are in place for both the plant grounds and the plant buildings.\nRMP Requirements\nThe RMP consists of three major parts. The first part is the Hazard Assessment. The Hazard Assessment is done to determine the potential effects that a release of a regulated substance could have on the public surrounding the facility. The second part is a Prevention Program that consists of 12 elements designed to improve the system safety and decrease the likelihood of a release. The third part is the Emergency Response Program, which develops a plan for dealing with a release in the unlikely event that one would occur. Because the regulations are very similar, the Prevention Program and the Emergency Response Program also serve as the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) plan, and this document is therefore is referred to as the RMP/PSM plan.\nHazard Assessment\nFor the Hazard Assessment, the distance a set endpoint concentration of chlorine gas would travel was determined. In addition, an estimate of the population that could be affected by a release of chlorine was determined, and sensitive receptors were identified. The Hazard Assessment considers two release scenarios\u00c2\u00bfa \u00c2\u00bfworst case\u00c2\u00bf and an \u00c2\u00bfalternative case.\u00c2\u00bf \nWorst-Case Scenario\nThe regulations require the development of a worst-case release scenario based on conservative assumptions. For example, the CHMP is required to assume that the entire contents of the largest single container of chlorine will be released in 10 minutes. In addition, only \u00c2\u00bfpassive\u00c2\u00bf mitigation methods such as buildings or dikes can be considered when determining the distance the release could travel. Passive mitigation, as defined, requires no mechanical, electrical, or human input. However, in many scenarios mitigating the release by isolating the process could reduce the amount released. In addition, the"

The information meets and in many cases exceeds the minimum required by the regulations.\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nA process hazard analysis (PHA) was conducted systematically to evaluate potential causes and consequences of accidental releases. This information was used by CHMP staff to improve safety and reduce the likelihood and potential consequences of an accidental release. Equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions, and external factors that might affect the process were the focus of the PHAs that were performed for the chlorine process.\nThe chlorine PHA was conducted by an experienced consultant with chlorine process operation and maintenance. The PHA was done using a combination of \u00c2\u00bfWhat-If\u00c2\u00bf and \u00c2\u00bfChecklist\u00c2\u00bf methods.  Based on the results of the PHA, recommendations for operating, maintenance, and other process safety management procedures that would improve the overall safety of the plant were identified.  Several changes have been adopted by the plant and incorporated as part of the overall RMP/PSM program.  \nOperating Procedures\nOperating procedures for the chlorine process has been developed as part of the RPM/PSM plan. Written operating procedures assure continuous, efficient, and safe operation of the facility. The goal of the operating procedures is to provide clear instructions to safely operate the process. Operating procedures are also used to train new employees and to provide refresher training for existing staff.\nTraining\nAn effective RMP/PSM training program can significantly reduce the potential for accidental release incidents. Employees involved in operating or maintaining the chlorine process must receive training that includes applicable operating and maintenance procedures and an overview of the process. Training must emphasize safety and health hazards and safe work practices.\nCHMP staff receives initia"

The mechanical integrity program also addresses equipment testing and inspection, preventative maintenance schedules, and personnel training. The intent is to ensure that equipment used to process, store, or handle chlorine is maintained and installed to minimize the risk of releases.\nThe CHMP maintenance staff schedule preventative maintenance (PM), provide safety procedures for work orders, and maintain an inventory of parts and materials. In addition to preventative maintenance, the plant staff performs corrective maintenance in the event of equipment malfunction or breakdown. The staff that perform maintenance tasks are all trained as part of the RMP/PSM program.\nHot Works Permits\nRMP/PSM regulations require employees and contractors to employ safe work practices when performing \u00c2\u00bfhot work\u00c2\u00bf in, on, or around the chlorine process. To ensure that hot work is done safely, a Hot Work Permit Program has been developed that requires a permit to be issued before hot work is performed. Hot work is defined as the use of oxyacetylene torches, welding equipment, grinders, cutting, brazing, or similar flame- or spark-producing operations.\nThe process of completing the hot work permit makes it necessary to identify the hazard, recognize what safeguards are appropriate, and then initiate the safeguards necessary to ensure a fire-safe workplace.

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\nIntroduction \nChemicals are widely used in industry, in the home, and in the environment.  They are transported on roads, water, and railways.  The Minneapolis Water Works\u00c2\u00bf (MWW) Columbia Heights Membrane Plant (CHMP) stores chemicals that are used in daily operations. The CHMP facility currently uses chlorine stored in up to twenty-four connected 1-ton containers. In addition to the twenty-four connected cylinders, space for up to twenty-four more reserve containers is available.  Chlorine is used to disinfect treated water prior to distribution to customers in Minneapolis and surrounding communities.  The natural world contains more that 1,500 chlorine-containing compounds.  Chlorine is also used to disinfect wastewater, disinfect our swimming pools and protect human health through the destruction of disease-causing organisms. The World Health Organization estimates that 25,000 children who die daily could be saved through the use of an effective water disinfection agent such as chlorine.\nChlorine is non-explosive and non-flammable. However, it can support combustion under some circumstances.  Chlorine is a respiratory irritant, and exposure through inhalation or eye or skin contact can pose a health risk.  As a precaution, the CHMP has special safety systems that are an integral part of the chlorine systems.\nWe take our safety obligations in storing and using chemicals as seriously as we take providing the community with treated water.  The following document describes the steps we take everyday to ensure a safely operating plant, what could happen if there was an accidental release of a chemical stored on site, and what to do in the event of an emergency.  \nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThis document complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program, codified under Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990, 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68."
