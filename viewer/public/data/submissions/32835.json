We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n *  A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n *  An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n *  A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n *  An overview of our emergency response program\n *  An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nOur facility produces aluminum using a variety of chemicals and processing operations.  An integral part of our aluminum processing is demagging. Demagging is one of the very few techniques for refining aluminum.  Demagging allows the removal of magnesium from the molten bath by treating the bath with either a fluoride salt or chlorine.  Demagging of aluminum at our facility is accomplished through the injection of chlorine into the molten aluminum.  Other than chlorine, we use no other chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release.\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of this chemical.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PRE"

Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n *  Process safety information\n *  Process hazard analysis\n *  Operating procedures\n *  Training\n *  Mechanical integrity\n *  Management of change\n *  Pre-startup review\n *  Compliance audits\n *  Incident investigation\n *  Employee participation\n *  Hot work permit\n *  Contractors\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented many chemical-specific prevention steps to reduce the risk associated with operating the chlorine process over the past several years.\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThis facility has had one reportable accident in the past five years, with a release of 3 pounds of chlorine.  No one offsite was injured,  nor were any homes or local businesses evacuated.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the community emergency response plan.\n\nOur plan includes:\n\nA stated purpose\nA policy statement \nThe application of the plan\nDisaster or Accident involving Chlorine\nProcedures for securing a Chlorine Gas leak\nDisaster or Accident Involving Fire\nDisaster plan for Tornado or Flood\nAlarm Signals\n\nPLAN"
