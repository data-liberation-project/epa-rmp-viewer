Separated natural gas undergoes a chilling process to strip out NGL liquids which are stored in a single 42,000 gallon pressurized bullet tank. Administrative controls are implemented at the facility which limit the total volumes to 33,000 gallons in the pressurized bullet tank. Separated crude oil/condensate is stored in two 400 barrel  bulk tanks. There are no administrative controls on the stored oil.\n\nThe facility is subject to the RMP requirements since it is a natural gas processing plant producing NGL and contains threshold quantities of regulated substances. \n\nThe NGL and oil products are a mixture of hydrocarbons consisting of methane, ethane, butane, isobutane, propane, pentane, and isopentane.  For purposes of determining the largest weight on site, the highest density substance was used (butane for NGL and pentane for condensate).\n\nThis facility has two applicable worst case release scenarios.  Scenario # 1 involves an explosion and fire from an NGL release from the single largest NGL vessel.  The total vessel size is 42,000 gallons however the facility has elected to use an administrative control to limit the total volume to 33,000 gallons.  Scenario # 2 involves an explosion and fire from a condensate release from the single largest tank.  The total tank volume is 400 barrels.  If the NGL storage tank volume reaches the 33,000 gallon level then all production of NGL will cease until such time that the volume in storage is reduced.\n\nBoth scenarios above yield the same distance to the endpoint which is 0.4 miles.

      "SummaryText": " 3.1 of this RMP shows the calculations used for each scenario.\n\nAn alternative scenario is not required for this facility because it is classified as a Program 1 site.  \n\nSince this facility is a Program 1, a documented prevention program is not required.  The operator is aware of the General Duty Clause in the Louisiana regulations (see Section 1.4 of the \"Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance Program\" document in the front sleeve of this plan) and accidental release prevention is a policy adopted by the operator.\n\nAs documented in Section 4.0 of this plan, the facility has not experienced a release as defined in the regulation within the past five years.  \n\nSince this facility is a Program 1, a written Emergency Response Plan is not required.  Emergency response procedures have been developed and are contained at the front of this plan and these procedures will be implemented in the event of an accidental release or the threat of such a release.\n\nAt present time, there are no planned changes to improve safety."
