HES has completed a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for chemicals stored on-site that could exceed reporting thresholds as a requirement of Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. HES began operations in 2009.  The initial RMP Submittal was completed 4/23/2009.  This RMP resubmission includes natural gasoline (denaturant) as a flammable mixture because it includes isopentane and has an NFPA rating of 4.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nHES is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process. HES uses natural gasoline as a denaturant to make ethanol produced at the facility unfit for human consumption. \r\n\r\nIn the event of a significant emergency, including an accidental release of flammable or toxic materials, it is the policy of HES to notify appropriate authorities and evacuate all employees at the facility.\r\n\r\nFacility and Regulated Substances Handled\r\nAs previously mentioned, HES's ethanol production process requires use of a denaturant (most commonly natural gasoline) to render ethanol produced by the facility unfit for human consumption. The natural gasoline is stored in an aboveground tank as a liquid under atmospheric pressure and is mixed with ethanol prior to transport.  The supply and chemical make-up of denaturant is dependent upon market rates and the source of the natural gasoline, making it difficult for HES to foresee with much certainty the specific chemical makeup of its denaturant. Denaturant used by the ethanol industry commonly contains pentane, isopentane, and/or butane in varying percentages.  HES has chosen to file this RMP based on the SDS for the natural gasoline it currently uses.  \r\n\r\nEmergency response programs for the modeled release scenarios have been prepared and imple"

HES has coordinated emergency response with local authorities and responding agencies and will conduct periodic drills.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\nThrough completion of this RMP and similar efforts regulated by OSHA's Process Safety Management standard at 29 CFR 1910.119, HES has complied with the EPA requirements at 40 CFR Part 68. Process safety information, safe work practices such as Hot Work, Confined Space Entry and Lockout/Tagout, and operations and maintenance procedures are documented on-site. Periodic functions such as process hazard analyses (PHA), training, management of change, pre-startup safety reviews, and incident investigation are conducted on a regular basis. A PHA for a variety of hazardous processes at the facility was conducted in June 2020. Compliance audits of the RMP Prevention Program are conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA and OSHA regulations.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\nHES does not have a history of accidents involving regulated chemicals which may have caused death, injuries, environmental or property damage, evacuations or in-place sheltering.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nHES has developed response efforts to a variety of potential scenarios involving hazardous substances stored and used at the facility. These efforts have been coordinated with state and local responders. HES also participates in meetings and planning with Chickasaw County Emergency Management.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nAs previously mentioned, HES is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process. HES management is committed to promoting a safe work environment. HES will continue to provide its employees with the necessary training, tools, and ongoing support needed to conduct their work safely and to operate the ethanol production process in a safe and efficient manner.
