Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe City of Porterville - Wastewater Treatment Facility handles chlorine which is considered a hazardous material and is a regulated substance under the California Accidental Release Program (CalARP) and is considered in this Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The properties of chlorine make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent human exposure, and to reduce the threat to the facility's workers and nearby members of the community.  It is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State of California rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the safe procedures used to handle chlorine; the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of the pertinent personnel.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe facility is a eight (8) million gallons per day treatment plant for wastewater from domestic and industrial sources.  The plant design has conventional primary treatment which screens coarse materials and removes grit and settleable organic solids.  There is a conventional secondary treatment which removes soluble organic material and additional suspended organic solids.  There is a solids handling system with dissolved flotation thickening of the waste activated sludge, anaerobic digestion of the primary and secondary organic sludges, and final disposal by land application.\n\nThe influent entering aerated grid channels contains large numbers of biological organisms.  Some of these may be pathogenic (disease causing) organisms.  The influent is disinfected to protect the public health by the use of a chlorine solution produced at the plant by mixing chlorine gas and water.  Additional chlorine is added at the secondary clarifiers.  Further chlorine is added at the chlorine contact tank to provide detention time for the chlorine to disinfect the treated wastewater."

      "SummaryText": "\n\nThere is a daily maximum of 20,000 lb of chlorine at the facility.\n\n3a. Administrative Controls\n\nAdministrative control to limit the distances for each reported scenario exists to restrict to a minimum, the amount of chlorine lost from a one ton container if an accidental release were to occur; and preferably to not have a release occur.  This administrative control is inherent in the operational procedures for the chlorine process system and the training provided to the operators of the chlorine process system.\n\n3b. Mitigation Measures\n\nMitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario exist to restrict the amount of chlorine released to a minimum, if a release were to occur; and preferably to not have a release occur.  The mitigation measures are based upon the design, inspection, testing, and maintenance of the chlorine process systems; their related equipment and components; and the treatment system.\n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility complies with all applicable federal and state codes and regulations.  There are safety meetings and safety training.  The Process Safety Management (PSM) program implemented at the facility for the chlorine process system and the related activities and equipment represents the facility's main active commitments to an accidental release prevention program.\n\n5. Five Year Accident History\n\nThere has been no accidental release of chlorine in the last five years.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is based upon alerting personnel at the facility to evacuate the facility and await the arrival of responders from the City of Porterville Fire Department at the evacuation assembly location if a release occurs that causes the evacuation to be initiated.  The Tulare County - Environmental Health can incorporate this response into the County Area Plan for the Regional Local Emergency Planning Committee.\n\n7. Planned Changes To I"

Current applicable codes and regulations are reviewed as part of the PSM to determine if other commitments need to be made to achieve increased operational safety for the regulated chlorine process system.  These commitments will be prevention and mitigation measures for accidental releases of the regulated substance."
