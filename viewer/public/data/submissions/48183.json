Facility Policy:  The owners, management and employees of Vohs & Miller, Inc. located in Holstein, Iowa (the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.  \n\n2. Facility Information:  The primary activity at the site is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to local farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients in one or more storage tanks and numerous nurse tanks which are parked from time-to-time at this site.\n\n3. Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario:  A) The Worst-Case Scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 131,125 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is about 4.4 miles.  B) The Alternate Release Scenario, based on the five-year accident history, or the most likely potential incident, is a release from a break in a 3\" transfer hose followed by release of ammonia for 10 minutes before an automatic or manual shut-off intervenes and stops the flow of ammonia.  The maximum quantity released would be 2,800 pounds.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.1 miles.  \n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program:  The facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of ?Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1? - 1989 edition with amendments, published by The American Nationa"

(ANSI), and the standards of the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, ?Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia?.  The ANSI Standard has been adopted by reference by Iowa Administrative Code (IAC) Part 21?Chapter 43?Rule 43.6(200)-\"Standard for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\"  The OSHA Standard is referenced in the Registration Form Section 8.3.b.\n\n5. Five-Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage.  There have, however, been two incidents where minimal quantities of anhydrous ammonia has been released. One incident occurred in 1999 and the other in 2004. In the 1999 incident, Vohs & Miller, Inc. reported a release of approximately 80 pounds while approximately 30 pounds was released in the 2004 release. \n\n6. Emergency Response Program:  The facility has: A) a written Emergency Action Plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard 1910.38 and B) provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);The primary emergency response coordinator for the Holstein site is Steve Vohs, owner. His work and 24-hour emergency response telephone numbers are provided in the Registration Section of this document. In addition, the following individuals (with associated work and 24-hour emergency response telephone numbers) are to be contacted in order:\n\nSteve Vohs\nWORK: (712) 368-2238\nHome: (712) 282-4256\n\nStewart Else\nWORK: (712) 368-2238\nHome: (712) 368-4877\n\nCurt Ehlers\nWORK: (712) 368-2238\nHome: (712) 282-4245\n\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety:  Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic "
