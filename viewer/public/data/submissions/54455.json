      "SummaryText": "The WFA ? Agua de Lejos Treatment Facility is located at 34.127224 and -117.682183. The WFA ? Agua de Lejos Treatment Facility has developed a risk management program to address the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program requirements (California Health & Safety Code, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, Sections 2735-2785). The WFA ? Agua de Lejos Treatment Facility is diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community. The WFA ? Agua de Lejos Treatment Facility staff is trained and utilizes equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while effectively and safely using chlorine.\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICIES\nThe WFA ? Agua de Lejos Treatment Facility has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training, reputable contractors, and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Chlorination Process. The WFA ? Agua de Lejos Treatment Facility policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. Water Facilities Authority maintains a safely committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility. \n \nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\nThe WFA ? Agua de Lejos Treatment Facility receives Stale Project water from the eastern branch of the California Aqueduct via the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD). The plant processes include flow measurement and control, chemical mixing and flow distribution, flocculation and sedimentation, filtration, effluent distribution, and solids handling and waste wash-water processes. Chlorine is used in several of these processes for disinfection, taste and odor control, algae control, and color control.\nThe existing chlorine system consists of four main subsystems: (1) Storage and Supply, which i"

Chlorine is withdrawn as gas from the one ton containers and passed through a vacuum regulator to the chlorinators. The chlorinators regulate the gas flow and discharge it to the injection lines at the appropriate rate. This concentrated solution is then injected at several points throughout the plant: the flash mix vault, the sedimentation basin effluent channels, the filter effluent channel, the filter effluent vault\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\nScenario Description: Per the CalARP Regulations, one worst case analysis has been defined for each covered process.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment Tab in the CalARP/RMP/PSM Compliance Workbook.  \nAlternative Release Scenarios Results Summary\nScenario Description: One alternative case release scenario was modeled.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment Tab in the CalARP/RMP/PSM Compliance Workbook. \nRISK CONSIDERATIONS\nAlthough the storage and use of chlorine has inherent potential risks, and worst case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; the WFA ? Agua de Lejos Treatment Facility has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make the worst case event non-credible, it should"

      "SummaryText": " also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event.\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with a release of a regulated substance:\n?    The system has alarms and interlocks\n?    The system undergoes periodic maintenance to reduce the likelihood of catastrophic failures.\n?    Gas detection is in place to notify individuals if a leak occs.\n?Scrubber system.\n ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nAs part of the implementation of this CalARP Program, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by the WFA ? Agua de Lejos Treatment Facility to manage process safety issues associated with the use of chlorine.  In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed; this includes common practices outlined by the Chlorine Institute.  The Prevention Program 3 elements include:\n?    Process Safety Information\n?    Process Hazard Analysis\n?    Operating Procedures\n?    Training\n?    Mechanical Integrity\n?    Management of Change\n?    Pre-Startup Safety Review\n?    Compliance Audits\n?    Incident Investigation\n?    Employee Participation\n?    Hot Work Permit\n?    Contractors\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no chlorine releases within the last five years.\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \nThe Water Facilities Authority has an emergency response plan in effect at the facility. The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document. This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\nThe Wa"

      "SummaryText": "ter Facilities Authority maintains a safety committee whose members include the emergency coordinators for the facility. The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility\nThe Emergency Response Plan is reviewed and updated by the Water Facilities Authority responsible person, Mr. Jose Urioste at least once a year. This Plan will be review and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations, and to ensure that the plan Is kept current.\nThe Water Facilities Authority has coordinated emergency response efforts with the local fire department, San Bernardino County Fire Department. In the case of a chemical related (chlorine) emergency, its is the policy of Water Facilities Authority to evacuate the employees and to allow the fire department to respond to the emergency (potentially with the assistance of trained facility personnel).\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) and Seismic Assessment have been conducted to examine mitigation measures to improve safety at the facility.  Planned changes to improve safety are listed as recommendations in the reports. \nFLAMMABLES: WORST CASE\nThe use of flammable materials at the WFA ? Agua de Lejos Treatment Facility is not encompassed by either the federal or state RMP requirements.  Therefore, this section is not applicable. \nFLAMMABLES: ALTERNATIVE RELEASE\nThe use of flammable materials at the WFA ? Agua de Lejos Treatment Facility is not encompassed by either the federal or state RMP requirements.  Therefore, this section is not applicable.\nEXTERNAL EVENTS ASSESSMENT\nPursuant to the requirements of California Health & Safety Code, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, Section 2745.7(q), general events external to the plant that can conceivably cause a release of chlorine were addressed by the PHA and Seismic Asse"
