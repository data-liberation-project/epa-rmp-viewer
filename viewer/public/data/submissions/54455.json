The WFA \u00bf Agua de Lejos Treatment Facility has developed a risk management program to address the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program requirements (California Health & Safety Code, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, Sections 2735-2785). The WFA \u00bf Agua de Lejos Treatment Facility is diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community. The WFA \u00bf Agua de Lejos Treatment Facility staff is trained and utilizes equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while effectively and safely using chlorine.\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICIES\nThe WFA \u00bf Agua de Lejos Treatment Facility has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training, reputable contractors, and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Chlorination Process. The WFA \u00bf Agua de Lejos Treatment Facility policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. Water Facilities Authority maintains a safely committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility. \n \nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\nThe WFA \u00bf Agua de Lejos Treatment Facility receives Stale Project water from the eastern branch of the California Aqueduct via the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD). The plant processes include flow measurement and control, chemical mixing and flow distribution, flocculation and sedimentation, filtration, effluent distribution, and solids handling and waste wash-water processes. Chlorine is used in several of these processes for disinfection, taste and odor control, algae control, and color control.\nThe existing chlorine system consists of four main subsystems: (1) Storage and Supply, which i"

Chlorine is withdrawn as gas from the one ton containers and passed through a vacuum regulator to the chlorinators. The chlorinators regulate the gas flow and discharge it to the injection lines at the appropriate rate. This concentrated solution is then injected at several points throughout the plant: the flash mix vault, the sedimentation basin effluent channels, the filter effluent channel, the filter effluent vault\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\nScenario Description: Per the CalARP Regulations, one worst case analysis has been defined for each covered process.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment Tab in the CalARP/RMP/PSM Compliance Workbook.  \nAlternative Release Scenarios Results Summary\nScenario Description: One alternative case release scenario was modeled.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment Tab in the CalARP/RMP/PSM Compliance Workbook. \nRISK CONSIDERATIONS\nAlthough the storage and use of chlorine has inherent potential risks, and worst case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; the WFA \u00bf Agua de Lejos Treatment Facility has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make the worst case event non-credible, it should"

In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed; this includes common practices outlined by the Chlorine Institute.
