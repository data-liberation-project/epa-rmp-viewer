We perform a thorough annual audit program and monitor facility compliance with the safety standards and everseen assistance with this speciality firm.  The program consists of iternal audit utilizing checklists survey forms that are reviewed regularly and updated as necessary to ensure all applicable federal, state and local regulations are covered.  These checklists are used to measure regulatory compliance including those governing the safe handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia.

Anhydrous Ammonia is received by truck, is handled and stored on-site and is a regulated substance by the EPA requireing us to comply with this Risk Management Program.  We sell anhydrous ammonia to growers in nurse tanks manufactured to the requirements to do such.  The customer applies the ammonia into the soil as a needed source of nitrogen fertilizer for growing agricultural crops.  Ammonia is also used for blending into mixed grade liquid fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n\nOur facility maintains 7 1,000 -gallon nurse Tanks and 7 1,500-gallon nurse tanks for customer delivery.  Our combined storage capacity in nurse tanks is 17,500 gallons.  Anhydrous Ammonia is stored in 3 stationary tanks -- 1-12,000 gallon & 2-6,000 gallon on site.\n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO\n\nOur worst case scenario is the loss of the total contents of 12,000 gallon storage tank,  when filled to the greates amount allowed (85% of capacity), release as a gas over 10 minutes, resulting total vaporization.  The maximum quantity released would be 56,000 pounds.  According to DEGRADIS modeling, the distance to the endpoint (point of disperion to 200 PPM) would have off-site impact.  It should be noted that our company has never had a total release of an entire storage tank.\n\nALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe most common alternate release scenario from an anhydrous ammonia storage facility would not reach an endpoint off-site.  The alternate release scenario modeled for the purposes of this plan is a two-minute release from a stationary storage tank representing a valve and hose failure requiring a manual shutdown.  The total amount of anhydrous ammonia released in this scenario would be 12,000 pounds for a storage tank.  The distance to the endpoint would have an impact.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe ammonia storage system is designed, installed and is maintained in ac"

The load-out risers used for the purpose for filling the nurse tanks are protected by excess flow valves and fill lines breakaways to immediately stop the flow of ammonia if a line or a hose would fail.
