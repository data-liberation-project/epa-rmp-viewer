The model used was a RMP*Comp. \nOther Information Required Per 40 CFR 68.155: FS1's accidental release prevention and emergency response policies are predicated on compliance with OSHAs Process Safety Management (PSM) standard. The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps include process hazard analysis (PHA). The facility has had no accidents in the past five years from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. The emergency response program was developed consistent with OSHAs Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) and PSM standards, as well as other applicable regulations. Planned changes to improve safety include completion of PHA recommendations and completion of a PSM/RMP compliance audit in 2024.   Enclosed modules which house process equipment operated at FS1 are equipped with fire suppression systems. In the event of fire, HalonA1 fire suppressant is automatically released to inhibit the chemical reaction of combustion and extinguish the flames. Prudhoe Bay has its own professionally-trained fire department which responds and serves as the local fire department. There is no other jurisdiction providing emergency response at FS1, with the exception of mutual aid provided by the fire departments of other nearby North-Slope Alaska oil fields."

Approximately 58% of the NGLs flash off in the Slug Catchers into the gas stream which are routed through the gas compression and treating system and either reinjected into the reservoir, sent back to CGF for processing, or dehydrated and used as fuel gas. The other 42% of the NGLs remain in the liquid phase and are routed through the remaining oil separation equipment to further remove produced water and gas vapor before existing the facility as sales crude.\n\nThe maximum quantity of NGLs within the process was calculated using the maximum sustained NGL flowrate through the facility of 10,000 BBLs/day as well as the FS1 HYSIS model. The HYSIS model mass balance estimates that 9.98% of all hydrocarbons in the inlet stream to the facility can be NGLs. The remaining 90.02% are natural occurring hydrocarbon mixtures and are excluded from this analysis. The FS1 maximum intended inventory estimates a total flammable liquid and vapor quantity of 10,656,393 lbs. Assuming 9.98% of these hydrocarbons originated as NGLs within the entire facility, this results in a maximum quantity of 1,100,000 lbs of NGLs that could be in the facility at any given time to two significant digits (40 CFR \u00a768.160(b)(7)). \nIt should be noted that this estimate is conservative in that this mode of operation is typically for short durations and rarely, if ever, at the maximum rate of NGLs. This also assumes that only the LP production and NGL stream is in operation. In addition, all of the chemicals that make up the NGLs are also included in the naturally occurring hydrocarbon mixture (e.g., propane, butane, iso-butane, pentane, and iso-pentane) and it would not be possible to determine which molecule came from the NGLs and which molecules came from the naturally occurring hydrocarbon mixture.    \n\nThe maximum quantify of NGLs in a single vessel was calculated to be 26,000 lbs in a single Slug Catcher and is the basis for the Worst Case Scena"

      "SummaryText": "The Flow Station 1 (FS1) production facility located in Prudhoe Bay Alaska is classified as NAICS code 211120, Crude Petroleum Extraction. All of the production fluids are classified as being a naturally occurring hydrocarbon mixture per 40 CFR \u00a768.115, and therefore not considered in the threshold calculation. Prior applicability analyses performed by earlier operators demonstrated that the facility was not covered by RMP, due to this naturally occurring hydrocarbon exemption. However, it was identified after Hilcorp North Slope (Hilcorp) began operating FS1, that there are times when NGLs are diverted from the Central Gas Facility (CGF), which is covered by the RMP rule with EPA identification # (1000 0021 2003), to FS1 as to not exceed the Total Vapor Pressure limit on the Trans-Alyeska Pipeline. These NGLs are not considered a naturally occurring hydrocarbon mixture and are therefore considered within the threshold calculation. Since the quantity of NGLs within the processing equipment can, at times, exceed 10,000 pounds, it is considered covered by the EPA\u2019s RMP rule. FS1 has been maintained and operated in compliance with OSHA's PSM under Hilcorp as well as previous owners. All of the required RMP elements were already in place aside from submittal of this Risk Management Plan. \n\nDescription of stationary source and regulated substances handled: FS1 processes crude oil production fluids received from various drill-sites in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska. These production fluids consist mainly of crude oil, hydrocarbon gas, and water. Crude oil is processed to remove hydrocarbon gas and water in order to meet specific crude oil sales specifications. Sales oil then enters the Trans-Alaska Pipeline.\n\nNatural Gas Liquids (NGLs): NGLs are periodically diverted from CGF to FS1 maintain total vapor pressure on the Trans-Alyeska pipeline. The NGLs are treated the same as the naturally occurring hydrocarbon mixture in that they are all received in the Slug Catchers which are th"
