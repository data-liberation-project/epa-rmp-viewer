This program is organized into the following elements; 1) Employees participate in the elements of this safety and release prevention program wherever possible; 2) Training is provided for operators and maintenance personnel; 3) Process Safety Information (PSI) is maintained on ammonia hazards and the process; 4) A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) of the system was conducted and has been revalidated.  It will be periodically reviewed to ensure adequacy of controls; 5) The Mechanical integrity program ensures the system continues to operate as designed; 6) Operating and maintenance procedures provide operators and maintenance staff the information necessary to safely operate and maintain the system; 7) Contractors working on or near the ammonia process are selected for safety performance, and are briefed on the hazards and safety requirements of the job; 8) Hot work permits are required whenever welding, cutting, grinding or other activities are conducted that could generate sparks and start a fire; 9) The Management of Change(MOC) program requires that the impact of changes to the ammonia system be evaluated and approved prior to the work being conducted; 10) Pre-startup safety reviews (PSSR) are conducted prior to restart of the system after modifications to ensure that the impacts of the change are addressed; 11)Incident investigations are conducted for incidents involving ammonia releases and near misses that endanger employees or the public; 12) Compliance audits will be conducted every three years to ensure that the prevention program is meeting its objectives; 13) Emergency planning and response ensures that employees and emergency personnel are prepared to respond to an ammonia release in accordance with the plant's emergency plan\n\nand that notifications are made to designated points of contact at local, state, and federal levels depending on the extent of the release.\n\n",

ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY POLICIES\nClimax Molybdenum recognizes management's responsibility in protecting its employees, equipment, property, and the environment.  The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the facility.\n\nThe Climax Molybdenum PSM/RMP program assigns and documents the specific responsibilities for developing, implementing, and integrating the OSHA PSM and the EPA RMP standards into its safety program.  The Climax Molybdenum PSM/RMP program focuses attention on \"Making PSM/RMP the way we manage our ammonia based processing operations\" rather than a project we expect to complete and put on the shelf when the filing date has passed.\n\nClimax Molybdenum believes that employee participation is the key to a successful program.  Operating level employees, particularly the Ammonia System Operators, have been deeply involved in the development and implementation of the PSM/RMP Program and they assume the major responsibility for operating safely.\n\n2.  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nClimax Molybdenum processes Molybdenum containing intermediate materials into various end products.  The storage processing system contains Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\n3.  SUMMARY OF WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\nSection A?68.25 of the RMP Regulation defines a worst-case scenario as a release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to a specified endpoint of 200 ppm (ERPG-2). \n\nPlease refer to onsite documentation for Off-Site Consequence/Hazard Assessment data.\n\n4.  DESCRIPTION OF THE CLIMAX MOLYBDENUM ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nClimax Molybdenum conducts triennial PSM/RMP audits of the entire program to identify strengths and weaknesses and make improvements.  Climax Molybdenum considers the PSM/RMP manuals to be \"living\" "

Facility tours and risk management discussions are scheduled and conducted upon written requests.\n\n5.  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT RELEASE HISTORY\nThere have been no releases of ammonia that have resulted in an injury, or that had an off-site impact, or that resulted in significant property damage either on-site or off-site.\n\n6.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nClimax's emergency response policies have been designed to comply with all applicable state and federal Regulations.  These policies summarize the actions to be taken in response to a chemical spill.  In the event of a spill, the HazMat Team will react with the proper actions, as listed in the Emergency Response Plan, in association with the local fire department\n\n7.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nClimax Molybdenum recognizes that (even though their ammonia release and injury experience has been excellent) their PSM/RMP program will provide much needed improvement to their safety effort.  The PSM/RMP program is considered to be a set of \"living\" documents and procedures that will require constant attention, development, and revision before \"Safety\" becomes second nature.\n\nClimax Molybdenum expects to improve safety performance by emphasizing all of the elements of their PSM/RMP program.  All recommendations developed during the Process Hazards Analysis revalidation and the most recent compliance auditwere designed to improve the s"
