Employees have access to information developed to comply with the PSM standard in the Pasadena Plastics Complex Central Office Building Library.  Examples of employee participation range from reviewing process safety information and Standard Operating Procedures to serving on Process Hazard Analysis teams.  \n\nPasadena Plastics Complex also utilizes other processes such as company communication tools and the Employee Safety Process to keep employee participation evergreen and provide periodic reminders to the employees that their process safety concerns and suggestions are welcome.  \n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\n\nPasadena Plastics Complex compiles and maintains written process safety information to enable both the employer and employee the ability to effectively identify and understand the hazards posed by the process.  Written PSI provides employees with a baseline of information to identify hazards of the chemicals used or produced in the process, information about the technology of the process, and information about the equipment in the process.  This PSI provides the foundation for performing the unit Process Hazards Analysis, developing operating procedures, and determining the applicability of management of change. The record copy of this formation is maintained in the Pasadena Plastics Complex Central Office Building Library. \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nA process hazard analysis is a detailed and systematic evaluation of all aspects of the process (equipment, chemicals, technology, and procedures) to identify the potential hazards associated with the processing and handling of highly hazardous chemicals."

The Checklist and Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP), or other appropriate equivalent methodologies, were used to perform the PHAs on each covered process at Pasadena Plastics Complex.  A PHA results in action items (findings/recommendations) that identify and address perceived potential hazards.  The action items are prioritized for management and employee resolution utilizing the scheme below:\n\nPasadena Plastics Complex additionally uses Layers of Protection Analysis methodology (commonly referred to as LOPA) to integrate process risk management into a unified, comprehensive program and identify Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS) in accordance with ANSI/ISA S84.01-1996 and IEC 61511.  \n\nIndependent Protection Layers (IPLs) are systems used to mitigate serious environmental and process safety risk, identified during the process hazard analysis.  IPLs include specific and identified standard operating procedures, alarms with operator response, safety instrumented systems, emergency shutdown systems, and protective devices. IPLs can be viewed as one of the first \u00bfline of defense\u00bf against a potential incident and often decrease the frequency of a potential incident.\n\nIPL Analysis provides the risk assessment methodology for the Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) which is an integral part of the PSM program.

Operator Training has been developed to equip operators with the knowledge and skill necessary to safely and proficiently perform their job duties.  This training emphasized specific safety and health hazards, emergency operations including shutdown, and safe work practices applicable to the employee's job tasks.  Written tests, oral tests, observation, demonstration and peer evaluations are utilized to verify the training.\n\nRefresher training/certification is provided every three years to operations personnel on the operating units for which they are responsible.  Training in safe work practices is given to employees during new employee safety orientation, annual safety training, special classes and monthly safety meetings.  \n\nContractors\n\nContract employees at Pasadena Plastics Complex provide labor for general maintenance or repairs, turnarounds, major renovations, construction, demolition, equipment installation or specialty work on or adjacent to covered processes.  Thus, their actions may have an influence on process safety.  Pasadena Plastics Complex informs contractors of known potentials fire, explosion or toxic release hazards related to the contractor's work and the process as well as the emergency action plan, safe work practices and sign-in/sign-out requirements for Pasadena Plastics Complex during the Contractor Safety Orientation.
