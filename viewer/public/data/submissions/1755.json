Our facility has one 25,000 gallon tank and three 6,000 gallon tanks for storing anhydrous, and an atmospheric-pressure 10,000 gallon tank for storing aqual.  We have equipment for receiving anhydrous and aqua, and equipment for transferring these materials from storage to trucks for delivery to customers.  It is our policy to meet, or exceed, all local, state, and national standards relating to handling our materials.\n\nIn the past five years, we have not had any accidents or releases with off-site consequences.\n\nWe are inspected periodically by the state to ensure that our equipment is well maintained.  In addition, we employ the following specific safety features to minimize the impact of an accidental release:\n\n1. Excess flow valves to prevent flow from the tanks if any anhydrous hose or line breaks.\n2. Pressure relief valves on the anhydrous storage tanks to prevent overpressuring and rupture of the tanks.\n3. Diking around the aqua storage area, to contain any accidental spills.\n\nTo further ensure safe operation of the facility, our employees are trained in procedures for safe handling of hazardous materials, and in safe operating and maintenance procedures.  We have also coordinated with the Fire District 13 to respond in the unlikely event of an emergency.\n\nAs required by the EPA, we have analyzed the worst-case release scenario defined by the EPA. This scenario involves a release of the entire contents of the largest anhydrous storage tank.  According to information supplied by the EPA the impact from this scenario would extend 6 miles from our facility, and would impact residences, but no hospitals, schools, or major commercial areas.\n\nIt is extremely unlikely that an event such as EPAs worst-case release scenario will ever occur.  A more probable, but still highly unlikely event, would be an "
