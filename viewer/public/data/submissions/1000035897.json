The plant was constructed in 1973. This facility consists of two plants: a plant that manufactures formaldehyde, which is one of the basic raw materials used to manufacture the resins, and the resin manufacturing process.   Overall, the facility employs 38 full-time employees.\n\n\n\nGP is committed to operating the plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, GP has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMP Plan) describing the risk management program at the plant. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the plant.\n\n\n\nThe risk management program at the Plant consists of the following three elements:\n\n?a hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances).\n\n\n\n?a prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes).\n\n?an emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes\n\n\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMP"

Although the risk management program at the Plant helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the safety program at the Plant.  In fact, the Plant has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance and injuries and damage from a release of a hazardous substance.\n\n \n\nGP limits the use of hazardous substances.  Before using a hazardous substance at the Plant, less hazardous alternatives are considered. When a hazardous substance is used at the Plant, GP considers the potential for this substance to adversely affect plant workers, the public, and the environment and takes steps to prevent any such effects.\n\n\n\nGP prevents releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  When a hazardous substance is used at the Plant, the equipment is carefully designed, built and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment. \n\n\n\nGP trains its employees to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences in the event that a chemical release should occur.  In addition, GP has provided information to the Albany Fire Department to help prevent injuries and/or environmental impacts that might be associated with a release.\n\n\n\nThe safety program at the Plant consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule. This RMP Plan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at the Plant that are required by the RMP rule.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nGP is committed to the safety of workers and the public, and the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.

Workers who perform operations involving formaldehyde receive training emphasizing safe handling procedures for formaldehyde developed by the plant.   The storage tanks are surrounded by a concrete dike which is large enough to contain 100% of the volume of the largest tank should its entire contents be spilled. Process areas that handle formaldehyde also have containment.  Air emissions from the storage tanks and the process are directed to a thermal oxidizer, which destroys in excess of 95% of the formaldehyde emissions.\n\n\n\nAmmonium hydroxide solution (30%):  Ammonia solution is purchased from an approved offsite vendor and delivered by DOT approved tank truck.  The solution is offloaded to a dedicated storage tank (M10) following a prescribed SOP to ensure worker safety and mitigate environmental risks. Workers who perform operations involving ammonia receive training emphasizing safe handling procedures (SOP) for ammonia developed by the plant.   The storage tank is located in the raw material tank farm which is encircled by a concrete dike wall large enough to contain 100% of the volume of the largest tank should its entire contents be spilled. Ammonia is pumped from the tank farm to the kettle area for utilization in resin manufacturing.  SOPs, operator training and a system of dike walls and/or ditches ensure safe handling and utilization of ammonia.\n\n\n\n1.4  Five-Year Accident History\n\nThe plant has completed a review of the five-year accident history for the plant.
