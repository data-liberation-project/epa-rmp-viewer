The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nThe Service First Logistics (SFL) Atlanta Warehouse maintains accident prevention programs and an emergency response plan appropriate to the site. SFL Atlanta Warehouse personnel are responsible for regulatory compliance issues that apply to the site, providing training for site employees, and budgeting and procuring safety and training services.\n\n2. The facility and the regulated substance handled\n\nThe SFL Atlanta Warehouse is located at 5400 Fulton Industrial Boulevard in the southwest corner of the city of Atlanta, Fulton County, Georgia.  The facility consists of areas for dry, cooler, and freezer storage of perishable and non-perishable items.  The facility is a public warehouse, operated by SFL, who rents storage space to a variety of customers in the food supply industry.\n\nThe SFL Atlanta Warehouse has an ammonia refrigeration system that exceeds the 10,000 lb. RMP threshold quantity.  The ammonia refrigeration system\u00bfs equipment is located in the compressor room in the southeast area of the building, except for the high pressure receiver (HPR).  The HPR is located outside of the warehouse next to the southeast property boundary.  The process includes a number of safety devices such as dual port relief valves, high pressure cutoffs and ammonia detectors with alarms.                                     \n\n3. The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\n\nThis facility exceeds the ammonia threshold quantity in the ammonia refrigeration system for the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, 1910.119, and is therefore subject to the PSM requirements.   For RMP compliance purposes, this places the Atlanta Warehouse's refrigeration process in the Program 3 level.  The SFL Atlanta Warehouse will use its PSM program as the required Program 3 Prevention Program for ammonia. \n\nThe SFL Atlanta Warehouse has a program in place to comply with the OSHA Pr"

The PSM Program was developed for the previous operator of the warehouse and is being updated to reflect SFL's staff, capabilities, and operations.  The PSM Program includes a preventative maintenance plan which is being revised by SFL to indicate their methods for periodically inspecting and servicing equipment.  Service First Logistics has reviewed the written operating procedures for the refrigeration process and is developing additional SOPs where needed.  These procedures cover all phases of operation and include information on safety devices.  These procedures will be used to train the mechanics who work on the ammonia refrigeration process to ensure consistency of operation and minimize human error.  Existing safe work practices such as Lockout/Tagout and Hot Work Permit were reviewed and updated to ensure that all non-routine work can be performed safely.  Other components of the prevention program include collection and review of all equipment information and the correction of any errors found.  A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was conducted involving SFL staff.  Other PSM procedures, including Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Compliance Audits, and Incident Investigation are also part of the program to ensure continued safe operation and prompt correction of deficiencies.\n\n4. Five-year accident History\n\nThe SFL Atlanta Warehouse has had no accidental releases of ammonia in the past five years.\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe SFL Atlanta Warehouse has an Emergency Action Plan in place.  The program complies with 29 CFR 1910.38.  The current plan has been coordinated with the Fulton County Fire Department and Hazardous Materials Response Team, and the State Emergency Response Commission.  Notification is made locally by dialing 911, and by notifying the Georgia State Warning Point at (800) 241-4113 or (404) 656-6905.\n\n6.\tPlanned changes to improve safety\n\nSFL is in the process of updating"
