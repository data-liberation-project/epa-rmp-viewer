The facility has also implemented all the elements of the Cimarex Energy Co. Environmental, Safety & Health Manual, which contains additional environmental, health, and safety standards.\n\n\n\nThe Cana East CDP facility's Emergency Response Plan includes required actions by plant employees as well as required notification and coordination with local responders and agencies. All employees are trained in the execution of the Emergency Response Plan.  Specific emergency response actions are included in the emergency section of the facility Operations Manual.\n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated substances:\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the Cana East CDP Facility is to receive gas and liquids from the Cimarex gathering system, to separate the bulk of the liquids from the gas, and to dehydrate the gas.  Incoming gas flow will include pigging operations that push liquids and pigs into the plant.  The pigs are captured in the pig receivers.  The liquids and gas are routed to the slug catchers.  Large amounts of liquids will be captured in the slug catchers and routed to a separate liquids handling facility which is remotely located.  These liquids are routed through a basket strainer before leaving the plant.  After the slug catchers, Separator(s) are used to further separate liquids from the incoming gas before the gas is routed to the treatment system.  The liquids are directed to a separate site for processing and the gas is delivered to the Enogex meter.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information: A variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation o"

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors, (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) are aware of any hazards in the workplace, (3) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (4) understand and follow site safety rules, and (5) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSR's): The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup before placing modified equipment into service.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity: The Cana East CDP facility has well established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in safe operating condition.\n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices and Procedures: Examples of safe work practices include methods for controlling plant entry, presence and exit of support personnel, and lockout/ tagout procedures to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, hot work procedures and permits for work with the potential for generating ignition sources in the presence of flammable or combustible material, and confined space entry permits and procedure"

The program consists of procedures for responding to releases of regulated substances, including the possibility of associated fires or explosions. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, if a release occurs. Employees receive training in these procedures annually to perform emergency response duties. The program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the gas plant processes. Emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety: In response to the most recent Process Hazard Analysis, the Cana "
