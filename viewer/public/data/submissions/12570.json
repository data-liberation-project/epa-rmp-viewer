These chemicals are stored in separate but proximate tanks and each is routed through pipes to be repackaged into small aerosol containers.\n\n*Note: The quantities listed above are predictive. At this time both Difluoroethane and Methyl Ether are kept below threshold at 9,500 pounds.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s)\n\nOur worst case release scenario would be a vapor cloud explosion. Our maximum quantity released would be 28,000 pounds of flammable gas reaching an estimated endpoint to 1 psi overpressure of  0.2 miles.

These plans include the spill emergency practices and the responsibility and procedures. In addition, the manufacturing areas in the plant have plans relating to specific situations. These plans identify all hazardous materials used and/or hazardous waste generated in each respective area, and the proper method of disposal and/or containment in case of a spill. The effective implementation of these above mentioned procedures should avoid a large scale emergency situation.\n\nHazardous Waste Storage Area\n\nAll hazardous wastes are stored in 55 gallon drums, in a properly designated hazardous waste storage area, located in the southeast corner of the building, until permanent disposal is arranged.\n\nMaterial Separation\n   \nAll hazardous materials within the building are segregated in accordance to federal state, and local regulation guidelines.\n\nAll hazardous wastes are segregated properly and employees which are trained to work with hazardous waste work in this area.\nInspection and Monitoring Program\n\nGood manufacturing practices are employed to protect the company from the loss of valuable raw material and the risk of generating unnecessary waste.

Included in the inspection is a check for unsafe conditions, unsafe handling techniques, storage problems, etc. All items noted during this inspection are documented on the inspection log.\n\nHousekeeping\n\nThe importance of housekeeping as a safety measure is very important. At least monthly inspection is performed by the safety committee members. Feedback to the appropriate employees is used to involve all employees with the importance of good housekeeping practices.\n\nNeat and orderly storage of chemicals, regular garbage pickup and disposal, maintenance of clean dry floors, proper spacing for pathways between containers, and stimulation of employee interest are a few examples of routine housekeeping practices.\n\nSecurity And Alarm System\n\nEntrance to the plant is restricted to employees and authorized personnel only. All others must be accompanied by an employee while in the plant.\n\nAfter hours all doors and entrances are locked.\n\nIn the plant in the H occupancy area the overall alarm system is tied into all pull boxes.

The facility fire alarm sends an automatic signal to the central monitoring station and the central station will notify the fire department and the facility emergency coordinators.\n\nThere are local emergency evacuation alarms which are designed to notify employees in certain designated areas if evacuation is required at the time of a chemical spill.

They should also know the compatibility, fire hazard (including use of fire extinguisher), and equipment used to handle these materials.\n\nexplosion\nExplosion may occur either with gases and vapors or with dusts when handling hazardous materials, either of these two conditions could be expected.  Most spill prevention and control procedures are designed around the fact that keeping the material above or below the flammable range would be sufficient to preclude fire or explosion.\n\nfire\nFires are also classified by the type of material in which they occur.  The following are the four classes of fires.  \u0013A\u0014 Fires occur in ordinary combustible materials.  \u0013B\u0014 Fires occur in flammable liquids, vapors, or gases.  \u0013C\u0014 Fires occur either as an underlying 'A' or 'B' fire with the exception that it is in, or possibly could be in, energized equipment.  \u0013D\u0014 Fires are those which occur in the combustible metals such as magnesium, sodium potassium, and aluminum.\n\ngases\nAll compressed gases are kept in controlled areas. In short, the primary hazards associated with handling compressed gases during spill incidents are very high.  As soon as a spill is detected,  immediate evacuation of all employees is required.
