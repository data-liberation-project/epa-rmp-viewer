The system is checked on a regular basis to ensure it is functioning properly and in good repair.\n\n\n\nThe facility has an emergency evacuation plan that includes ammonia leaks.  If an ammonia leak or an alarm indicating an ammonia leak is observed by facility personnel, the decision to evacuate the building is made by management.  Professional emergency responders and the facility's professional refrigeration service firm are called to assist with the ammonia leak. \n\n\n\nThe management at Tropicana is committed to safety.  The emergency action plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.\n\n\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe facility is located at 240 North Orange Avenue in Industry, California.  The system was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the Uniform Fire and Mechanical Codes.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses 21,639 pounds of ammonia for the cold storage of fruit juice and fruit juice beverages.  The majority of the system is located inside the Machine Room, Process Area, Glycol Chiller #9 Room, Glycol Chiller #10 Room, outside, and in the Freezer and Storage areas.  \n\n\n\nThe refrigeration process equipment at the facility operates continuously.  The compressors and condensers cycle on and off to comply with system demand during operation.  \n\n\n\nThe refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of liquid ammonia from the Condensers to the High Pressure Receiver.

The chilled high pressure liquid is then sent to the +20?F Cooler Recirculator, and Chillers #9 and #10.\n\n\n\nThe +20?F Cooler Recirculator feeds controlled pressure liquid ammonia to Air Handling Units #1 - #3 and #9 - #11 (+35?F). At the evaporators, the liquid ammonia, flowing through coils in the unit, is partially boiled as it absorbs heat from the product and room. The resulting 'wet suction' (liquid/vapor mix) from AHU #1 - #3 and #9 - #11 and is returned to the +20?F Cooler Recirculator, wherein the liquid drops to the bottom of the vessel and vapor is drawn from the top of the vessel by the Compressors.  \n\n\n\nThe Chillers receive chilled high pressure liquid ammonia from the Liquid subcooler to cool product in the process areas at the facility.  The liquid ammonia boils off, and the Chillers return cooler suction (vapor) to the +20?F Cooler Recirculator.\n\n\n\nThe Frick Compressors (#3 - #7) draw vapor from the +20?F Cooler Recirculator. The vapor discharged from the Compressors is routed to the Condensers.  The compressors receive subcooled liquid from the Liquid Subcooler for oil cooling.\n\n\n\nAt the Condensers (#2, #3, #4 & #5), air (fans) and water (pumps) are used to condense the compressor discharge into high pressure liquid, which then drains to the High Pressure Receiver to begin the refrigeration cycle again.  \n\n\n\nThe system is also equipped with an Automatic Purger that removes non-condensables, i.e. air, from the system.\n\n\n\nAll process equipment and piping are designed according to ASME standards.

      "SummaryText": "EVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Tropicana ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with Cal/OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.  The facility conducts maintenance and any necessary minor repairs in house, but an outside contractor is hired for major repairs. The facility also maintains a contract with a professional refrigeration contractor to conduct preventative maintenance and any necessary repairs.\n\n\n\nThe facility including the ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety features include a water diffusion tank, ammonia sensors in the engine room as well as sensors near the evaporators, and automatic shut down systems. In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine room and just outside of the engine room (Condenser and High Pressure).  All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that are commonly piped to the water diffusion tanks.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, Tropicana has developed a preventive maintenance program that utilizes the services of a professional refrigeration contractor to complete regularly scheduled inspections and tests of the ammonia refrigeration system as well as repairs as needed to process equipment.  \n\n\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe EPA's RMP Program defines \"accident\" as the following:\n\n\n\n\"The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process.\n\n\n\nThe release must have caused at least one of the following:\n\n \n\n?

However, the facility did experience a \"near miss\" that warranted an internal incident investigation. \n\n\n\nOn February 2, 2018, refrigeration contractors were working at the facility during a project to replace equipment and piping. The contractor employee removed a pressure gauge from an evacuated pipe; however, some residual ammonia vapor in the line escaped when the gauge was removed. The vapor reached the ammonia sensor located directly above the gauge and caused readings to spike to 240 ppm, and triggered the plant evacuation alarm. The plant evacuated per the Emergency Response Plan, and Utilities Operators contacted the alarm company to silence the alarm and not contact first responders. At the evacuation assembly location, the Supervisor notified employees of the situation and gave the all clear to return to work. It was calculated that 2.73 oz. of ammonia was released.\n\n\n\nIt was determined that refrigeration contractor employees are too meet with the Utilities Operators on shift prior, and to communicate their specific task they will be completing each day prior to beginning work on the system. This will allow the Utilities Operators to inform the contractors of specific hazards and sensors in their specific work areas.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Tropicana facility has an emergency action plan in effect.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nT"

The PHA Revalidation was comprised of one session that included a discussion of any changes to the ammonia refrigeration system since the previous HAZOP Revalidation study, a detailed review of the recommended action items generated during the 2014 PHA Revalidation study, a discussion of the facility's accident history dating back five years, the completion of checklists, the completion of the HAZOP log tables, and a site inspection walkthrough.  \n\n\n\nIn addition, the Tropicana safety committee is planning to complete several items over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.
