We believe that a vessel failure such as this is extremely unlikely because the vessels are carefully designed with significant engineering safety factors.  In addition, all pressure vessels are carefully inspected and pressure tested before they are placed in service, and the Gulf Coast Fractionators Facility follows a rigorous Mechanical Integrity Program to ensure that all process equipment is properly maintained and inspected, to prevent leakage or failure.\n\nALTERNATIVE FLAMMABLE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe RMP regulations require the operator to model a single \u00c2\u00bfalternative release scenario\u00c2\u00bf for all regulated flammable substances.  For the Gulf Coast Fractionators Facility, this hypothetical scenario was modeled on the basis of a seal failure on the ethane pipeline pump, which was assumed to last for ten minutes.

They are thereby trained in the specific knowledge, skills, and procedures needed to safely conduct their work.  In addition, each operator receives facility-specific training on how to operate the plant, including detailed training on the operating procedures, including startup, shutdown, normal operations, temporary operations, and emergency operations.  As part of this training, an operator in training is paired with an experienced operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (through tests and skills demonstration) the knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, only then can they work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at a high level.  This refresher training is provided as often as necessary, and no less than every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\n\tThe Gulf Coast Fractionators Facility uses contractors to perform many project-specific activities and supplement the plant workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction periods.
