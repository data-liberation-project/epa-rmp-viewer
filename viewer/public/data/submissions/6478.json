If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify 911 or the City of Riviera Beach Dispatcher at (561) 790-5180 and request response to the emergency. Additional emergency response can be obtained through the Palm Beach County HazMat Team, if necessary.\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled: The Pepsi Cola Bottling Company of Fort Lauderdale-Palm Beach, Inc. (Pepsi) facility manufactures soft drink products. The facility consists of a 180,000-square foot operations building situated on approximately ten acres. The site is enclosed by a chain-link fence to prevent unauthorized entry. A maximum of 16,000 pounds of ammonia is stored at the Pepsi facility. The anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant during the manufacturing process. It is contained in one, 800-gallon (4,500 pounds) cylinder and associated refrigeration system pipes, pumps, and receivers. The refrigeration system is a closed loop system; therefore, ammonia is not released during normal operations. \n\nThe worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario:\n\nThe worst-case scenario is a release of gaseous ammonia resulting from the total failure of the 800-gallon (4,500 pounds) cylinder. This event is unlikely to occur and is presented here as required by the Risk Management Program regulations. The worst-case scenario assumes that the entire quantity of the 800-gallon cylinder is completely released over a period of ten minutes, resulting in a gaseous release of ammonia. According to EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis look-up tables, and results from EPA's RMP*Comp, the distance to the toxic endpoint for this quantity of ammonia is 0.9 miles. The facility is located in an urban area and would affect approximately 12,000 persons. \n\nThe alternative release scenario i"

      "SummaryText": "s a more plausible event that would involve a release of gaseous ammonia from an external pipe. It has been assumed that a <-inch diameter hole could develop due to corrosion of system piping. According to EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis look-up tables, the corresponding release rate is 130 pounds per minute. The distance to the toxic endpoint for this quantity of ammonia is 0.1 miles. The alternative scenario release of gaseous ammonia would affect approximately 150 persons.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps: The ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with engineering standards associated with the refrigeration industry. The facility completes daily preventative maintenance and contracts a licensed ammonia refrigeration contractor to perform detailed monthly preventative maintenance. The facility's prevention program also includes employee training. Operators receive both classroom training and on the job training. \n\nPepsi has safety programs in place to prevent accidents, as well as respond to accidents, should they occur. Pepsi's safety and hazard prevention programs include the following:\n\n7 Risk Management Program\n7 Process Safety Management\n7 Hazard Communication\n7 Lockout/Tagout\n7 Confined Space Entry\n\nFive-year accident history: The Pepsi facility has never had an accident involving ammonia that caused deaths, serious injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\nThe emergency response program: In the event of an emergency involving the ammonia system, it is our policy to notify 911 or the City of Riviera Beach Fire Department Dispatcher at (561) 790-5180 and request response to the emergency. Additional emergency response can be obtained through the Palm Beach County HazMat Team, if necessary. We have discussed this policy with the City of Riviera Beach Fire Department."
