In the Program Level 3 designation, Cal/ARP also includes CA Title 8, Section 5189 Process Safety Management as the basis for the Prevention Program component of the Plan/Program.  Coastal Cooling is updating its RMP (and the associated submittals) due to a PHA Update conducted 3/11/2016, which was conducted to evaluate a pre-cooling expansion project.  All 9 sections of the RMP are being updated as a result, within the 6 month window allowed.     \r\n\r\nA.\tRMP EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \t\r\n\r\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe Coastal Cooling Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies are simply not to have accidental releases or emergencies.  The Company endeavors to execute these policies through the daily implementation of its Safety Programs.  Company safety programs include, but are not limited to the Process Safety Management Program (PSM) for its Program Level III Process.  The PSM Program is an integrated, holistic approach to the safe operation of processes using Regulated Substances.  The design of the Process in use and the PSM Program are specifically intended to prevent accidental releases, and to deal safely with emergencies if and when they do happen.  It is the primary goal of Coastal Cooling to protect its employees, visitors and neighbors from harm due to Company operations.  With this in mind, the priorities of protection of life, the environment, and then property have been established.\r\nThe Company also recognizes the need to be prepared for accidental releases that could occur should established prevention programs fail.

Our policy is to regularly test and maintain emergency safety systems per our Mechanical Integrity Program, which is intended to ensure proper operation, actuation and function of the refrigeration-related systems and components.  The Plant is also equipped with Ammonia-Water Diffusion Tank Systems (ADT).  The function of the ADT systems is to prevent ammonia from venting to atmosphere should a Pressure Relief Valve operate. \r\nThe Company has adopted a Non-responding Facility Emergency Response Policy.  The Plant's California Hazardous Material Business Plan (HMBP) was developed to be consistent with Emergency Action Plan requirements.  Emergency response pre-planning is coordinated through the local Certified Unified Program Agency (Monterey County Health Department/CUPA). The CUPA inspects the plant and receives copies of the routinely updated HMBP.  It is our policy to maintain RMP/PSM compliance, a good working relationship with the Monterey County Health Department/CUPA, and other Public Emergency Responders that are part of the Monterey County Emergency Response Mutual Aid Agreement.\r\nCoastal Cooling's ammonia refrigeration process is supported by Western Precooling Systems (WPS), which is a stakeholder in the operation as described below.

WPS assists Coastal Cooling with implementation of its RMP/PSM Accidental Release Prevention Program elements, and would serve as a technical resource in an emergency situation.\r\n\r\nIt is through these measures, policies and pre-planning that Coastal Cooling endeavors to maintain effective Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response.\r\n    \r\n2.\tGeneral Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe facility is an ammonia refrigeration plant located in Castroville, CA, in a commercial/industrial area on the SE side of the city.  Coastal Cooling, LLC leases the property and refrigerating equipment from WPS, which purchased the facility in 2011.  Coastal Cooling, LLC is a California Limited Liability Company made up of On the Move Logistics and Western Precooling Systems (WPS).  Prior to WPS purchasing the facility it was owned by D'Arrigo Bothers and leased by Coastal in 2010.  Prior to 2010, Dole Fresh Vegetables leased the facility from D'Arrigo Brothers for the 2008/2009 season.  \r\n\r\nThe original ammonia refrigeration process was built in 1985 with expansions, modifications and/or upgrades in 1994, 1998, 2014, 2015 & 2016.  The facility has been upgraded, expanded and optimized for the pre-cooling, short-term refrigerated storage and shipping of fresh strawberries; and includes a small chilled berry juice operation leased and operated by a tenant.  The most recent expansion included the addition of two MACS&trade; pressure coolers, a portable high-side trailer and portable recirculating package described in more detail below.  The facility is open year-around with a busy season picking up in early March and continuing through the summer months.  Remaining winter months may see little in the way of fresh produce; however the refrigeration equipment generally remains operative.

The Prevention Program is equivalent to PSM including Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Written Procedures, Training, Mechanical Integrity, Management of Change, Pre-startup Safety Review, Employee Participation, Incident Investigation, Compliance Audits, Contractor Safety, and Injury and Illness Prevention.\r\n-\tBuilding refrigerated space is protected against fire by an automated fire sprinkler system.  \r\n-\tThe facility is equipped with automated monitoring and alarms that are supervised by a third-party alarm company.  The monitoring system is configured to make notifications based on pre-determined parameters. Technicians are notified if out-of-tolerance parameters are being approached, so potential problems can be remedied before they escalate to a release situation.\r\n-\tPressure Relief Valves (PRVs) are installed to protect vessels from operating above their ratings. \r\n-\tPRVs are piped to headers that terminate at Ammonia-Water Diffusion tanks.  Discharge from a PRV would be absorbed into water containment, thereby preventing an ammonia release to atmosphere.  \r\n-\tThe facility is protected by fencing and gates to limit access by pote"
