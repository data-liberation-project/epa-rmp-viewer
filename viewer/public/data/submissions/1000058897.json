In the Program Level 3 designation, Cal/ARP also includes CA Title 8, Section 5189 Process Safety Management as the basis for the Prevention Program component of the Plan/Program.  Coastal Cooling is updating its RMP (and the associated submittals) due to a PHA Update conducted 3/11/2016, which was conducted to evaluate a pre-cooling expansion project.  All 9 sections of the RMP are being updated as a result, within the 6 month window allowed.     \n\n\n\nA.    RMP EXECUTIVE SUMMARY     \n\n\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe Coastal Cooling Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies are simply not to have accidental releases or emergencies.  The Company endeavors to execute these policies through the daily implementation of its Safety Programs.  Company safety programs include, but are not limited to the Process Safety Management Program (PSM) for its Program Level III Process.  The PSM Program is an integrated, holistic approach to the safe operation of processes using Regulated Substances.  The design of the Process in use and the PSM Program are specifically intended to prevent accidental releases, and to deal safely with emergencies if and when they do happen.  It is the primary goal of Coastal Cooling to protect its employees, visitors and neighbors from harm due to Company operations.  With this in mind, the priorities of protection of life, the environment, and then property have been established.\n\nThe Company also recognizes the need to be prepared for accidental releases that could occur should established prevention programs fail.

Our policy is to regularly test and maintain emergency safety systems per our Mechanical Integrity Program, which is intended to ensure proper operation, actuation and function of the refrigeration-related systems and components.  The Plant is also equipped with Ammonia-Water Diffusion Tank Systems (ADT).  The function of the ADT systems is to prevent ammonia from venting to atmosphere should a Pressure Relief Valve operate. \n\nThe Company has adopted a \"Non-responding Facility\" Emergency Response Policy.  The Plant's California Hazardous Material Business Plan (HMBP) was developed to be consistent with Emergency Action Plan requirements.  Emergency response pre-planning is coordinated through the local Certified Unified Program Agency (Monterey County Health Department/CUPA). The CUPA inspects the plant and receives copies of the routinely updated HMBP.  It is our policy to maintain RMP/PSM compliance, a good working relationship with the Monterey County Health Department/CUPA, and other Public Emergency Responders that are part of the Monterey County Emergency Response Mutual Aid Agreement.\n\nCoastal Cooling's ammonia refrigeration process is supported by Western Precooling Systems (WPS), which is a stakeholder in the operation as described below.  WPS is a well-known reputable supplier of ammonia refrigeration equipment and services.  WPS has a Regional Service Center in Castroville within two miles of the Coastal Cooling facility.

General Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe facility is an ammonia refrigeration plant located in Castroville, CA, in a commercial/industrial area on the SE side of the city.  Coastal Cooling, LLC leases the property and refrigerating equipment from WPS, which purchased the facility in 2011.  Coastal Cooling, LLC is a California Limited Liability Company made up of On the Move Logistics and Western Precooling Systems (WPS).  Prior to WPS purchasing the facility it was owned by D'Arrigo Bothers and leased by Coastal in 2010.  Prior to 2010, Dole Fresh Vegetables leased the facility from D'Arrigo Brothers for the 2008/2009 season.  \n\n\n\nThe original ammonia refrigeration process was built in 1985 with expansions, modifications and/or upgrades in 1994, 1998, 2014, 2015 & 2016.  The facility has been upgraded, expanded and optimized for the pre-cooling, short-term refrigerated storage and shipping of fresh strawberries; and includes a small chilled berry juice operation leased and operated by a tenant.  The most recent expansion included the addition of two MACS&trade; pressure coolers, a portable high-side trailer and portable recirculating package described in more detail below.  The facility is open year-around with a busy season picking up in early March and continuing through the summer months.  Remaining winter months may see little in the way of fresh produce; however the refrigeration equipment generally remains operative.  Annual refrigeration equipment maintenance is performed during low-season winter months.  Portable pressure coolers including MACS&t"

Refrigerating process equipment overall consists of Compressors, Evaporative Condensers, Room-Unit Evaporators, Room Pressure Cooling Units, MACS&trade; Pressure Cooling Units, Berry Juice Chillers, Pressure Vessels, pumps and associated controls, valves, instrumentation and piping.  Pressure and temperature controls and safety cut-outs are installed in accordance with appropriate codes & standards, including isolation and overpressure relief valves.  Pressure relief valves are piped to headers that terminate at one of two ammonia-water diffusion tanks.  In addition to automated monitoring, pre-qualified personnel regularly check the refrigeration process for proper operating parameters.\n\nSystem 1 consists of a complete high (compression) and low (evaporators) side refrigeration system that supports pressure cooling (room units & MACS&trade;) within the main cold storage facilities, and two strawberry juice chillers.

Technicians only perform tasks for which they have been pre-qualified.\n\n\n\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nHistorically it has become apparent that a mishap while draining oil from a system was one of the most common incidents to occur in the ammonia refrigeration industry.  To correct this issue special self-closing valves were developed and installed as a permissive for oil drain flow.  If a release were to develop during the oil-draining task, the mechanic simply releases the handle of the self-closing valve and flow is terminated.  These types of valves are installed at the Plant's oil drain points.\n\n\n\nOther release prevention steps taken at the Plant:\n\n\n\n-    Management has taken ownership of the RMP/PSM Program.  \n\n-    Continuing implementation of the Prevention Program elements.  The Prevention Program is equivalent to PSM including Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Written Procedures, Training, Mechanical Integrity, Management of Change, Pre-startup Safety Review, Employee Participation, Incident Investigation, Compliance Audits, Contractor Safety, and Injury and Illness Prevention.\n\n-    Building refrigerated space is protected against fire by an automated fire sprinkler system.  \n\n-    The facility is equipped with automated monitoring and alarms that are supervised by a third-party alarm company.  The monitoring system is configured to make notifications based on pre-determined parameters. Technicians are notified if out-of-tolerance parameters are being approached, so potential problems can be remedied before they escalate to a release situation.\n\n-    Pressure Relief Valves (PRVs) are installed to protect vessels from operating above their ratings. \n\n-    PRVs are piped to headers that terminate at Ammonia-Water Diffusion tanks.

The Safety Day promotes best practices and release prevention throughout the industry.\n\n\n\n4.      Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere is no data to report.  \n\n\n\n5.     Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThis plant is engineered to provide for life safety and effective emergency response.  Building space is equipped with a fire-alarm system & fire sprinklers.  Refrigerated space and Engine Rooms are equipped with ammonia sensors and associated alarm system.  The refrigeration process' Control, Monitoring and Alarm System (described above) is supplemented with backup systems (kill switches).  Currently, authorized personnel can access critical process system controls via the Plant's Electrical Rooms.  Portions of the refrigeration process are equipped with Fire Department Emergency Control Boxes and a KNOX BOX has been installed.  The KNOX is kept up-to-date per the North County Fire & City of Castroville Police Departments.  Automated systems and safety cut-outs are regularly inspected, tested and maintained at pre-determined intervals. Personnel are experienced in ammonia awareness, manual discovery, emergency shutdown, evacuation and notification procedures in the event of a failure of the e"

In the event of an ammonia emergency, the response is to follow the procedures in the Equipment SOP's and the California Hazardous Material Business Plan.  The overall procedure is to shutdown when and where appropriate and safe, evacuate, and notify the local response agencies and WPS (technical support).  Plant employees are to implement hazard communications, provide for the safety of visitors and report to the established Evacuation Staging Area(s) for a head count. Emergency response is coordinated with the County of Monterey Health Department/CUPA and local Fire Department.  Coastal Cooling has verified it is included in the Monterey County Area Emergency Plan. \n\n   \n\n6.    Planned changes to improve safety\n\n\n\nThe primary mechanisms to identify and plan safety improvements include (but are not limited to):\n\n?    Process Hazard Analysis;\n\n?    Compliance Audits;\n\n?    Routine inspections, tests & maintenance (Mechanical Integrity Program);\n\n?    IIAR Bulletin 109 Inspections (IIAR Minimum Safety Criteria For The Safe Operation Of Ammonia Refrigeration Process);\n\n?    Coastal Cooling and WPS Internal Inspection Protocols\n\n?    Incident Investigation\n\n\n\nThe Programs above may result in recommendations ranging from capital improvements to routine maintenance of the plant.  Service calls are established in parallel to identified needs.  \n\n\n\nCurrent planned changes to improve safety include the recommendations identified in the most recent Process Hazard Analyses, which were conducted by experienced teams on 3/11/2016 (MACS&trade; Expansion).  A summary of improvements includes engineering, mechanical, and administrative changes or upgrades.  Coastal has prepared written itemized lists of the improvements which are to be implemented.
