      "SummaryText": "The Wagner Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant is an activated sludge wastewater treatement plant with a nominal capacity of two (2) millions gallons per day. The plant uses chlorine as a disinfection agent and sulfur dioxide as a dechlorination agent prior to discharge of the final effluent to Days Creek. The facility's only activity is the primary and secondary treatment of municipal wastewater.\n\n\n\nLiquid chlorine and sulfur dioxide are the only two chemicals used in sufficient quantity at the facility to be regulated under the RMP program.\n\n\n\nUp to seven (4) one tone cylinders of chlorine and seven (4) one ton cylinders of sulfur dioxide are stored at the site. Up to two (1) cylinders of chlorine are used at any one time in the process and two (1) cylinders of sulfur dioxide.\n\n\n\nTexarkana Water Utilities is dedicated to the safe and proper handling of chemicals necessary for the production of drinking water and treatment of wastewater for its citizens. Utility management has consistently budgeted and the elected bodies of the two Texarkana's have consistently approved funds to support personnel and citizen safety preventative maintenance training, chemical awareness and handling, emergency response and equipment related to chemicals used at the facility.\n\n\n\nSeveral training and procedural methods make a worst case release of either chlorine or sulfur dioxide unlikely. The site is staffed eight (8) hours a day with periodic inspections of the chlorination facilities by employees from the South Regional Plant. Highly trained personnel and an extensive preventative maintenance program keep all chlorination equipment in like new condition. There are remote (SCADA system) alarmed gas detectors for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide. Safety procedures, including those associated with chlorine and sulfur dioxide are standardized through Standard Operating Procedures (SOP's). Cylinder repair kits for both chemicals are kept at several locations in the system.\n\n\n\nThe American "

      "SummaryText": "Water Works Association publication Compliance Guidance and Model Risk Management Program for Water Treatment Plants, was used in the selection of an alternative release scenario for chlorine. The accidental release prevention program is predicated on well informed, well trained employees. The facility makes use of written, video and classroom training from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, Arkansas Department of Health, Chlorine Institute, The American Water Works Association and The Water Environment Association. Facility management has developed written standard operational procedures for maintenance programs that provide frequent checks and keep equipment in like new condition. Gas detection and alarm devices are used to provide early alert to any chlorine or sulfur dioxide releases.\n\n\n\nThere have been no reportable chlorine or sulfur dioxide releases or accidents for a period exceeding five (5) years largely due to the previously described steps taken by Texarkana Water Utilities management.\n\n\n\nThe Utility is included in the written community emergency response plan and maintains a close working relationship with the local Emergency Management Office. The facility has its own written emergency response plan and participates in site-specific, multi-agency response drills. Highway 59 Environmental, a company which maintains a Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) team, is available to back up and respond to any chemical release.\n\n\n\nThe Utility has a geographic information system base map to assist utility, fire, police and emergency management personnel in prevention and response planning for any chemical release."
