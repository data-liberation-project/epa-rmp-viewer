This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Gaseous Chlorine Disinfection System.  The CWTP's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substance. \n\n4.2    Stationary Source and Regulated Substance \n\nChlorine is injected into the water in order to disinfect it and to prevent bacterial growth while the water travels through pipelines.  The maximum intended inventory for this facility is approximately 20,000 pounds of chlorine kept in ten (10) one-ton containers.  Chlorine leak detection and warning is provided by high and low chlorine sensor alarms to control room with an audible and visual alarm system.  \n\n4.3    Hazard Assessment Summary/Offsite Consequence Analysis \n\nThe Off-site Consequence Analysis must be reviewed every five years or within six months of process changes or other changes that may significantly affect the results of the Off-site Consequence Analysis.\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\n\nPer the CalARP Regulations, one worst-case release scenario has been defined for the Gaseous Chlorine Disinfection System.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation.  \n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary\n\nPer the CalARP Regulations, one alternative-case release scenario has been defined for the Gaseous Chlorine Disinfection System.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation.  \n\n4.4    Risk Considerations\n\nAlthough the storage and use of chlorine has inherent potential risks and the release scenarios can potentially reach sensitive populations within the community, the CWTP has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst-case type of event non-credible.  In addition to "

The facility has chlorine detectors that activate a Scrubber System.\n\n4.5    Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\nAs part of the implementation of the CalARP/EPA RMP Program for the Chlorination System, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by CWTP to manage process safety issues associated with the use of chlorine for water treatment.  Furthermore, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.\n\nThe facility maximum intended inventory of chlorine is 20,000 lbs.  Therefore, the regulated substance is over the 2,500-lbs. threshold for EPA RMP, the 1,500-lbs. threshold for Cal/OSHA PSM and the 100-lbs. state threshold for the CalARP Program.  As a result, the chlorine covered process is subject to CalARP Program Level 3, EPA RMP Program Level 3, and Cal/OSHA PSM.\n\nThe Prevention Program 3 elements include:\n\n?    19 CCR ? 2760.1 Process Safety Information (PSI)\n\n?    19 CCR ? 2760.2 Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n?    19 CCR ? 2760.3 Operating Procedures (OP)\n\n?    19 CCR ? 2760.4 Training (TRN)\n\n?    19 CCR ? 2760.5 Mechanical Integrity (MI)\n\n?    19 CCR ? 2760.6 Management of Change (MOC)\n\n?    19 CCR ? 2760.7 Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\n?    19 CCR ? 2760.8 Compliance Audits (CA)\n\n?    19 CCR ? 2760.9 Incident Investigation (II)\n\n?    19 CCR ? 2760.10 Employee Participation (EP)\n\n?    19 CCR ? 2760.11 Hot Work Permit (HWP)\n\n?    19 CCR ? 2760.12 Contractors (CON)\n"

The CWTP has submitted a Hazardous Materials Business Plan in order to coordinate with the local emergency planning and response agencies to ensure that in an event of an emergency they are properly prepared and have knowledge of the system.\n\n4.8    External Events Analysis\n\nPursuant to the requirements of California Code of Regulations, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, Section 2745.7 (q), general events external to the plant that can conceivably cause a release of chlorine were addressed by the PHA.  \n\n4.9    Planned Changes To Improve Safety \n\nThe Compliance Audit has been conducted to examine any deficiencies at the Program 3 facility improve the safety program.  Planned changes to improve safety are listed as recommendations in the October 2019 Compliance Audit Report.\n\n4.10    Flammables: Worst Case \n\nThe use of flammable materials at the CWTP facility is not encompassed by either the federal or state RMP requirements.  Therefore, this section is not applicable.  \n\n4.11    Flammables: Alternative Release \n\nThe use of flammable materials at the CWTP facility is not encompassed by either the federal or state RMP requirements.  Therefore, this section is not applicable.\n\n\n\nThe PHA was due May 2019 but is scheduled to be completed in February 2020 so that the anniversary date of both the Water Treatment Plant and the other Calexico facility may have the same anniversary date for future program maintenance.
