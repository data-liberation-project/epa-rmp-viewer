The sulfur is generated because oil contains significant quantities of sulfur that must be removed to produce clean burning gasoline and diesel.  The fuel products are also stored in onsite storage prior to shipping, and any non-hydrocarbon products e.g. sulfur is also stored prior to shipping.  The facility also has the utility and support systems required providing for safe operation of the facility.\n\nThe RMP contains two parts required for submittal:\n* RMP Executive Summary, Prevention Program Summary, and Management System\n* RMP Data Elements\n\nThe RMP effort at the facility was divided into three phases.  First, the facility determined which processes were covered by the RMP regulation.  The results of this study are published in the report titled Phase I: Inventory Determination which measured the quantities of regulated substances to determine which processes are subject to RMP.  Next, the facility conducted the required hazard assessment as defined by the regulation.  The hazard assessment modeled accidental release scenarios that provided the refinery with insight into the potential for onsite processes to affect the surrounding community and the environment.   Finally, Phase III of the RMP effort is provided in this document.  It contains the executive summary of the overall RMP effort at the facility, a synopsis of the prevention program, a five-year accident history and summary of the management systems in place to implement and maintain the facility's risk management measures.\n\nThe RMP submission documents are updated in this submission (August, 2003) from the original submission in 1999, to include changes such as:\n\n* Change of facility ownership\n* Addition of refinery units, including the addition of the Fluidized Catalytic Cracking (FCC) Unit, the FCC Gasoline Merox Unit, and"

For regulated substances where emergency response planning guidelines (ERPG) values have been established, RMP requires that the ERPG-2 value be used as the toxic endpoint.  RMP also requires an offsite consequence analysis for potential releases of flammable materials.  In modeling flammable materials, the stationary source is required to present distances to endpoints resulting from any of the following:\n\n* Explosion: Overpressure of 1 psig.\n* Radiant Heat/Fire: Radiant heat of 5 kW/m2 for 40 seconds.\n* Lower Flammability Limit: a lower flammability limit as provided in NFPA documents or other generally recognized sources.\n\nIn addition, the facility has modeled alternative release scenarios (ARSs), to show release scenarios that may have more realistic chance of occurrence.

As part of the ongoing PSM Program, the facility documents and tracks all incidents and near-misses that occur within the facility.  This incident database serves as the basis for the five-year accident history.\n\nRMP requires facilities to report any incident from a covered process involving a regulated substance and resulting in any of the following:\n\n* Onsite deaths, injuries, or significant property damage\n* Offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, or environmental damage\n\nThe Facility has had no such accidents in the preceding 5 years.  This is a strong indication of the successful risk management program in practice at the facility.\n\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the refinery.

HF Laser Detectors installed in the acid section of the Alkylation Unit.  These provide a quick detection of a hydrofluoric acid release, and allow operators and the emergency response team to respond accordingly.\n\n2. Acid Inventory Management System implemented in the acid section of the Alkylation Unit, allows operators to transfer hydrofluoric acid from process unit equipment to a single safe storage location. If a leak were to occur within the process equipment, the operator can activate the emergency acid inventory management systems (AIMS) to reduce the duration of an acid release, and to store the acid in a safe location until the equipment can be repaired.  When the system has been repaired, the acid in the emergency system can be safely transferred back into the process, without requiring any disposal of material.\n\n3. As a result of the Y2K Task Force, the facility experienced no upsets, environmental impacts and no safety concerns as a result of the potential Year 2000 data change problems in electrical equipment.  The changes made to the facility and programs put in place as a result of the Y2K Task Force improve the reliability of the facility's safety systems in the unlikely event of future troubles with power supply, field instrumentation, or other electrical control systems.\n\n4.

It receives crude oil, which it processes into petroleum products, including gasoline, transportation fuels, LPG, and oils.  In addition to the flammable materials associated with crude oil processing, the facility uses hydrofluoric acid in the Alkylation Unit, which is a standard refining application.  Other toxic chemicals, such as ammonia and sulfuric acid, are present in quantities far below the regulated threshold amount.  As well, the processing of the crude oil results in the generation of hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, and mercaptans, none of which exceed the threshold quantities.  A Sulfur Recovery Unit processes the hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide to recover sulfur for sale and to limit SO2 and CO2 releases to atmosphere at quantities below the allowable limits.\n\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThe federal Risk Management Program requires ConocoPhillips Company, Ferndale Refinery (ConocoPhillips) to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for any processes containing regulated substances above threshold quantity (TQ) at the Ferndale Refinery.  The Ferndale Refinery handles hazardous materials onsite, and recognizes a responsibility to safely operate the facility in order to protect the surrounding community, employees, and the environment.  The facility has taken a proactive stance to promote the overall safe operation of the processes, with programs to prevent accidents from occurring, planning for emergencies, and maintaining the equipment needed if an emergency does occur.  The RMP formalizes existing programs and procedures so that these programs may be reviewed more efficiently.\n\nThe Ferndale Refinery processes oil into gasoline and refining products.  The facility receives oil from many sources via ship or pipeline, stores it in tanks onsite, and then processes the oil into products to be shipped elsewhere by pipeli"
