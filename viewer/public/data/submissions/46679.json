      "SummaryText": "BACKGROUND\n\nChurch & Dwight Co., Inc. (C&D) is engaged in the manufacture and sale of a diversified line of consumer and health care products.  C&D began its operation at the North Brunswick Distribution Center in July 2000.  The C&D North Brunswick Distribtion Center consists of administrative offices, warehouse storage and shipping areas.  There are no manufacturing activities at this location.\n\nThe North Brunswick Distribution Center includes 152,000 square feet of warehouse storage capacity and is situated in a commercial zone surrounded by several other distribution facilities.  The warehouse operates five days per week, 16-hours per day, and employes approximately 40 people.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\n\nThe operations affected by the Risk Management Plan (RMP) involve the receipt and storage of aerosol product in consumer size containers.  Product is moved within the warehouse via forklift trucks.\n\nVarious hydrocarbons are used as propellants in the aerosol product.  The hydrocarbon propellants are defined by the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) as hazardous materials.  The USEPA enforces regulations designed to minimize the potential for an accidental release associated with handling hazardous materials.  Additionally, the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) enforces accident prevention regulations to protect employees.  The aerosol product propellants are listed as hazardous due to flammability.\n\nACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe North Brunswick Distribution Center has no history of accidential releases associated with the regulated hazardous materials.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nIn accordance with the USEPA regulation and results of the hazard assessment, the North Brunswick Distribution Center is classified as a Program 1 facility.  Program 1 facilities are considered by the USEPA to present a minimal risk to the community.\n\nC&D has developed programs to comply with required environmental, health, and safety standards.  C&D takes a systematic, proac"

These include an early suppression, fast response sprinkler system installed throughout the warehouse.  Aerosol storage racks are equipped with in-rack sprinkler systems.  All of C&D's forklift truck operators are trained and certified.  The firewater and sprinkler systems are inspected annually by an outside independent company.  \n\nEMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE\n\nC&D has an emergency response plan detailing procedures to respond to accidential releases and other emergencies.  The plan is tested on a regular basis through exercises and drills.  The plan has been shared with the local Office of Emergency Management for North Brunswick Township.\n\nIn the event of an emergency affecting the local community, C&D will work closely with local, county, and state agencies to help ensure public safety.  These agencies take the lead in informing the public on appropriate actions in the event of an emergency.\n\nPLANNED CHANGE"
