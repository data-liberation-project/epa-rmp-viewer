Public and environmental receptors that could possibly be affected by the release scenarios were determined through the use of MARPLOT mapping system software.  Population estimates were generated using MARPLOT with data from the 2020 US Census. \n\n- The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention\n\nButterball Jonesboro has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68.  To meet these necessary requirements Butterball has implemented their Process Safety Management program through the written guidelines stated in the OSHA PSM Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119. \n\n- Accident History\n\nThere have been no ammonia related incidents at the Butterball Jonesboro facility within the last five years that have resulted in on, or off site property damage, injuries or deaths.\n\n\n- Emergency Response Program\n\nThis Butterball facility has developed an Emergency Response Plan.  It is a detailed document that discusses the role of employees in an emergency.  The plan outlines specific procedures for evacuation of plant personnel.  All emergency response personnel, (HAZMAT TEAM) have completed required emergency training in accordance with 29 CFR1910.120.  \n\n- Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nButterball Jonesboro currently has no changes planned for the ammonia refrigeration process at this time.   However, the process will be subjected to periodic process hazard analysis reviews for the purpose of identifying potential hazards and implementing the necessary improvement to provide a safer system. Butterball personnel will also periodically review all potential opportunities to improve the safety of our personnel, the surrounding community, and the ammonia refrigeration process."

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n- Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nButterball Jonesboro is committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is evident in our accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated process. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible accidental releases of regulated substances. However, if such an accidental release does occur, we are coordinated with the Jonesboro Fire Department and the Craighead County Local Emergency Planning Committee for emergency response support.\n\n\n- The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Butterball Jonesboro facility produces deli meat products for deli and foodservice distribution. Presently Anhydrous Ammonia is the only RMP regulated substance present at the facility above a threshold quantity.  Ammonia is utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-loop refrigeration system. The system's purpose is to provide refrigeration and cold storage capabilities for Butterball processing operations.  Due to the  and characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration system, Butterball Jonesboro is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\n\n- Offsite Consequence Analysis \n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario have been completed and documentation is contained in Section 2 and 3 of this RMP Submit.\n\nTo evaluate the worst case and alternative release scenarios, EPA's RMP Comp Hazardous Release software was utilized exclusively. The RMP Comp models are referenced in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance as an acceptable model for the release scenario estimation process.\n\nAs specified in the RMP Guidance, the worst case and alternate case release scenari"
