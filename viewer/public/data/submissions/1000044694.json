To insure safe operation and release prevention at Tyson Foods GLEN ALLEN, VA., this facility has implemented The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations Chemical Process Safety Management Program 29 CFR 1910.119.  All operators of systems containing the threshold amount of hazardous chemicals will undergo Chemical Process Safety Management training and operator training specific to the system. \r\nTo insure proper response to emergency situations, Tyson Foods GLEN ALLEN, VA., has implemented Emergency Action Plans as required by The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations 29 CFR 1910.38(a) and Emergency Response Plans 29 CFR 1910.120. All safety personnel and operators of the process will be trained in these emergency procedures.\r\n\r\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\r\n      Poultry slaughter plant & further processing.\r\n      Regulated substances: Ammonia.\r\n      Amount of regulated substance: 78,000LBS.\r\n  \r\n3.  The general accidental release prevention program.\r\n     This facility complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administrations Chemical Process Safety Management 29 CFR 1910.119 and the Environmental Protection Agencies Risk Management Program 40 CFR Part 68.  For ammonia systems Tyson Foods, Inc. has adopted the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration guidelines for system operation and maintenance.  Tyson Foods Inc. uses the IIAR Basic Ammonia Refrigeration Training Series for all operators.  \r\n \r\n4.  Five-year accident history.\r\n      \r\n       On 4/11/13, A Refrigeration Operator was performing routine valve replacement on roof that included an oil draining task.

      "SummaryText": "ents of the bucket into a roof drain. The drain path lead to the contents of the containment bucket to production areas in the processing plant below culminating in a sump pit where the contents gased off when mixed with other drain waters. The plant did not evacuate, however Emergency Services were called when two TM's reported the Health Services with suspected exposure. The two TM's were taken to local hospital where they were observed and released. \r\n        \r\n5.   The emergency response program.\t\r\nA written Emergency Response Plan has been developed and is on record at the Facility.  This plan includes Pre-Emergency Planning with Outside Agencies, Personnel Roles and Lines of Incident Command Authority, Facility Hazard Analysis and Emergency Prevention, Safe Distances and Places of Refuge, Site Security and Control, Evacuation Routes and Procedures, Decontamination Procedures, provisions for Emergency Medical Treatment, Emergency Notification Procedures, Chemical Response Procedures, Post Incident Critique, and Personal Protective Clothing and Emergency Equipment. The plan also contains detailed procedures for immediate notification to local response teams.\r\n     The facility currently has a cooperative agreement with both Hanover County Fire & EMS and Henrico County HAZMAT for all emergency response needs. Furthermore, Hanover County Fire & EMS has established regional response guidelines for Hazardous Materials and Technical Rescue incidents. Under the request of the Hanover Incident Commander, apparatus for Richmond Fire, Henrico Division of Fire, and Chesterfield Fire and EMS may be called to our facility. We conduct periodic joint meetings, visits, plant tours at a minimum of annually with both Hanover and Henrico counties fire, EMS and Hazmat teams.\r\n\r\n     \t\r\n6.  Planned changes to improve safety.\r\n      (CONTINUE TO UPGRADE SYSTEM)"
