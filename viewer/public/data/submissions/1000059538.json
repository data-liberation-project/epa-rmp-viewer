In fact, IP has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance and injuries and damage from a release of a hazardous substance.\n\nIP limits the use of hazardous substances.  Before using a hazardous substance at IP, less hazardous alternatives are considered. Part of IP'S RMP compliance philosophy has been the reduction of the use of hazardous substances covered under this regulation. When a hazardous substance is used, IP considers the potential for this substance to adversely affect IP workers, the public, and the environment and takes steps to prevent any such effects.\n\nIP works to prevent releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  When a hazardous substance is used at IP, the equipment is designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.

Executive Summary \n\nInternational Paper Company (IP) is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for IP workers, the public, and the environment. As a demonstration of that commitment, IP has developed and implemented Environmental and Workplace Health and Safety Policies to serve as guiding principles for all it's employees and operations. The Environmental Policy includes the following:\n\nIP strives to minimize the environmental impacts of all our operations, processes, and products in a manner responsive to the needs of our shareholders, customers, employees, the communities in which we operate, and the public.\n\nThe Workplace Health and Safety Policy further includes:\n\nThe protection of our people and property as well as the prevention of all accidents, injuries, and illnesses, are core values at International Paper Company. As such, they are also key considerations in everything we do. Our success depends greatly on a work environment that is safe and healthy for all employees, visitors, contractors, and the residents of the communities in which we operate.\n\nIP believes that following these policies is the responsibility of every employee. IP has put in place an organizational structure to demonstrate its commitment to that belief. \n\nAs part of this commitment, IP has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at IP and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at IP.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirement of the"

In addition, IP works with the local fire department and with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to help ensure that injuries and/or environmental damage will not occur if a release does occur.\n\nThe safety program at IP consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule.  This RMPlan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at IP that are required by the RMP rule.\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIP is committed to the safety of workers and the public, and the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  IP implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes at IP; and programs to evaluate the hazards at IP.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, IP controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help limit injury to the public or the environment.  IP provides response training to IP personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local Ermergency Response \nagencies. The Pensacola Mill maintains a Hazardous Materials Response team that is trained and equipped to respond to on-site chemical releases. Response activities have also been discussed with the LEPC.\n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, IP established a management system headed by the mill's Operations Manager to oversee safety-related activities.\n\n1.2 IP and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Pensacola Mill is an integrated pulp and paper mill primarily involved in"

Beginning in 1992, IP formally implemented the 14 elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) prevention program. In 1996, the EPA RMP rule established two levels of prevention program requirements.  IP has implemented the prevention program requirements, which are as follows:\n\nProgram 3 level processes - essentially the same as OSHA PSM, except that the program also focuses on protecting the public and the environment.  Program 3 requires 12 of the 14 elements of the OSHA PSM regulation.  This prevention program has been established for the chlorine dioxide generation and distribution process.\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of IP'S prevention program that address the EPA RMP rule prevention program requirements. \n\n1.4.1 Program 3 Prevention Program\n\nThe Pensacola Mill Program 3 prevention program, which applies to the chlorine dioxide generation and distribution process, consists of the following 12 elements:\n\n1.\tProcess Safety Information.  IP maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of the covered processes.

The operating procedures are used both to help in operating the covered processes and as a training guide for both new and experienced operators.  Operating procedures are updated at least annually to ensure they reflect current operating conditions.\n\n4.\tTraining. The mill trains workers to perform their assigned tasks safely and effectively. The IP training program includes both initial and refresher training that covers (1) a general overview of the process, (2) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process, and (3) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices.  Oral reviews and written tests are used to verify that an employee understands the process operation prior to job assignment.\n\nThe operators are consulted annually during operating procedure reviews to evaluate the effectiveness and need for additional training.  Recommendations from the operators are reviewed, and changes to the training program are implemented, as appropriate.\n\n5.\tMechanical Integrity.  IP maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment.  This is accomplished by: (1) an inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before the equipment fails, (2) a quality assurance program to help ensure that new and replacement equipment meet the design standards required for service in the covered processes and (3) utilizing personnel who are specially trained to maintain process equipment.  \n\n6.\tManagement of Change.

Many of the operating parameters are included in the operating procedures to help with the safe operation of the process.  These documents are used (1) to train employees, (2) to perform process hazards analyses, and (3) to help maintain the equipment.\n\n2. \tProcess Hazard Analysis. The Pensacola Mill performs and periodically updates process hazard analyses (PHAs) of the covered processes to help identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.  A team composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a leader with process hazard analyses experience is assembled to analyze the hazards of the process.  IP primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) technique, supplemented with checklists, to perform this analysis.  The PHA team prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations.  Responsibility to resolve the recommendations is assigned to area personnel and, when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the process are implemented.\n\n3\tOperating Procedures.  IP operators, process engineers and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safely performed.  The operating procedures (1) are used to train employees and (2) serve as reference guides for appropriate"

      "SummaryText": "e prevented.  IP trains employees to identify and report any incident requiring investigation.  An investigation team is assembled, and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident. The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process improvements are implemented.\n\n10.\tEmployee Participation.  The Pensacola Mill developed a written employee participation program for covered processes to help ensure that IP workers participate in the development and continuous improvement of these prevention program elements. Employees are consulted on and informed about various aspects of the RMP rule prevention program, including PHAs and operating procedures. \n\n11.\tHot Work Permits.  IP uses a hot work permit program to control spark- or flame-producing activities that could result in fires or explosions in covered processes at the Pensacola Mill. IP reviewed OSHA's fire prevention and protection requirements in 29 CFR 1910.252(a) and created a Hot Work Permit Form to comply with these requirements.  Personnel who are to perform hot work are required to fill out the Hot Work Permit Form.  The Shift Supervisor reviews the completed form before work can begin.  Training in the use of the Hot Work Permit Form is included in the IP safe work practices orientation.\n\n12.\tContractors.  IP has established Contractor Guidelines for Safety and Health to outline expectations related to contractor work, at Pensacola Mill including work on the covered processes.  The program reviews the safety record of all contractors to help ensure that IP only hires contractors who can safely perform the desired job tasks.  IP explains to the contract supervisors the hazards of the process on which they and their employees will work, IP safe work practices, and IP emergency response procedures.  IP requires that the contractor supervisors also train each of their employees prior to beginning their work on a covered process.  IP periodically"

The following paragraphs describe some of these safety features. \n\nChlorine dioxide gas is produced in the chlorine dioxide generator and piped to a water absorber column, where a 1.0 wt % chlorine dioxide solution is generated. Chlorine dioxide is produced at the IP-Pensacola Mill and stored as a dilute water solution to avoid transporting large quantities of the solution.  Storing the chemical in a water solution greatly reduces the potential for off-site impact. Containment diking and sewers are provided in all areas where chlorine dioxide is used. Detectors and alarms provide continuous monitoring in all areas where the potential for chlorine dioxide exists, providing early detection and helping to ensure a quick response in the event of a leak.\n\n1.5 Five-Year Accident History\n\nIP has completed a five-year accident history for the chlorine dioxide generation and distribution process at the Pensacola Mill.  There have been no accidents or releases involving a reportable quantity of chlorine dioxide at the Pensacola Mill in the last five years.  In fact, there has never been a release of a reportable quantity of chlorine dioxide at the Pensacola Mill.  \n\n1.6 Emergency Response Programs\n\nIP has established a written emergency response program to help safely respond to accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for:\n\n* informing the local fire department and the public about accidental releases that could reasonably result in offsite consequences\n* providing proper first aid and emergency medical treatment to treat accidental human"
