The Emergency Action Plan incorporates the local fire department as emergency responders.\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances Handled:  The anhydrous ammonia is stored in one 30,000-gallon aboveground container, with the capacity to contain 140196 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nWorst-Case Scenario: The worst case toxic release scenario was evaluated using Degadis model.  The scenario involves the release of 140,196 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, liquefied under pressure, which represents release of anhydrous ammonia in an amount equal to the maximum capacity of the container.  Default assumptions for the RMP COMP software were used: 77 degrees F, 3.4 MPH wind speed, and stability class F.  In addition, an urban setting was used (based on actual site conditions), and no mitigation measures were included.  The release duration was 10 minutes.  The toxic endpoint for this scenario is 1.1 miles (1.8 kilometers).
