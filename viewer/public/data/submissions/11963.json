      "SummaryText": "alternative release scenario for hydrazine hydrate (solution) involves a release from production process storage.  The scenario involves the release of 32,000 pounds of hydrazine hydrate (solution).  Toxic liquid is assumed to be immediately released to form a pool of height 1 cm, from which evaporation takes place. Passive mitigation controls such as dikes and sumps are not taken into account to calculate the potential for offsite impact. Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the endpoint of 0.011 mg/L of hydrazine hydrate (solution) is 0.19 miles. If the passive mitigation controls in place, i.e. dikes, were accounted for and the active mitigation deluge system was considered, the release would not have an offsite impact.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for flammable substances, as a class, involves a release from storage of methyl butene in the methyl butene storage process.  The scenario involves the release of 132,000 pounds of methyl butene.  Passive mitigation systems such as dikes have been considered when evaluating this scenario.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  The maximum distance of 0.41 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.  \n\nThe representative alternative release scenario involves a release from storage of methyl butene.

      "SummaryText": "General Executive Summary for Chemical, Manufacturing and Oil Refining Facilities\n\n\n\n\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Practices\nWe the Agriculture Division, are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate measures to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our highly trained on site emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  Bayer has maintained a long-standing working relationship with the Kansas City emergency response team HAZMAT 71 to insure their support in the event of an unexpected release.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nThe primary activities at our Hawthorn Road site are the formulation and manufacture of crop protection chemicals.  Of the 140 RMP regulated chemicals we have 8 chemicals present at our facility in quantities sufficient to be regulated by this rule.  These chemicals are essential raw materials for the production of crop protection intermediate chemicals and include carbon disulfide, chlorine, ethyl mercaptan, formaldehyde (solution), hydrazine hydrate, methyl butene, phosphorus trichloride, and vinyl chloride. Chlorine is also used for the manufacture of sodium hypochlorite, which is the oxidizing agent for one of our herbicides, or is either sold as bleach or used as a vent gas-scrubbing agent on site. \n\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release scenario(s),including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.  \n\nTo evaluate the worst case and alternate scenarios, we used the look-up tables and equations provided"

The scenarios were selected in accordance with the EPA guidance documents.  All chemicals are submitted as Program Level 3 for both toxic and flammable scenarios.  The worst case was evaluated using the required Class F meteorological conditions with 1.5 meters/second wind speed.  The alternate case used neutral weather conditions Class D meteorological conditions wind speed 3.0 meters/second. \n\nThe worst case toxic release scenario submitted involves a release from a chlorine rail car.  The scenario involves the release of 180,000 pounds of liquid chlorine which is evaporated over 10 minutes. The maximum distance of 14.2 miles under worst case weather conditions is obtained corresponding to an endpoint concentration of 0.0087 mg/L (3 PPM).\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine involves the release of gaseous chlorine near the point of use in the production process.  The scenario involves the release of 83 pounds of chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as the enclosure are taken into account to calculate the potential for offsite impact reducing the release to the environment to 43 pounds over 10 minutes.  The release is assumed to be controlled by active mitigation measures that include emergency shutdown systems.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L (3 PPM) of chlorine is 0.21 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for carbon disulfide involves failure of a transfer hose resulting in the release of 1770 pounds of carbon disulfide.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be immediately released to form a pool of height 1 cm, from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated over 14.51 minutes.

Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.16 mg/L of carbon disulfide is 0.27 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for phosphorus trichloride involves a release from the 170,000 pound storage vessel.  The scenario involves the failure of a transfer hose resulting in the release of 253 pounds of phosphorus trichloride.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be immediately released to form a pool of height 1 cm, from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 37 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as dikes are taken into account to calculate the potential for offsite impact.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by active mitigation measures that include emergency shutdown systems.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the endpoint of 0.028 mg/L of phosphorus trichloride is 0.08 miles.  Currently this process is being relocated to another production area.  All reviews will be brought up to date prior to startup.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for formaldehyde (solution) involves a release from raw material storage.  The scenario involves the release of 10,415 pounds of formaldehyde (solution).  Toxic liquid is assumed to be immediately released to form a pool of height 1 cm, from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as dikes and sumps are not taken into account to calculate the potential for offsite impact. Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the endpoint of 0.012 mg/L of formaldehyde (solution) is 0.19 miles.
