(DXI) is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations as well as implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\nOur emergency response program includes procedures for notification of the local fire department; notification of any potentially affected neighbors; and notification of local, state and federal agencies.   Safety is an essential part of our operations, the safety devices built-in to the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the extensive training of our personnel.\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nDXI is a 52-year-old company whose primary activities encompass distributing and repackaging inorganic chemicals and compressed gases as well as manufacturing water treatment products. For example, chlorine is used to produce sodium hypochlorite commonly know as household bleach.   We are headquartered in Houston, Texas and operate more than 20 plants across the United States.\n \nWe have 3 regulated substances at our facility: Ammonia (anhydrous), Chlorine, and Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous).  DXI transfers these materials into 150-lb. cylinders, 800-lb. containers, and ton containers for use by our customers.\n\nThe maximum inventories of these substances at this facility are:\n\nChlorine  - 3,500,000 lbs.\nSulfur dioxide (anhydrous) - 900,000 lbs.\nAmmonia (anhydrous) -"

The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used EPA's RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nExecutive Summary\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Sulfur Dioxide repackaging.  The scenario involves releasing the entire contents of a railcar in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  This release would reach the toxic endpoint (0.0078 mg/l or 3 ppm) and public receptors.\n\nOne alternative release scenario has been submitted for each toxic substance present in Program 3 processes.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Chlorine is the failure of a 1/2\" hose on the filling station in the repackaging process.  This would release material in a gaseous form over 15 minutes.  It is assumed to be controlled by active mitigation measures that include emergency shutdown systems. This release would reach the toxic endpoint (0.0087 mg/l or 3 ppm) and public receptors.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) is the failure of a 1/2\" hose on the filling station in the repackaging process. .  This would release material in a gaseous form over 15 minutes.  It is assumed to be controlled by active mitigation measures that include emergency shutdown systems.

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nDXI maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the What if/Checklist (combined).  A team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated every 5 years as \nExecutive Summary\n\n\nrequired or as necessary.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA was conducted on 6/1/99.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, DXI maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, and normal shutdown.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nDXI has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.
