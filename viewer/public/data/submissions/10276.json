Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Prinsburg Farmers Coop - West Finishing Facility in Prinsburg, MN are strongly committed\nto employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our\ncomprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation,\noperating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our\nfacility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated\nsubstances.  If such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to\ncontrol and mitigate the effects of the release.  We also coordinate our response efforts with the\nPrinsburg Fire Department, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include turkey production.  We have propane  stored in one 12,000-\nand one10,500-gallon tank located at our west finishing facility in Prinsburg (Figure 1).  The\nmaximum amount stored is 20,250 gallons (85,515.75 pounds) at the maximum fill capacity of 90\n%.\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\nWe utilized RMP PRO for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite\nconsequence analysis for our facility.  The following details these scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the largest\npropane storage tank (45,608.4 lbs.) in gaseous form over a 10-minute period.  At Class F\natmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance to an endpoint of 1 psi\noverpressure"

This amount of overpressure can cause partial demolition of\nhouses and can result in serious injury to people within this distance.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a 30-minute release of propane from a product line that\ncontacts an ignition source and detonates, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under neutral\nweather conditions, the maximum distance to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 0.13 miles (Figure\n3).\n\n     4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention\nrequirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements\nof the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\nProcess Safety Information\nPrinsburg Farmers Coop - West Finishing Facility maintains a detailed record of safety information\nthat describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with\nall processes (Appendix D).\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are\nidentified and controlled effectively.  Any findings from the hazard analysis are addressed in a\ntimely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nPrinsburg Farmers Coop - West Finishing Facility maintains written operating procedures to ensure\nthat activities within our covered processes are conducted safely.  These procedures address various\nmodes of operation; the information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators\ninvolved in the processes (Appendix B).\n\nTraining\nPrinsburg Farmers Coop - West Finishing Facility has a comprehensive training program in place\nto ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures\nassociated with these processes.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nPrinsburg Farmers Coop - West Finishing Facility conducts documented maintenance checks on\nprocess equipmen"

Examples of process equipment that\nwould receive maintenance checks include:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief\nand vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Any equipment deficiencies\nidentified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner (Appendix C).\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Prinsburg Farmers Coop - West Finishing Facility to manage\nchanges in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators,\nmaintenance personnel or other employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process\nconditions are promptly notified of the modification and offered training to deal with it.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPrinsburg Farmers Coop - West Finishing Facility routinely conducts pre-startup safety reviews\nrelated to new processes and modifications in established processes.  These reviews are conducted\nto confirm that construction, equipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for\nsafe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nPrinsburg Farmers Coop - West Finishing Facility conducts compliance audits on a regular basis to\ndetermine whether the provisions of the plan, as set out under 40 CFR part 68, are being\nimplemented.
