The Depot Manager is responsible for ensuring that Helena Staff are properly trained in the implementation of the Prevention Program which includes Safety Information, Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigations, and Emergency Contingency Plans.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nHelena's Memphis, MO Facility is a non-responding facility. Helena has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency response agency and local fire department.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThere have been no on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place, in the past five (5) years because of the ammonia operations at the Memphis, MO Facility.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe Risk Management Plan implemented by Helena Chemical Company at the Memphis, MO Facility complies with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r). The RMP will be updated as the Memphis, MO Facility adds, deletes, or changes processes. The Emergency Response Program has been coordinated with the Scotland County LEPC and the Memphis Fire Department.  \r\n\r\nNOTE: Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 of the standard RMP produced by EPA's RMP Submit Program are not applicable to the Memphis, MO Facility."

      "SummaryText": "The Helena Memphis, MO Facility has submitted this updated electronic RMP in compliance with the provisions of the Clean Air Act 112 (r) as codified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency at 40 CFR Part 68. Standards codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration at 29 CFR 1910.119 are not applicable to the operations at this facility because the facility is operated as a retail operation and is exempt from the OSHA standards.  However, the OSHA standards at 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, are applicable and are included in the Risk Management Program (RMPr) document that is implemented by this Facility.\r\n\r\nThis electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the Memphis, MO Facility located approximately 1.8 miles north of Memphis, MO at 19696 County Road 564, MO. 63555.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Memphis, MO Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Memphis, MO Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\r\n\r\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\r\n\r\nHelena is submitting this as a correction to update the owner/operator address and nurse tank inventory. The address update reflects the update received from the 911 system. It is important to note that the physical location of the Facility has not been moved from the original location. Since the last update, the Facility has reduced its inventory of stationary storage tanks and nurse tanks.\r\n\r\nFACILITY\r\n\r\nThe Memphis, MO Facility is a retail agricultural chemical facility and operates one (1) covered process that includes Storage and Handling of anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is transported to the Facility via a commercial tanker truck and then transferred to (1) 30,000-gallon stationary storage tank.  The commercial"

      "SummaryText": "tanker truck operator (Contractor) performs these transfer operations.  \r\n\r\nHelena stores the anhydrous ammonia in the on-site stationary storage tank and then transfers the anhydrous ammonia from the storage tanks to nurse tanks at point of retail sale to the end user (e.g. the farmer).  This Facility owns and operates (14) 1,000-gallon nurse tanks and (3) 1,465-gallon nurse tanks. Helena performs this operation in accordance with its RMPr accident prevention program.  \r\n\r\n \r\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nWorst case and alternative case consequence analyses were completed for the single covered process that is operated at this Facility.  The covered process includes anhydrous ammonia Storage and Handling.  The worst case scenario release for the Retail Facility assumes that all the contents in the largest single storage tank are released.  For this Facility, the largest vessel is a 30,000-gallon stationary storage tank.  The release was modeled as if the ammonia tank was punctured on the side at the ground level. The resulting release of ammonia was modeled as a ground level horizontal jet.\r\n\r\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario was completed for the storage and handling covered process as well.  The alternative release for the Storage and Handling assumes a 30-second release from a ruptured 2-inch transfer hose caused by an impact from a vehicle or some other source on the liquid ammonia transfer hose during a transfer operation.  Although this event is classified as an alternative scenario, even an accident of this type is unlikely to occur due to the safety equipment (i.e. emergency shutoff valves and excess flow valves on the commercial tanker truck; and emergency shutoff valve and excess flow valves on the storage tank side of the bulkhead) and operating procedures that Helena uses to safeguard ammonia transfer operations.\r\n\r\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Depot Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Facility.
