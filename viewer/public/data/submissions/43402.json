THE  WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\n\n\n     A. THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA WOULD BE THE RELEASE\nOF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF A STORAGE TANK RELEASED AS A GAS OVER 10 MINUTES.  THE\nMAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 120,000 POUNDS WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF \nTHE STORAGE TANK AT 85 PERCENT CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS. THE DISTANCE TO\nTHE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS 1.09 MILES.\n\n\n     B. THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA BASED ON THE HAZARD\nREVIEW IS A 2 MINUTE RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A 2 INCH PIPE. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT \n(POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS .56 MILES\n\n\n4. THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM.\n\n\n     THE FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF \"SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE\nSTORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA K-61.1\", PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN\nNATIONAL STANDARDS INSTITUTE, INC.
