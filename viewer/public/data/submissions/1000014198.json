This\ndocument provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk\nmanagement activities that we have designed and implemented,\nincluding:\n\n-  A description of our facility and use of substances\nregulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n-  A summary of results from our assessment of the potential\noffsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n-  An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n-  A five-year accident history of accidental release of\nchemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n\n\nOur facility produces a water based Acrylic Emulsion used in\nthe Industrial Coatings Industry as well as some products\nused for paper coatings.  In our process, we use the\nfollowing chemicals that EPA has identified as having the\npotential to cause significant offsite consequences in the\nevent of a substantial accidental release.\n\nToxic Chemicals:\n\nVinyl Acetate\nVA is received via rail car and is stored as a pressurized\nliquid in horizontal tanks capable of holding 165,000lbs.\n(we have 2 tanks)  Procedures are in place so that we do not\noffload a rail car until it can fit into the tanks.  There\nare several manual and automatic safety devices in place,\nand the tanks are vented to a flare system.  All offloading\nis done via a closed loop system so that all vapors are\ncontained.  All offloading is continuously monitored until\ncomplete, and there is a containment under the railcar which\nis piped to a secondary containment pit"

Technicians are involved\n   in writing, reviewing, and updating operating instructions.\n\n-  Training - Training is based on the operating\n   instructions.  Technicians are trained on all new or changed\n   systems, as well as re-qualified on all procedures at least\n   every 3 years.\n\n-  Mechanical Integrity - We have a comprehensive\n   inspection and preventive maintenance system that ensures\n   that equipment maintains its capability to contain the\n   process chemicals.  This system is being continuously\n   improved.\n\n-  Management of Change - We have a detailed, multi-level\n   MOC system that ensures that nothing is changed without\n   input, and that everyone involved knows about it.  Employees\n   at all levels are involved in the operation of the MOC\n   system.\n\n-  Compliance Audits - Compliance audits are performed and\n   actions are entered into a computer based action tracking\n   system to make sure actions are closed in a timely manner\n   and it is available for everyone to see.\n\n-  Incident Investigations - Incident investigations are\n   done on any accident, injury, process upset, or near miss.\n   We use the multi-cause, or root-cause analysis, and all\n   actions and results are tracked.  This information is used\n   to find the problem and make sure that it doesn't happen\n   again.\n\n-  Employee Participation - Employees participate in all\n   aspects of the prevention program.  Employees are involved\n   in HAZOP's, MAPP's, Incident Investigations, and EHS\n   Reviews, or they don't happen.  Employees help write\n   procedures and assist in training.  Technicians and\n   mechanics are expected to attend MOC and EHS Reviews.\n\n-  Contractors - Contractors are selected according to\n   stringent standards of management, competence, corporate\n   guidelines, and most importantly safety.  Contractors are\n   expected to"

The worst case would be a\ncomplete rupture of a tank that would result in a release of\nthe entire tank (if it was full) in 10 minutes.  This would\nproduce a cloud that would not reach the residence or\nschools in Deer Park, but would reach the neighboring sites,\nas well as the San Jacinto Battleground/Monument State Park.\nIt would also reach the Houston Ship Channel.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemical\n\nVinyl"

No additional measures\nare necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accidental\nreleases.  In the event of fire, explosion, or a release of\na regulated substance from the process, entry within the\ndistance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to\npublic emergency responders.  Therefore, public emergency\nresponders should not enter this area except as arranged\nwith the emergency contact indicated in the RMP Plan.  The\nundersigned"
