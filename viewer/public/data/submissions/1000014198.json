We use a combination of accidental\nrelease prevention programs and emergency response planning\nprograms to help ensure the safety of our employees and the\npublic as well as protection of the environment.  This\ndocument provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk\nmanagement activities that we have designed and implemented,\nincluding:\n\n-  A description of our facility and use of substances\nregulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n-  A summary of results from our assessment of the potential\noffsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n-  An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n-  A five-year accident history of accidental release of\nchemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n\n\nOur facility produces a water based Acrylic Emulsion used in\nthe Industrial Coatings Industry as well as some products\nused for paper coatings.  In our process, we use the\nfollowing chemicals that EPA has identified as having the\npotential to cause significant offsite consequences in the\nevent of a substantial accidental release.\n\nToxic Chemicals:\n\nVinyl Acetate\nVA is received via rail car and is stored as a pressurized\nliquid in horizontal tanks capable of holding 165,000lbs.\n(we have 2 tanks)  Procedures are in place so that we do not\noffload a rail car until it can fit into the tanks.  There\nare several manual and automatic safety devices in place,\nand the tanks are vented to a flare system.  All offloading\nis done via a closed loop system so that all vapors are\ncontained.  All offloading is continuously monitored until\ncomplete, and there is a containment under the railcar which\nis piped to a secondary containment pit"

The following brief summaries\nof these scenarios including information about the key\nadministrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the\nexposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemical\n\nAcrylonitrile -\nEven though the tank can hold up to 176,000 pounds, we use an\ninventory method that we only order 40,000 pounds at a time\nand keep the inventory low.  The worst case would be a\ncomplete rupture of a tank that would result in a release of\nthe entire tank (if it was full) in 10 minutes.  This would\nproduce a cloud that would not reach the residence or\nschools in Deer Park, but would reach the neighboring sites,\nas well as the San Jacinto Battleground/Monument State Park.\nIt would also reach the Houston Ship Channel.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemical\n\nVinyl"

Our management\nsystems address each of the key features of successful\nprevention programs including:\n\n-  Process Safety Information - Each of our processes have\n   a comprehensive information package that is used to guide\n   the choice of process and control technologies, operating\n   parameters, and inspection intervals for equipment such as\n   pipes, vessels, and protective systems.\n\n-  HAZOP - These HAZOP's were and are used to define the\n   scenarios used in this report.  The accident scenarios found\n   in HAZOP's form the basis of additional analyses which allow\n   us to ensure that the integrity levels of all protective\n   systems are high enough to protect both our employees and\n   our neighbors.  They also help us target the most important\n   equipment for more frequent inspections.\n\n-  Operating Procedures - Operating procedures are in\n   place for"

Technicians are involved\n   in writing, reviewing, and updating operating instructions.\n\n-  Training - Training is based on the operating\n   instructions.  Technicians are trained on all new or changed\n   systems, as well as re-qualified on all procedures at least\n   every 3 years.\n\n-  Mechanical Integrity - We have a comprehensive\n   inspection and preventive maintenance system that ensures\n   that equipment maintains its capability to contain the\n   process chemicals.  This system is being continuously\n   improved.\n\n-  Management of Change - We have a detailed, multi-level\n   MOC system that ensures that nothing is changed without\n   input, and that everyone involved knows about it.  Employees\n   at all levels are involved in the operation of the MOC\n   system.\n\n-  Compliance Audits - Compliance audits are performed and\n   actions are entered into a computer based action tracking\n   system to make sure actions are closed in a timely manner\n   and it is available for everyone to see.\n\n-  Incident Investigations - Incident investigations are\n   done on any accident, injury, process upset, or near miss.\n   We use the multi-cause, or root-cause analysis, and all\n   actions and results are tracked.  This information is used\n   to find the problem and make sure that it doesn't happen\n   again.\n\n-  Employee Participation - Employees participate in all\n   aspects of the prevention program.

No additional measures\nare necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accidental\nreleases.  In the event of fire, explosion, or a release of\na regulated substance from the process, entry within the\ndistance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to\npublic emergency responders.  Therefore, public emergency\nresponders should not enter this area except as arranged\nwith the emergency contact indicated in the RMP Plan.  The\nundersigned "
