Contractors\r\nBoise has established a program to help ensure that contractor activities at the mill are performed in a safe manner.  The Jackson Mill provides training to contractor supervisors on the hazards of the process on which they and their employees will work, and also informs the contractor supervisors of safe work practices and emergency response procedures.  The Jackson Mill requires that the contractor supervisors train each of their employees who will work in the mill before that worker begins work on site.

Boise White Paper, LLC's (Boise's) Jackson Mill has implemented the RMP requirements for the chlorine dioxide system.  \r\n\r\nA Risk Management Plan, as required by the EPA, is included at the end of the main body of this document. It includes a summary of data elements that must be submitted to the EPA for incorporation into the public access database RMP*Info. The Plan includes an Executive Summary that follows EPA's required format.  The purpose of the Plan is to inform the public of the Jackson Mill's proactive stance toward protection of the environment and the surrounding community.\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nThe Jackson Mill is committed to the safety of workers and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Boise implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes at the Jackson Mill; and programs to evaluate the hazards at the Jackson Mill.\r\n\r\nIn the event of an accidental release, Boise controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injury to the public and the environment.  Boise provides response training to mill personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local fire department, police department, and hospital.  Response activities have also been discussed with the Clarke County Emergency Management Agency.\r\n\r\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, Boise has established a management syste"

      "SummaryText": "m headed by the RMP Manager to oversee risk management-related activities.\r\nFacility Information and Regulated Substances\r\nThe Jackson Mill is an integrated bleached Kraft pulp and paper mill located in Jackson, Alabama.  The mill produces approximately 800 tons per day of bleached Kraft pulp.  The mill currently operates one paper machine with capacity of 475 tons per day and a second paper machine with a capacity of 1,400 tons per day.\r\n \r\nA Hazard Assessment was conducted as an initial screening procedure to determine the Program Level (1, 2, or 3) that applies to the Jackson Mill.  The mill currently stores chlorine dioxide in a quantity that exceeds the threshold amount listed in the RMP rule.  \r\n\r\nBecause the mill's chlorine dioxide generation and storage process is covered by OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) rule and because nearby residents (public receptors) lie within the toxic endpoint concentrations of the mill's worst-case release, the chlorine dioxide process is subject to Program 3 requirements of the RMP. \r\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\r\nThe RMP rule requires the Jackson Mill to perform an offsite consequence analysis for the following scenarios.\r\n\u00bf\tOne worst-case release scenario for the toxic substance chlorine dioxide\r\n\u00bf\tOne alternative release scenario for the toxic substance chlorine dioxide\r\nThe following information summarizes this offsite consequence analysis.\r\n\r\nChlorine Dioxide\r\nThe worst case scenario is failure of one storage tank releasing 112,000 gals of a 1% chlorine dioxide with no containment. This release corresponds to approximately 9,341 pounds of ClO2 in each full tank.  The ClO2 volatilizes from the uncontained liquid surface.  Estimating this volatilization rate using a mass transfer relationship yields a release rate of 4.7 pounds per second.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint concentration (1 ppm) is 9.5 miles.  This distance represents the worst-case scenario for the Jackson Mill.  Several residential areas are"

The chlorine dioxide worst-case release scenario affects two environmental receptors:  the Upper Stimpson Wildlife Sanctuary and the Stimpson State Game Sanctuary.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario is the rupture of a 4-inch diameter transfer line leading from the storage tank to the bleach plant.  The solution is pumped through the line at a rate of 500 gallons per minute (gpm). Because of the high vapor pressure of ClO2 and the turbulent action of the spill, all of the ClO2 is assumed to volatilize as soon as the solution impacts the ground.  Assuming that 500 gpm is the spill rate, the emission rate is 0.69 lb/sec of gaseous chlorine dioxide.  For a release duration of 30 minutes, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint concentration (1 ppm) is 1.4 miles.  Several residential areas are located within this distance to the mill, with a population of about 2,140 people.  The chlorine dioxide alternative release scenario affects no environmental receptors.\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nThe Jackson Mill's accident prevention program for the chlorine dioxide process consists of the following 13 elements.\r\n1.

Process / Chemical Safety Information\r\nComprehensive chemical data has been assembled to include regulatory reporting and action thresholds, health hazard and chemical exposure limitations, as well as detailed physical properties of each regulated substance. This information was compiled from numerous sources, and is intended to be a one-stop source for the reader seeking data on these substances. \r\n\r\nProcess safety information was meticulously compiled on the chlorine dioxide process. Hard-to-find specifications are located in one place for easy reference. Details such as Maximum Intended Inventory, Safe Upper and Lower Temperatures, Safe Upper and Lower Pressures, and codes and standards used to design, build and operate the chlorine dioxide process are on file at the mill. \r\n3.  Process Hazard Analysis\r\nA process hazard analysis (PHA) is conducted for the chlorine dioxide process at least once every five years. The process hazard analysis team consists of plant management, process operating and maintenance experts, process design engineers, and mill employees knowledgeable in the PHA method. The PHA method used was a Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP), supplemented by completion of design checklists.\r\n4.  Operating Procedures\r\nStandard operating procedures have been developed, and stringently reviewed by Jackson Mill employees.
