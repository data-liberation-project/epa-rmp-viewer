The Facility Policy:\n\n      The owners, mangement and employees of Cargill, Inc. are commited to the prevention af any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any releases and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information:\n\n     The primary activitiy at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizer for sale to farmers.  The facility is a retail sales operation.\n\n     Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application.  Anhydrous Ammonia is used for crop production nutrients.\n\n3.  The worst case release scenario and the alternate release scenario:\n\n     a.  The worst case release scenario for anydrous ammonia would be the release of the total contents of the rail car used to transport the material to the facility.  \n\n     b.  The alternate release scenario for anhydrous ammonia based on the hazard review is a two minute release from a break in a 3-inch pipe on the on-site storage tank.  \n\n4.  The Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\n     The facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the Standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\n5.  The Five-year Accidetn History:\n\n      There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any death, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelteri"

Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as requried under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\n     c.  Coordinated with local emergecny responders.\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\n     Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
