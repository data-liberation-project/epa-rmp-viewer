The emergency response program is coordinated with the State Emergency Management Agency for notification of the public.\n\nPRASA periodically conducts various training programs, including emergency response training. A refresher training was provided on August 25, 2005. \n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nWithin the past five years there have been no unplanned releases of chlorine in excess of 10 pounds resulting in injuries or significant property damage on site; or known offsite injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nPRASA uses Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) to identify and recommend changes to ensure a high level of safety.  Issues identified from a PHA are then addressed in PRASA's Prevention Program.   Recommendations from the most recent PHA include more frequent training in operating and maintenance procedures, and an improved preventative maintenance program.  An audit of the RMP and PSM programs will be conducted within three years to verify the effectiveness of the program."

Approximately 1,240 residents are located within a 0.3 mile radius of the chlorine storage area.  .\n\nThe conditions and parameters for the worst-case scenario are specified by EPA.  A more realistic alternative release scenario was examined, also following EPA's Risk Management Program Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The alternative release scenario is a vapor release of the entire contents of a cylinder through a broken 3/8 inch flexible connector tube.  If the container was not shut off, the contents would be released at a rate of 1.6 pounds of chlorine per minute over a 95 minute period.  More typical weather conditions are also used (wind speed of 3.0 meters per second, atmospheric stability Class D).  Other conditions remain the same as in the worst-case scenario (urban topography and no mitigation of the release).\n\nThe zone of vulnerability for the alternative release scenario is determined to extend 0.1 miles from the chlorine storage area.  Approximately 18 residents a school and commercial/industrial area are located within a 0.1 miles radius of the chlorine storage area.  These residents could be impacted, depending on the direction of wind.  No known environmental receptors are located within the zone of vulnerability.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nPRASA complies with PROSHO requirements for Accident Prevention Programs and for Process Safety Management.  Operators, maintenance staff and contractors are informed of chlorine hazards and hazard signs are posted in the chlorination room.  Standard operating and maintenance procedures have been developed, and employees who work with chlorine are provided training.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nPRASA has an emergency response program.

      "SummaryText": "The Puerto Rico Aqueducts and Sewers Authority (PRASA) as the operator of the Lajas Water Filtration Plant has developed an integrated Risk Management Plan/ Process Safety Management (RMP/PSM) program. This program was developed for the  managing and risk prevention associated with the storage, handling and use of Chlorine Gas, a hazardous toxic ubstance,  in the Lajas Water Filtration Plant (WFP).  This RMP/ PSM program was developed for the safe operation of the Lajas WTP and to assure compliance with EPA, Puerto Rico Environmental Quality Board (EQB), Ocupational Safety And Health Administration (OSHA)  and Puerto Rico Ocupational Safety and Health Office (PROSHO) regulations. This program has been updated to comply with the April 9, 2004 revisions for 40 CFR Part 68.\n\nAccidental Releases Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIt is the AAA policy to comply with applicable Federal and local (Commonwealth of Puerto Rico) requirements. This RMP/ PSM was developed in compliance with 40 CFR Part 68 and the Clean Air Act (CAA) Section 112 \u00ae (1). The elements of the prevention program were based on the elements of the PSM program 29 CFR Part 1910.119. Among the most important components of this RMP/ PSM are the AAA's policies and procedures for operation and maintenance and the Emergency Response Plan of the facility.\n\nThe chlorination process at the Lajas WFP uses Chlorine gas, toxic substance regulated by the EPA, for the water desinfection, a critical step to assure the quality of the potable water supplied by the utility.   Safety precautions include procedures and equipment to minimize the potential for accidental release, as well as a written emergency response program for response to any chlorine release that may occur.  Due to the hazardous characteristics, the Lajas WFP incorporates in the RMP/ PSM all the safety measures necessary during the storage, handling and use of Chlorine needed for the protection of employees, contractors, visitors and nearby com"

These measures include procedures and equipment to minimize accidental releases and an Emergency Response Plan to effectively manage any Chlorine release.  \n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Lajas WFP supplies potable water to the surrounding community.  Chlorine is used to disinfect the water, destroying microorganisms that could cause illness in humans.\n\nChlorine is delivered to the facility via truck in 150 lb. cylinders The facility is authorized to store more than 10 cylinders (>1,500 lb., all of them in the chlorination room.  Four Chlorine cylinders are individually connected to vacuum chlorinators  Two of these cylinders are active at the time and connected to a main manifold through flexible connections.  The chlorintion is effected by mixing the chlorine gas with water by means of an eductor. This streams are mixed with the treated water at two points. \n\nWorst-case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case release scenario was determined following EPA's Risk Management Program Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The worst-case release scenario is a vapor release of the entire contents of a 150 lb. cylinder over a ten minute period (8.25 pounds of chlorine per minute).   Other worst-case assumptions required by EPA include a low wind speed (1.5 MPH), stable atmosphere (Class F), urban topography, and no active mitigation of the release.\n\nEPA requires the determination of the area (zone of vulnerability) which may be exposed to a chlorine concentration of 3 ppm or greater.  According to the American Industrial Hygiene Association, 3 ppm is the maximum concentration of chlorine in air below which nearly all people could be exposed for one hour without serious health effects.  Based on the worst-case assumptions, the zone of vulnerability was determined to extend 0.3 miles from the chlorine storage area.\n  \nThe following are known to be within the zone of vulnerability for the worst-case release scenario: reside"
