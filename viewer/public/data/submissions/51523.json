We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented at the OTI (Oil Tanking) Facility, including:\n\n\t* A description of our facility and use of substances required by EPA's RMP regulation\n\t* A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n\t* An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n\t* A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n\t* An overview of our emergency response program\n\t* An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nEnterprise's OTI Facility is used to offload and load various LPG streams.  Off loaded products include propane and butanes.  These LPG products are imported from ships and barges.  The products are then pumped into pipelines for distribution. Loaded products at OTI include propane and butanes.  There is equipment to provide dehydration and refrigeration to these products loaded through Enterprise's Oil Tanking Terminal.  There are three dehydrators in the facility, two of which are on-line while the other is being regenerated.  While loading, every seven hours one newly regenerated bed starts in parallel adsorption cycle and another one goes off-line for regeneration.  There are two dehydrators in adsorption cycle during l"

Although the concentration of the mixture in the Refrigerant Accumulator varies, the mixture is predominantly propane.  Therefore, the simulation assumed the worst-case concentration of 100% propane inside the Refrigerant Accumulator.  The tank inventory of approximately 35,800 pounds is assumed to be released, completely vaporized, and ignited resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The simulated end point distance to the 1 psig overpressure would be approximately 0.27 miles, which will result in off-site impacts.  Although there are numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, credit for passive mitigation was not taken into account when modeling this scenario.  All emergency response and early warning to the employees and the community would be exercised immediately if this were to occur.  All Emergency Response protocols would be in effect.  There would be no offsite environmental impact in this scenario due to the material being consumed on site.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) = Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nThe alternative release scenario is the simulation of a 1 diameter hole in the Refrigerant Accumulator.  The Refrigerant Accumulator contains a mixture of propane and ethane at approximately 294 psig and 115 degrees F.  For reasons discussed above, the simulation assumed the worst-case concentration of 100% propane in the Refrigerant Accumulator.  The propane would be released at a rate of 2,610 lbs/min.  The release is assumed to continue for ten minutes and ignite in a vapor cloud explosion.  The simulated end point distance to the 1 psig overpressure would be approximately 0.08 miles, which"

The dehydrators have pre- and post-filtering of the product being loaded.\n\nFor butane loading, dried product is passed through refrigeration chillers and cooled to about 50 degrees F.  When loading propane, additional refrigeration is used to reach cooler temperatures.  The propane is cooled to about -45 degrees F and then pumped to the ship.  \n\nCurrently, there are no toxic substances used, manufactured, or stored at the OTI Facility that meet the RMP threshold quantities promulgated for those substances. \n\nFlammables\n\nThe OTI Facility handles the loading and offloading of propane and butanes.

We have a training program in which the Operations and Maintenance personnel are specifically trained in the operation of the plant, the operating procedures, maintenance procedures, and specific other regulations and policies, as well as in all areas of emergency response.  We train, use, and apply the guidelines of our PSM program which include all of the above-listed areas.  All of these programs come under scheduled scrutiny and critique.\n\nWe have an on-going inspection program designed to search out and find deficiencies in the process equipment prior to any incident.\n\nOperations personnel make regular inspections of the equipment and processes they operate.

For each of these incidents (as defined by OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard), formal incident investigations are conducted to identify and correct the root causes of the events.  There have been no RMP-defined accidental releases of hazardous material from Enterprises' Propylene Processing Facility within the last five years. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nEnterprise maintains an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  The program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting the workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, the plan is coordinated with the Oil Tanking Terminal, Inc. and Channel Industries Mutual Aid (C.I.M.A.) group, which includes the Coast Guard, City of Houston fire department, and Harris County Sheriff.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nEnterprise Products continually reviews all safety policies and procedures in an effort to improve overall facility safety.  The company promptly addresses any recommendations to improve safety that result from incident investigations, and suggestions from employees are also reviewed with the intent to install equipment or implement procedural changes that will improve facility safety.  At the current time, there are modifications to the facility control room  being designed that will specifically improve safety.
