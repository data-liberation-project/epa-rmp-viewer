The facility was purchased by Pinnacle in 2015.  The facility was built in 1984 and owned/operated by Unilever and then Shenandoah Family Farms Cooperative.  The ammonia system was built in 1984 and has been modified and upgraded by Pinnacle. The plant initially submitted its Risk Management Plan (RMP) under Unilever and then Shenandoah Family Farms Cooperative. This RMP is prepared in accordance with the requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nPinnacle is committed to providing a safe workplace that is operated in an environmentally responsible manner. Pinnacle strives to protect all its valuable resources and assets - both personnel and property. We live and have families in this community. We want to prevent exposure to all our personnel as well as nearby members of our community, existing natural resources, and the surrounding environment. Pinnacle is also committed to complying with all applicable laws and regulations relating to safety in the workplace and the protection of the environment. Through continual, accurate training and various safety devices and procedures, we work to minimize potential releases.\r\n\r\nIt is Pinnacle's policy to promote overall public and associate safety by developing, implementing and maintaining all required elements of the EPA's RMP provisions and OSHA's PSM standard regarding the storage, handling, and processing of anhydrous ammonia used at this facility. The incorporation of these programs helps to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of highly hazardous materials as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic incidents.\r\n\r\nThis fa"

The Facility's Plant Manager is responsible for the implementation of the RMP.  In turn, he has designated the facility EHS Manager as PSM coordinator having overall authority for, and oversight of, the Facility RMP. As part of the PSM and Risk Management Program, the facility has an Emergency Action and Response Plan which provides instructions and responsibilities required of facility personnel in case of the following plant emergencies: employee illness/injury, ammonia release, fire, and severe weather. The manual also provides procedures and responsibilities for controlled and emergency shutdowns of facility equipment. The management team is committed to safety and the implementation of safe procedures at the facility.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. FACILITY OVERVIEW AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\n\r\nThe facility is located on 12.6 acres in a suburban setting of Hagerstown, Maryland at the southern edge near Funkstown.  The facility consists of one main plant building with approximately 143,000 square feet under roof. The primary purpose of our facility is the production of plant and soy based food products. We utilize anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration for space cooling of the packaging area and storage areas for food ingredients/products, freezers in production and for chilling process water. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) considers anhydrous ammonia as hazardous; therefore, the properties, which make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant, also necessitate certain safety precautions. A nationally recognized, reputable and professional ammonia delivery company is used to recharge the system when needed. Steel piping then carries the ammonia to the refrigeration equipment. Access to the site is restricted to company employees and authorized contractors and visitors.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only RMP regulated substance (toxic or flammable)"

The nominal charge of ammonia is 22,477 pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nC. FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nNo major releases of ammonia have occurred since this ammonia system is just being reactivated. EPA specifies inclusion of all releases that resulted in: deaths, injuries, significant property damage on site, known offsite deaths, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage. \r\n\r\nExecutive Summary\r\n\r\n\r\nD. THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system design and construction is based upon accepted and proven engineering design practices for a safe operating refrigeration plant. The system was designed and constructed to meet the Uniform Building Code, Uniform Mechanical Code, Uniform Fire Code, ANSI / ASHRAE Standard 15 and the National Electrical Code.  Shut-off valves are strategically located throughout the refrigeration system to\r\nallow emergency shut-off, periodic maintenance and repair. Pressure vessels are ASME rated to 150 and 250 psig and fitted with either a single or dual safety relief valve as required by ASME. The facility has an automatic ammonia detection, notification system, and response system for the engine room and refrigerated spaces.\r\n\r\nThe facility complies with applicable Federal, State and Local regulations including the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule.  Personnel are trained about this during our Hazard Communications Training and through access to our Written Programs.\r\n\r\nThe facility has reviewed and revised the documents and procedures for compliance with OSHA's PSM and EPA's Risk Management Program for ammonia use and storage. A management system has been established to maintain the elements of the PSM and Risk Management Programs. Applicable written elements of the PSM and the Risk Man"

THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Planning and Response Plan covers the ammonia refrigeration system in accordance with Process Safety and Risk Management. Our emergency plan has specific procedures for accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia as well as other emergencies.  If a release of ammonia is detected by the ammonia detection system or by employees, the procedures within this manual will be followed including notification of hazardous materials responders (refrigeration technicians) by radio and as required, the involvement of the incident commander. The manual describes the level of personal protective equipment to be used to respond to ammonia incidents. Facility responders have received initial and annual refresher training in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120. Facility-wide training regarding emergency procedures and evacuation routes occurs annually.\r\n\r\nThe facility works with the Hagerstown Fire Department. We have met with representatives and toured the facility. Pinnacle will work with this agencies as necessary to notify the public about an ammonia release. The manual also contains procedures for emergency alerting and response procedures for on-site personnel, off-site emergency contacts, and adjacent plants.  Senior management will handle media relations.\r\n\r\nWe strive to minimize off-site consequences through the implementation of emergency response program elements: pre-emergency planning, facility evacuation procedures, emergency response procedures, emergency medical and first aid procedures, post-emergency guidelines, and training program.\r\n\r\n\r\nF.
