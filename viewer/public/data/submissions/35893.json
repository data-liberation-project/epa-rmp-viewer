CGI is committed to the safety and health of it's employees, contractors and visitors.  This commitment is demonstrated in the design, operation and maintenance programs developed and implements specifically for this facility.  Operation and maintenance personnel are trained in the appropriate emergency response procedures to follow in the event of an accidental release.  However, accident prevention is the ultimate goal and as such a site-specific mechanical integrity program is being implemented and maintained.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe CGI Matli Gas Plant is located approximately 3 miles North of Watonga, OK on Hwy 8.  It is a plant that is designed to extract natural gas liquids (ie: ethane, propane, butane and heavier hydrocarbons) from raw natural gas and at the same time produce a pipeline quality gas (primarily methane).  The only process in the plant that contains an above threshold quantity of a regulated substance is the Product Storage Tank.  There are no above threshold quantity toxic substances at the CGI Matli Gas Plant.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe CGI Matli Gas Plant has developed and implemented a site-specific accidental release prevention program that consists of a detailed facility mechanical integrity program and employee training program.  The mechanical integrity program was developed under the guidelines of manufacturer written recommendations, recognized/generally accepted good engineering practices, industry/regulatory standards and past operation history.  Employee training was designed to ensure/document employee understanding of facility operation and maintenance requirements.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe CGI Matli Gas Plant has had no acciden"

      "SummaryText": "tal releases in the past 5 years that have resulted in offsite consequences.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe CGI Matli Gas Plant has developed and maintains a site-specific Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that includes actions to take in the event of an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance.  The ERP includes the names and phone numbers of not only company personnel but also the names and phone numbers of support services (contractors, police departments, fire departments, medical services/hospitals, regulatory agencies, LEPC, etc.) that may be called upon for assistance.  Liaison with those agencies is maintained to ensure timely and proper responses.  Employee understanding of their responsibilities during an emergency situation is high priority.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nCGI believes safety is an issue that can always be improved upon.  CGI continues to look for, develop and implement programs that will improve an employee's ability to identify and correct potential workplace hazards.  CGI also endeavors to ensure policies, programs and procedures are developed and implemented to meet applicable laws, rules and regulations.  Employee understanding of these policies, programs and procedures is high priority."
