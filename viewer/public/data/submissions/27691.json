      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThis Risk Management Program is designed to comply with the Environmental Protection Agency regulations detailed in 40 CFR Part 68.  This is a stationary source. The only RMP regulated substance at this facility is anhydrous ammonia--which is classified as a toxic substance, liquefied under pressure. \n\nThis is an existing process that is being enlarged and will now fall under the RMP regulations due to an increase in ammonia inventory above the threshold level. \n\nThe refrigeration system in this facility has an ammonia inventory of approximately 12,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. \n\nThis process does not meet the requirements of Program 1. It is subject to OSHA's PSM standard.  Therefore, this RMP is written to meet the EPA Program 3 level of compliance.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICY\nThis facility follows a rigorous thirteen volume Ammonia Safety Program to prevent the accidental release of ammonia. This program is also in compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) of 29 CFR 1910.119. Employees and management participate and cooperate in the PSM program to maintain a work environment that is safe to employees, the community, and the environment.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\nThe facility has a comprehensive emergency response plan that meets established criteria. The plan is made available to the local LEPC for review.\n\nPROCESS OVERVIEW \nThis food distribution facility operates a two temperature, single stage, anhydrous ammonia (R-717) refrigeration system with an engine room capacity of 175 TR @ +20?F high-temperature suction and 380TR @ -20?F low-temperature suction. This refrigeration system is a liquid recirculation system and is designed to operate at an over-feed ratio of approximately 3:1 for all evaporators. Anhydrous ammonia (R-717) refrigerant is a Group II refrigerant. Rotary screw compressors are used in the refrigeration system.\nEngine room electrical classification is NEM"

X 8'-0\" thermosyphon pilot-receiver.\n?One 60\" dia. X 12'-110\" controlled-pressure high-pressure receiver.\n?One 48\" dia. x 12'-4\" OAL vertical gas-pumper accumulator package +20?F.\n?One 42\" dia. x 10'-0\" OAL vertical gas-pumper accumulator package -20?F.\n\nMajor equipment located outside on the roof includes:\n?One evaporative condenser (EVAPCO PMCB-390, rated @ 3,805 MBH, for +95? FCT/ 78? FWB). \n?One evaporative condenser (EVAPCO PMCB-690, rated @ 10,143 MBH, for +95? FCT/ 78? FWB).\n\nMITIGATION MEASURES\nThere are some mitigating measures in place. Although there are doors and windows, the overall enclosure acts as a dike creating liquid pooling and limiting the liquid run-off. Ammonia leak detection is installed in this area that sounds alarms and starts emergency ventilation. The emergency ventilation is automatically controlled and discharges the engine room air outside which creates a lower level of concentration in the engine room for responders. It also starts air dispersion at lower concentration levels and disperses the ammonia with greater air turbulence.\n\nSUMMARY OF HAZARD ASSESSMENT\nThis hazard assessment was conducted to meet the RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis requirements for the ammonia refrigeration system.

      "SummaryText": "hydrous ammonia which is classified is as a toxic substance, liquefied under pressure. The definitions and parameters for the following release scenarios are based on the \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\" as described in Chapter 4: Off-site Consequence Analysis.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario (OCA-1) used in this assessment identifies the high-pressure receiver (V-2) as the vessel with the potential to hold the largest quantity of ammonia. This is based on the system design that uses this vessel as a pump-down holding receiver. The worst-case release scenario is based on over-filling this vessel causing the released quantity to be equal to the total vessel volume with no piping volume included. The worst-case release is estimated to be 8,637 pounds of ammonia over a ten-minute period.\n\nThe alternative release scenario evaluated in this hazard assessment is the direct release of ammonia vapor from the largest pressure relief valve with a duration of sixty minutes. This is considered to be the most likely scenario capable of having off-site consequences. The size of the release is based on the rated capacity of the pressure relief valve (66.9 lbs/min) with a release duration of sixty (60) minutes.\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThis facility follows the OSHA Process Safety Management Program. Various special elements have been incorporated into this program to meet the additional EPA requirements for the RMP. Following is an overview.\n\nParticipation - The Participation Program is an asset to both employees at the site and to the community as a whole.  As a general rule, employees who are fully involved have a greater sense of responsibility; they are more likely to catch the problems that can cause accidents. Employee awareness is for employees, not directly involved with the process, this includes knowing the hazards, the safety rules, warning signs, and evacuation procedures. All employees have access to the PSM Program. Involved employees"
