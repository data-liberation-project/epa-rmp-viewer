Huntsman Odessa is committed to providing a safe, healthy and environmentally conscious work place for its employees and neighbors.  This is exemplified by the Odessa site having earned the Texas Chemical Council award for excellence in safety performance.  The Huntsman Odessa site maintains a working PSM program, which implements a series of steps to prevent potential hazards associated with the process and assures a well-trained work force.   The PSM program further implements its policies with onsite procedures and manuals.  Huntsman Odessa participates with community agencies to develop emergency response plans and participates in cooperative training with these agencies.  Since its certification in January 1993, the Odessa Site has been an active participant in the International Standards Organization (ISO) 9002 quality management program.\n\nThe Odessa site is subject to numerous safety and environmental regulations at both the state and federal levels.  The Odessa site is subject to Clear Air Act (CAA) Title V, but has not yet received an identifier for the air operating permit.\n \n2.  Regulated Substances Huntsman's Odessa site is located in Odessa, Texas.  The Odessa site operates six Program Level 3 processes.  These processes receive, handle and store flammable hydrocarbon feedstocks for the production of olefins, styrene monomer and specialty grade polymers.  End uses for the products include medical and personal care products, electronic cable coatings, adhesives and sealants as well as boat and vehicle trims.  Huntsman's Odessa site has large volumes of several regulated flammable substances, such as ethane, ethylene, propane, propylene, butene and butane.  The Odessa site uses small volumes of toxic chemicals, which are consumed in the process.  The toxic chemicals are:    \n-  Boron Trifluoride - Used in the manufacture of styrene monomer.\n-  Hydrogen Chloride - Used in the manufacture of p"

Offsite Consequence Analysis  \nThe RMP Rule requires that offsite consequence analysis (OCA) be performed to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.  This OCA includes the development of worst and alternative release scenarios for the release of toxic and flammable substances.  The OCA allows for the consideration of administrative controls in estimating potential scenario impacts.  \n\nDistances for worst case and alternative release scenarios in this RMP have been calculated using the methods described in EPA's OCA Guidance Document.  The population within the circles defined by these distances has been calculated using the Landview III program.  For release scenarios where there are no public residences inside the circle, the reported population is zero.\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\nThese worst case scenarios are based on EPA required assumptions, are highly unlikely, and have not occurred at this facility.\n\nThe worst case scenario associated with the release of flammable substances is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE), involving an underground hydrocarbon storage well (#9).  The well stores Y-grade, a mixture of light hydrocarbons, principally, ethane, propane and butane.  As the storage well is 2,000 feet underground, the worst case release is an above ground piping failure rather than the loss of the entire inventory of the well.  The selected release scenario is a situation that completely shears off the well head.  The casing annulus tubing then telescopes into the bottom of the well.  The analysis assumes that all of the material released in a 10 minute period vaporizes and ignites, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The basis for using a 10 minute release from a piping failure instead of the entire underground hydrocarbo"

The VCE would reach offsite and may affect nearby public receptors, but no environmental receptors.\n\nThe worst case scenario associated with toxic substances is the failure of a single tube of boron trifluoride held on a 6-tube trailer.  The entire tube contents, 3,500 lbs are released over a 10 minute period.  This worst case scenario has the potential to affect public receptors, but no environmental receptors.\n\nALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS  \nThe alternative case scenarios used in this RMP do not take credit for existing safety systems and process controls, thus making them extremely conservative.  The one active mitigation measure considered is isolation of releases after 10 to 20 minutes.\n\nThe alternative case scenario for flammable substances is a complete seal failure on the LPG Pump (P-55C) in the Utilities area.  This alternative case scenario would reach offsite but would not affect public or environmental receptors.\n\nThe alternative case scenario for boron trifluoride is from a failure of the < inch inside diameter tubing which connects the tube trailer to the process.  In this scenario, 3,300 lbs of boron trifluoride are estimated to be released.  The release continues for 20 minutes until isolated by operations.  No credit is taken for the water spray system that has been recently installed to protect against this specific scenario.  This alternative case scenario has the potential to affect one industrial neighbor.  However, it does not impact the public or the environment.\n\nThe alternative case scenario for anhydrous hydrogen chloride is a vapor release from a failure of the < inch piping off the 600-pound cylinder, resultin"

The release continues for 10 minutes until isolated by operations.  This alternative case scenario does not affect the public.  However, one or more industrial neighbors are impacted by chlorine releases from two of the six processes.  No environmental receptors are affected. \n\nThe alternative case scenario for vinyl chloride is a pump seal failure on the pump used for unloading vinyl acetate from a truck into a storage tank. For this scenario, 2,400 pounds of vinyl acetate is released.  The release forms a pool that slowly evaporates.  This alternative case scenario does not affect public or environmental receptors.
