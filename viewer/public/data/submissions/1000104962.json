Cyclohexylamine arrives in 55 gallon drums and is stored outside on our flammable storage pad. This pad is a containment dike that is equipped with a fire monitor. Dimethylamine (DMA) is a new chemical that we will use in excess of the threshold quantity. The end product will be a coagulant used mainly in the paper industry and water purifications plants. We are currently in the trialing stage and will use the Kymene reactor for producing this coagulant. \n\nAccident Prevention Program:\nThe process is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and has a complete process safety management system in place.  This includes the use of process hazards analysis to identify and address potential hazards, management of change procedures to control modifications, mechanical integrity procedures for minimizing mechanical failures, detailed operating procedures for process control, and operator training for the personnel involved in the process.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\nIn the past five years, the Portland Plant has not had any accidental releases of Epichlorohydrin or Cyclohexylamine that have resulted in on-site injuries or damage or any off-site impacts. The same is true for DMA.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nThe Portland Plant has a written emergency response plan and coordinates emergency response matters with the Portland Fire Bureau.  In addition, the plant is an active participant in a mutual support group that includes other companies and agencies in Portland.  The plant has provided emergency response training for all plant employees."

Epichlorohydrin, is used in the production of wet-strength resins. These resins are used to improve the wet-strength characteristics in a variety of paper applications.  Epichlorohydrin is a raw material for the process and is consumed in a chemical reaction to make the product.  The plant primarily receives Epichlorohydrin in tank cars however there is the capability of receiving tank trucks.  Epichlorohydrin is stored in a tank that holds a maximum of 307,700 pounds; the storage tank is provided with a containment dike and leak detectors to minimize adverse impacts from any leaks or spills.
