ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nOK Foods, utilize anhydrous ammonia in a closed-circuit refrigeration system. OK Foods established; programs, procedures and safety devices to prevent exposure to personnel, community and surrounding environment also protect property assets.  Policies have been created to comply with all Federal, State, and Local regulations. OK Foods strives to prevent potential releases through continual, training and revision of policies, programs and procedures.  \n\n\n\nEmergency response program has specific notification procedures in the event of an accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. Working in conjunction with the Oklahoma City Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee to prepare for necessary notification of all affected neighbors.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of our facility is the further processing of poultry products to produce cooked, frozen products for wholesale and retail consumers. We utilize one regulated substance above the threshold level:  anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as refrigerant for the refrigeration system, cooling and freezing. An outside company is used to fill our main receiver tanks.  Piping then carries the ammonia to the needed refrigeration, cooling or freezing units. Access to the site is restricted to facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors. \n\n\n\nO.K. Foods has two independent systems at this site. Both have capacity above the 'covered' process threshold.  The largest process contains 23,000 pounds of ammonia.  The total amount of ammonia stored at this facility is 34,400 pounds.  \n\n\n\n3.

The rule requires the assumption that the entire contents of the largest vessel, or the vessel with the furthest endpoint impact, without management controls, are released within 10 minutes as a two phase flow.  O.K. Foods has determined  the East Engine Room receiver to be the source of the worst-case release.    \n\nDistance to endpoint: 2.9 miles\n\nPopulation: 10,010\n\n\n\nAlternative Scenarios (endpoints based on RMP*Comp (on-line version); population from \n\nMARPLOT 5.0.1)\n\n\n\nAll 5 alternative scenarios identified in 68.28(b)(2) were considered and are summarized here.  \n\n(i.)    Delivery truck transfer line failure at the East Engine Room receiver.\n\na.    Toxic endpoint distance = 0.4 miles\n\nb.    Population affected = 0\n\n(ii.)    Process piping failure (1\" pipe outside East Engine Room).\n\na.    Toxic endpoint = 0.9 miles\n\nb.    Population affected = 4\n\n(iii.)    Release from hole inside OKC plant creates puddle\n\na.    Toxic endpoint < 0.1 mile\n\nb.    Population affected = 0\n\n(iv.)    1\" high pressure relief valve release from plant\n\na.    Toxic endpoint = 0.8 miles\n\nb.    Population affected = 0    \n\n(v.)\n\nVapor leak from an 8 in2 hole in an un-liquefied container inside Plant.\n\na.    Toxic endpoint = 0.6 miles\n\nb.    Population affected = 0\n\n\n\nScenario (iv.) is considered by the O.K. Foods Process Safety Committee as being the most likely to occur.\n\n\n\n4. FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nO. K.

PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nCurrently, OK Foods trains and tests all refrigeration technicians.Process Safety Program is reviewed and updated annually also the program is improved continuously through annual updates of our written program and annual training of our technicians. OK Foods to continually improve infrastructure for safer handling and management of the ammonia system.
