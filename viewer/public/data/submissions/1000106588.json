Facility personnel are trained in procedures and use of equipment appropriate to their role in response to small incipient accidental releases.\nThis facility is a responding facility and has coordinated the emergency response plan with the local emergency response agencies, such as local law enforcement, local and state government officials, and the local emergency planning committee. The facility maintains a written emergency response plan to protect workers, ensure public safety and to protect the environment. The plan details the procedures for responding to an emergency, including the release or potential release of a hazardous substance. The procedures include instruction for response, communication, first aid, evacuation, accounting for personnel, company and agency notification procedures, and post incident cleanup and decontamination. All emergency equipment is maintained following established procedures. Employees are trained in the procedures and use of equipment appropriate to their role in the response effort.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY \nThe plant personnel are continually developing new ways to improve the safety of the facility.  This is done through responsibility matrices and training which is a vital part of any safety program.  Training is conducted according to a systematic schedule.  All new and modified equipment is designed with appropriate safety controls and devices.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS \nDetails of the release scenarios are included with the backup documentation associated with this RMP plan. \n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM \nSpecific responsibilities are summarized in the backup documentation associated with this RMP plan."

This commitment is strongly supported by senior management and is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as employee training and in considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our facility. The facility does not anticipate having any type of uncontrolled release.  However if an uncontrolled release does occur, the personnel at the facility will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the plant, and notify the necessary outside agencies. \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES \nThe Tyler Terminal is a propane marketing and storage facility which receives propane by truck and pipeline, stores it in above ground storage tanks, dehydrates the propane as necessary and ships it out by truck and pipeline.  There are no listed toxic substances which exceed their respective threshold quantities stored at this facility. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \nThis facility is regulated by 29 CFR 1910.119 (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals - PSM), 1910.38 (Employee Emergency Plans), as well as other federal, state and local regulations which are in place to reduce the potential for the release of Highly Hazardous Chemicals. \nThis facility has implemented the PSM elements to facilitate accidental release prevention.  Process safety information, consisting of technical standards, specifications and levels, promotes safe process design and operation.
