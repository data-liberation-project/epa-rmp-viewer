      "SummaryText": "MacDermid, Inc., located at 526 Huntingdon Avenue in Waterbury, Connecticut, is a manufacturer of specialty chemicals for use in many industries, including metal finishing, plating on plastics, and printed circuit industries.  MacDermid blends or compounds a variety of standard chemicals in precise formulations to create the end products to be supplied to the appropriate industry.\n\nMacDermid must store and use toxic chemicals such as ammonia and formaldehyde in sufficient quantities so that there is an adequate supply to create its specialty chemicals.  Both ammonia and formaldehyde are regulated by EPA as toxic substances.  Because of the hazards associated with these chemicals, MacDermid has developed comprehensive accident prevention and emergency response procedures to protect its employees and members of the surrounding community.\n\nIn order to ensure that the regulated chemicals are handled safely, MacDermid has designed its production processes to comply with a variety of standards and guidances, including those from the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and the Compressed Gas Association (CGA).  MacDermid regularly inspects and tests these processes to ensure that there are no equipment malfunctions or problems.\n\nBecause MacDermid stores and uses two regulated toxic chemicals above the EPA threshold levels, it has evaluated scenarios for releases of ammonia and formaldehyde in compliance with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Regulations.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario that could occur at MacDermid would be a failure of the outside 8,000-gallon ammonia tank.  Ammonia is stored in this tank as a liquefied gas under pressure.  If the tank were to be ruptured or punctured and the entire 8,000 gallons (41,000 pounds) of ammonia released, the distance to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 milligrams per liter is 2.3 miles.  If this release scenario "

      "SummaryText": "were to occur, the surrounding community within 2.3 miles of MacDermid's facility could potentially be affected.  However, this release scenario is highly unlikely.  The tank is constructed of 3/4-inch thick stainless steel.  As such, it would be very difficult to rupture or puncture.  In addition, the tank is located in a relatively isolated area near the center of the site.  It is isolated from regular vehicle and equipment traffic, and thus, is not likely to be struck.\n\nMacDermid has also developed alternative release scenarios which, while still improbable, are more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario described above.  A possible alternative release scenario for the ammonia containing process would be a crack or failure of one of the valves on the piping inside the facility.  The large ammonia tank is equipped with a shutoff valve that would prevent any of the contents of the tank to be released if a failure in the piping were to occur.  Therefore the release would be limited to the amount of ammonia contained in the piping within the facility, or approximately 100 pounds.  Because this type of potential release would occur within the walls of the facility, it would have a minimal impact on the surrounding community.  The estimated distance to the toxic endpoint for this alternative release scenario is 0.1 miles.  This release scenario could potentially affect the community within approximately 530 feet of the facility.\n\nAn alternative release scenario for the formaldehyde containing process has also been developed by MacDermid.  Formaldehyde is stored as an aqueous solution in a 5,500-gallon tank within the facility.  It is pumped to the necessary production areas.  If the pump were to develop a leak, it could release the formaldehyde solution to the floor of the facility, where it could evaporate and be released to the atmosphere.  If the pump were to leak for 60 minutes before it was shut down, 1,800 gallons (approximately 17,000 pounds) of formaldeh"

      "SummaryText": "yde solution could potentially be released to the floor of the facility.  This material would evaporate and escape the building, resulting in a potential hazard distance of 530 feet.\n\nMacDermid has operating procedures in place and trains its employees on a regular basis to prevent these types of accidents from occurring and to ensure that all operations at the facility are conducted safely.  There have been no accidents involving ammonia or formaldehyde at MacDermid's facility in the past five years.\n\nIn the unlikely event of an accidental release, a team of MacDermid employees is OSHA trained to respond.  In addition, MacDermid maintains a comprehensive emergency contingency plan that details procedures for reacting to a toxic release or any other accident involving hazardous or regulated materials.  MacDermid has coordinated its emergency response procedures with the Waterbury Fire Department and Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) to ensure that the community is protected.\n\nMacDermid is active in the community and strongly supports community safety.  Once each year, MacDermid hosts an open house at its facility.  Members of the community are encouraged to visit and learn about MacDermid's operations.  Tours of the facility are provided and presentations regarding operations, safety measures, and emergency response activities are given.  To learn more about the open house contact Greg Strong, Manager of Regulatory Affairs at (203) 575-5700."
