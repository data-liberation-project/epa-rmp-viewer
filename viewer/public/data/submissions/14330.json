We shall, as a minimum: (1) consult with employees and their representatives on the conducts and development of the process hazard review and other elements of the risk management plan, and (2) provide to our employees and their representatives access to the process hazard review and all other information required to be developed under that standard.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe City of Blackwell has taken steps to train the operators, supervisor, maintenance crews, and fire department to be first responders to a release.  The training included three days of classroom and hands on training on the proper use of emergency response equipment and procedures.  The course followed the guidelines state in OSHA 1910.120.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances.\n\nThe Water Treatment Plant utilizes chlorine for disinfection of the water supply for the City of Blackwell.  The maximum inventory of chlorine the Water Treatment Plant may have on site is 8,000 lbs. The  threshold quantity for chlorine is 2,500 lbs.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes a worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario as defined in 40 C.F.R. 68.  A dense-gas dispersion model (SLAG) was used to determine endpoint distances for both scenarios.  A dense-gas model is required since chlorine is heavier than air.  The model's input parameters are s"
