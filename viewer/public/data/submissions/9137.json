The owner, management, and employees of Cropmate Company, Irvington, Ia. are commited to the prevention of any accidental release of Anhydrous Ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local Fire Department, LEPC, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release on people and the environment.\n\nII. FACILITY INFORMATION.\nA. The primary activity at the facility is the storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia for sale to farmers.\nB. Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for application on crops as a fertilizer nutrient.\nC. The maximum quantity stored would be 130000 pounds in a 30000 gallon storage tank.\n(Note: maximum quantity allowed to be stored is 85% of the storage tank size.)\n\nIII. THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\nA. The worst case release scenario would be the release of the entire contents of the storage tank over ten minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 130000 pounds, which represents the volume of the tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the toxic endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.06 miles.\nB. The alternative release scenario is based on a release from a break in a transfer hose. Quantity released would be 26000 pounds. The toxic endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .59 miles.\n\nIV. THE ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM.\nA. The facility has implemented the provisions of the safety requirements for the storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by the American National Standards Institute Inc.\nB. The facilityy has implemented the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety And Health Administration (OSHA) 29-CFR 1910.111, storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\nV. THE FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY.\nA. There has b"

THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM.\nA. The facility has an Emergency Action Plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38.\nB. The facility has provided to the state and local authorities, the emergency planning and community Right-To-Know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA)\nC. The facilityhas a written Emergency Response Program, in accordance with OSHA standard 29-CFR-1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\nVII. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY.\nA. Safety improvement is an ongoing process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions and evaluate employee training. There are no specific Anhydrous Ammonia safety recomendations at this time."
