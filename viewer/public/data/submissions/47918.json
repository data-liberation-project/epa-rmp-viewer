Facility Policy:  The owners, management and employees of Farmer\u00bfs Cooperative Elevator  Company located in Kingsley, Iowa (the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.  \n\n2. Facility Information:  The primary activity at the site is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to local farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients, the maximum quantity stored would be about 325,500 pounds in one (1)  25,000 and one (1) 30,000- gallon storage tanks and 49 - 1,000 gallone nurse tanks which are parked from time-to-time at this site.\n\n3. Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario:  A) The Worst-Case Scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 131,250 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is about 4.4 miles.  B) The Alternate Release Scenario, based on the five-year accident history, or the most likely potential incident, is a release from a break in a 3 transfer hose followed by release of ammonia for 10 minutes before an automatic or manual shut-off intervenes and stops the flow of ammonia.  The maximum quantity released would be 2,800 pounds.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.1 miles.  \n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program:  The facility has been reviewed for general compliance"

The OSHA Standard is referenced in the Registration Form Section 8.3.b.\n\n5. Five-Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage.  \n\n6. Emergency Response Program:  The facility has: A) a written Emergency Action Plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard 1910.38 and B) provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);The primary emergency response coordinator for the Kingsley site is Jason Anderson, agronomy manager.
