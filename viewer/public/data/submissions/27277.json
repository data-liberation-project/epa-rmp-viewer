The listed RMP rule threshold quantity is\n10,000 pounds.   Wygen 1 will store the chemical in one 12,000 gallon tank (49,400 pounds) .\nThe storage and management of anhydrous ammonia for this system is addressed in this RMP plan.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia will be used at the Wygen 1 Power Plant as an air pollution control additive, to \nminimize the formation of nitrogen oxides in boiler flue gas emissions.  The boiler unit is equipped with \nselective catalytic reduction (SCR) devices.  Wygen 1 storage tank is designed at 12,000 gallons of\nAnhydrous Ammonia.  This tank and associated piping system is addressed in the Risk Management\nPlan.\n\nPlant Description\nThe Wygen 1 Power Plant is located in Campbell County, Wyoming, at 13151 Hwy 51, Gillette, WY.\nThe facility is situated south of Interstate I-90 and approximately 2.5 miles east of the city of Gillette.  To\nthe east and also on the north side of the interstate is residential area.  Open-pit mining operations are on the west and northwest side of the plant. The property to the south of the power plant consists of reclaimed coal mine property and undeveloped grassland.  There is a recreational area called the Cam-Plex that is located to the southwest of the plant which have such events as motor-cross and horse riding occasionally; however,  the mine property is between the power plant and the Cam-Plex. This recreational and residential area were taken into consideration in the receptors section of the RMP Analysis in addition to Interstate I-90 to the north, Highway 51 to the south, and a railroad right-of-way that is located between I-90 and Wyoming Highway 51.\n\nAmmonia System Description\nThe ammonia storage tank is designed to be filled by a tanker truck at a dedicated loading station.  The\ntank will be maintained at a pressure of 60-200 psi, by drawing liquid ammon"

For the nitrogen oxides control system, ammonia vapors will be drawn from the tanks head space,\nregulated for pressure, mixed with air, and injected into the boiler flues within each respective ammonia injection grid.  In combination with the catalyst located within the selective catalyst reduction unit, nitrogen oxides will be chemically reacted with the ammonia\\air mixture and emissions of the pollutant will be reduced.\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario\nThe worst case release scenario for ammonia was calculated as the loss of the storage tank in \naccordance with the definition provided in the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidance document \nfor RMP development.  The ammonia would be released as a gas.  As allowed by the regulations, the analysis considered the administrative control systems such as the company policy to fill the tank to a maximum of 80% liquid by volume.  Additionally, the tank design will begin discharging small amounts of ammonia vapor if the tank if filled greater than 80% to warn of overfilling the tank.  The area of potential impact was determined using RMP * Comp (TM), modeling software developed b the EPA. The conditions of the scenario, such as release time and weather status are those specified in the EPA Consequence Analysis Guidance Document.  The area of potential impact was determined using the RMP*Comp, modeling software developed by the EPA.\n\nThe results of the Consequence Analysis using RMP*Comp, indicated that the ammonia would travel approximately 4,940 lbs/min under the specified weather conditions of 1.5 m/sec.  before dispersing in the atmosphere to the specified toxic endpoint concentration of 0.14mg/l with a release rate of 10.0 minutes.  Within this radius from the ammonia tanks,  seven residents with an estimated 20 people could potentially be affected.  Maps of the area and a list"

The likelihood of such\nan incident occurring is miniscule.  Anhydrous ammonia tanks are installed with multiple safety systems\nto prevent the release of an entire tank in a single event.  There have been no incidents of ammonia\ntank breaches reported in the nationwide EPA - Chemical Emergency Preparedness and Prevention\nOffice database.\n\nAlso, in the event of a release, it is highly unlikely that the ammonia would disperse in a circular pattern\ngiven the weather conditions in Campbell County.  During a release, it is expected that an ammonia\nplume would disperse in the direction of the prevailing wind at the time of the event, as opposed to\ncovering the entire area defined by a circle with a radius of 1.2 miles.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\nThe alternative release scenario is, by definition, a more likely release scenario than the worst case.\nEngineered controls, such as automatic shut-off valves,  check valves, relief valves, ammonia vapor\nleak detection system and alarms are considered in the analysis.\n\nThe type of system failure identified for the alternative release was a loss of ammonia caused by a\na hole or puncture approx. 1.9 sq. inches inside the plant.  In the analysis the tank pressure was 200 psi. and the tank temp was 100 F.  No mitigation measures were used; although, it is likely the release could be within the plant enclosed area so the analysis may be conservative for an in-plant leak.  The calculated release rate was 302 pounds per minutes and was assumed to continue for 10 minutes or until the ammonia vapor detector sounds an alarm, alerting an operator to check the ammonia system.  The main isolation valve would be closed automatically upon alarm.  If the ammonia vapor concentration is unsafe for facility response and the main isolation doesn't clear the ammo"

Within that radius of the ammonia tank storage area, the only receptors include plant personnel and employees of the adjoining industrial facilities.  Maps of the area and a list of types of receptors in the potential impact area are provided in Off-Site Impact Analysis Section.\n\nProcess Hazard Assessment (PHA)\nA process hazard assessment was performed on the ammonia system using a Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) technique which includes a complete environmental, safety and operation review using as a basis failure modes and effects analysis.  The ammonia tank and associated systems were reviewed for compliance with the American National Standards Institute standards for ammonia (ANSI K-61.1 - American National Standard Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia).  Compliance with  code requirements regarding the storage tank, unloading station, piping system, vaporizers, air dilution equipment and ammonia injection grid as well as operational practices and protocols with anhydrous ammonia management were assessed.

Personnel will be trained annually on safety concerns and general operation procedures as well as emergency response procedures.  Emergency response training on self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), worn by the operators during emergency releases of ammonia will be conducted annually and prior to system start-up. Key employees will be trained and certified annually on the safety requirements for connection/disconnection of ammonia supply components, awareness of the hazardous properties of ammonia, and the presence, location and design of ammonia detectors.\n\nAmmonia detectors with alarms will be installed within proximity of the ammonia storage tank and ammonia injection skid and will be used to detect leaks and warn of hazards by flashing a beacon.
