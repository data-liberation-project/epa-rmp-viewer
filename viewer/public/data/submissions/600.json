THE FACILITY POLICY\n     The owners,management,and employees of FARM & HOME COOP are committed to the \n     prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If a accidental release\n     should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other\n     authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and \n     the environoment.\n\n2. FACILTY INFORMATION\n      -The primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers.\n      - Anhydrous ammonia is received,stored,and distributed for direct application for crop production\n        nutrients.\n      - The maximum quanity stored would be 130,000 in our 1-30,000 gallon storage tank.\n\n3. The worst-case release and the alterativee scenario\n      A. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank \n           (or tank car) release as a gas over ten minutes. The maximum quantity released would be \n           130,000 pounds,which repesents the volume of the largest storaqge tank at 85 percent capacity\n           as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint(point of dispersion to 200ppm)\n           is 5.6 miles.\n\n       B. the alternative release scenario based on the most likley potential incident is a release from a break\n           in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.2 miles\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program \n       The facility has implemented the provisions of Safty Requirements for the Storage and Handling of \n       Anhydrous Ammonia,K-61.1 published by the American National Standards Institute,Inc.., and the\n       standeards of the U.S. Occupational Safty and Health Administartion(OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111,\n       storage and handling af anhydrous ammonia.\n\n5.

Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n             Safety improvements is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are preformed to assess the maintenace of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementions at this time."
