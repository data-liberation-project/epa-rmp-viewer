This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \n\n\n\n- save lives;\n\n- minimize and avoid injuries;\n\n- protect the environment; and\n\n- minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the RMP regulations.  \n\n\n\nDFA - Keller's Creamery personnel circulate throughout the plant, taking note of unusual conditions in any portion of the system.  In the event that an ammonia leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will alert any personnel in the immediate area who are unaware of the danger, and the Maintenance Manager and Safety Representative (Supervisor).  The Supervisor will determine what procedures and personnel are necessary to remedy the problem. Emergency agencies will also be notified as necessary as outlined in the Emergency Action Plan.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe primary business of DFA - Keller's Creamery is the production and processing of butter.  In order to conduct operations, the facility currently uses a maximum of 25,073 pounds of ammonia in its ammonia refrigeration system.  The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment (compressors, evaporative condensers, pressure receiver, chiller, suction accumulator, and Surface Scrapper), cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for production and storage.  Typical operating conditions range from approximately 25 psig on t"

This prevention program covers the process that handles ammonia above the threshold quantity of either PSM or RMP rules.\n\n\n\nThe prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents.  Some of the specific activities in the prevention program include:\n\n\n\n1) Process safety information is accessible to all applicable employees upon hire.\n\n2) In depth process hazard analyses are completed every five years by qualified personnel using techniques approved under the PSM standard.\n\n3) Written operating procedures (kept up to date) are used for training and guiding the work of operators.\n\n4) Training is provided to all employees upon hire, and refresher training is given at least every three years or upon request.\n\n5) Operators, mechanics, and contractor personnel are qualified, trained in the general hazards in the facility, and informed of any temporary situations affecting safety.\n\n6) Pre-startup safety reviews are conducted to insure that conditions for safe operation have been satisfied prior to starting new or modified equipment.\n\n7) A program is in place to maintain the mechanical integrity of the process, which includes written procedures, training requirements, and equipment deficiency requests for employees, work orders, scheduled maintenance, and documentation.\n\n8) A hot work permit system assures that work is done safely and properly.\n\n9) A management of change system is in place to ensure that changes are managed safely.\n\n10) Incidents are investigated and actions are taken as part of a continuous improvement effort.\n\n11) Routine audits are conducted to as"

The training, qualifications, and safety awareness of our operations, maintenance, and management personnel are a key element in reducing and mitigating accidents.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nSince November 2008 to the present, there have been no accidents or releases of regulated substances from covered processes that meet specific EPA criteria for the Five-Year Accident History.  Such \"RMP accidents\" would involve serious accidents with either on-site deaths, injuries, or significant damage; or known, off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, or environmental damage.  DFA - Keller's Creamery realizes that the community may also be interested in smaller releases of regulated chemicals that do not meet such criteria. \n\n\n\nAn investigation into the facility's accident history showed that there have been no releases of anhydrous ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds over the past five years. \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nDFA - Keller's Creamery employs a response team. Selected employees are trained to 24 hour Technician Level for emergency response operations. These employees are fitted for APR and SCBA. This response team has coordinated with the Local Fire Chief and Assistant Chief as to the DFA internal response capabilities. In the event of a significant release, the rest of the employees are to be evacuated from the facility to a designated area. \n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nMitigation measures to prevent accidents involving anhydrous ammonia include additional training, key maintenance related tests/inspection, and enhanced emergency response policies and procedures. The facility's PSM team is planning to meet periodically, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes may include the following it"
