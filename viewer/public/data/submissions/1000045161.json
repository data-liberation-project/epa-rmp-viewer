The main elements of the emergency response plan are: (1) incident response flow chart, responsibilities of various personnel at the facility, duties of on-scene incident commander, site response team, and site safety representative, (2) details of emergency recognition and prevention at the facility, (3) procedures for planning and coordination with off-site emergency response organizations, and (4) details of the training program for all employees involved with the chlorination and digester gas processes.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety \r\nNumerous changes to improve safety were previously identified for the chlorine and methane processes in 1997 when a Process Safety Management (PSM) Plan was prepared. The PSM was updated in 2010. MDWASD is currently in the process of evaluating and implementing recommendations from the June 23-25, 2014 Process Hazard Analyses.  \r\n\r\nMDWASD is committed to providing a safe and healthful work environment to its employees, while protecting the public, on-site and off-site property, and the environment from releases of chlorine."

In addition, the Central District WWTP also receives a mixture of primary sludge/WAS from the North District WWTP.  The sludge treatment process is divided into two trains from secondary clarifiers through anaerobic digestion.  One train is associated with Plant 1 at the Central District WWTP and receives WAS from the Plant 1 secondary clarifiers.  The Plant 2 train receives WAS from the Plant 2 secondary clarifiers in addition to the North District WWTP sludge.  After anaerobic digestion, the sludge treatment processes are combined into a single process train.  The sludge streams are first conditioned with polymer and fed to gravity thickeners.  The sludge, from the thickeners, is then pumped to two-stage anaerobic digesters for stabilization.  The gas produced by the digestion process is compressed, scrubbed to remove hydrogen sulfide and stored on-site in two compressed gas spheres.  The digester gas is used to power engine-driven blowers and electric generators.  Electricity generated by burning the digester gas is used to power some of the plant equipment.  Waste heat from the gas-powered engines is used to heat the primary digesters.  The maximum quantity of digester gas present at the Central District WWTP at any given time exceeds the listed threshold quantity in the EPA rule.  \r\n\r\nSeveral safety features are part of the digester gas process.  These safety features include, pressure and flow manometers, meters, switches and transmitters, which are used to monitor the system performance for high or low pressures, temperatures and flows; and digester pressure relief valves and Sphere pressure safety valves, which are used to relieve excess pressure in the system.

The Central District WWTP has two separate liquid treatment trains that are referred to as Plant 1 and Plant 2.  The facility stores chlorine and digester gas, which are regulated substances under RMP rule.  The two chlorine systems (for Plant 1 & 2) supply chlorine to the wastewater effluent and the non-potable water system.\r\n\r\nChlorine is delivered in one-ton containers to the Central District WWTP chlorine buildings.  The chlorine buildings are divided into a covered chlorine storage area and a chlorination room and the safety system for each chlorine process operate in a similar manner.  The one-ton containers store liquid chlorine under pressure.  The storage area in Plant 1 is equipped to store up to 32 (cylinders) tons of chlorine.  The storage area in Plant 2 is equipped to store up to 46 (cylinders) tons of chlorine. The maximum quantity of chlorine present at the Central District WWTP at any given time exceeds the listed threshold quantity in the RMP rule. It also exceeds the listed threshold quantity in Process Safety Management Standard.\r\n\r\nThe pressure from the stored chlorine in the cylinder forces liquid chlorine through the tubing and into the manifold system. During normal operation liquid chlorine flows from the cylinder through the chlorine pipeline to the evaporators located in the chlorinator room.  At the evaporators, the liquid chlorine is heated and converted into chlorine gas.  The evaporators are equipped with high and low temperature alarms, to ensure that normal temperature is maintained. Chlorine gas then flows from the evaporators through the temperature-actuated control valve to the chlorinators.  The chlorinators are used to"
