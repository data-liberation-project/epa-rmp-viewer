The facility process met the Program 2 criteria, because it did not qualify for consideration under Program 1 due to the distance of the nearest receptor within the impact areas identified during the evaluation of the worst-case scenarios, and did not qualify for Program 3, because the facility is not subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management requirement.   \r\n\r\nProgram 2 requirements include: 1) the development of a management program which identifies the responsibilities of management personnel relative to the Risk Management Program, 2) a Prevention Program to establish procedures and document information that will help to prevent an accidental release, 3) an Emergency Response Program that outlines the necessary procedures and contacts in the event of an accidental release, 4) and the evaluation of a worst case and alternate scenario of a potential release from the cov"

A review of site operations revealed that two substances stored on site were regulated under Section 68.130, which include chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  Seven 2,000-pound chlorine tanks and seven 2,000-pound sulfur dioxide tanks are stored in the chlorine building next to the chlorine contact chamber.

For the purposes of this definition, any group of vessels that are interconnected, or separate vessels that are located such that a regulated substance could be involved in a potential release, shall be considered a single process.\"\r\n\r\nOne process was identified at TPCG-STP.  As stated above, seven 2,000-pound chlorine tanks and seven 2,000-pound sulfur dioxide tanks are located at the plant site.  Both substances are considered one process due to the close proximity of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide tanks to each other.   \r\n \r\n1.2 PROGRAM IDENTIFICATION\r\n\r\nThe process identified at the TPCG South Treatment Plant was determined to meet the criteria for Program 2 status.  The facility has had no accidents within the past five years, and the facility is not subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Process Safety Management (OSHA, PSM) requirements, because it is a local governmental facility.  However, the endpoint for the worst case scenario falls beyond the boundaries of the facility and reaches public receptors including residences and schools.  Because the process does not meet Program 1 or Program 3 status, it must fall within the requirements of Program 2.  The program criteria are described in the following sections.\r\n \r\n1.2.3\tManagement Program\r\n\r\nRegulations require that a management system be developed to oversee the implementation of the risk management program (RMP).
