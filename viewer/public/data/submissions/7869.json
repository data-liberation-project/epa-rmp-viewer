      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\tAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nOremet-Wah Chang's basic commitment to responsible stewardship of the environment, protection of the community, protection of employee health, and assurance of product safety extends to the processes covered by the new EPA Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements.  The Oremet-Wah Chang (OWC) facility at 1600 Old Salem Road in Albany, Oregon, also called the North Plant, has developed management systems in compliance with various applicable regulations to prevent the release of regulated substances especially in locations which may cause detrimental effects to employees, the community, or the environment.  This is accomplished through a systematic evaluation of process design, process technology, operational procedures, maintenance activities, non-routine procedures, emergency preparedness, training, and several other factors.\n\nThe  North Plant plans to meet or exceed regulatory requirements.  In the attempt to accomplish this goal, the management systems at the North Plant have been developed in such a way that the hazards are identified, understood, and controlled to prevent accidents.  The RMP regulated chemicals include chlorine, aqueous ammonia, hydrofluoric acid, phosgene, and titanium tetrachloride. \nPrograms have been developed to comply with OSHA's 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, and EPA's 40 CFR part 68 subpart D, Accidental Release Prevention Provisions in the Risk Management Program.  \n\n2. The stationary source and the regulated substances handled\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to extract zirconium and hafnium from zircon sand and produce various metal products.  These products are sold to customers who produce final products for the nuclear industry, the industrial process industry and other related industries.  Zirconium chemical products as well as byproducts are also sold. \nThe regulated substances handled at this faci"

The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\nEach of the regulated substances at the Oremet-Wah Chang North Facility is in a separate process.  For this reason, OWC has developed worst-case and alternative case release scenarios for each substance.  The development of the worst-case scenario is dictated by the EPA.  The amount of the substance released for the worst-case scenario is equal to the greatest amount held in a single vessel or pipeline.  For toxic chemicals that are normally gases at ambient temperature and are handled as a gas or as a liquid under pressure, the chemical is assumed to be released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The release rate to the atmosphere is calculated as the quantity released divided by 10 minutes unless passive mitigation is in place.   For toxic gases that are handled as refrigerated liquids at ambient pressure, if the released substance is not contained by passive mitigation systems or if the contained pool would have a depth of 1 cm or less, it is assumed that the substance is released as a gas over 10 minutes.  If the released substance is contained by passive mitigation systems in a pool with a depth greater than 1 cm, it may be assumed that the quantity is spilled instantaneously to form a liquid pool and the release rate to the atmosphere is calcula"

These scenarios are considered more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenarios.  However, the alternative case release scenarios are still considered unlikely to occur.  As part of its release prevention program, discussed in detail in the next section, OWC is constantly monitoring, reviewing, and upgrading its standard operating procedures and equipment.  In addition, OWC has developed a detailed Facility Emergency Response Plan (FERP) and individual Departmental Emergency Response Plans (DERPs) to minimize the effects of a release should one occur.  In addition to these administrative controls, OWC has automatic release mitigation systems in place for the regulated substances which are discussed below.  \nWith the exception of the worst-case scenario for phosgene, the distance to the toxic endpoint (or de minimus pressurization differential) for the worst-case and alternative case scenarios for each substance was calculated using EPA's RMPComp computer modeling program.   The Dense Gas Dispersion (DEGADIS) model version 2.1 was used to calculate the distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case scenario for phosgene because this substance is dispersed in a matrix of liquid silicon tetrachloride.   The RMPComp model is considered conservative and would generally give longer distances than computer model developed specifically for OWC.\n\nChlorine-Worst-Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios\nWorst-Case Scenario\nThe largest vessel of chlorine on-site is a 180,000 pound capacity railcar.  Since the chlorine contained in the railcars is a liquid under pressure, the worst-case release rate of chlorine to the atmosphere would be 18,000 pounds per minute.

Under this scenario, 8.8 pounds of chlorine would be released to the atmosphere per minute for a period of 20 minutes.  The distance to the toxic endpoint for this scenario was calculated at 0.1 miles.  To help minimize the effects of a release, OWC has installed emergency shutdown systems, an emergency scrubber, excess flow valves and a foam system.\nPhosgene Alternative Case Release Scenario\nAlternative Case Scenario\nA release scenario considered by OWC to be more likely to occur would be a valve stem leak.  Under this scenario, 0.005 pounds of phosgene would be released to the atmosphere per minute for a duration of 10 minutes.  The distance to the toxic endpoint for this scenario was calculated at 0.3 miles. In addition to dikes around the largest phosgene-containing tank, OWC has emergency shutdown systems, an emergency scrubber and a foam system that all help to minimize the effects of a release.  It should be noted that the EPA requires release rates below 0.1 pounds per minute to be rounded up to 0.1 pounds per minute.  For this reason, the RMP submittal form shows a release rate of 0.1 pounds per minute for the alternative scenario for phosgene. \nTitanium Tetrachloride Alternative Case Release Scenario\nAlternative Case Scenario\nA release scenario considered by OWC to be more likely to occur would be a pipe leak.

The supervisor of the area/ construction project leader is responsible for ensuring a PSSR is performed. \n\nMechanical Integrity\nOWC provides appropriate resources to ensure that the equipment used to process, store, or handle highly regulated substances is designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize the risk of releases of the regulated substances into the workplace or community.  To accomplish this goal, a Mechanical Integrity Program is in place to ensure the continued integrity of the processes.  The Mechanical Integrity Program is implemented for the systems that could potentially result in the release of a hazardous chemical.  The program utilizes increased maintenance training, and preventive maintenance in conjunction with regular inspections and tests, to ensure equipment is in satisfactory condition.  A summary of the Mechanical Integrity Program is found in the PSM Central Files with more details located in the maintenance shop.  The ongoing rec"

The Hot Work Permit System is specifically concerned with the permitting of hot work operations associated with welding and cutting on or near PSM/RMP regulated process areas.  The permits document compliance with the fire prevention and protection requirements.\nAdditional safe work practices such as lockout/tagout, confined space entry, and control over entrance are also implemented to increase facility safety.\nThe ongoing recordkeeping requirements for the hot work/safe work programs are:\n\n\tCopies of the hot work permit showing: that the fire prevention and protection requirements in 29 CFR 1910.252(a) are in place prior to beginning the hot work operations; the date(s) authorized for hot work; and the object on which hot work is to be performed.  The permit is kept on file until completion of the hot work operations.\n\nManagement of Change\nOWC manages all changes to processes regulated by PSM or RMP to ensure the processes are operated and maintained as safely as possible.  To assist in accomplishing this goal, a Management of Change Program is in place.  Management of Change examines any type of change that is planned for the process, and the basis of the change.\nThe Management of Change Program is designed to evaluate, approve and administer changes to PSM/RMP regulated processes to assure any changes implemented enhance the operation and safe"

The five-year accident history\n\nDuring the past five years, the OWC North Facility has had only two reportable accidents.  OWC emphasizes safety in the work place and takes pride in their safety record.  OWC was the first OSHA Star facility west of the Mississippi River; however, the State of Oregon has since discontinued this program.  Each of the reportable accidents is described below.\nThe first accident occurred in August of 1994.  A worker did not follow written instructions when opening an ammonia process vessel.  The wrong manway was opened on the vessel and approximately 50 pounds of liquid ammonia was released.  The worker was exposed and had to be taken to the local hospital for evaluation.  As a result of this accident, training procedures for this activity have been revised.\nThe second accident occurred in December of 1995.  A process vaporizer developed a leak due to the corrosion of wet chlorine.  Under normal conditions the chlorine used in this process is dry.  Approximately 400 pounds of chlorine were released.  A worker in a nearby work station was exposed to the chlorine and had to be taken to the local hospital for evaluation.  Approximately $50,000 dollars in property damage was sustained as a result of this accident.  The equipment has since been upgraded and improved and the process has been changed to prevent a similar situation from occurring in the future.\n\n6. The emergency response program\n\nOWC has developed and implemented an emergency response program for the purpose of protecting public health and the environment.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of lo"
