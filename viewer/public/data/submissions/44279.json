The drills are used to test the response time of the Emergency Response Team, to test the plant employee accountability program, and to activate the plant's Emergency Operations Center (\u00bfEOC\u00bf).  In addition, the Battleground facility has developed a Special Situations Plan (\u00bfSSP\u00bf) which is a program designed for responding to emergencies that may have impacts beyond the immediate plant and is a supplement to the Emergency Response Plan.  The Special Situation Plan links the local response to the OxyChem Corporate Emergency Response Center located in Dallas, Texas.\n\nThe facility is a member of the La Porte Area Local Emergency Planning Committee (\u00bfLEPC\u00bf), which includes industrial and public entities.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety (\u00a7 68.155(f))\n\nThe Battleground facility implements process safety improvement opportunities identified through annual reviews of our plant procedures, near misses and incident investigation programs, and a program soliciting safety and environmental suggestions from the plant employees.
