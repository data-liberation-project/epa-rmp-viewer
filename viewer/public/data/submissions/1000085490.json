It processes natural gas to produce purified components, including Methane, Ethane, Propane, Isobutane, Butane, and heavier hydrocarbons. The processing of the natural gas results in the generation of a hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide mixture. This mixture is further processed to recover sulfur.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\n\n\nThe processes at the plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The following are some examples of the accidental release prevention program at BEC: \n\n?    LDAR\n\n?    Preventive Maintenance\n\n?    Vessel Inspections\n\n?    Pipeline x-ray\n\n?    Operator Training\n\n?    Annual Contingency Plan\n\n?    EAP\n\n?    SPCC\n\nSome of the administrative programs to prevent, detect or mitigate an incident at the plant are presented above.  Specific safety equipment and procedures, known as safeguards, are in place at the plant.  These safeguards are listed as part of the process hazard analyses, process safety information, and in the operating procedures.  Some examples of general safeguards are presented below:\n\nRelease Detection\n\n?    Hydrogen sulfide detectors with alarms\n\n?    Facility alarm system to notify personnel in case of emergency\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n?    Pressure Safety Valves (PSVs) to protect all pressure vessels\n\n?    Manual and automatic valves to permit isolation of the process\n\n?    Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters\n\n?    Containment around some tanks to contain liquid materials\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n?    Trained emergency response personnel\n\n?    Personal protective equipment (e.g., protective clothing, self-contained breathing)\n\n\n\nTHE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED AT THE FACILITY:\n\n\n\nThe RMP regulated substances handled at the distribution facility are flammable (Methane, Ethane, Propane, Isobutane, Butane, Isopentane, Pentan"

The Facility complies with 29 CFR Part 1910.119 (Process Safety Management for Highly Hazardous Chemicals). The Facility conducts regular Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) for the process to identify potential hazards as well as controls, systems, and recommendations to mitigate those hazards. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. The Facility maintains Operating Procedures and Process Safety Information that describes the chemical hazards associated with regulated substances at the Facility. The Facility also has processes in place for Training, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigations, Management of Change (MOC), Employee Participation, Hot Work Permitting, and Contractor Safety Performance in order to ensure continual commitment to safety.  Access to the Facility is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, and authorized contractors/visitors.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\n\n\nThe RMP rule requires facilities to compile a 5-Year Accident History for all RMP regulated substances in covered processes at the facility.  As part of the ongoing PSM Program, the facility documents and tracks all incidents and near-misses that occur within the facility\n\n\n\nRMP requires facilities to report any incident from a covered process involving a regulated substance and resulting in any of the following:\n\n?    Onsite deaths, injuries, or significant property damage\n\n?    Offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, or environmental damage\n\nThe BEC Plant had no RMP reportable incident in the five years prior to the submittal of this RMP.  \n\n\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\n\n\nThe plant provides resources for planning in case of emergencies at the facility.

      "SummaryText": "design, maintenance, operating procedures, and training provide for risk minimization before an accident can occur.  In spite of all these things, emergencies can arise, sometimes through forces beyond control.  \n\n\n\nThe purpose of this emergency plan is to provide a cohesive, written procedure for coordinating effective response procedures by all plant personnel in order that danger to employees, contractors, the general public and the environment may be lessened in the unlikely event of an emergency.  The emergency response procedure covers the entire plant. It includes, but is not limited to incident command system, evacuation, medical response to chemical exposure, agency notification, public notification if potential for impact, personnel accounting, and clean-up.\n\n\n\nTraining for emergency response is conducted frequently with classroom, tabletop, and live exercises.  \n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\n\n\nThe BEC plant is constantly re-evaluating the current safety systems through the use of prevention programs such as Management of Change and the Process Hazard Analysis program. As a result of these programs, and other safety and risk reduction initiatives, improvements to the safety of the workers and the surrounding community continue to occur. All hazardous consequence mitigation recommendations from PHAs relating to safety and environment are prioritized by a risk matrix designed to address highest risk scenarios first.  All hazardous consequence mitigation recommendations are resolved in a timely manner.\n\n"
