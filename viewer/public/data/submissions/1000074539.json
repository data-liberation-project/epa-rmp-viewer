EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\n     The ISP/Ashland Calvert City Plant is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for Calvert City Plant workers, the public, and the environment.  As a member of the American Chemistry Council and the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturers Association, ISP implements the principles of Responsible Care to ensure a safe and environmentally sound operation, and is RC14001 Certified.  In addition, as part of this commitment, the Calvert City Plant has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One part of these systems is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at ISP's Calvert City Plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) rule 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) describing the Risk Management Program at the Calvert City Plant.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan executive summary requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of that Risk Management Program.\n\n\n\n1.1        Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\n     The ISP/Ashland Calvert City Plant is committed to the safety of workers and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. The Plant implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. In the event of a significant accidental release, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain such releases.  The Plant evaluates each situation, evacuates workers as necessary, responds based on our capabilities, skills and training, and if necessary, contacts the local Mutual Aid A"

However, the specific responsibilities for certain aspects of that program have been delegated by the Site General Manager to other personnel who report either directly, or through other management personnel, to the Site General Manager.  Those relationships are depicted on an organization chart.  Specific responsibility for the implementation of the Process Safety Management (PSM), accident prevention program, RMP hazard assessment and Risk Management Plan has been delegated jointly to the Environmental Manager, Safety-Health & Security Manager, and Safety Engineer.  In keeping with our policy that safe operation is part of everyone's job, many other personnel are also involved in RMP activities on an ongoing basis.\n\n\n\n1.2        ISP's Calvert City Plant Regulated Substances\n\n\n\n     The ISP Calvert City Plant is a chemical manufacturing facility located in the Purchase Area of far Western Kentucky, in Calvert City, in northern Marshall County.  The ISP Plant is the largest industrial employer (approximately 520 site employees) in Marshall County.  We use the following chemicals as our feed materials: acetylene, ammonia, benzene, acetone, ethanol, butanediol, vinyl acetate, isopropyl alcohol, iodine, styrene, methanol, propane, cyclohexylamine, ethylamine, cyclohexane, ethyl acetate, isobutylene, and isopropyl acetate.

Because processes at the Plant that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, and because the OSHA PSM requirements are very similar to the EPA RMP requirements for chemical manufacturing facilities, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements.  The PSM program at this facility has been extended, where necessary, to satisfy EPAs Program Level 3 accident prevention program requirements.\n\n\n\n1.4.1    Employee Participation\n\n     \n\n    ISP encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), incident investigation, and plant and process inspection teams. Employees have access to all information created as part of the site accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented "

These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety. The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\n\n\n1.4.2    Process Safety Information\n\n     \n\n     The Calvert City Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the Plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. \n\n     \n\n     Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Safety Data Sheets (SDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the Plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in their product/process operating manuals.  The Plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). \n\n     \n\n     The Plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage those hazards.\n\n     \n\n     The Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques available.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\n     \n\n     The PHA team recommendations are reviewed with plant management for evaluation and resolution. Implementation of safety improvements in response to PHA findings is based on corporate risk acceptance criteria.  ISP utilizes a Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA) method to guide in prioritization of these improvements.  This ensures that potential accident scenarios with the highest risks receive immediate attention.  All approved safety improvements being implemented in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are complete.

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  Procedures are maintained current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made to the process.  In addition, the operating procedures provide guidance on how to respond to events that result in exceeding safe operating limits for specific process or equipment parameters.  The written operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n     \n\n1.4.5    Training\n\n\n\n     To complement the written procedures for process operations, ISP has implemented a company training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training on site operations.

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the Plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) information about safety and health hazards, (2) emergency response plan requirements, and (3) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  The Plant maintains SWPP 19, Contractor Safety, which specifically addresses contractor safe work practices and is reviewed for accuracy and updates every 3 years.  In addition, the Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n     \n\n1.4.7    Pre-startup Safety Reviews\n\n     \n\n     ISP conducts a pre-startup safety review for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the review is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in a"

The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\n     \n\n     Maintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).
