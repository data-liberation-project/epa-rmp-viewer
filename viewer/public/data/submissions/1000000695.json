A maximum of ten one (1) ton containers are stored at the WTP at any one time.\n\nChlorine Storage and Handling\nFour chlorine cylinders are stored in a room specifically designed for the storage of these tanks with the remaining cylinders stored outside. The room is equipped with chlorine gas detection equipment and an active ventilation system. If chlorine gas is detected within the storage room an alarm will alert WTP personnel and the ventilation system will start removing the gas from the storage room. Access to the chlorine room is through an outside entrance that is kept locked at all times.\n\nThe chlorine cylinders are equipped with a valve that requires a vacuum to be applied to it in order to open.  This eliminates discharges from the cylinder if a line or fitting fails. Self-contained breathing apparatuses are also available to WTP personnel if needed in the case of an emergency.  \n\nFive Year Accident History \nThere have been no chlorine related accidents at the WTP in the last five years.\n\nSafety Training\nWTP personnel are trained on the proper safety procedures if an accidental chlorine release occurs every six months. The training consists of notification requirements, use of SCBAs, health affects, proper use of leak repair kit, and proper procedures to take if a release occurs.\n\nEmergency Response\nWTP personnel are trained to handle all minor chlorine releases. The local fire department would be contacted if a large release occurred. The fire department would make the decision if an evacuation operation would be required.\n\nPlanned Change to Improve Safety\nThe City of Minot installed chain-link fence around the entire water treatment facility in 2004. Security cameras were also installed that includes a camera for viewing chlorine storage area. With the Northwe"
