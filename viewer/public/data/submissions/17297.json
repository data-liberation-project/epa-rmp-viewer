SOUTH HEART No. DAK. are committed to providing a safe workplace free of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Health, safety and environmental compliance are a fundamental part of every employee's job.  It is facility policy to adhere to applicable Federal, State and Local laws and to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release were to occur, the facility would respond in accordance with it's Emergency Response Plan and is prepared to work with the local fire department, the Local Emergency Planning Committee and other authorities to control and mitigate the release and minimize the impact of the release to employees, the environment and the general public.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled: The primary activity at this facility (the stationary source) is the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia for direct sale to farmers.  The maximum stored quantity of anhydrous ammonia is approximately 149,280 pounds stored in 1 storage tank(s).  The maximum fill level of the tank(s) is 85% of the total tank(s) capacity, which is controlled by a liquid level gauge.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario.\nThe worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank releases as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 149,280, which represents the volume of storage at 85% of capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint is 4.4 miles.  The alternate release scenario involves the release of anhydrous ammonia from a breakdown/rupture in a three(3) inch hose during transfer of ammonia from the storage tank to a nurse tank.  The quantity of ammonia released as a gas would be approximately 95 pounds.\n\nThe accidental release prevention program.  The facility complies with the EPA's accidental "
