Ammonia is the only hazardous chemical used at this facility that is subject to the CalARP program or federal RMP requirements.\n\n\n\nThis facility recognizes the hazards associated with the use of highly hazardous chemicals.  As a reflection of our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations, we submit this plan to address the hazards inherent with the use of ammonia.  Our program addresses safety precautions regarding the handling and operation of this covered system as well as proper training for those who operate and maintain the system.  The company training policy requires that all employees will be properly trained for a job position before assignment to that job.\n\n\n\nOur accidental release prevention program is clearly defined by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Program and California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program for this facility.  This prevention program follows industry-recommended standards for preventing unnecessary human exposures and reducing the threat to the health of our employees as well as to members of the community and the surrounding area.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle these chemicals, the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility and its processes, and the training that we provide our personnel.  This Plan is updated as required by law.\n\n\n\nOur Emergency Action Plan (EAP) details the response this facility will take as a result of a release, or impending release, of ammonia.  The Plan includes procedures for notification of the local emergency responders.  This EAP also includes a specific protocol for responding to an ammonia release and assigns an Emergency Coordinator to implement the response.  This Plan i"

The facility lies to the west of State Highway 160 (Lander Avenue) north of the town of Hilmar and north of August Avenue.  The facility is situated in an area comprised primarily of agricultural lands, light commercial and office areas, and residential areas.\n\n\n\nThis facility manufactures and stores cheese products for wholesale distribution.  The facility areas include offices, production buildings, a wastewater treatment facility, parking, a visitors center, warehouses, loading/unloading docks and areas, raw material tank storage, and three ammonia refrigeration systems.  The facility operates seven days per week throughout the year.  \n\n\n\nRegulated Substance Handled\n\n\n\nThis facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant in each of these three systems.  Systems include the Cold Storage System, the Production System, and the Production 2013 System.  Each system is a single-stage mechanical refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nCompressors provide suction and compression for the systems to operate.  The heat of compression in the high-pressure compressor discharge is removed in the evaporative condensers.  Each condenser drains high-pressure liquid to its respective system high-pressure receiver for screw compressor cooling an"

Oil is drained from the Production System through the plate and frame chillers, which also have self-closing, spring-loaded valves.  Oil from the Production 2013 System is drained through oil pots at the accumulator and surge drums.  All pressure vessels in the systems have dual safety relief valves (SRV's) to protect the respective vessel against overpressure conditions.  All SRV's on the Cold Storage System and Production 2013 System relieve to a respective  ammonia diffusion tank via a common discharge piping system.  An auto purger removes non-condensibles and air as required to maintain efficient refrigeration processes.\n\n\n\nEvaporator piping and valve trains are located on the roof and the evaporators are defrosted with hot gas from the high stage discharge line at the Cold Storage and Production systems.\n\n\n\n \n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThis facility complies with the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program and OSHAs Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.
