The plan outlines actions that company technicians and contract employees are to take when there is an unwanted release of highly hazardous chemicals. The intent of this plan is to facilitate the prompt evacuation of employees when necessary and to account for all personnel.  The emergency plan also includes procedures for handling small releases.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is properly functioning, the Gray County Gas Plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits will be conducted at least every 3 years. The audit team includes those knowledgeable in the process, operations personnel, and at least one person trained in audit techniques and practices. The audit team develops findings and corrective actions are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained. \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nEnergy Transfer is committed to operating the Gray County Gas Plant in a safe manner for workers, the public, and the environment. Energy Transfer personnel utilize auditing processes to ensure the plant complies with safe operations of its processes.  In the event improvements in safety can be realized through auditing efforts, actions are planned and instituted to respond to safety enhancements of operating practices.  Improvements to safety are a continual process at the plant."

Process equipment inspection and testing follows recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices. Equipment deficiencies that are outside of acceptable limits are corrected before further use or in a safe and timely manner when necessary means are taken to ensure safe operation.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe Gray County Gas Plant has a comprehensive system to manage and document changes to all covered processes. A systematic approach is followed to control and manage facility changes in order to minimize the possibility that such changes will have an adverse impact on personnel safety, equipment, or the environment.  Employees involved in process operations and maintenance and contract employees whose job tasks might be affected by process changes are informed of and trained in the change prior to process start-up.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Gray County Gas Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  An incident investigation is initiated as promptly as possible to thoroughly investigate and analyze the incident.  This investigation is led by an incident investigation team consisting of those with appropriate knowledge and experience in the process. The findings and recommendations made by the incident investigation team are promptly addressed and resolved in a timely manner. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.\n\nEmergency Planning and Response\n\nThe Gray County Gas Plant retains a written site specific formal emergency response plan which includes the designated actions the company and all personnel will ta"

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides an additional check to make sure that construction and equipment are in accordance with design specification, that adequate safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place, and that training of each employee involved in operating the process or equipment has been completed. A standard checklist is used to document compliance.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Gray County Gas Plant has well-established programs, procedures, and practices that are required to ensure that equipment used to process, store, or handle lightly hazardous chemicals and/or flammable gas or liquid is designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize the risk of a release. Equipment examples include vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, and relief and vent systems with associated emergency shutdown systems and controls (i.e., monitoring devices, sensors, alarms, and interlocks).\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) a review of the process hazards, and (3) t"

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years by the PHA team.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Gray County Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) initial startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) emergency operations, (6) normal shutdown, and (7) startup following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a consistent training basis for new operators. Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and certified as current. When a process change occurs, operating procedures are revised as necessary through the management of change process.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written process operation procedures, the Gray County Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees. New employees receive job specific basic training in plant operations. Employee training includes emphasis on safety and health hazards, emergency shut down operations, and safe work practices. Operators demonstrating adequate knowledge to safely perform duties and tasks are allowed to work independently.\n\nHot Work Permit\n\nThe Gray County Gas Plant issues a hot work permit for all hot work operations conducted on or near a covered process.

In addition, the plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters and ensures limit maintenance by using highly trained personnel, process controls, and monitoring and protective instrument systems.\n\nThe plant also maintains documentation that provides information about the design and construction of process equipment. Equipment information includes construction materials, design pressure, and temperature and electrical ratings.  This information provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Gray County Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Gray County Gas Plant primarily uses the HAZOP method to perform these evaluations. This technique provides a highly structured approach where process parameters such as flow and temperature are examined for deviations from their intended design. Deviation effects are considered in order to determine resulting potential hazards while preliminary recommendations for improvement are proposed.\n\nThe PHA team findings are promptly and systematically addressed.

The Energy Transfer policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nEnergy Transfer operates the Gray County Gas Plant located in Gray County County, Texas. The Gray County Gas Plant is a cryogenic natural gas processing plant designed for the extraction of liquid Y-grade product from a gas stream. The cryogenic extraction plant recovers methane, ethane, propane, butane, and pentane from the inlet gas.  As evidenced in the ensuing text and based on criteria outlined in the Accidental Release Prevention Program (ARP), the Gray County Plant is a Program 1 process.\n\nThe Gray County Gas Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances were present in the process and if they exceeded the threshold quantity. All equipment and vessels are considered to be connected and/or co-located; consequently, for the purposes of the ARP Program, all equipment and vessels are part of a single process. The identification of even a single vessel exceeding threshold quantities of a regulated flammable or toxic substance would subject a process to threshold determination for offsite consequence analysis.\n\nIt was determined that a single vessel of flammable mixture exceeded threshold quantity. The identification of th"
