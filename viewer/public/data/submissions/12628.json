Both have regulations addressing chlorine gas in quantities greater than 1500 pounds.\n\nThe City of Fort Dodge is an operator of a stationary source subject to the Risk Management Program Rule. For this reason, we are submitting this Risk Management Program to include all information required in 68.115 through 68.185 for all covered processes. As determined by 68.115, the presence of chlorine is above the threshold level for a regulated substance.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe primary activity at the John W. Pray Water Treatment Plant is to treat and distribute drinking water to the residences and businesses in Fort Dodge, Iowa.  To do that, it is imperative that a disinfection process be administered to maintain quality drinking water. This is accomplished through the use of chlorine gas. \n\n\nSource Identification:  John W.

Administrative controls that limit this amount from being released include manifolding of the cylinders and use of chlorinators that work on a vacuum system. Once the vacuum has been lost, the chlorine is not permitted to feed from the cylinder unless there is a leak on the cylinder itself from a cylinder rupture, from a melting fuse plug, or from a leaking valve. \n\nThe worst case scenario is anticipated to occur from a release of a 1- ton chlorine cylinder.\n\nChlorine is a gas at ambient temperature. It is handled as a liquid under its own pressure in the cylinder and as a gas in all other parts of the chlorinating system (from the cylinder to injection in the finished water).\n\nALL DATA UTILIZED IN DETERMINING WORST-CASE SCENARIO WAS OBTAINED UTILIZING THE EPA RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS GUIDANCE DOCUMENT.\n\nFrom information obtained from the Chlorine Institute and from review of past release scenarios from the EPA Guidance Document, a Mitigated Release of Gas formula was utilized. \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tQR =  (QS divided by 10) multiplied by 0.55\n\t\t\t\t \nWhere: QR = release rate (pounds per minute)\n\t   QS = quantity released (pounds)\n\nChlorine gas is handled inside of a storage room at the John W. Pray Water Treatment Plant, so a reduction in the release rate to the outside atmosphere was taken since the release is in an enclosure.\n\nFor estimation purposes, it is anticipated a worst case scenario would be from shearing a tank valve. This would allow chlorine gas to release uncontrolled through the opening. In 10 minutes approximately 2,000 pounds of chlorine gas would be released or 200 pounds of chlorine gas per minute into the enclosure.  \n\nWind speed of 1.5 meters per seco"

      "SummaryText": "nd and an F stability class are being utilized for determination of this worst case scenario.\n\n1.1.2 Mass Released in the Worst-Case Release Scenario: The mass M (pounds) of chlorine is all of the contents of a one-ton cylinder and the attached piping.  The John W. Pray Water Treatment Plant has a maximum of 4, 1-ton chlorine cylinders onsite at any one time. \n\nA limiting factor of  administrative controls is included in the mass release calculations. Realistically, the tank valve of the other cylinder that is manifolded  with the one in use is closed until the active tank has emptied its contents.  Then a full tank replaces the empty one, is isolated by its tank valve, and the tank previously attached to the manifold is opened, tested and used.\n\n1.1.3 Distance To Toxic Endpoint: The toxic end point of chlorine was determined by utilizing Appendix A Table of Toxic Endpoints for chlorine. This was listed as 0.0087 mg/L. \n\nSince chlorine is a gas at atmospheric temperature and will generate and accumulate as a dense cloud and is located in an urban topography--table #7 was selected to determine the evacuation distance. Release duration was chosen for 10 minutes. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Toxic End Point for chlorine gas is 4.3 miles according to Reference Table #7. \n\n\nThe population area surrounding the Water Plant consists primarily of heavy residential to the north and west, and light industrial to the south.  A unique factor in the determination of exposed population would be greatly controlled by the topography of the adjacent land. The water plant sits in a valley along the Des Moines River and is flanked by very high ridges that run parallel to the river from north to south.  The east and west exposures form a very narrow band, minimizing much of the population of the City.  A 1-mile radius would be classified as 90% residential. \n\n1.1.4 Passive Mitigation:  Credit is being taken for passive mitigation at the John W. Pray Water Treatment Plant since the chlorine cylinders are s"

The release would then be mitigated by the room it is stored in and the rest of the building.\n\n1.2 Alternative Release Scenario:  An alternative release scenario chosen for compliance with this RMP is TANK PIGTAIL LINE FAILURE. \n\n1.2.1 Mandatory Inputs:  Because cylinder changouts occur approximately every fourteen days, the potential for a chlorine release is most likely to occur during this process. \n\nAlthough the release rate is not likely to be sufficient to reach complete release of a 1-ton chlorine cylinder in 10 minutes, it has the greatest potential for chlorine release during normal operations at the water plant.  It will likely not propagate offsite.\n\nAn average wind speed of 3m/s and D stability class has been chosen for this alternative release scenario.\n\n1.2.2 Choice of Alternative Scenario:  Although there may be other choices for a potential alternative scenario for chlorine gas release, they will likely not be large enough to exceed the toxic end point offsite.  Other alternative releases would be from: \n\nLeaking seals; leaking valves\nDelivery truck hoist failure and damage to the cylinder\nProcess piping releases from failures at flanges, joints, welds, & valves.\nProcess vessel releases due to cracks, seal failure, drain, or bleed failure.\nFailure of chlorine injector equipment.\nRelease of chlorine through a melted fuse plug during a fire.\n\nAs mentioned above, the alternative release scenario is anticipated to \"most likely\" occur from normal operational procedures when handling chlorine changeover.  A release rate of less than 50 pounds per minute is anticipated for this type of release. \n\n\nThe Toxic End Point for chlorine gas is 0.62 miles according to Reference Table #16 for an Alternative Release Scenario at the John W.

Pray Water Treatment Plant must be reviewed and updated at least once by 2003.  If changes occur in our processes, quantities stored or handled change significantly, or any other aspect of our chlorine equipment or processes change that increase or decrease the worst-case scenario toxic endpoint, a revised analysis must be done and included in this Risk Management Plan.\n\n1.8 Five-Year Accident History: \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of chlorine at the John W.
