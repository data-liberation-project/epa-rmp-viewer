A separately owned cattle feedlot produces large quantities of clean manure needing treatment. The anaerobic digester transforms the cow manure into methane a.k.a. biogas. The ethanol plant uses the biogas instead of natural gas or coal in their boilers to produce steam for the facility. The wet cake byproduct from ethanol production is then fed to the cattle. AltEn started operations on January 9, 2015.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\nAltEn has an ongoing commitment to the health and safety of onsite employees and the surrounding community. This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training for the proper operation and maintenance of plant equipment and preventative maintenance programs.\n\n\n\nAltEn has emergency response policies in place that are addressed in the facility's Health and Safety Plan; Industrial Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan; Spill Prevention, Controls, and Countermeasures Plan; and Emergency Action Plan. Most of the listed Plans require a minimum of annual training in order to keep employees educated on emergency response procedures in place at the facility. All new employees are required to undergo training on emergency response procedures prior to initiating responsibilities onsite.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES:\n\nThe AltEn ethanol plant is located near Mead, Saunders County, Nebraska.\n\nThe facility will operate 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn. The regulated substances under the RMP program include the ammonia solution (greater than 20%) and Denaturant (natural gasoline), which is considered a flamm"

Aqueous Ammonia: Aqueous ammonia is stored as a liquid in three (3) aboveground steel tanks. The worst-case scenario used is a release of the entire contents of one of the largest storage vessels onsite, creating a toxic cloud. The containment berm the tank(s) are located was used as passive mitigation in this scenario. RMP Comp was used to determine the worst-case distance to endpoint; the model results were a 1.4-mile radius. Population data was obtained using Circular Area Profiling Software (CAPS) which incorporates 2010 U.S. Census Data. Public receptor information (i.e. schools, hospitals, etc.) was obtained using Google Earth. No environmental receptors are within the worst-case distance to endpoint for ammonia.\n\n\n\n2. Flammable Mixture (Denaturant): The flammable mixture stored onsite is natural gasoline, typically referred to as denaturant. Natural gasoline is used onsite to denature ethanol prior to shipment offsite. Denaturant is stored in an aboveground steel tank. The denaturant is located in a diked containment structure that contains an impermeable liner with gravel overlay. A worst case MSDS was used to determine RMP applicability. The worst-case scenario used is the release of the entire contents of the denaturant tank, causing a vapor cloud explosion. RMP Comp was used to determine the worst-case distance to endpoint; the model results were a 0.2-mile radius. Of the entire tank contents, only a portion was used in the RMP Comp model due to the breakdown of regulated constituents under CAA Section 112(r). Population data was obtained using Circular Area Profiling Software (CAPS) which incorporates 2010 U.S. Census Data. Public receptor information (i.e. schools, hospitals, etc.) was obtained using Google Earth. No environmental receptors are affected by a worst-case release of denaturant.\n\n\n\nAlternative Scenarios:\n\n1. Aqueous Ammonia: The alternate scenario used f"

      "SummaryText": "or aqueous ammonia is a release due to a rupture disk/relief valve failure from the ammonia piping system. This scenario is considered the most likely cause of an ammonia release onsite. The alternate release duration assumed is 10 minutes with an atmospheric stability of D and wind speed of 3.0 m/second. The facility control room is manned 24 hours/day and would be alerted of the relief valve failure at the ammonia tank within minutes. The emergency shutdown system installed at the facility and the excess flow valve has been considered in this scenario as active mitigation. The ammonia tanks are located within a diked containment area which was used as Passive Mitigation in the model. RMP Comp was used to determine the alternative distance to endpoint; 0.1-mile radius. Population data was obtained using Circular Area Profiling Software (CAPS) which incorporates 2010 U.S. Census Data. Public receptor information (i.e. schools, hospitals, etc.) was obtained using Google Earth. No environmental receptors are within the alternative distance to endpoint for ammonia.\n\n\n\nThe facility ammonia storage qualifies for Program 2 for ammonia since public receptors could be impacted by a worst-case release. The facility is not subject to OSHA's Program Safety Management requirements that would trigger Program 3. The worst-case scenario for denaturant does not impact a public receptor and therefore falls under Program 1.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\nPlease review the first section of this Executive Summary for the general accidental release prevention program information.\n\n\n\nAltEn's maintenance department performs regular preventative maintenance inspections, as required by the manufacturer's recommendations and/or State and Federal regulations. Monthly visual inspections are performed, and quarterly leak detection monitoring is performed and reported per NDEQ requirements.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nThere have bee"
