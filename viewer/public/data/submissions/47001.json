Albemarle, Tyrone Plant was opened for business in 1976 by two entrepreneurs.  In 1986, Albemarle, Tyrone Plant was bought by First Chemical Company of Pascagoula, MS.  First Chemical Company is a subsidiary of First Mississippi Corporation, who was restructured under the name of ChemFirst Inc. in late 1996. Albemarle Corporation purchased the site in July of 2001.\n\nThe facility is designed for maximum flexibility and is continuously upgraded to ensure safe operation, minimal waste, and top efficiency.  We have more than 60,000 gallons of reactor capacity and a complete range of solids handling equipment.  The plant is especially well-equipped for complex, multi-step synthesis.  Albemarle, Tyrone Plant's production operations consist of the batch production of specific and finite campaigns to produce chemicals for our customers.\n\nThe facility's Quality and Environmental management systems are ISO 9002 (Quality) and 14001 (Environmental) registered.\n\nFACILITY POLICIES FOR ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVETION AND EMERGENCY REPSONSE\n\nCompany environmental and safety/health policy statements stress the importance of protecting the safety and health of our employees as well as that of the community and the public.  \"The world's natural resources of air, water, and land are finite and must be conserved and protected.  Life and health are precious and must be safeguarded.  These beliefs compel us to conduct our business in a manner that protects the health and safety of our employees and the public....\"  \"The personal safety and health of each employee of this company and the general public of Tyrone is of primary importance.

These chemicals and their maximum intended inventory levels are: chlorine, 2,000 pounds; phosphorous oxychloride, 38,000 pounds; 37% formaldehyde  70,000 pounds,  12% oleum, 27,000 pounds and hydrochloric acid (37% solution), 70,000 pounds and 3000 lbs of anhydrous hydrochloric acid in tube trailers.\nChlorine is a gas that is delivered and maintained in cylinders, anhydrous hydorchloric acid is deliveredand used from 3000 pound tubes, 12% oleum is a solution stored in a 3000 gallon vessel, phosphorous oxychloride is a liquid stored in a  gallon vessel while hydrochloric acid solution and 37% formaldehyde are  liquids that are stored in an 8000 gallon tanks.  Only one cylinder of chlorine is used at a time to feed the raw material to a batch.  In addition to minimizing the inventory of these and other chemicals that are needed for our production operations, we also try to remove the chemicals from our site when they are no longer needed for a production campaign.\n\n\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nA worst-case release scenario for chlorine, a cylinder leaks and releases 2000 pounds of chlorine  gas (the entire contents of the pressurized cylinder) in 10 minutes.  The impact distance hypothetically could be up to 1.3 miles during the worse possible weather conditions.  This scenario DOES NOT take into account the plant's safety and prevention systems, and assumes nothing is done to minimize the release.\n\nFor hydrochloric acid solution, a tank rupture causes the release of 40,000 pounds.  (The amount of material in the 8000 gallon tank is limited to 7200 gallons by written operating procedures and high-level alarms.)  The liquid spills into a dike around the tank and evaporates over 10 minutes.  The concrete dike around the tank limits the exposed surface area of a pool.

The Emergency Response Plan is updated to reflect any facility changes, and is coordinated with the Blair County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC).  Annually, all employees receive training in their duties under the plan, and the evacuation plan is practiced at least once each year.  Each shift has a trained Emergency Response Team, that is equipped to respond to fires, spills and releases, and medical emergencies.  Each Team is comprised of employees and is led by its shift supervisor, who assumes the role of Incident Commander during any on-site emergency.  Albemarle, Tyrone Plant emergency response personnel receive appropriate training (i.e., confined space rescue, SCBA, fire fighting, spill response); some members are also certified in CPR and first aid response.  Drills are conducted at least twice/year for each crew's response personnel.  The safety department determines the scenario for each drill.  After the drill is completed, it is critiqued; the findings and recommendations are used to help design future drills and training exercises.  Using this approach, each Team addresses specific response areas that need improvement.\n\nAll production and maintenance employees are also trained to respond to spills and releases, and all employees receive training in the use of hand held fire extinguishers to extinguish incipient stage fires.  In addition, the facility is protected with a foam sprinkler system, and is also equipped with several outdoor fire monitors and wheeled fire extinguishers that may be used in the event of a larger fire.
