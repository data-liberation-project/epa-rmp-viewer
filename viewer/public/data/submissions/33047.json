The PHA is an organized and systematic effort to \nidentify and analyze the significance of potential hazards associated with the processing \nor handling of highly hazardous chemicals.  The PHA focuses on equipment, \ninstrumentation, utilities, human actions (routine and non-routine), and external factors \nthat might impact the process.  These considerations assist in determining the hazards and \npotential failure points or failure modes of a process.  When hazard scenarios are \nidentified, existing or proposed designs and operations are assessed to determine if \nappropriate engineering and administrative controls are in place.  If the current level of \nprotection is determined insufficient, recommendations are made to eliminate and \nmitigate the scenarios.\n\nIn order to provide a thorough analysis as specific as possible to the Water Treatment \nPlant, the Hazards and Operability Analysis (HazOp) method, incorporating the guide-\nword approach, was selected for the PHA.  The HazOp Study was conducted on February \n23, 1999 by a HazOp Team consisting of two employees of Block Environmental \nServices, with expertise in the HazOp process, and five members of the City's Staff, with \ncollective expertise in the management and operations of both the City's water and \nwastewater treatment facilities.

A thorough \ninvestigation of the facility's susceptibility to sabotage and terrorism was conducted and \nwill be completed by June 2004.\n\nBased on the 1999 RMP recommendation, ventilation systems are operated in manual \nmode in order to mitigate chances of an uncontrolled release. All wells have manual \nswitches on the outside of the building for this purpose.  The HazOp team concluded that \nthe engineering controls, safety systems, and procedures in place at the facility achieve \nthe lowest risk practicable for all deviations identified.  The chlorination equipment used \nincorporates many design standards for chlorine equipment that have been developed to \nutilize chlorine for disinfection as safely as is practical.

The PHA is an organized and systematic effort to \n\nidentify and analyze the significance of potential hazards associated with the processing \n\nor handling of highly hazardous chemicals.  The PHA focuses on equipment, \n\ninstrumentation, utilities, human actions (routine and non-routine), and external factors \n\nthat might impact the process.  These considerations assist in determining the hazards and \n\npotential failure points or failure modes of a process.
