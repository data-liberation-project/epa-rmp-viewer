It is governed by the citizens of the district who elect its board of directors, and it is staffed by approximately 160 regular employees. This plant is located in a rural area of Nevada County California adjacent to an air park, some residences and a commercial/ industrial subdivision. It processes untreated surface water that originates from reservoirs in the High Sierra. It produces some of the finest drinking water in the world.\n\nThe Nevada Irrigation District's Accidental Release Prevention Program involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices. The district adheres to all applicable procedures of the Environmental Protection Agency Prevention Program. The district's Emergency response Policy involves the preparation response plans which are tailored to this facility and to the emergency response of the community and of local responding agencies. It is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nThis plant was constructed in the 1970's and has been periodically upgraded as the requirements of clean water and safe practices have become more demanding. Two one ton chlorine cylinders that are used in our processing are stored and utilized in a separate building from other processes. The fact that we have never experienced a measurable release of chlorine gas attests to a high degree of care and training. It is a level of excellence that upper management and the community insist is maintained.\n\nThe offsite consequences analysis includes two scenarios. The first scenario releases the gas in ten minutes at an amount of two thousand pounds. The second scenario states that 317 pounds of chlorine would be released in sixty minutes. Both releases would tri"

They are trained and certified by the California Department of Health Services. As part of their certification and their training, safe chlorine handling , high standards of maintenance of processing equipment, release prevention and emergency response are made a top priority. Regular safety training, preventive maintenance of equipment, and continuing education are the intrinsic duties of the operators of this plant. \n\nThe District's nine treatment plant operators and supervisors make up the Chlorine Emergency Response Team. They are trained regularly in the usage of self-contained breathing apparatus while wearing B level chemical suits. The District has one ton and one hundred and fifty pound chlorine emergency repair kits. The response team's exercises include the use of these kits while wearing the suits and the self-contained breathing apparatus systems. Training exercises are performed at the plant site while simulating equipment failures. Each team member has regular cardiopulmonary testing. The District has a health clinic and provides excellent healthcare benefits.\n\nThe foundation of our accidental release prevention program is the chlorine leak"

This system, as well as other processing systems, are tested and maintained regularly. Major overhauls on all system components, including the leak detection system, are preformed annually.\n\nThe emergency response program includes interaction and communication with local and State responsive agencies. The Nevada County Department of Environmental Health, as part of their business plan program, inspects our facilities bi-annually and is notified immediately if there is a hazardous release. The Nevada County Fire District, as incident commander in the case of a chlorine release, coordinates evacuation procedures in a worst case scenario. The California State Office of Emergency Services and Nevada County Office of Emergency Services are also notified in a worst case scenario. The District's chlorine manufacturer is also notified.\n\nThese policies and procedures are described in the Nevada Irrigation District's Chlorine Process Safety Management Manual. This manual, as required by State and local regulatory agencies, also contains information and procedures relating to chlorine processing equipment, handling, leak response and repair procedures, education and safety training. It contains a HAZOP Study and various report forms.\n\nThe Lake Wildwood Treatment Plant meets all current safety requirements. As it has in the past, the Nevada Irrigation District will comply with any and all new requirements and advancements in water treatment processes and safety. The well being of our community and our employees is paramount in the goals of our organization."
