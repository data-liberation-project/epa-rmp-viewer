Our objective is to continuously improve our safety, health and environmental performance.  The Company operates, maintains and designs improvements to the Delaware City Refinery to minimize environmental impact and to protect employees, contractors, and the public from injury and illness.  Safety, health, and environmental performance is a key factor in selecting and periodically evaluating contractors.  The Company routinely audits safety, health, and environmental performance to assure compliance and improvement.  The Company is prepared to respond quickly and effectively to any incidents involving the refinery, its equipment or products under its control.  The refinery has had an active process safety management (PSM) program since 1989.\n\nEmployee participation is important in PSM.  Refinery operators participate in every process hazard analysis (PHA) and PSM self-audit, contribute experience to updating operating procedures, evaluate jobs for hot work permits, participate on incident investigation and emergency response teams.  The refinery has two Health & Safety Representatives from the bargaining unit who contribute to PSM program decisions.  In addition they coordinate the Triangle of Prevention (TOP) incident investigation program which investigates every incident with trained investigators from both the bargaining unit and management.  Recommendations from investigations are tracked to completion in a computer database that reminds people weekly about their assigned work in resolving the recommendations.  This data tracking system is also used to follow up management of change (MOC) and recommendations from PHA, internal and external audits, incident investigations and mechanical inspections.\n\nRefinery people have held local public meetings to discuss the R"

The Company has also led or participated in Chemical Industry Council (CIC) and Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) public meetings to explain the RMP program and accidental release prevention policies and preparedness practices.\n\nThe Delaware City Refinery is a complex facility consisting of 11 operating process areas.  Each area has its own staff, control system, operations building, and process specific procedures.  These process areas contain unit operations that may be interconnected but that can also work independently.\n\nThe refinery is designed and operated to process crude oil into fuels including propane, butane, gasoline, home heating oil and diesel fuel.  The process units may use heat, pressure or catalyst to separate and recombine the hydrocarbons in crude oil to produce components for blending into fuel products.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only toxic material regulated by RMP that is stored in the refinery.  Hydrogen sulfide is present in several processes but is not stored and does not exist in sufficient quantity for EPA or OSHA regulation coverage.\n\nThere are three EPA Program Level 1 process areas.  These are the Crude Unit, Desulfurizer & Ether, and Low Pressure Reformer.\n\nThe Crude Unit uses heat and vacuum to separate crude oil into components for further processing.  Desalting units remove foul water from the crude oil.  The Sour Water Stripping section removes hydrogen sulfide and ammonia from refinery foul water.     Since the worst case release cannot reach the refinery boundary and there have been no RMP incidents in the past 5 years, the Crude Unit qualifies for Program Level 1.  \n\nThe Desulfurizer and Ether area processes use heat and catalyst to promote desirable chemical reactions.  Four Desulfurizer Trains remove sulfur compounds from raw gasoline, kerosene, and light fuel oils.  The Ether Units produce the oxygenate gasoline components methyl tert-butyl"

These tanks are instrumented with temperature indicators and with level indicators and alarms.  Their safety systems include pressure relief valves.  The above ground propane and butane tanks have remotely operated shutoff valves and water spray deluge systems.\n\nThe Hydrocracker and Hydrogen process area includes a unit for converting high sulfur gas oil into heating oil and gasoline, a unit for producing hydrogen and a selective hydrogenation unit.  The Hydrocracker uses high pressure and catalyst to crack heavy gas oils into lighter gasoline and fuel oils.  It has alarms on all critical operating parameters and the capability to safely depressure the process unit to the flare system in an emergency.  The hydrogen unit produces pure hydrogen by reforming methane from natural gas.  The selective hydrogenation unit adds hydrogen to less stable unsaturated molecules in raw gasoline to minimize gum formation.  \n\nThe Polymerization and Alkylation process combines light gases into gasoline blending components by the use of catalysts.  The Polymerization unit uses solid catalyst while the Alkylation catalyst is sulfuric acid.  Additional sections of this process area isomerize and separate hydrocarbon streams for gasoline blending.  \n\nThe Fluid Coker process uses high temperature to crack heavy hydrocarbon molecules into more useful gasoline and fuel oil components.  Fluid coke is a byproduct from the process and is the feedstock to the neighboring Repowering Project.  There are no public receptors within the worst case overpressure area.\n\nThe Catalytic Cracker and Gas Plant uses a circulating catalyst to break gas oils down into fuel oil, gasoline and light gases.

The Desulfurizer and Ether process area has not had any incidents that affected public receptors in the past five years and qualifies as a Program Level 1 process.\n\nThe Low Pressure Reformer uses a catalyst at high temperature to rearrange desulfurized naphtha molecules into high octane material for gasoline blending.  Hydrogen is a byproduct of the reforming reaction.  It is purified in an adsorption unit before being piped to other refinery processes.  The flammable worst case release scenario does not affect any public receptors.  Since starting up in 1983, the process has never had an incident meeting RMP reporting requirements and qualifies as a Program Level 1 process.\n\nThere are seven EPA Program Level 3 process areas.  These are Utilities, Blending Storage, Hydrocracker & Hydrogen, Polymerization & Alkylation, Fluid Coking, Catalytic Cracking & Gas Plant, and Naphtha Fractionation & Tetra Units.\n\nThe Utilities Area contains intermediate product storage, piping between process areas, flare system, fuel and natural gas distribution systems, fire water system, and anhydrous ammonia storage.  The anhydrous ammonia is stored as a liquid in a pressure tank at ambient temperature and piped to a process unit.  The tank has a level indicator, dual pressure relief valves and is protected from damage by barricade posts.  Fire water monitors and hoses in the area can be used to control ammonia gas from leaving the site if a leak were to occur.  Operators and refinery emergency responders are trained to use self contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) when responding to an ammonia release.  The ammonia tank inventory is administratively limited to reduce the accidental release potential.\n\nThe Blending Storage area contains tanks of crude oil, blending component oils and finished petroleum products.

There are no public receptors within the worst case overpressure area.  \n\nThe Sulfur Recovery process area lacks sufficient quantities of RMP listed hazardous materials to be registered in the EPA RMP program.  The Sulfur Recovery area is registered for hydrogen sulfide with Delaware only.  Hydrogen sulfide is not stored in the refinery but exists in piping between the Gas Plant where it is formed and the Sulfur Recovery area where it is converted to liquid sulfur product.  Process areas with high flowrates of hydrogen sulfide have area monitors to give early warning of possible leaks.  Operators and emergency response people are trained in the use of fresh air breathing equipment for responding immediately to a leak.  \n\nThe Delaware City Refinery has complied with Delaware's process safety management regulations since the Extremely Hazardous Risk Management Act was promulgated in 1989 as well as the OSHA Process Safety Management regulation 29 CFR 1910.119 of 1992.  The refinery keeps updated process safety information including equipment data, piping and instrument drawings, and material safety data sheets (MSDS). The process equipment is regularly inspected and maintained.  Each inspection is compared with previous ones and to applicable company and industry standards to help plan maintenance and prevent accidental releases from equipment failure.  Changes to equipment, procedures or processes are evaluated and tracked in the computer based Management of Change (MOC) system.  Operating proc"

      "SummaryText": "(ESP), Pressure Equipment Integrity (PEI), and Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM).  The Operator Training & Operating Procedures initiative created a bargaining unit training position for each process area.  Existing procedures were updated and new procedures are being added.  Operators are being trained in all procedures for their work area.  Management of Change was upgraded in 2002 to a computer based system for better tracking and efficient completion of the process and safety evaluations required before a modification is put into use.  Process Hazard Analysis was standardized on the PHA Works software which uses Hazard And Operability (HAZOP) methodology.  Additional people were trained as HAZOP team leaders.  Incident Investigation was upgraded to cover a wider variety of incidents and near misses.  Incident Investigation seeks to identify and evaluate root causes, determine measures to prevent recurrence, and follow up on all action items.  Ensure Safe Production studies create meaningful and timely notice of process deviations to prevent or mitigate process upsets.  Parameter limits are set for key process variables.  Pressure Equipment Integrity uses regular equipment inspections to assess equipment condition.  Corrosion Control Document (CCD) studies are similar to PHA's but concentrate on groups of equipment where the same corrosion mechanism may appear.  Reliability Centered Maintenance monitors rotating equipment performance and condition to schedule maintenance in a predictive manner before failure occurs.  Many refinery people have been trained in risk assessment so that they can prioritize work by risk ranking.  The Unsafe Condition & Near Miss reporting system has brought attention and action to situations and minor incidents to prevent bigger problems.\n\nMany man-years of work by operators, shift supervisors, engineers, trainers, inspectors, maintenance workers, area supervisors, and managers go into the Process Safety Management Program.

      "SummaryText": "edures are updated as needed and reviewed annually.  Operators receive thorough training to qualify for each position they work.  Operator skills are maintained through documented refresher training every 3 years.  An initial process hazard analysis (PHA) study was done for each process unit.  Revalidation PHA studies are done every 5 years.  Recommendations from the PHA studies are tracked to their resolution in a computer based system that automatically reminds people who have unresolved recommendations assigned to them.  The refinery performs a self-audit of process safety management compliance every 3 years.  Delaware's Accidental Release Prevention group has made PSM inspections.  The refinery looks forward to these inspections as a way to continually improve the activities and documentation that can help prevent incidents and accidental releases.\n\nThe Delaware City Refinery has had three PSM incidents in the past five years.  An incident on July 17, 2001 started with the ignition and fire of unexpected flammable vapor leaking from a sulfuric acid storage tank.  One contractor died and eight others were injured from the fire and acid.  The acid tank was destroyed and its entire contents were released.  Part of the acid release reached the Delaware River causing a fish kill.  The acid regeneration operation that used the tank was permanently shutdown following the incident.   \nOn January 22, 2002 a process unit upset caused tube end plugs to open in a process heater releasing hydrogen and residual gas oil that immediately burned.  There were no injuries or offsite consequences but the process heater and some peripheral equipment were damaged.  \nThe third incident occurred on May 4, 2003 when butane was inadvertently sent to a sulfuric acid storage tank where it vaporized, overwhelmed the tank\u00bfs relief valve capacity, split the wall to roof seam, and released butane and sulfuric acid.  There were no injuries or offsite consequences but the tank needed significant"

      "SummaryText": "repairs.\n\nThe first line of emergency response in the refinery is the process operators.  They have been trained in emergency operation and shutdown procedures.  Most of the operators have also had firefighting training at the refinery fire fighting training facility or Delaware Fire School.  The refinery has trained emergency response teams for firefighting, medical emergency, rescue, hazardous material (Hazmat) incident, and oil spill response.  The refinery Fire Department has a high ladder truck, ambulance, rescue truck, foam truck, water cannon, and several pumper trucks.\nThe emergency contact person for the refinery at any time is the Refinery Shift  Superintendent.  If there is a significant fire or release, the refinery notifies the New Castle County 911 center and potentially affected neighboring industrial facilities by telephone or radio.  The 911 center can call additional fire departments, emergency units, and Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  The Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) hotline is notified.  The Incident Commander and DNREC are responsible for notifying and protecting the community.  Community notification may be by a 3 to 5 minute siren blast, emergency vehicle loud speakers, door-to-door notification, or local radio station announcements.\nThe Delaware City Refinery participates in the New Castle County LEPC and Delaware City Community Awareness and Emergency Response group (DC CAER) emergency planning and training exercises.  The refinery maintains a close relationship with local fire and emergency response organizations to which many employees and refinery contract workers belong.\n\nIn 1999 the refinery started work on important process safety initiatives to improve safety and performance of equipment and operation.  These initiatives include Operator Training & Operating Procedures, Management of Change (MOC), Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), Incident Investigation, Ensure Safe Production"
