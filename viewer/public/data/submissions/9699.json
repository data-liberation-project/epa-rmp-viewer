This is exemplified by the Huntsman Austin Laboratories site having earned and maintained since 1989 the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) Star award for excellence in safety performance.  Huntsman Austin Laboratories  maintains a working Process Safety Management (PSM) program, which implements a series of steps to prevent potential hazards associated with the process and assures a well-trained work force.   The PSM program further implements its policies with onsite procedures and manuals.  Huntsman Austin Laboratories participates with community agencies to develop emergency response plans and participates in cooperative training with these agencies.  Since its certification in March 1993, Austin Laboratories has also been an active participant in the International Standards Organization (ISO) 9002 quality management program.\n \n2.  Regulated Substances.  Huntsman's Austin Laboratories is located at 7114 North Lamar Boulevard in north central Austin, Texas.  Austin Laboratories performs product development and process demonstration work for surfactants, specialty amines, and other specialty products which are used in the manufacture of a variety of consumer goods.  \n As raw material for its processes, Huntsman Austin Laboratories uses five regulated toxic substances :  acrylonitrile, ammonia, ethylene oxide, formaldehyde and propylene oxide.   Common industry uses for these materials are listed below.  Acrylonitrile is used in the manufacture of consumer goods such as textiles, food containers, toys, luggage, and automotive parts.

      "SummaryText": "fertilizers.  Ethylene oxide is used as a sterilant and fumigant for equipment in the medical field and in food processing plants; it is also used in the production of detergents, antifreeze, urethane foam, and fuel additives.  Formaldehyde is used in the manufacture of textile products and as a disinfectant in medical, personal care, and food handling applications .  Propylene oxide is commonly used for the production of packaged foods, cosmetics, plastics, polyurethane foam, and antifreeze.\t \n \n3.  Offsite Consequence Analysis  \nThe RMP Rule requires that offsite consequence analysis (OCA) be performed to estimate the potential impact of an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.  This OCA includes the development of worst and alternative release scenarios for the release of toxic and flammable substances.  The OCA allows for the consideration of administrative controls (ex: self-imposed maximum vessel inventory) in estimating potential worst case scenario impacts.  Other safety controls may be considered in alternative release scenarios.  \n\nWorst Case Release Scenarios\nHuntsman Austin Laboratories uses no regulated flammable substances as defined by the RMP Rule.  The worst case scenario associated with toxic substances used at Huntsman Austin Laboratories is represented by the failure of an ethylene oxide storage tank, resulting in the release of 180,000 pounds of ethylene oxide over a 10-minute period.  This worst case scenario has the potential to affect offsite receptors.\n\nThis worst case scenario is based on EPA required assumptions (i.e., the simultaneous failure of all active safety and emergency response systems) and is highly unlikely.   No accidental release having environmental impacts approaching those associated with the worst case scenario has ever occurred at the facility.\n\nAlternative Case Release Scenarios  \nThe alternative case scenario for acrylonitrile is a pump leak resulting in the release of 400"

Active mitigation for this scenario includes fire monitors and a leak detection system with a water-deluge.\n\nThe alternative case scenario for ammonia is a gasket leak resulting in the release of 270 pounds of ammonia over a 2-minute period.  This alternative case scenario has the potential to affect offsite receptors.  Active mitigation for this scenario includes excess flow valves, fire monitors, and a leak detection system with a water-deluge. \n\nThe alternative case scenario for ethylene oxide is a valve packing leak, resulting in the release of 60 pounds of ethylene oxide over a 5-minute period.  This alternative case scenario has the potential to affect offsite receptors.  Active mitigation for this scenario includes fire monitors and a leak detection system with a water-deluge.\n\nThe alternative case scenario for formaldehyde is a pump leak that results in the release of 830 pounds of formaldehyde over a 10-minute period.  This alternative case scenario has the potential to affect offsite receptors.  Active mitigation for this scenario includes fire monitors.\n\nThe alternative case scenario for propylene oxide is a pump leak, resulting in 530 pounds of propylene oxide released over a 10-minute period.  This alternative case scenario does not have the potential to affect offsite receptors.  Active mitigation for this scenario includes fire monitors and a leak detection system with a water-deluge.\n\n4.
