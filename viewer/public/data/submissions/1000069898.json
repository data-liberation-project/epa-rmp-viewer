      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary:\n\n\n\nAirgas USA, LLC. an Air Liquide Company (Airgas USA, LLC. commonly known as AMG - Airgas Merchant Gases) operates a liquid hydrogen (LH2) transfill facility with thirty one (31) employees in Etiwanda, California.  The facility is manned 24 hours per day. The Etiwanda hydrogen process receives LH2 by tractor trailer that is stored onsite in a single bulk storage vessel (5,860 lbs at approximately -420 ?F) before being vaporized and transferred into gas tube trailers then distributed to customers.  Distribution trucks containing approximately 590 lbs of gaseous hydrogen are filled on a daily basis. Each is monitored and analyzed, increasing operational safety.\n\n \n\nOn or about June 25th, 2018 this transfill facility and process will be expanded and the single bulk storage vessel will hold a capacity of 7,810 lbs LH2; the planned inventory for the covered process will be 40,000 pounds (lbs) of hydrogen.  The covered process will exceed the listed regulatory threshold quantity (TQ) of 10,000 lbs for hydrogen and will be subject to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, written in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 (40 CFR Part 68) (the RMP Rule), as well as the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program written in California's Code of Regulations Title 19.  CalARP includes some additional state requirements and is implemented at the local government level by the Certified Unified Program Agencies (CUPA's) which determine the level of detail in the RMPs, review RMPs, conduct facility inspections and provide public access to RMP information.  The San Bernardino County Fire Department (CUPA) is the implementing agency for the Airgas Etiwanda covered process.  Airgas' commitment to safety and environmental protection extends beyond its gates.  As part of the community, we have a responsibility to our customers and to those who live in the surrounding area.\n\n\n\nRegulated Che"

The Airgas Etiwanda, CA onsite inventory of hydrogen will be in excess of 10,000 pounds making the hydrogen transfill process and its connected equipment a PSM/RMP/CalARP covered process.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\n\n\nThe highly flammable and hazardous nature of hydrogen in the process makes it necessary for Airgas to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human and environmental exposure and to reduce the potential threat to personnel and nearby members of the community.  Airgas' policy is to comply with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  This Executive Summary sets forth some of the management systems in place to implement the accidental release and prevention program.  Airgas has also implemented specific chemical prevention steps to help prevent potential scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.  The following examples of the types of safety features in place:  (1) Release Mitigation - Emergency stop buttons to isolate hydrogen sources; personal protective equipment (personal gas detectors, protective outerwear clothing, intrinsically safe devices, safety goggles, shoes, etc.)  (2) System Integrity - Automatic control and manual valves that provides isolation for hydrogen process equipment, check valves on hydrogen loading lines and pressure safety valves for the process piping and vessels.  (3) Facility and Environment - Contracted emergency response specialist, Safety-Kleen, to support the Etiwanda plant emergency response plan.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation (EP)\n\nAirgas has developed a written plan of action and Etiwanda employee/operators are expected to participate in the accidental r"

Specific actions an employee can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in the Employee Participation plan.  Forms of participation include being part of a PHA, a PSSR, and/or being involved in incident investigation. Employees participate in monthly safety meetings where process safety issues are discussed and corrective actions are developed, and they are involved in the review of the covered process operating procedures annually to ensure they are current, accurate and recommend any necessary changes.\n\n \n\n \n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\n\nAirgas keeps a variety of technical documents onsite and in the company's electronic document control system that are used to help maintain safe operation of its processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, equipment design/configuration information, specific chemical inventories and operation limits for key process parameters - all key information for operating the process safely.  Process operators are trained to operate the process using process controls and instrumentation within these safe operating limits.\n\n \n\nThe Facility Manager is responsible for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily accessible as part of the written employee participation. \n\n \n\n \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nAirgas has a risk management program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  The covered process underwent an initial process hazard analysis (PHA) and will continue to undergo periodic review/re-validations at least every five years or as required by Management Of Change (MOC).

Facility Manager is responsible for prioritizing and tracking implementation of the action plan to closure.\n\n \n\n \n\nOperating Procedures (OP)\n\nAirgas maintains controlled written procedures that address various modes of liquefied and gaseous hydrogen process operations, such as: (1) initial startup; (2) normal operations; (3) emergency shutdown; (4) normal shutdown and; (5) startup after turnaround or emergency shutdown.   The hydrogen transfer operation will not operate under temporary or emergency operations.  If these conditions occur, plant operators and management will evaluate the circumstances and either shut the plant down or complete an MOC, including and emergency MOC.  Additionally, the emergency shutdown procedure includes conditions that will prompt a shutdown and identifies qualified and responsible operators to complete the steps in a safe and timely manner.\n\n \n\nAirgas operating procedures have safe operating limits identified along with consequences of unsafe deviation.  Procedures further provide steps for operators to take that will correct or avoid an unsafe deviation.  Airgas procedures are used by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.\n\n \n\n \n\nTraining (TRN)\n\nAirgas has implemented a training program for all employee/operators involved in the hydrogen covered process.

PSSR's are intended to ensure safety through confirmation that:  (1) construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications; (2) safety, operating, maintenance and emergency procedures are in place and adequate; (3) PHA's have been performed and recommendations resolved before startup of new plants or processes; (4) MOC requirements have been satisfied for modified facilities; and (5) training has been completed and documented for affected operator/employees.\n\n \n\n \n\nCompliance Audits (CA)\n\nTo help ensure the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Airgas conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accidental release prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  Resolutions to recommendations are documented, tracked and closed.  Once the resolutions have been completed, changes are communicated to operating, maintenance and other employees whose work assignments are in the covered process and who may be affected by the recommendations or actions.  Training and communication is documented.\n\n \n\nIncident Investigation (II)\n\nAirgas defines management systems and establishes the requirements for communicating, investigating and reporting of incidents at all facilities through the use of an Incident Investigation and reporting procedure.
