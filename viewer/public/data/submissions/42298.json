The Emergency Coordinator will designate a technical person to help identify injury-causing hazardous agents and provide any pertinent information on agent toxicity.\n\n6.  The Emergency Coordinator will have incoming emergency/medical assistance met and guided to the first-aid station or location of an on-site emergency.\n\n7.  Upon arrival of Emergency Medical Service, the control of casualty treatment and disposition will transfer to the medical service person in charge.  The Emergency Coordinator will place himself and the resources of the plant under the director of the medical service person in charge.\n\n8.  After the medical service determines where casualties will be taken, he will notify the appropriate hospital emergency room of the arrival of casualties, the nature of the injuries, and any information deemed necessary for that particular incident.\n\nThe following hospitals have been notified of potential hazards and will be given a copy of this emergency response program which is to be implemented in the event of an emergency:\n\n\nUniversity Hospital and "
