At Helmitin, the listed propellants used in the gas house operation fall under the RMP Program 3 Prevention Program, which is identical to the OSHA PSM program. EPA has said that if the process is in compliance with OSHA PSM, then it is compliance with RMP Program 3. Thus, PSM has been reviewed and determined to be complete for the RMP document. \n\nThis is a new process with initial training including both classroom and on the job.\n\n4.0\tFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidents.  This is the initial RPM for a new process. \n\n5.0\tEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nHelmitin plans to rely on the City of Olive Branch Fire Department until an emergency response plan has been developed.\n\n6.0\tPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nNo safety changes are planned.

This document consists of the executive summary and registration data elements (68.155 through 68.185).\n\n1.0\tRELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nHelmitin, Inc. (Helmitin) has flammable gases (Propane, Butane, and Dimethyl Ether) on site that requires protection as defined under the Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation (29 CFR 1926.64).  Helmitin has implemented a PSM program to provide information to employees to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling and processing of highly hazardous materials.  The program emphasizes the application of management controls and standard operating procedures when addressing the risks associated with handling or working near highly hazardous chemicals.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) summarizes the worst case scenarios for a release of these flammable gases, the management systems and monitoring systems in place to prevent such a release, and the training and employee participation in the PSM program.\n\nIn accordance with the 2004 amendment to the RMP regulations, the off-site consequence analyses (OCA) are not included in this executive summary.\n\n2.0\tPROCESS DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nA gas house operation charges propellants in adhesive aerosol products. The gas house operation includes the gas house, propellant storage tanks, and associated transfer equipment and piping.   The propellant is pumped from one of the three storage tanks to the filling station in the gas house.  The propellant feed rate is controlled by parameters setup in the PLC panel.  \n\nThe propellants stored in the three storage tanks are the RMP regulated substances propane, butane, and dimethyl ether.  One propellant is a mixture of propane and butane.  The other propellant is dimethyl ether.  \n\n3.0\tGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL - SPE"
