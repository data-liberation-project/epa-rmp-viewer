Our commitment to minimize off site impacts from our production process is demonstrated by our efforts for continuous improvement through design changes, operating procedure updates, preventative maintenance and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\nGN has a thorough emergency response plan in place which our employees and local responders are periodically trained to. Should a release occur that requires emergency response, the Utah County Emergency Coordinator and Orem Fire Department will work with GN to implement this plan and provide highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the incident.\n\n\n\nTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nGN's primary activities encompass Manufacturing of Nitric Acid and Ammonium Nitrate. There are 2 regulated substances present at this facility. These substances include Ammonia (anhydrous) and Nitric Oxide [Nitrogen oxide (NO)]. Ammonia (anhydrous) is used to manufacture both Nitric Acid (<80 percent) and Ammonium Nitrate. Nitric oxide is used to manufacture Nitric Acid (<80 percent).\n\n\n\nThough the quantity on hand is usually much lower, maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) is administratively limited to at our facility is 3600 tons while NO is present at our facility in a maximum quantity of 9 lbs.\n\n\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nGeneva Nitrogen, LLC continues to take all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under EPA and OSHA regulations. This facility was designed, constructed, and contin"

Process Safety Information\n\nGeneva Nitrogen LLC maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes. As technology develops and our process changes, any new information is reviewed and updated.\n\n\n\n2. Process Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is Hazardous and Operability Study (HAZOP). The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. The most recent PHA/update was performed on 08/13/2009 and we are currently in the process of conducting the next five year update.\n\n\n\n3. Operating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Geneva Nitrogen LLC maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\n4. Training\n\nGeneva Nitrogen LLC has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure the employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with the processes. Refresher training is provided at least every three (3) years and more frequently"

Mechanical Integrity\n\nGeneva Nitrogen LLC carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure the required operating parameters are maintained. Process equipment examined by these checks includes, among others: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Only highly trained and qualified personnel are allowed to perform these maintenance operations. Additionally, these personnel attend specialized training as needed to stay up to date with the current technology. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and efficient manner.\n\n\n\n6. Management of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Geneva Nitrogen LLC to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and trained to deal with the modification.\n\n\n\n7. Pre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-startup safety reviews (PSSR) related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as required at Geneva Nitrogen LLC. The PSSR is used to ensure that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\n8. Compliance Audits\n\nGeneva Nitrogen LLC is audited routinely be many agencies including Utah OSHA, Utah Division of Air Quality, Utah Division of Water Quality, City of Orem Department of Public Works, and the EPA. These audits are supplemented by regular reviews of operating records and reports to ensure we continually operate in a safe and environmentally conscious manner. The most recent compliance audit was conducted on 04/17/2014 by the Utah Division of Air Quality. Though there were no significant findings during this audit, any findings or recommendations from regulat"

Accident Investigation\n\nIn an effort to ensure an atmosphere of continuous improvement, Geneva Nitrogen LLC promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in an injury or catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n\n\n10. Employee Participation\n\nGeneva Nitrogen LLC truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. Employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\n\n\n11. Contractors\n\nOn occasions, Geneva Nitrogen LLC hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities. Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the contractor's safety performance is carried out. Geneva Nitrogen LLC has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to their work and the processes that could affect them. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nGeneva Nitrogen LLC has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years. Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has only been one occurrence of a release which was attributed to equipment failure. This release resulted in only minor property damage and there was no danger to the public or our employees. A lot was learned from this incident which directly resulted in modification to the "

The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification to and the involvement of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced. The plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response. In addition, we conduct periodic emergency response drills to keep our employees and local responders familiar with the plan.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program. Installation of Ammonia detection sensors as well as an Ammonia Chiller System has improved the safety at our facility. In an effort to improve efficiency and reduce overall risk, installation of an Ammonia generation plant is being considered. If installed, this plant would drastically reduce the amount of Ammonia stored at our facility as well as reduce the amount of ammonia being transported through our community. We are constantly working to improve our Environmental Health and Safety performance.\n\n"
