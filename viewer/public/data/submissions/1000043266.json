Introduction\n\n\n\nThis Executive Summary briefly reviews the major elements of the Risk Management Plan of Cottage Grove - 3M Company.  We take seriously our safety, health and environmental responsibilities to our employees and to the community.  As an operating unit of 3M Company, we share in a tradition of environmental, health and safety responsibility going back through much of the company's history.  3M Company was an early pioneer in pollution prevention and created its environmental policy in 1975.  Since 1990, 3M Company has cut its worldwide volatile organic air emissions and releases to water. \n\n\n\n\n\n2.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nIt is our goal to prevent accidental releases of regulated and other materials through the proper design, installation, operation and maintenance of our manufacturing processes and the proper training of our employees.  If, despite our efforts, such a release should occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control the effects of the release until the Cottage Grove Fire Department arrives. We maintain an excellent working relationship with the emergency responders to ensure rapid and effective response. \n\n \n\n\n\n3.  The Stationary Source and The Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nWe manufacture specialty chemicals for internal and external customers for use in making a wide variety of products from sandpaper to medical imaging materials.  We use a regulated substance at our facility in quantities regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program.  3M employees are trained and experienced in working with these substances and we contribute to safety by providing high quality manufacturing processes, equipment and maintenance. \n\n\n\nThe following regulated substance is used at Cottage Grove - 3M Company:\n\n\n\n? Hydrogen fluoride/hydrofluoric acid, a non-flammable, corrosive acid, is a key raw material used to make such products as replacements"
