The process for producing polyurethane foam requires the use of Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI).  TDI is listed in the Clean Air Act 112 (r) list of regulated substances.  Consequently, FXI Foamex Innovations  is subject to EPAs Risk Management Program Rule (RMPR).  The same properties that give TDI commercial value are the characteristics that make it a hazardous material.  Prior to RMPR, FXI Foamex Innovations recognized the chemical and physical hazards involved with TDI and has observed safety precautions in its handling.  These precautions have been implemented to help limit exposure to the public, environment and our employees.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  \n\nWe are committed to the safety of our employees, the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Effective implementation and monitoring of our accidental release prevention program helps us facilitate our Management System in the interest of reducing the possibility of accidental releases and proper mitigation in the event of an accidental release.\n\nDescription of the facility and the regulated substances handled\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to produce flexible polyurethane foam, which is sold to other facilities, the automotive industry and the furniture bedding industry.  TDI is one of the reactants required to produce polyurethane foam.  TDI is received primarily by rail car and is stored in indoor storage tanks.  The maximum quantity of TDI stored in rail cars and in storage tanks at our plant is about 800,000 pounds.  The TDI is piped to a mix head where it is mixed with other reactants to produce a slab of polyurethane foam.  The foam is conveyed to cutting"

TDI is a regulated substance because it is listed on CAA 112 (r) and our process involves a quantity that exceeds the threshold quantity (TQ) of 10,000 pounds. \n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps\n\nThe plant has implemented programs and procedures that comply with EPAs   Accidental Release Prevention (Program 2).  Our facility is not eligible for Program 1 because our worst-case release scenario for TDI indicates a potential to impact public receptors within our toxic endpoint distance; however, FXI Foamex Innovations Santa Teresa is not subject to OSHAs Process Safety Management Standard in that TDI is not listed on OSHAs list of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.  Consequently, our covered process is not subject to Program 3, therefore we are subject to Program 2.  Our accidental release program is designed to systematically accomplish the following function:\n\n1    Control the creation and retention of safety information regarding the regulated substances, process and equipment\n2    Conduct hazard reviews to identify, evaluate, and control process hazards associated with the regulated substances, processes, and procedures\n3    Create, maintain, and evaluate operating procedures for activities within or near processes that use regulated substances\n4    Provide training for personnel who operate covered processes so that they safely perform their jobs\n5    Monitor and control maintenance activities that can affect the mechanical integrity of equipment used in covered processes\n6    Confirm through compliance audits that RMP practices at the plant are consistent with our written programs and that the programs are adequate to address all of the requirements of the RMP rule\n7    Ensure that process incidents, particularly those of catastrophic magnitude or potential, are thoroughly investigated u"

The prevention program outlined above is applied to the TDI process.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accidental releases that could be caused by equipment failures, human errors, and by management system failures.\n\nIn addition to the accidental release prevention program, our plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain or control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of or mitigate a release.  The following types of safety features are used in various units of the TDI process:\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n1    TDI storage tanks located inside an enclosed building\n2    Automated shutdown systems for critical process parameters (e.g., high-pressure) high level alarms have been addressed and proposed in the process hazard analysis\n3    Pressure/vacuum relief devices on vessels to prevent rupture or collapse\n4    Seal less pumps \n5    Double Sealed TDI receiving and transfer pumps \n6    Valves to permit isolation of the process\n7    TDI railcar inner tank is surrounded by an outer shell filled with insulation and a steam jacket\n8    TDI railcars are top unloaded through a nozzle in the top of the tank\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n1    Fire suppression and extinguishing systems\n2    Trained emergency response personnel\n3    Personal protective equipment (e.g., protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus, breathing air stations)\n\n\nFive-year accident history\n\nWe have not had a release of TDI in the last 5 years that resulted in deaths or significant property damage on site, or known deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damages, or environmental damage off site.

We estimated there were less than 2 gallons of TDI released.  \n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nOur emergency response program is based on the requirements in OSHAs emergency action and fire prevention plan regulation, OSHAs hazardous waste and Emergency Response Program operations regulation, the EPAs emergency response program requirements in its RMP rule.  Our program consists of procedures for responding to a release of TDI.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection and testing of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary, based on modifications made to plant processes or other facilities.  Personnel affected by changes in the program are informed and trained on those changes.  \n\nThe overall emergency response program for the plant is coordinated with the LEPC.  This coordination includes participation in periodic meeting of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and other industry representatives.  The plant has around-the-clock communications capability with the appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations such as the fire department.

The following changes are currently planned for implementation:\n\n1    Upgrade inspections and tests of selected equipment and instrumentation designed to prevent TDI releases\n2    Revise operating procedures to resolve findings from the latest TDI process hazard review.\n\n"
