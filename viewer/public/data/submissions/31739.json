These containers are stored and used on a chlorine dock located just east of the main office building at the facility.  The maximum intended inventory of chlorine is 6,000 lbs in one-ton and 150 pound cylinders.\n\nTo facilitate the chlorination process, two (2) one-ton cylinders are simultaneously connected to a split manifold.  Only one (1) container is active at any given time.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program:  The facility has an aggressive accidental release program that is based upon a foundation of employee awareness and proactive system maintenance.\n\nFive Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases at the Facility in the last five (5) years prior to the date of this Plan.\n\nEmergency Response Program:  The facility has en Emergency Response Plan that defines the sequence of actions taken by facility employees in the event of an accidental release of chlorine.  This plan has been communicated to the South Walton Fire District.  It is the policy of SWU that its personnel are trained to the First Responder Awareness Level.  These are individuals who are likely to wi"
