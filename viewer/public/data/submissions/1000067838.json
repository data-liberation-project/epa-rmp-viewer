Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR ?5189\n\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR ?1910.119\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, RCS / Packing and Cooling has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1 RCS / Packing and Cooling, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that RCS / Packing and Cooling has updated their unified RMP-PSM Program.

From the accumulators, low pressure liquid is circulated through evaporator coils. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature and pressure gas which is returned to the accumulator vessels. The suction gas is returned from the accumulators through a suction return line to the main suction accumulator.  From the main suction accumulator, ammonia is piped to the suction inlet on the compressors. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water-cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquefied and returned to the thermosyphon vessel and then to the high pressure receiver.\n\n\n\nThe system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and pressure relief valves which vent to the atmosphere if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point. \n\n\n\nThere is an ammonia detector installed inside the refrigeration machinery room. The sensor is set at the California OSHA permissible exposure limit of 25 ppm, which will activate an audible alarm and initiate an auto-dialer. Also, a sampling "

During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nRCS / Packing and Cooling has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release.

The ammonia process contains a total charge of approximately 47,000 lbs. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personn"

Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \n\n\n\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\n\n\n\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nRCS / Packing and Cooling has implemented many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, RCS / Packing and Cooling continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety. By utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved RCS / Packing and Cooling's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that RCS / Packing and Cooling's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\n\n\nRCS / Packing and Cooling has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program.

For the future, RCS / Packing and Cooling now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for RCS / Packing and Cooling employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program RCS / Packing and Cooling will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety.\n\n"
