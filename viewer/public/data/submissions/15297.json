The Risk Management Program identifies the equipment, procedures, maintenance, inspection, and training associated with Regulated Substances (RSs) handled at this facility in excess of Federal threshold quantities; describes the structured assessment of hazards which was conducted to assess possible effects on employees and offsite public and environmental receptors; provides the results of an offsite consequences analysis, defines a prevention program, emergency response program,  and mitigation measures to reduce the probability and magnitude of accidental releases of RSs, and establishes a schedule and responsibilities for implementation of mitigation measures and auditing of program elements.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) is being filed as required by ARP regulations inorder to report the elements of the current Risk Management Program and to describe further measures planned to mitigate or prevent accidental releases of RSs.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe SCA has contract operator for the SCA Cogen II facilityt, located at 5000 83rd Street, Sacramento, CA in Sacramento County, owned by Sacramento Cogeneration Authority.  Aqueous ammonia (25% solution) is used for selective catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides in the gas turbine exhaust.  This RS is handled in quantities greater than its Federal threshold quantity.  The facility is located in an industrial area in south Sacramento with few residences nearby.  There are 16 full-time employees at the site.  Aqueous ammonia (29% solution) is received in bulk by truck into an enclosed steel storage tank.  The aqueous ammonia solution is pumped from the storage tank at a metered rate into the flowing turbine exhaust gas at the location of a catalyst within the exhaust duct, a"

In order to accomplish this goal, the SCA Cogen II plant has gathered safety information on aqueous ammonia (29% solution) and  on the process, equipment and procedures involving aqueous ammonia (29% solution), performed a structured assessment of hazards of the process and external events which might affect the process, performed an offsite consequences analysis of defined release scenarios, established a written program for prevention and mitigation of releases; and established a written emergency response program coordinated with emergency response agencies.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario\n\nA single \"worst case\" release scenario is required to be considered for each stationary source, resulting in the maximum distance to an endpoint for all toxic RSs contained on site above the threshold quantity.  The worst case release scenario for toxic chemicals is defined in the ARP regulations as the release of the contents of the largest single container of RS (in this case aqueous ammonia (29% solution)) over a period of 10 minutes.  The scenario considered the release of the contents of the largest container of aqueous ammonia (29% solution) on site, in this case the contents of the 10,000-gallon storage tank containing 18,750 lb. of ammonia.\n\nAlternative Case Release Scenario\n\nAn \"alternative case\" release scenario is required to be considered for each toxic RS handled in quantities grea"

The \"alternative case\" considered for this facility is the release of aqueous ammonia (25% solution) from process piping due to component failure, with the release secured by operators after 5 minutes.\n\nAdministrative Controls\n\nAdministrative controls in effect at the SCA Cogen II plant which were considered to mitigate the severity of the Worst Case and Alternative Case release scenarios include the SCAs written policies and procedures for training of operators and maintenance personnel, written procedures for control of the inventory of aqueous ammonia (25% solution) at the facility, and policies regarding quality level of replacement materials and components for the aqueous ammonia (25% solution) system.\n\nMitigation Measures\n\nPassive mitigation in the form of a concrete secondary containment structure surrounding the storage tank was considered to limit the severity of the Worst Case scenario.  The same passive mitigation measure was considered to limit the severity of the Alternative Case scenario.  Active mitigation was considered for the Alternative Case, in the form of response of trained operators in a timely manner to close the valve on the suction side of the transfer pump.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Programs\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention programs instituted by the SCA Cogen II plant are categorized as administrative (management) programs, procedures, training, and engineering controls, and emergency response programs.\n\nThe SCA Cogen II plant maintains policies and procedures conforming to recognized industry standards covering the operation and maintenance of its sele"

This constitutes the general accidental release prevention program for the SCAs operations at the SCA Cogen II Plant.  The program and document management procedures included in the PSM Program will be used as the management system for the Risk Management Program.\n\nChemical-Specific Release Prevention Steps\n\nRelease prevention steps specific to aqueous ammonia (29% solution) have been identified and implemented.  These include, among other things, creation of numerous facility-specific operation procedures with check boxes for completion of critical steps.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidents involving aqueous ammonia (29% solution) at this facility within the past five years resulting in injuries or offsite consequences.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe SCAs Emergency Response Program applicable to aqueous ammonia (29% solution) has been coordinated with Sacramento County Environmental Management Department, Hazardous Materials Division, the local agency responsible for hazardous materials inventory reporting and release response coordination.  It consists of notification of the public agency assigned responsibility for First Response to hazardous materials release emergencies.  First Responders have participated with the SCA personnel in response drills.\n\nPlanned Changes to improve Safety\n\nAll of the improvements and mitigation measures identified in the process hazard analysis which the SCA committed to accomplish have been completed or are in progress.  Any other measures identified by employees during workplace hazard surveys, or as a result of audit activities, will be thoroughly reviewed and considered for implementation."
