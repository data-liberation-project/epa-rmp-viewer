Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nZeon Chemicals L.P. is committed to the safety and health protection of our employees, our customers, our neighbors, and others that may be affected by our products or activities.  \n\nThrough participation by all employees, we will provide a safe work place at our sites, in addition to designing and operating our facilities for minimum adverse impact on public health and the environment.\n\nWe will produce and sell only products that can be manufactured, used and disposed of safely.  We will promptly communicate to affected persons the known hazards of our products and activities, and the methods necessary for safe handling and health protection.\n\nThe foundation of our Health & Safety Program is full compliance with all accepted standards, applicable laws, regulations, and corporate policy.  It is the responsibility of all employees to assure that their actions are consistent with the policy at all times.\n\n2.   The stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\nZeon Chemicals, Kentucky Plant performs emulsion polymerization on a commercial scale.  The major steps in the process include polymerization into a latex emulsion, recovery of unreacted monomer, coagulation of the latex into a wet crumb, and then drying into a final product.  In practice, latex is usually accumulated after recovery in storage tanks where it is sampled and tested before \"finishing\" to a dry product.  As a result, a description of the manufacturing of nitrile rubber can be conveniently divided into two areas: Polymerization and Finishing.\n\nIn a batch process, raw materials are charged independently to each reactor, and the polymerization proceeds to the desired end point in each reactor where it is either stopped or the contents of the reactor transferred to a \"blowdown\" tank and stopped.  The process of polymerization is closely monitored to follow the conversion of monomer to polymer.  The conversion i"

      "SummaryText": "s important for two reasons: Some recipes call for additions of ingredients at specific points during polymerization, and all recipes have specific final conversion target at which time polymerizations must be stopped so that the desired product properties are achieved.  Conversion is determined by a total solids method in which the difference in weight before and after drying of a latex sample (to remove water and volatiles) allows the conversion of monomer into polymer to be calculated form the data contained in the recipe. \n\nAfter manufacturing a polymer in latex form and recovery of the unreacted monomer, it is collected in large tanks for further processing to a dry rubber form.  The standard finishing process involves addition of a stabilizer to the latex, coagulation of the latex to form a slurry of rubber crumb in water, washing of the wet material, and de-watering and drying to a finished product. \n\nOnce the latex is coagulated, the resultant slurry is process across a dewatering screen and sent to a washing tank or tanks.  The purpose is to remove water-soluble solids by the addition of fresh water.  Whether this is carried out in one tank or in two steps in series, water is usually recycled, and screens are utilized for separating the wet rubber crumb from the free water.  It is common for the pH in the wash tank(s) to be controlled using sulfuric acid or sodium hydroxide.  The tanks are diked to minimize unusual discharges to the environment.\n\nThe final operation in the washing process is to mechanically dewater the crumb.  These are commonly extruder presses in which the screw forces the wet material through a restriction, and which have a slotted barrel to allow free water to drain away.\n\nAfter dewatering the crumb is fed to the drying process, which is usually accomplished in a continuous tunnel dryer.  The crumb is spread on a perforated stainless steel bed, through which hot air passes to evaporate the remaining water.\n\nThe regulated substances hand"

The release is uncontained and by definition none of our safety systems mitigate the release.  The substance will travel off-site before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the community.

Corrective action plans are developed and implemented as part of the analyses and updated a minimum of every five years.\n\n3) Operating Procedures - Operating procedures have been developed for all processes to insure safe operation.  Those involved with the manufacturing process are included in the development, training and periodic review of these procedures.  Our processes are ISO - 9002 certified and subject to internal audits as well as external auditing every six months.   \n\n4) Employee Training - Training programs have been developed and implemented to ensure all affected employees understand the hazards of the chemicals used and the required safe handling procedures.  The Plant has established an Operator Certification Program to train, test, and qualify employees involved in operating the chemical processes.  All new employees complete the certification program and all affected employees are re-certified a minimum of every three years.\n  \n5) Mechanical Integrity - This program was established to insure the integrity of process equipment.

All contract personnel must complete a Zeon Chemicals training class prior to entering the facility.  Training must be repeated annually.\n\n10) Incident Investigation - Any reportable incidents or near misses involving the release of hazardous material are investigated by a team of skilled plant personnel.  These investigations identify corrective actions, evaluate our management systems and are documented and communicated through a narrative report.  These reports are circulated to all Zeon Chemical sites.  The corrective actions are tracked by Plant Health and Safety Committee for timely completion.\n\n11) Compliance Audits - Audits of our Process Safety Management System are conducted once every three years.  These audits consist of review of documentation, verification of process safety information and inspection of the physical facilities.\n\n5.    Five-year Accident History\n\nThe RMP rule requires each company to include a description of all accidental releases resulting in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.

Planned changes to improve safety\n\nOur safety program is integrated into all facets of plant operation and involves the identification and implementation by numerous means to improve safety performance.  Safety performance is measured in terms of OSHA recordable incidents and is the criteria by which the plant is evaluated by senior management.  It is a basic premise of our safety activities that we can only be successful through employee involvement.
