Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\nHuntsman Peru is committed to providing a safe, healthy, and environmentally conscious work-place for its employees and neighbors.  The Huntsman Peru facility maintains a working PSM program, which implements a series of steps to prevent potential hazards associated with the process and assures a well-trained work force.  The PSM program further implements its policies with onsite procedures and manuals.  Huntsman Peru coordinates all fo the emergency response activities with the La Salle County LEPC, City of Peru Fire Department, and City of La Salle Fire Department.  Huntsman assists local officials in the development of emergency procedures to identify resources, chemicals, contacts, and material safety data sheets for participating companies.  Other community activities include cooperative training between the Peru facility and the Illinois Valley Community Hospital (IVCH).  Since its certification in November 1993, the Peru Site has been an active participant in the International Standards Organization (ISO) 9002 quality management program.\n\n2. Regulated Substances.\n\nThe Peru site manufactures polystyrene-based products consisting of two main process areas where expandable polystyrene (EPS) and performance resins (PR) are produced and a tank farm where the regulated substance is stored.  The polymers and resins are produced in batch processes.  Huntsman's Peru Site has 1 regulated substance, pentane (flammable liquid), at the facility.  The pentane is impregnated inside the polystyrene to expand the beads.  The maximum inventories of the regulated substance is summarized below:\niso-pentane - Used as a blowing agent in the production of expandable polystyrene (EPS)\nn-pentane - Used as a blowing agent in the production of expandable polystyrene (EPS)\n\n3.

This OCA includes the development of worst and alternative release scenarios for the release of flammable substances.  The OCA allows for the consideration of administrative controls in estimating potential scenario impacts.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario\nThe worst case scenario is based on EPA required assumptions, is highly unlikely, and has never occurred at this facility.\n\nThe flammable worst case scenario for Huntsman's Peru facility involves the instantaneous failure of the three pentane storage tanks located on the south side of the site.  100% of the pentane inside the tanks are assumed to form a vapor cloud within the upper and lower flammability limits, and the cloud is assumed to detonate.  As a conservative assumption, 10 percent of the flammable vapor in the cloud is assumed to participate in the explosion.  This scenario results in off-site impacts to residences, public recreational areas and industrial areas.  There were no administrative controls or passive mitigation considered for this scenario.\n\nAlternative Case Release Scenarios\n\nThe first flammable alternative release scenario involves a leak from the pentane railcar.  All fo the pentane inside of the railcar is released onto the ground surface forming a pool, which is assumed to ignite.  The consequence distance endpoint is a radiant heat level capable of causing second degree burns from a 40-second explosion.  There were no administrative controls or passive mitigation considered for this scenario.  This scenario results in offsite impacts to residences, public areas and industrial areas.\n\nThe second flammable alternative release scenario (included in RMP*Submit) involves a leak from the pentane railcar.  100% of the pentane inside the railcar is assumed to form a vapor cloud withing the upper and lower flammability l"
