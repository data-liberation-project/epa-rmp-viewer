      "SummaryText": "     The MOT Water Farm provides treatment and land application for approximately 0.5 million gallons of water a day.  The plant has a Risk Management Program 2 process, storing a maximum of 4,000 lbs. of chlorine for wastewater treatment.\n     The worst case release scenario for the plant is the release of an entire ton tank of chlorine into open air.  The toxic endpoint is approximately 1.3 miles downwind of the plant.\nThe alternate release scenario includes the puncturing of the storage vessel, releasing chlorine gas into the open air, with a response time of 60 minutes.  The toxic endpoint of the release is approximately 0.2 mile downwind of the plant.  Mitigation measures include chlorine detection alarms, manual shutoffs, relief valves, and emergency training procedures for plant personnel.  Plant equipment is checked on a monthly basis and maintenance procedures are reviewed yearly.\n     In the event of a chlorine leak, the chlorine alarm system will be activated and the operator in charge will verify the alarm.  If there is a leak, the operator in charge will assess the severity, and if needed, alert the County dispatch office, 911, DNREC, and the National Response Center.  All visitors and employees will be evacuated to a safe distance from the plant, where the operator in charge will account for everyone.  The operator in charge will remain at the scene to assist the emergency responders as needed.\n     There have been no accidental releases in the plant for the past 5 years."
