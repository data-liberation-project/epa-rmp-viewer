This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility's processes.  It is the practice of Kiva Energy, LP Terminal LLC to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY (19 CCR 2745.3)\n\n\n\nES - 1.0    FACILITY ACCIDENTAL RELEASE POLICY\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Kiva Energy - LP Terminal, LLC Rocklin (Rocklin Terminal) located at 1545 Nichols Drive, Rocklin, California in Placer County, are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of odorized, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG, propane). If an accidental release should occur, the facility staff are prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. A detailed Consolidated Emergency Response/Contingency Plan (CCP) has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n\n\nES - 2.0    FACILITY INFORMATION\n\nThe Facility is a bulk, hydrocarbon storage and handling facility that receives LPG by rail cars and trucks. The liquefied petroleum gas is stored in the facility's 18 aboveground, pressurized storage tanks prior to being loaded into DOT approved delivery trucks (including those owned by Kiva Energy as well as third-party distributors). The 18 tanks are interconnected into three groups of six vessels (PVI.001-PVI.006, PVI.007-PVI.012, and PVI.013-PVI.018). Each group of six bullets is operated as if it were a"

The detailed results of the evaluation are provided in the Risk Management Plan (RMP). Administrative controls limit the tank fill capacity to in accordance with NFPA 58 7.4.3.2(B).\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario. The worst-case release scenario is the release of propane from a bank of six (6) storage bullets when filled to the greatest amount . The scenario assumes a complete release of 645,660 pounds of propane gas. The pressure wave (with an endpoint of 1 pound per square inch gauge over atmospheric pressure) would extend 0.7 miles (1.12 kilometers). The pressure wave could reach the residential neighborhood located to the southwest of the site as well as the Placer County government center located to the east of the site. There are no sensitive receptors within this blast zone.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario. The alternative release scenario based on the hazard review (or a more plausible potential incident) is a catastrophic release from a full-sized (10,000 gallon water capacity), tanker truck. This scenario assumes that the tanker leaks from the bottom mounted entry valve and that the entire contents of the truck are released to the atmosphere. The alternative release scenario would produce a pressure wave with an endpoint of 1 pound per square inch gauge over atmospheric pressure that would extend 0.3 miles (0.48 kilometers). The resulting pressure wave has the potential to impact nearby businesses within this blast radius.
