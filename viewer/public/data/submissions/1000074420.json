This Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the Butane Blending process including one 60,000 gallon butane storage vessel and associated piping and transfer equipment.\n\nThe Butane Blending process was designed and constructed in accordance with National Fire Protection Association Code No. 58 (NFPA 58) - Liquefied Petroleum Gas Code, the primary Recognized and Generally Accepted Good Engineering Practice (RAGAGEP) for Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) processes. Kinder Morgan operates and maintains the Butane Blending process in accordance with RAGAGEP and manufacturer's recommendations. In addition, Kinder Morgan complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Accident Prevention Rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and associated 14 elements (29 CFR Part 1910.119), and all applicable state and local laws and regulations.\n\nThe Butane Blending process includes a variety of engineered and operational safety controls to minimize the potential for a release of butane. These controls are implemented in accordance with the appropriate design codes and meet or exceed RAGAGEP. Process safety controls include excess flow valves, emergency shutoff valves with local and remote actuation, and ESD system that stops butane flow from anywhere in the facility, vessel level monitoring that prevents potential overfilling (85% fill limit), hydrostatic/thermal relief valves where liquid could potentially be isolated, grounding interlock devices, video display, among others.\n\nKinder Morgan has developed a written emergency response program and coordinates response activities with the local responders annually at minimum. If an emergency involving the butane process were to occur, it is Kinder Morgan's policy to notify the Roano"

Additionally, the Roanoke Fire-EMS is contacted regarding participation in site emergency response drills. Additional actions include consolidating separate system inspection checklists for ease of completion."
