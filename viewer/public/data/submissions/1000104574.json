One example of a major safety initiative is described below.\n\nA recommendation from the 2020 Honeywell Corporate Process Safety Management Audit was to install an early warning/detection of a release system throughout the facility. The site installed point-source LEL monitors and Chloroform monitors in applicable processing areas with local audible and visual alarms. These alarms are also tied into a new PLC system with displays in the main Production offices."

The Plan provides for both internal site and external community emergency alerting and notification processes with multiple means of communication. The Plan also addresses emergency medical care, sheltering in place, evacuation, emergency responsibilities, response and control procedures, and emergency equipment.

This policy includes the following elements: a) established process safety management system for oversight and control of the chloroform and ethyl ether processes; b) development and implementation of accurate procedures for safe operation and maintenance of the process; c) an on-going mechanical integrity program that ensures critical process equipment is designed, constructed and installed in accordance to codes and standards and is also inspected, tested and proactively maintained; d) performance of process hazards analyses with resolution of recommendations and revalidating for inherently safer processes/technologies; e) use of safety shutdown, relief and vent systems, interlocks, dikes, and other secondary containment installations, control instrumentation and process monitoring for early warning and detection; f) implementation of procedures designed to review and manage changes to the process; g) performance of incident investigations, process safety compliance audits, and pre-startup safety"
