In compliance with applicable Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP requirements, the Abitec Risk Management Program document, which is summarized by this plan, describes the following components of a RMP: \n\n- A hazard assessment program that identifies and analyzes the potential onsite and off-site impacts of worst-case scenarios of regulated substances, and includes documenetation of five-year accident histories involving regulated substances.\n\n- A prevention program that covers operating procedures, maintenance, training, management of change, process safety information, and other similar information involving regulated substances.\n\n- A contigency plan and a trained first responder team to mitigate any accidental releases that occur.\n\n- An overall system to manage the development and implementation of a risk management system.\n\n- Abitec is covered by Process Safety Management (PSM).\n\n- Active mitigation measures have been installed in the form of sprinkler and deluge systems for fire prevention.\n\nThe plan is submitted in accordance with applicable regulations for the on-site regulated process covered by RMP regulations.\n\nThe Abitec facility processes hydrogenated vegetable oils into flake and bead form for use in the baking, food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries.\n\nThe process could result in a catastrophic release and could impact public receptors.  Therefore, the subject facility is regulated by Program 3 requirements.\nAbitec's Emergency Response Program was developed in compliance with RMP regulatory requirements cited in 40 CFR 68.90(b)(1) and (3).\n\nThere have been no reportable accidents involving this process within the past 5-years.\n\nThe Abitec Emergency Response Program limits employees to actions to end small leaks or releases (e.g. shutting a valve), mitigating a release that does not"
