The regulated substance is anhydrous ammonia with a total inventory charge over the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs. Since the facility is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's PSM Standard 29 CFR 1910.119, Program 3 is required.\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICY\nThe top priority of Nestle Health Science (NHS) is to provide a healthy and safe work environment for its employees and the surrounding community. In this effort, Nestle Health Science (NHS) has developed strict policies and procedures to reduce the risk of an accidental hazardous chemical release. The Process Safety Management (PSM) program acts as a gatekeeper of these policies and procedures. The requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) PSM Standard CFR 1910.119 mirrors that of Risk Management Prevention Program 3 and therefore has been integrated. Of the 14 PSM elements, 13 focus on accidental release prevention and one on emergency planning and response. It is the commitment of management and employees to follow the established procedures and seek new ways for improvement.\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\nIn the event of an emergency and depending on the type and magnitude of the emergency, Nestle Health Science (NHS) will evacuate or shelter in place its employees and call the Savannah Fire Department to respond to the emergency.\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nNestle Health Science (NHS) is a food and beverage / dairy processing facility located in Savannah, Georgia. The process cools glycol for use in the plant and comfort cooling that utilize anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant. Anhydrous ammonia is a regulated substance under the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, 40 CFR 68.\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nEPA's Ri"

The facility has its own emergency action plan. The emergency action plan includes procedures for informing the public and local response agencies of a chemical release. The emergency action plan also includes information on emergency health care. Nestle Health Science (NHS) does not respond to emergencies. Nestle Health Science (NHS) coordinates its Emergency Action Plan with the Savannah Fire Department.\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nNestle Health Science (NHS) has recently performed a Process Hazard Analysis and IIAR 9 Gap Analysis. Areas for improvement during the process hazard analysis and the IIAR 9 Gap Analysis were identified and corrective actions recommended.  All recommendations are promptly addressed."
