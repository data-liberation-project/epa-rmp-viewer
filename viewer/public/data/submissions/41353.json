The release would be estimated at 5 minutes and would have a toxic end point of 0.9 miles to the West and 2.2 miles to the East over the Chesapeake Bay.\n\nThe alternative scenario would be a cylinder containing one ton of chlorine compressed gas.  The release would be in an enclosed room with a toxic endpoint of 0.9 miles to the West and 2.2 miles to the East over the Chesapeake Bay.\n\nThe City of Havre de Grace complies with the OSHA Process Safety Management Rule and keeps on line inventory of chlorine gas below 2500 pounds. Storage is kept to three separate one ton cylinders.  The feed systems are vacuum regulated and any failure in the system shuts down with passive mitigation.  It takes a vacuum to feed the chlorine, without the vacuum the system shuts down.\n\nThe City of Havre de Grace has had no accidental release of chlorine in the past five years.\n\nThe Havre de Grace Wastewater Plant has an emergency response plan coordinated with the Harford County Local Emergency Planning Committee, which the Cit"
