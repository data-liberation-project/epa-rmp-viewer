The alternative-case release scenario represents an accidental release that is more reasonable than the worst-case but is still highly unlikely to occur.  Based on our analysis using USEPA-approved methods, the alternative case release scenario for butane could possibly impact offsite public receptors.  In the alternative-case analysis, a restricted volume was considered as an administrative control and an excess flow valve was considered as an active mitigation measure. \r\n\r\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\r\n\r\nThis facility is operated in strict accordance with the USEPA prevention program requirements.  A written management system is in place with operating and maintenance procedures for the covered process.
