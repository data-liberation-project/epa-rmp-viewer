Some of our employees are members of the Local Emergency Planning Committees, area volunteer fire departments, and local emergency response units.  Our facility has written emergency preparedness plans that are updated regularly.  \n\n\n\nOur facility typically hosts open houses as an opportunity for neighbors to learn about our commitment to safety.  Ashland Performance Materials makes every effort to support our communities through sponsorship of local activites and participation in local organizations. \n\n\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substanses handled:\n\n\n\nThis facility produces maleic anhydride by the oxidiation of butane and air in the presense of a catalyst.  Butane is the single regulated substance handled above the regulatory threshold quantity.  The facility receives truck deliveries of butane into three (3) storage tanks.  Butane is also supplied on supplemental basis via pipeline from Marathon Petroleum's Catlettsburg, KY Refinery.\n\n\n\nFor more information contact the Plant Manager.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario:\n\n\n\nThe USEPA RMP regulations require the worst-case release scenario to assume that the entire contents of the largest vessel are released.  This event is highly unlikely and has never occurred at our facility.  The USEPA also requires the worst case scenario for butane to "

Based on our analysis using USEPA approved methods, the worst-case release scenario for butane could potentially affect offsite receptors.  In the worst case analysis, a restricted volume was considered as an administrative control.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario:\n\n\n\nThe USPEA RMP regulations require an analysis of the alternative-case release scenario.   The alternative-case release scenario represents an accidental release that is more reasonable than the worst-case but is still highly unlikely to occur.  Based on our analysis using USEPA-approved methods, the alternative case release scenario for butane could possibly impact offsite public receptors.  In the alternative-case analysis, a restricted volume was considered as an administrative control and an excess flow valve was considered as an active mitigation measure. \n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n\n\nThis facility is operated in strict accordance with the USEPA prevention program requirements.  A written management system is in place with operating and maintenance procedures for the covered process.  These procedures ensure rigorous training for operations employees, numerous management checks and balances and strict attention to changes in the operations; with a through review and examination of potential incidents that could lead to an accidental release.  Ashland Performance Materials maintains an 24 hour emergency reporting system that can speedily coordinate emergency responders with top management and quickly communicate key first aid or medical information to local health care providers.
