      "SummaryText": "Introduction\nThe purpose of this Executive Summary is to provide the public with information about the Ross Incineration Services, Inc., (\"RIS\") Risk Management Plan (\"RMP\"). RIS is a commercial hazardous waste treatment and storage facility that processes substances covered by the accidental release prevention regulations under section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act. All facilities covered by these regulations must develop and implement programs that prevent accidental releases of regulated substances and reduce the severity of releases that may occur. These risk management programs must be described in an RMP. The RMP must include a hazard assessment, a prevention program and an emergency response program. RIS' RMP was originally submitted to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency by June 21, 1999. The regulations require sources to update and resubmit RMPs at least every five years or sooner if any changes occur. RIS has developed its risk management programs and routinely updated its RMP to comply with regulation.\n\nIt is RIS' policy to provide its associates with a safe work environment and its neighbors with a safe environment in which to live. RIS is also committed to providing its associates with safe equipment and is committed to complying with State and Federal regulations regarding working conditions and accident prevention. The personal health and safety of RIS associates and neighbors is of primary importance. To this end, RIS maintains safety and health programs that employ an aggressive approach toward injury and illness prevention focusing on a safe work environment. RIS operates within guidelines set by its Statement of Environmental, Health and Safety Policy, which follows. \n-\tOur business success and our commitment to protection of human health and the environment are consistent and complementary goals. \n-\tWe demonstrate leadership in protection of human health and the environment in our workplace, marketplace and the community. \n-\tWe comply with al"

These regulations require RIS to operate under strict specifications, which protect RIS' people, the environment, and the community. Under the RCRA regulations, RIS has applied for and been granted a RCRA Part B permit. The purpose of the RCRA regulations (and the Part B permit) is to assure that RIS operates its processes in a manner that protects human health and environment. The RIS facility operation was designed to prevent accidental releases as well as mitigate potential releases. Daily inspections are conducted for the operational processes, storage areas and secondary containment areas. Additional inspection and monitoring (also required by RCRA and the Part B permit) are conducted to assure that the processes are operating within permitted and regulated specifications. \n\nUnder the CAA MACT regulations, RIS has applied for and been granted a Title V permit.

Additional inspections and monitoring of the operational processes are required by RIS' Title V permit and assure that RIS' processes are operating within Title V permitted and regulated specifications. \n\nThe OSHA Process Safety Management (\"PSM\") regulation parallels the RMP program. Both were created to minimize unexpected releases of toxic, reactive, or flammable liquids and gases. To ensure safe and healthful workplaces, OSHA issued the Process Safety Management (\"PSM\") standard (29 CFR 1910.119), which outlines facility requirements associated with processing certain chemicals. RIS has a comprehensive PSM management program that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices to minimize the potential for an unexpected chemical release. \n\nRIS firmly believes that a release of a hazardous chemical from its facility that would adversely impact the environment or cause concern to human health is very unlikely. Waste management processes at RIS are engineered and constructed with controls to prevent or mitigate off-site releases of hazardous chemicals to the environment. Current operating and safety procedures further reduce the possibility of such a release. RIS' Emergency Response Program minimizes hazards to human health and the environment from fires and unplanned releases of hazardous waste constituents from facility operations. This program includes provisions to coordinate on-site emergency response personnel if a chemical spill or fire were to occur. It also includes provisions to coordinate response to site emergencies, if necessary, with local, State and Federal emergency management personnel. Emergency Coordinators (\"EC\") and Emergency Response Team (\"ERT\") personnel employed by RIS are trained to control chemical spills and fires to minimize the possibility of an off-site release o"

Each RIS operations associate receives hundreds of hours of supervised, on the job training to learn operating procedures and proper techniques to operate process equipment and machinery. All RIS associates receive more than 24 hours of OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120 training within their first six months of employment. This safety training helps RIS associates recognize and manage the hazards associated with their jobs. It also provides organized and consistent procedures to respond to emergency situations, including chemical spills and fires. Refresher training is provided annually to apprise each associate of facility process upgrades, potential process hazards, and safety procedure changes. RIS trainers review emergency response responsibilities, contingency plan implementation criteria and site evacuation procedures during this annual training. Additionally, each RIS associate receives monthly or quarterly safety training where he or she focuses on applicable OSHA safety procedures and established safety programs. Qualified safety and health professionals provide training at RIS. \n\nRIS personnel meet annually with the local emergency service providers. Discussions at this meeting include the location and layout of the facility, properties of hazardous wastes and the associated hazards, places where facility personnel will normally be working, entrances to and roads inside the facility, evacuation routes, the potential associated hazards of emergency response and any changes that have been made to the emergency response plan. In addition, the responsibilities of each party are reviewed. Updated emergency response plans are shared with outside responders at the annual meeting.\n\nSince 1999, RIS has voluntarily participated in the OSHA On-Site Consultation Program through the Ohio Department of Commerce, Division of Labor and Worker Safety.

Evaluations are made on all aspects of these programs through inspections and associate interviews. RIS continues to participate in the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's On-Site Consultation Program. Having this independent input has enabled RIS to strengthen its outstanding programs and to better incorporate associate involvement in its efforts. Moreover, RIS' compliance with the OSHA PSM regulation requires a periodic series of health and safety program Compliance Audits by experienced RIS personnel. \n\nFacility Information \nRIS is a commercial hazardous waste treatment and storage facility located in rural Lorain County, Ohio. RIS began its waste management operations in 1949. Its primary method of waste treatment is and has always been incineration. The entire RIS facility encompasses approximately 80 acres and is surrounded by farmland, dense woodland and a small residential area. RIS thermally treats non-hazardous and hazardous solid and liquid wastes including spent solvents, paint solids, off specification chemicals, and chemical products from manufacturing facilities. RIS has drum and bulk storage capabilities and is permitted to store waste for treatment in tanks, in a covered, open sided container storage facility, in a container storage facility, on two bulk storage area pads, in waste storage bays and in an oxidizer storage building. RIS complies with State and Federal regulations for hazardous waste treatment and storage facilities (RCRA). RIS operates under State and Federal RCRA Part B permits. It also complies with OSHA standards and State and Federal air standards specific to the treatment of hazardous wastes. RIS operates under a State issued Title V Permit. \n\nWaste Management Processes \nFor the purposes of this submittal, RIS considered four processes that encompass the entirety of its facility operations.

RIS continues a review process to determine potential applicability. The following list of the chemicals are being registered. It is important to note that these chemicals are received from manufacturers as wastes and waste mixtures rather than as products. \n\nToxic Substances: \n-\tAcrylonitrile [2-Propenenitrile]\n-\tToluene Diisocyanate (Mixed Monomers)\n-\tToluene-2,4-diisocyanate \n-      Toluene 2,6-diisocyanate \n\nHazard Assessment \nThe regulated chemicals received above the TQ are evaluated in an off-site consequence analysis that considers management of these chemicals in the processes described above.

Although RIS does not typically receive regulated toxic chemicals in pure form, RIS may exceed a TQ with acrylonitrile, toluene 2,4-diisocyanate, toluene 2,6-diisocyanate, and toluene diisocyanate (mixed isomer).  Specifically, Acrylonitrile is received in a tank several times a year. A Worst-Case release would involve the contents of an entire 5,000-gallon tank of acrylonitrile solution being released. It is unlikely that an entire 5,000-gallon tank of acrylonitrile would be released without mitigation.  In the event that a tank develops a leak, RIS would take steps to contain the leak and process the container tank immediately.\n\nToluene diisocyanate (mixed isomer) (\"TDI\"), toluene-2,4-diisocyanate (\"TDI\"), and toluene-2,6-diisocynate (\"TDI\") are typically received in drums several times a year. A Worst-Case release would involve the contents of an entire 55-gallon drum of TDI solution being released. It is unlikely that an entire 55- gallon drum of TDI solution would be released without mitigation. In the event that a drum of TDI solution developed a leak, RIS would take steps to contain the leak and process the container immediately.\n\nThe assumptions used to determine the Worst-Case off-site release scenarios were highly conservative, and do not consider the preventative measures currently incorporated into RIS' standard operating procedures, or the emergency response procedures that would minimize or prevent potential off-site releases. For example, routine inspections of tanks, tankers and other containers help prevent the potential for a spill. In the event of an incident, materials would be secondarily contained. Secondary containment is designed to mitigate release. In addition, RIS' ERT members would immediately act to contain and clean up the waste material, and the release rate to the air would be minimal.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nRIS has not had an accidental release of a regulated chemical within the la"

RIS' Contingency Plan addresses various types of potential emergency situations, including spills, fires, civil unrest, associate injuries, earthquakes and high winds. Under its Contingency Plan, RIS will notify and work with the Lorain County Office of Emergency Management and Homeland Security (\"LCOEMHS\"), the local fire departments, sheriff, and hospital to control most emergency situations. A crisis communication plan is also in place to address more serious incidents with members of the local community. In extreme emergency situations, RIS may notify and seek assistance from the following organizations: \n\tLorain County Red Cross,\n\tArmy Corps of Engineers,\n\tCHEMTREC,\n\tEnvironmental Emergency Response Center, U.S. EPA Region V,\n\tLorain County Office of Emergency Management and Homeland Security,\n\tNational Response Center, and \n\tOhio EPA Emergency Response. \n\nSeveral of RIS' key Operations personnel are trained as Emergency Coordinators (\"EC's\") to manage emergency situations at the RIS facility.
