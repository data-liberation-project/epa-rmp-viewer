Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.  TPC's TBCC facility is committed to providing a safe, healthy and environmentally conscious work place for its employees and neighbors.  The PNO Facility, which includes TBCC,  maintains a working OSHA Process Safety Management  (PSM) program, which implements a series of steps to prevent potential hazards associated with the process and assures a well-trained work force.   The PSM program further implements its policies with onsite procedures and manuals.  The EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) has been built upon this existing PSM program.   TBCC participates with the Calcasieu Parish Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), are associate members of the Mutual Aid Organization in the Westlake area and the Carlyss Fire Department in assisting local officials in the development of emergency response plans and participates in cooperative training with them.   The facility complies with all applicable codes and standards regarding operating and equipment safety.  The PNO Plant Manager is responsible for implementation of the Risk Management Program (RMP) at the TBCC Facility.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled. The TBCC Facility is located  is located on the south side of Bayou D\u00bfInde immediately east of Louisiana Highway 108.

Following is a brief summary of the elements that have been implemented to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements outlined by the EPA in the RMP Rule, as well as, with the OSHA PSM standard.  \n\nProcess Safety Information\nThe PNO Facility maintains a compilation of written safety information for the TBCC facility.  This includes information pertaining to hazards of regulated substances, the technology of the covered process and the equipment in the covered process.\n \nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\nThe PNO Facility has performed the revalidation of process hazard analysis of the TBCC Facility to comply with 29 CFR 1910.119(e) and these hazard analysis apply to processes covered by RMP.  The HAZOP methodology was utilized, a recognized and generally accepted method, for identifying, evaluating, and addressing hazards in the process.  Employees from the TBCC site participated in the revalidation study. The team developed recommendations to reduce the potential hazards which are further evaluated and implemented where beneficial.  Recommendations are tracked until they are resolved.  The hazards imposed by hurricanes and inclement weather are minimally discussed during PHA's since this issue is well-covered by our Hurricane Preparedness Plan and Corporate Standards require designing equipment/structures to withstand high winds.\n \nOperating Procedures\nThe TBCC Facility maintains written operating procedures, that were developed by operations, and provide clear instructions for safely operating the facility.  These operating procedures are available to all employees who work in the processes.  The procedures are reviewed at least annually and modified whenever needed to accommodate operational and process changes.\n \nTraining\nThe TBCC Facility provides initial training as well as refresher training to employees who operate the p"

The program is comprised of well-trained personnel who follow maintenance, testing and inspection procedures that ensure proper function of process equipment.   This program includes the periodic inspection and testing of process equipment, as well as, the documentation of the results of these activities. \n \nManagement of Change\nTPC has established and implemented written procedures to manage changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures, and any changes to the facility that affect a covered process.  The procedures assure that, prior to any change, the following issues are considered: the technical basis for the proposed change, its impact on safety and health, any modifications to operating procedures, the necessary time period for the change, and any authorization requirements.  Employees involved in operating a process, as well as maintenance and contract employees whose job will be affected, are informed of and trained in the change.  If necessary, the process safety information and operating procedures are updated.\n \nPre-Startup Review\nThe TBCC Facility performs pre-startup reviews for major changes in a process that require modification to process safety information.\n \nCompliance Audit\nTPC performs audits of its compliance with the provisions of 29CFR1910.119 (PSM), and will now include 40 CFR part 68 (RMP), every three years.

The TBCC Facility has had no incidents in the last five years that have resulted in an off site impact.\n\n5.  Emergency Response Program.  The PNO Facility  has a written emergency response program which encompasses the TBCC site and contains procedures to be followed in the case of an accidental release of a hazardous chemical.  These procedures include steps for informing the public, proper first aid and medical treatment, the proper use of emergency equipment and emergency response training for emergency response employees who perform emergency response duties and local emergency responders who may be called to assist in emergency response.   The emergency response plan is reviewed annually and updated as necessary. Likewise the emergency response equipment is maintained, tested and inspected periodically.
