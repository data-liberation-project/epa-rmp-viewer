Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nWe at the North Central Grain Cooperative are strongly committed to employee, public, and\n\nenvironmental safety. This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive Accidental Release\n\nPrevention Program that covers areas such as (but, not limited to)design, installation, operating\n\nprocedures, maintenance, and employee training, all associated with the processes at our facility. It\n\nis our policy to implement the appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated\n\nsubstances. We also coordinate our response efforts with the local Fire Department, Law\n\nEnforcement, and Emergency Medical Services, all which provide additional emergency response\n\ninformation and expertise.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for agricultural crop production. We have\n\nanhydrous ammonia stored at our facility, in both a primary holding tank(s), as well as supplemental\n\nnurse tanks, which are used for product field application. All of our tanks are filled by skilled, trained\n\nemployees who do not fill any tank beyond the 85% standard maximum storage capacity.\n\n3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios:\n\n(NOTE: #3 Available only to County Emergency Manager, Fire Department and North Central Grain\n\nCooperative - not included with disk to EPA for public access per Federal Regulation posted 2004)\n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program :\n\nOur facility has taken the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention\n\nrequirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68. The following sections briefly describe the elements of\n\nthe release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source:\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\nNorth Central Grain Cooperative maintains a current and detailed data base of safety information\n\nthat describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment d"

These procedures address various\n\nmodes of operation; the information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to all operators\n\ninvolved in the processes.\n\nTraining:\n\nNorth Central Grain Cooperative has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that all\n\nemployees who are involved with operating processes and procedures are competent in the\n\noperating procedures associated with these processes.\n\nMechanical Integrity:\n\nNorth Central Grain Cooperative conducts regular, documented maintenance checks on all process\n\nequipment to ensure safe, proper operation. Maintenance checks are conducted by qualified\n\npersonnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Examples of process equipment that\n\nwould receive maintenance checks include: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief\n\nand vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps. Any equipment deficiencies\n\nidentified by the maintenance checks are taken out of service and corrected in a safe and timely\n\nmanner.\n\nManagement of Change:\n\nWritten procedures are in place at North Central Grain Cooperative to manage changes in process\n\nchemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel\n\nand/or other employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are\n\npromptly notified of the modification and receive updated training to deal with it.\n\nPre-startup Reviews:\n\nNorth Central Grain Cooperative routinely conducts pre-startup safety reviews rela"
