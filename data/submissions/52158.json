We offer a large selection of Berks branded franks, hams, ring bologna, sausage, bacon, and deli meats including ham, roast beef, and turkey breast.\n\nThe facility is located at 307-323 Bingaman Street, Reading, PA.  The NAICS code for the operation is 311612.  The facility has approximately 160 full time employees and typically operates 24 hours per day, five days per week, 52 weeks per year.  Staffing is greater during normal business hours due to the presence of management and administrative personnel.\n\nLike most meat processing manufacturing facilities, we operate an ammonia refrigeration system as part of the process to keep products and raw materials fresh and preserve food safety standards.  40 CFR 68.130 lists anhydrous ammonia as an extremely hazardous chemical subject to regulation under a Risk Management Plan (RMP), for facilities like Berks that store a threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.\n\nRMP?s are mandated by Section 112? of the Clean Air Act, and are designed to prevent chemical accidents and releases through a program of preparedness, response and prevention.  An RMP, such as the one maintained by Berks and described in this document, is required to be developed by subject facilities and includes an executive summary, registration information, off-site consequence analysis, five-year accident history, prevention program and emergency response program. \n\nBerks Packing is committed to the safety of its employees, the surrounding community, and to the quality of the environment.  Our mission includes a commitment to act as responsible neighbors in our communities.  Our refrigeration system is compliant with local building and fire codes, as well as industry-consensus codes and standards where appropriate.  We will accomplish our mission by adhering with all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  The facility has developed an emergency"

(ASHRAE). \n\nThe facility has developed and implemented a Process Safety Management Program (PSM) in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  Qualified outside contractors are used for construction and major repairs or modifications to the system. The facility's PSM program includes provisions for process hazard analyses, management of change, pre-start up safety reviews, safe work practices, inspections, testing, maintenance, compliance audits, and contractor qualifications.  The PSM program is reviewed annually and updated as necessary.  All significant changes to the system are reviewed in accordance with the PSM/RMP management of change provisions stated in the facility's plan.\n\nThe system is continuously monitored and inspected by technicians that are trained, qualified, and experienced in ammonia refrigeration in accordance with the facility's PSM program.  The system is inspected periodically for proper operation daily.  Walking inspections are conducted on intervals not longer than 8 hours apart.  System parameters are logged in a permanent record, as are routine maintenance activities.\n\nThe system is equipped with a series of redundant failsafe devices, sensors, and overrides.  In the event a malfunction occurs that could result in an ammonia release, these protective devices shut the system down.  The system can't be restarted until the cause of the shutdown is identified and corrected.  The system is equipped with "

The system can be manually shutdown using a kill switch located outside the engine room.\n\nOur priority is to prevent accidental releases of hazardous materials instead of merely responding to problems.\n\nAs required by the EPA, we have analyzed \"worst-case\" and \"alternative\" hypothetical ammonia release scenarios and their consequences, details of which appear in other portions of this RMP.  We used the EPA's ammonia refrigeration guidance documents to estimate hazard levels.  The methodology used to evaluate these accidents is prescribed by regulation, and makes no effort to estimate the likelihood or \"risk\" of these incidents.\n\nIn the past five years, there has been one ammonia release that is now included in the accident history, and which led to a minor injury to one contract employee on site.  It is estimated that one pound or less of ammonia was released during this event, which lasted between two to five seconds and occurred on 4/9/04 at approximately 3:00 pm.  The accident did not cause any property damage or offsite consequence.  We have had no other accidents involving ammonia that resulted in any on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or that resulted in any offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\nThrough our Process Safety Management program, Berks Packing continuously looks for possible system changes to improve safety in our facility.  Our safety program and PSM program are periodically reviewed, and any required upgrades to safety programs and procedures are made as required by these reviews"
