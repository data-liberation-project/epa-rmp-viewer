New employees receive basic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) that they have adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  All of this training is documented for each opertor, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nCONTRACTORS\nClemens uses contractors as a part of its regular work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to verify that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a Process Overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) Emergency Response Plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.

Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\nClemens Terminal promptly investigates all incidents that result in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the root cause and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to plant management and respective Teams for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until these actions have been resolved.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five years in order for reports to be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\nClemens Terminal periodically conducts compliance audits that include the following:  Internal PSM and RMP audits; Designated Self Audits (Safety and Health); and Responsible Care evaluations.

The Emergency Response Program changes are admisistered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in these changes.\n\nThe overall Emergency Response Program for Clemens Terminal is coordinated with the Brazoria Countly Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committtee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  Clemens has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, Clemens conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations.  In addition to the LEPC, Clemens also has a Mutual Aid System in place.  The Emergency Assistance Agreement Committtee (EAAC) is a sub-committee of the Industrial CAER organization in the Brazosport area.  This system provides Mutual Aid from other industry members in the Brazosport area.

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training and consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDescription of the Staionary Source and Regulated Substances\nClemens Terminal is an underground storage facility of finished and rerun products. The products stored in the underground storage domes are: Normal Butane, IsoButane, IsoPentane, Hydrogen, Natural Gas, Propane, Ethane-Propane Mix, Butanes-Butylenes Mix, NGL, Propylene, and Ethylene. In addition to the underground storage domes, Clemens is capable of treating Ethylene, Propylene, Propane, and normal and Iso Butanes for sales. These five products are treated through a molecular sieve bed for the removal of carry-over water resulting during storage. Ethylene and Propylene are additionally treated for the removal of Carbon Dioxide resulting from the underground storage. In our process, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a sustantial accidental release:\n\nToxics: There are no toxics stored at Clemens Terminal\n\nFlammables: Normal Butane, Ethylene, Propane,Propylene, Ethane,2-Butene-trans, 1-Butene, 2-Butene-cis, Butene, Isobutane, 2-Butene, Hydrogen, Isopentane, Methane, Pentane\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program Steps\nThe following is a summary of the general accidental release prevention program in place at the Clemens Terminal.

For specific process areas, the terminal has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the unit-specific Process Safety Information (PSI) document. The terminal verifies the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring, highly trained personnel and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nClemens Terminal also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This material includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, ect. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspections and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to confirm that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\nThe Clemens Terminal facility has a comprehesive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nClemens Terminal primarily uses the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perfom these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard techniques.

This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo confirm the process controls and/or process hazards do not deviate significantly from the original design safety features, Clemens periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the proces is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\nClemens maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) intitials startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a references by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.
