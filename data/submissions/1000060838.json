      "SummaryText": "The Baker Boy Bake Shop, Inc. facility located in Dickinson, North Dakota is a producer of frozen bakery products that handles ammonia which is considered toxic by EPA. The primary purpose of this facility is to make frozen dough products and pan baked products that are frozen for distribution to independent distributors.  The facility started up a new portion of the ammonia refrigeration system in 1998 bringing the amount of ammonia on site from less than 500 pound to an amount less than 10,000 in 1998.  Additional equipment was added in 2003, 2006 and 2012 which put us over the 10,000 pound threshold.\r\n\r\nAmmonia is used at the facility to refrigerate areas to maintain a safe storage and processing of food products.  Ammonia is a valuable chemical used in the facility refrigeration system, providing the means to remove heat from the products being handled.  The main supply of ammonia is stored in steel tanks located at various areas within the facility.  Ammonia is contained in equipment in the facility and is compressed, condensed and evaporated to remove heat from areas within the facility.\r\n\r\nSince ammonia is classified by EPA as a toxic chemical, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling the chemical to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the health threat to our own workers, and reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ammonia combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\r\n\r\nAn accidental release prevention program has been in place since the start up of the existing facility. The facility was constructed using the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines, and is in compliance with state codes as available during the time of construction.

This program also consists of having an effective preventative maintenance program and comprehensive employee training to insure adequate response to equipment integrity.  \r\n\u00bf \t A detailed process hazard review was conducted in January 2017.  A team with expertise in operations, maintenance, and safety evaluated the existing refrigeration system in depth and developed recommendations to improve the safety and operability of the system.  The PHA addressed:  (1) process hazards; (2) previous incidents; (3) engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards; (4) the consequence of control failure; (5) facility siting; (6) human factors; and (7) a qualitative evaluation of possible safety and health effects of control system failures.  The recommendations are being implemented on a time table.  \r\n\u00bf \t Written Standard Operating Procedures (RESOP/ROSOP) were prepared to provide the basis for proper and safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  The SOPs include procedures for normal operations, startup, shutdown, emergency operations, and emergency shutdown.  \r\n\u00bf \t For projects, a management of change procedure and a pre-startup safety review are in place to ensure that system changes or expansions are safe and that the changes are consistent with the engin"

Each of these contractors is evaluated from a safety perspective.  \r\n\u00bf \t The Plant has a program for replacement of all Safety Relief Valves on a 5 year interval as recommended by IIAR and is on a master change schedule as well as in our CMMS system.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur emergency response program is based upon federal guidelines as they apply to this facility.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority, local emergency response agencies, and notification of any potentially affected neighbors. The facility emergency response plan is based on all known applicable regulations and requirements.  The emergency response plan has been discussed with the Dickinson City and Rural Fire Departments and other agencies involved with a response including the Local Emergency Planning Commission.  Representatives of the Dickinson area Fire Departments visited this plant on an annual basis.  \r\n\r\nThere has been one incident that we reported but the release total was unknown.  We felt it better to report being we chose to evacuate the facility.  Spill was caused from a fan blade that ruptured an evaporator coil inside an enclosed spiral freezer.  No death or injuries were associated with the release and we were able to start operations in the plant the following day.  Changes were put in place to reduce or eliminate the same thing from happening after the conclusion of the internal investigation."
