Per CFR 68.25.b.1, \u0093For substances in a vessel, the greatest amount held in a vessel, taking into account administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity\u0094 is the worst-case scenario.\n\nThe greatest amount of propane held in one vessel is 75,000 Gallons or 262,000 lbs (85%). The total quantity released was 262,000 lbs. The propane was assumed to disperse in the flammable range, encounter areas of sufficient congestion and confinement and result in a vapor cloud explosion.\n\nUsing EPA RMP Comp, the calculated worst-case distance to 1 psi overpressure end point for vapor cloud explosion is 0.5 miles.\n\nAssumption\nRMP assumes meteorological conditions for the worst-case scenario of atmospheric stability class F (stable atmosphere) and wind speed 1.5 meters per second (3.4 miles per hour). Ambient air temperature assumed is 25 deg C (77 deg F). TNT-equivalent model is used which assumes a yield factor of 10 percent.\n\nAlternative Release Case Scenario\n\nFor alternative release scenario, release from transfer hoses at the facility was chosen. The active mitigation devices were assumed to work as designed, limiting the release to the contents of the hose. The calculated distance to 1 psi overpressure end point for vapor cloud explosion is 0.02 miles.\n\nBroken or burst propane loading hoses were determined to be the most common failure. Pumps and Compressors were also considered. Maintenance and mitigation devices are in place that would mitigate the risks of release from pumps and compressors. Vessel overfilling is mitigated administratively. The storage tanks are filled only to a maximum of 85% of the total capacity to allow expansion of the product. \n\nEmergency Response Plan\nThe facility is considered a non-responding location with no toxic substances on-site and as such maintains an Emergency Action Plan (EAP), which includes procedures for the notification of local fire, law enforcement, and medical organizations w"

The facility includes two (2) 30,000 Gallons Tanks, one (1) 60,000 Gallons Tanks and five (5) 75,000 Gallons Tanks. All the tanks are above ground.  It also has two (2) Compressors used to unload the rails cars, two (2) positive displacement Pumps. Process system involves receiving liquefied propane gas by rail cars. The terminal has a siding with four (4) rail towers designed to hook to rail cars and unload product to storage tanks using a system of compressors with vapor from the storage tanks.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy \nThe same properties that make propane valuable as a fuel also make it necessary to practice certain safety precautions in handling it to prevent leaks, spills and accidents. First and foremost, in our operations, efforts are undertaken to ensure employee and contractor safety while on site as well as to minimize the risk of exposure to the surrounding communities. It is our company policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations. The Facility has Logistics Managers and a Terminal Operations Supervisor who are able to immediately respond to a serious incident and provide technical expertise to emergency response agencies as needed at the scene of the incident. AmeriGas also maintains an around the clock Emergency Communications Center (ECC), which handles all after-hours and emergency calls from around the country. The ECC has the ability to contact AmeriGas field personnel, as well as Chemtrec, on any type of incident encountered at any AmeriGas location or by AmeriGas customers.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\nWorst Case Scenario\nFor flammables, vapor cloud explosion is specified as worst case scenario.
