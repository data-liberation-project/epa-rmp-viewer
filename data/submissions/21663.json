It is also our policy to work with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies, and promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork to provide an effective contingency plan in the unlikely event that a process incident occurs at one of our facilities.\n\nRegulated Substances\n\nThe primary activity at the North County Regional Water Treatment Plant (NCRWTP) is municipal water treatment.  Chlorine is the only 40 CFR 68 regulated substance at the facility.  Chlorine is used primarily as a disinfectant.  The maximum amount of chlorine at the facility is 17 tons.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario (WCS)\n\nThe Worst-Case release scenario according to EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance document is \"the greatest amount held in a single vessel.\"  The worst-case scenario is the complete release of chlorine from a one-ton container.  The worst-case scenario may not consider the use of active mitigation such as emergency scrubbers.\n\nThe chlorine toxic endpoint defined by 40 CFR Part 68 is 0.0087 mg/l which is equivalent to 3 parts per million by volume (ppm).  According to the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) Emergency Response Planning Guideline (ERPG)-2, this toxic endpoint is specified as \"the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\"\n\nThe SLAB computer model was used to simulate the worst-case scenario.  The maximum distance to toxic endpoint is 2.08 miles.  This distance considered the mitigation provided by the building but did not include the use of"

In addition, a comprehensive risk management program has been developed to prevent accidental releases.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nThe alternative release scenario modeled is the worst-case scenario with the emergency scrubber in operation It is assumed that a one-ton container reputes and releases all of its contents within the Process/Chemical building.  When the release is detected, the emergency scrubber is activated. There is no off-site impact for the alternative release scenario.  This alternative release scenario is not likely to occur; however, it demonstates that off-site impacts do not occur even for the worst-case scenario when the active mitigation system is used.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nCollier County is in compliance with 40 CFR 68.  The County has conducted a comprehensive review of the chlorine system as well as administrative, technical, operating and maintenance procedures, in addition to the other required program elements of the regulations.\n\nThe County has both passive mitigation, an enclosed building, and active mitigation, an emergency scrubber, to minimize the consequences of an accidental release.  The Risk Management Program addresses actions to minimize the likelihood of an accidental release and to minimize the impact if one occurs.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThere was one incident which resulted in chlorine exposure to a contractor's employee.  All available information on the accident is provided in the RMP form.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThis facility has an emergency response program that is coordianted with the Collier County Comprehensive Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that has been prepared in accordance with all local, state and federal regulations.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe hazard review resulted in the development of a list of improvem"

This work is currently in progress.\n\n   Chlorine containers must be rotated in the trunnions to properly align the valves prior to\n   connection.  The wrench currently used is not adequate and procurement of this specialized\n   wrench is recommended.\n\n   The wrenches used to connect/disconnect chlorine containers are the proper Chlorine Institute\n   approved wrenches, however, they are old and worn.  Replacement wrenches should be\n   purchased, and spare wrenches kept in stock. \n\n   Request Standard Operating Procedures for truck unloading and certification that chlorine\n   meets AWWA specifications from the chlorine supplier.  Inform plant personnel so that staff is\n   familiar with the supplier's safety and operating procedures.\n\n   Due to the chemical nature of chlorine, any work performed in the chlorine areas that involves\n   heat or sparks should be closely monitored.   Hot work permitting should be implemented.\n\n   There is a danger that visitors or other untrained individuals may enter chlorine areas, which is a\n   potential risk.  Signs should be posted in the chlorine storage area to designate it as a restricted\n   area.\n\n   Proper use and maintenance of respirators is critical.  A program for employees that wear\n   respirators should include medical exams, fit testing and training.  Purchase spare parts for the\n   respirators.\n\n   Develop an emergency evacuation plan for plant personnel.

This could lead to dropping of the container, causing possible injury to the employee, or \n   otherwise compromising the integrity of the container.

It is recommended\n   that the regulators at this facility be replaced by November 1999 or earlier.  \n\n   A preventive maintenance and replacement plan should be developed and implemented for the\n   vacuum regulators.  Plugs should be utilized to prevent moisture and dirt from entering the\n   vacuum regulators when they are stored or immediately after servicing.\n\n   A spare vacuum regulator should be purchased to enable continued operation while awaiting\n   container pick-up.\n  \n   An annual preventive maintenance program for the entire chlorine system should be prepared\n   and implemented.

An evaluation of the piping should be made by November\n     1999, and a replacement schedule implemented accordingly.\n\nTo Be Completed by January 2000\n\n     High speed vertical lifting of chlorine containers is not part of standard operations, however, it\n     is available and there is a risk of accidental use.  The high speed vertical setting on the\n     monorail mounted hoist should be disconnected, if possible.\n\n     There is potential risk of a caustic gas release in an unsafe manner from the exhaust stack. \n     This is due to an inadequate rain cap.  The rain cap should be modified or replaced.\n\n     The current location of the header vacuum gauge and valves is a trip hazard.  The header\n     should be moved to a safer location to avoid potential falls, which could result in leakage at a\n     valve. \n\n     Complete modifications of the chlorine system alarms to minimize false alarms.\n\n\n     Consider providing position switches on normal ventilation dampers to notify plant personnel\n     of a failure to close during scrubber operation.\n\n     Several non-chlorine lines in the chlorine room are painted the same color as the chlorine\n     lines.  Labeling and piping colors should be modified to be consistent with County or other\n     recognized standard.\n\n     There is a potential for the motorized switch over system to fail during transfer of chlorine\n     containers to the scales.  The motorized switch over system should be replaced with a\n     pressure operated switch over system or the system should be operated  manually.\n\nTo Be Completed by October 2000\n\n     The monorail system used to off-load chlorine containers requires that the containers\n     eventually be rolled to their destination.  The monorail system should be modified to allow\n     off-loading of chlorine containers without ro"
