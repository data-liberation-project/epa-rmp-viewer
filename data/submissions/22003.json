EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  68.155\nThe City of St. Augustine Utilities Department operates the City of St. Augustine Wastewater Treatment Plant #1 at 501 Riberia Street, St. Augustine, Florida, St. Johns County, Florida.  This plant is one of two plants operated by the City.  Both the water plant and wastewater plant have quantities of regulated hazardous chemicals above the EPA threshold.  The City has a unified Risk Management Program which applies to each plant.  Only Wastewater Treatment Plant #1 operations and policies are presented in this Plan.\n1.1. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES     (a)\nThe City of St. Augustine Wastewater Treatment Plant #1 accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures and management practices.  The plant prevention program complies with all applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) 40 CFR-68,  Prevention Program.\n1.1.1. MANAGEMENT SYSTEM  (a)(1)\n The City of St. Augustine has a management system in place which is lead by the City Manager, who oversees the implementation and on-going use of the RMP elements.  This program, along with other City-wide and plant-specific policies, eliminates and /or reduces the likelihood of a hazardous chemical release at the plant.\n1.1.2. PREVENTION PROGRAM LEVEL 3  (a)(2)\n The City of St. Augustine maintains policies, procedures and systems as part of their prevention program.  These are applied to each treatment plant and specifically the Wastewater Treatment Plant #1.  The program addresses each of  the EPA Program Level 3-listed 12 elements, plus  RMP elements needed to implement the program, and the like elements in place in the plants\u00bf OSHA PSM program.  These are maintained in The City of St. Augustine\u00bfs Document Management System (DMS).\n1.2. THE CITY OF ST. AUGUSTINE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED AT THE ST.

Chlorine is used as part of the treatment process.\n 1.2.1. SITE DESCRIPTION  (b)(1)\n The site is owned and operated by The City of St. Augustine Utilities Department.  The site is located at 501 Riberia Street,, St. Augustine, St. Johns County, Florida.  The site is located in a block area, boarded by (ICW) Intercoastal Waterway on the east, San Sabastian River on the west, Cerro Street on the north and San Sebastian River on the south.\n The Plant includes a separate chlorine storage building and adjacent control distribution system that is contained in a special process room of the wastewater plant building.  The boundaries of the chlorine system subject to the RMP regulation include the Bulk Chlorine Storage and Feed Control rooms and the associated vent makeup and exhaust systems.  These are detailed in the Process and Instrument Drawings (P&ID) which are part of the plant Process Safety Information (PSI).\n1.2.2. REGULATED SUBSTANCE  (b)(2)\n Chlorine is the only regulated substance on site which exceeds the EPA 40 CFR-68 rule threshold quantity.  The City of St. Augustine chlorine process was installed as part of the process of purifying water for public consumption.  It operates under permit from the State of Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FL DEP).  The chlorine is received, stored and distributed to five process control systems. \n Chlorine is an EPA and OSHA-listed toxic chemical.  It is an irritant and it is corrosive.  Chlorine is a halogen with the formula Cl2.  It is a chlorinating or oxidizing agent that is not flammable.  It has a 1 ppm OSHA ceiling Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) and a NFPA health rating of 4, severe; with immediate and delayed health hazards.  Chlorine is not a carcinogen.\n1.3.

The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that the ...shall assume that the... maximum quantity in the largest vessel ...is released as a gas over 10 minutes  due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario.\n Atmospheric dispersion modeling was performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to the toxic endpoint.  The EPA selected endpoint for chlorine is 0.0087 mg/l which equals 3 ppm. The 3 ppm endpoint is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual\u00bfs ability to take protective action.  The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance was defined, to estimate the population potentially affected.\n1.3.1. WORST CASE   (c)(1)\n Atmospheric dispersion modeling for the worst case scenario was performed using the EPA assumptions.  Results demonstrate a distance of 1.3 miles to the toxic endpoint.  The residential population that could potentially be affected by the release is estimated at 11,336 people.  There are schools, residences, hospital, recreation and industrial plus historic areas included in that release area.\n1.3.2. ALTERNATIVE CASE   (c)(2)\n The alternative release scenario involves the failure of the yoke assembly regulator of the pressure system connected to one of the one-ton containers.

ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM  (d)\nThe City of St. Augustine accidental release prevention program is based on OSHA\u00bfs PSM program and EPA\u00bfs RMP Level 3 prevention program.  The PSM program has been in place and effectively used for several years.  It is part of the plants operating culture.  There are two parts to the program.  The first is the general overall City-wide and Wastewater Treatment Plant #1 site program.  The second is the chlorine-specific actions within the site program.
