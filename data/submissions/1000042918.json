      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nDreisbach Enterprises is a northern California based company, providing complete warehouse and logistics capabilities at three public cold storage facilities located in Richmond, Oakland and Watsonville, California. \n\n\n\nDreisbach's senior management is not only committed to offer superior service, but to also maintain a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  Dreisbach's safety and environmental policies are administered by the President, who conducts quarterly inspections of its facilities to ensure compliance, and oversees the  safety and environmental programs associated with the regulated process.  These programs include Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers documentation, Emergency Action Plan, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nDreisbach's Oakland facility is located at 2530 East Eleventh Street in Oakland, California, which is adjacent to the I-880 Freeway.  The facility and the refrigeration system began operation in the early 1950s.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is urban.\n\n\n\nThe primary business of Dreisbach is to provide refrigerated warehousing and storage.  In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains a refrigeration system containing approximately 13,800 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance.  The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold and freezer warehousing.  \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nIn order to operate the ammonia refrigeration system, the facility complies with the following risk"

      "SummaryText": " management regulations:\n\n\n\n1) OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM);\n\n2) EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP); and\n\n3) CAL-OES' California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.\n\n\n\nThese regulations impose numerous requirements on the facility to ensure the safety of the public and on-site workers.  The following summarizes the key compliance programs that have been implemented by Dreisbach to prevent the accidental release of ammonia from the facility.  The Operating Procedures program ensures that the ammonia system is operated in a safe manner.  The Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their jobs in a safe manner.  The Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the ammonia system is in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards.  The Management of Change program ensures that process modifications are implemented in a safe manner.  The Pre-Startup Safety Review program ensures that adequate safety measures are in place before ammonia is introduced into a process.  The Hot Work Permit program ensures that Dreisbach's employees and contractors perform hot work (e.g. welding) in a safe manner.  The Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors understand the hazards of ammonia and must take specified precautions to safely complete job requirements.\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  The facility has installed ammonia sensors in the Engine Room and Cold Storage Areas t"

This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \n\n\n\n1. save lives;\n\n2. minimize and avoid injuries;\n\n3. protect the environment; and\n\n4. minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe Plan provides the notification procedures and evacuation routes for emergencies that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations.  Facility personnel receive annual training regarding the emergency procedures.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nIn December 2011, the refrigeration system was thoroughly examined for safety hazards by way of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA Revalidation which consisted of the following:\n\n\n\n1) Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study; and\n\n2) series of safety checklists.\n\n\n\nThe mitigation measures include additional training, additional labeling, minor equipment modifications, and fire department notification.  \n\n\n\nOngoing program and policy updates are addressed during the facility's Quarterly PSM / RMP Team meetings."
