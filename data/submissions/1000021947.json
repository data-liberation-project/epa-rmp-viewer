WTS has only one process that uses the following compounds: Anhydrous Ammonia and Aqua Ammonia more than 20%. On January 2011 the anhydrous ammonia tank was removed, as the feed to the aqua ammonia production reactor was directly from the tank trailer while still engaged to the truck. Our worst case scenario is now the release of Aqua Ammonia, limited to 0.8 miles, as determined by the RMP Comp modeling. WTS maintenance and other programs has allow us to operate without serious accidents since its foundation in 1974. \n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES 40 CFR 155(b)\n\nWTS manufactures ammonia solutions of different concentrations. The facility operates 1 process that has 1 RMP regulated substances, aqua ammonia. The anhydrous ammonia fed to the aqua ammonia reactor is not storaged on site any more as described above. The aqua ammonia storage tanks are a 6,000 gal. stainless steel tank and a 8,000 gal. plastic lined steel tank. There are other processes which deal with manufacturing of filters, ion exchange equipment and regeneration of ion exchange resins, which do not have RMP regulated substances."
