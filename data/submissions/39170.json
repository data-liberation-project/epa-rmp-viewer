The facility incorporates a standard evaporation and compression style ammonia refrigeration system, ammonia vapor, high stage suction (HSS) from the +20*F high temperature accumulator (HT-1) is routed to the suction (inlet) of two high stage screw compressors.  At the high stage compressors (HSC-1 and HSC-2), ammonia vapor (HSS) is compressed to a superheated vapor (HSD).  The superheated vapor (HSD) from the high stage compressors (HSC-1 and HSC2) is routed from the engine room to the roof.  On the roof it is fed to two evaporative condensers (EC-1 and EC-2).  At the condensers the superheated vapor (HSD) rejects heat and converts to a high pressure condensed liquid drain (CLD).  The condensers accomplish this by using a combination of air and water flow across the ammonia coils.  The condensers are equipped with the safety relief valves that vent directly to atmosphere.\n\nThe condensed liquid drain (CLD) from the evaporative condensers\u00bf gravity drains to the high-pressure receiver (HPR-1).  The high-pressure receiver (HPR-1) is used as a storage vessel for ammonia liquid (HPL).  As ammonia liquid (HPL) is needed in the system, it is fed (via pressure) from the high-pressure receiver (HPR-1) through a liquid filter assembly (FA-1).  The high-pressure liquid from the filter assembly (FA-1) is fed to several high-pressure liquid lines.  The first tee on the high-pressure liquid main feeds evaporators UC-15, UC-16, UC-17 and UC-18.  The high-pressure liquid main continues through an electric shutoff valve (king solenoid valve).  The liquid main feeds high-pressure liquid to the auto purger (HP-1) and liquid makeup to the +20*F high temperature accumulator (HTA-1).  The high"

Title 40 CFR Part 68.  In addition to other state and local codes applicable to our facility and process.  We have undertaken this process to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and use of anhydrous ammonia in our facility.\n\nOur goal is to promote overall worker, public, and plant safety.\n\nWhiteford Foods is located at 770 N. Center St., Versailles, OH, 45380.  We are a meat processing/packing facility.  The facility includes processing tanks, piping, packaging equipment, raw materials warehousing, finished goods refrigerated storage, an ammonia refrigeration engine room, boilers, and miscellaneous utilities.  Also located at the facility is shipping and receiving docks.\n\nThe refrigeration system required for our production process necessitates the submission of this Risk Management Plan.  The refrigeration system contains 17,500 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  This surpasses the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds outlined in Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program Regulations.\n\nWhiteford Foods has implemented numerous policies and procedures to enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of anhydrous ammonia as well as other hazardous substances, fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accident fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid property damage.\n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices that govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at our facility.\n\nWhiteford"

The hand expansion valves cause the ammonia liquid (HPL) to undergo a deliberate change in pressure.  Part of the liquid expands and evaporates into a vapor.  The remainder turns into a cooled liquid.  Liquid at this point is at +20*F.  This liquid is used to maintain a level in the +20*F high temperature accumulator (HTA-1).  Refrigerant pumps (LP-5 and LP-6) pump the liquid from the +20*F high temperature accumulator (HTA-1).  The +20F high temperature accumulator (HTA-1) is also equipped with a level column.  The level column contains a liquid level probe that has a low-level shutdown to shutoff the liquid pump (LP-5 and LP-6) in case of a low liquid level.  This is to prevent cavitation on the pumps.  The level probe in the column is also equipped with a high level alarm in case of a high liquid level in the vessel.  It is also equipped with an operating level that will energize the liquid supply solenoid to maintain the liquid level in the vessel.  The float column also contains a high-level shutdown float switch.  This float switch will power down the high stage compressors (HSC-1 and HSC-2).

The high-pressure liquid/vapor combination (TSR) is returned to the top of the high-pressure receiver (HPR-1).  In the high pressure receiver (HPR-1) the liquid/vapor combination (TSR) is separated.  The liquid is fed back out of the receiver into the liquid loop.  The vapor is fed back to the evaporative condensers (EC-1 and EC-2) via the equalizer line.  The vapor that is returned to the evaporative condensers (EC-1 and EC-2) is re-condensed into a liquid (CLD) where it returns to the high pressure receiver (HPR-1).\n \nHigh-pressure liquid (HPL) is also fed to the auto purger (HP-1).  Purged gas (PUR) is piped from the purge points to the purger (AP-1).  There are five purge points in the system.  Each evaporative condenser (EC-1 and EC-2) has 2 purge points on the condensed liquid drain outlets.  The high-pressure receiver (HPR-1) also has a purge point that is connected at the relief piping.  Each purge point consists of a solenoid valve with shutoff valves on either side for isolation.  Any non-condensables in the vapor stream are removed periodically by the automatic gas purger (AP-1).  The automatic gas purger (AP-1)"

If outside assistance is needed, the local fire department is contacted.  If the incident is very serious, the HazMat Darke County LEPC will be contacted.  Also, Whiteford Foods Emergency Response Team is contacted.  The engineers then take appropriate procedures, such as emergency shutdown standard operating procedures to control the leak with personal protective devices in place.\n\nOnce the incident commander arrives on the scene, a report is given and the incident commander takes control of the situation.\n\nWhiteford Foods is committed to continuous improvement of our policies, procedures, and facility safety.
