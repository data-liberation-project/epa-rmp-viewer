The investments Hatfield has made in environmental stewardship result in a cleaner environment and the conservation of our precious resources.  Hatfield is committed to constant reinvestment into its facility to keep its equipment and processes modern and efficient, resulting in the highest level of equipment integrity and safety for our employees and the surrounding communities.\n\nWith the submission of this Risk Management Plan (RMP), Hatfield continues to show its commitment to operate the facility and all its processes in a safe, environmentally responsible manner. Emergency response planning and an accidental release prevention program are in place to ensure a safe working environment and with it, protection of the public and the environment outside the property lines.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nHatfield Quality Meats is a family owned and operated company that has been in business since 1895.

It is the policy of the facility management to implement the requirements of this ER Plan by managing and operating the facility in accordance with the OSHA PSM and EPA RMP regulations and general good operating practices.  The objective is to minimize the risk of a fire or an accidental hazardous material release.  The ER Plan was developed to ensure fast and efficient response in case of an emergency situation.\n\nThe ER Plan identifies the emergency response organization, the procedures for notification and  evacuation, and emergency preparedness and planning.\n\nHatfield has assigned roles for its emergency response coordinator, alternate emergency response coordinators, and emergency response team.  These emergency coordinator and alternates are responsible for emergency actions as well as coordination with state and local agencies on a 24-hour basis.  The emergency coordinator functions as the leader of the emergency response team, initiates plant evacuation if needed, notifies the appropriate governmental agencies and offsite responders, and is responsible for documenting and reporting after the emergency.  The emergency response team provides additional support.\n\nIn addition, the ER Plan details the responsibility of the first aid team, the emergency procedures, and the evacuation procedures.  \n\nHatfield ha"
