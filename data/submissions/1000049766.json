This document has been prepared to satisfy the following regulations:\r\n\r\nCode of Federal Regulations, Title 40, Part 68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this document is to:\r\n\r\n1. Increase the protection of public health, the environment, and facility employees by ensuring proper emergency response and mitigation procedures when handling regulated substances.\r\n\r\n2. Assist Safeway and local government agencies in their communication and coordination efforts to improve facility safety while handling regulated substances.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis document summarizes Safeway's administrative and operational programs to prevent chemical-related accidents and reduce potential risks. These programs are detailed in the facility's Risk Management Program documentation.\r\n\r\nThe regulated substance of concern and focus of this document is ammonia. Ammonia is used as the refrigerant for the purposes of food storage.  Safeway Inc. is the owner and operator of the facility and the ammonia refrigeration system.\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n\r\nThe RMP document summarizes the prevention programs and technical studies that formulate the RMP at the facility for safe handling of ammonia. At the beginning of the RMP documents, are the Documentation Record and  Record of Revision, and Revision Page Summary forms. The Documentation Record outlines all parties that have a copy of the respective document. Updates to this document will be provided to all parties listed on this record.

      "SummaryText": "es\r\n\r\nSafeway is dedicated to operation of a safe facility for its employees and neighboring community. A safety committee has been established that is responsible for the implementation of the safety program and an Emergency Response Plan.  This includes safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system. Safeway has prepared risk and safety programs to ensure safe handling of the ammonia in the refrigeration system. Recently Safeway Inc. conducted a Process Hazard Analysis to identify potential hazards and the appropriate mitigation measures. \r\n\r\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\r\n\r\n1. The Safeway facility is located at 3520 Pacific Ave S in Auburn, Washington. The facility started operations at this location in 2005. Ammonia (NH3) is being used as the refrigerant. The total quantity of ammonia in 2005 was calculated to be 58,500 pounds. \r\n\r\n2. The Safeway ammonia refrigeration system is a closed system that cycles the refrigerant, or ammonia, from liquid to gas and back again. The system, consisting of piping, valves and process equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for product and process equipment. \r\n\r\n3. Changes in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature: lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature. Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat. Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize. Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid. Typical operating conditions range from approximately 0 psig on the low-pressure side of each system to 185 psig on the high side. \r\n\r\n4. Ammonia is the regulated substance at this facility.\r\n\r\n5. The maximum inventory of ammonia at the facility is 58,500 pounds.\r\n\r\nSafeway has an accidental release preventio"
