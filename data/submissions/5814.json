The District provides treated drinking water to approximately 6000\ntaps for customers in a service area of approximately 130 square miles in portions of\nunincorporated  Boulder and Weld counties in Colorado.\n     Surface water from Left Hand Creek is treated at the Spurgeon Plant.  During the months\nof November through March the Dodd plant is taken out of service when the Boulder feeder canal\nis de-watered for the winter.   During this winter period, the Districts water demands are met\nentirely from water treated at the Spurgeon plant.\n     Chlorine is added to the water at the plant as a disinfectant and to oxidize iron and\nmanganese for removal from the water during the filtration process.  \n     Chlorine gas is delivered to the plant and placed in the chlorine storage and containment\nroom in 2000 pound containers.  This room is designed to contain any chlorine gas in the event of\na  container or pipe leak.  Chlorine gas detectors constantly test the air in the room for any\nchlorine gas.  If chlorine gas is detected an alarm is activated.  An alarm sounds in the plant\ncontrol room and also sends out pages to all plant operators for immediate response.\n     The Spurgeon Water Treatment Plant has never had a reportable release of chlorine gas. \nThis is due in a large part to the priority that the District places on safety.  All of our plant\npersonnel have received training and have been tested in their knowledge of safe chlorine handling\nand emergency response.  We follow written procedures when working with chlorine. \n     In addition to these safety features the chlorine feed equipment is maintained in excellent\ncondition, inspected on a regular basis, and repaired immediately if a problem is found.  We have\nwritten procedures for emergencies and the op"

Emergency equipment is on site\nand maintained in excellent condition for the repair of any leaks that do occur.\n     The District is in the design process for an upgrade of the Spurgeon Water Treatment Plant.  Construction on the first phase of this upgrade is scheduled to begin in October 1999, and will include many improvements to chlorine system.  These improvements include the construction of a new chlorine storage and containment building, an R.J.
