      "SummaryText": "The City of Lancaster South Water Plant supplies potable water to the City's residences, businesses and industry. The primary function of the plant is the treatment of groundwater for drinking water purposes. The use of chlorine gas is a major component of the treatment process. The chlorine used in the facility is containerized in one-ton steel cylinders. Up to 13 cylinders maximum can be stored at the facility with 7 or 8 on site at one time. Only four of the cylinders can be on-line at one time.\nThe facility has made a commitment to safety and the implementation of safe wok procedures by emphasizing on-the-job training and encouraging continued awareness of safe working procedures. A review of plant safety procedures is being conducted in conjunction with this RMP.\nA worst-case scenario for a chlorine gas release from the South Water Plant facility was calculated using RMP*COMP software obtained from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Enclosure of the cylinders in the treatment plant was considered a passive mitigation for the modeled alternative-case scenario. \nThe Lancaster South Water Plant facility has coordinated emergency response with the Lancaster Fire Department and the Berne Township Volunteer Fire Department, along with local and county police departments."
