BTQCL \u00bf Escalon Cellars, located on Highway 120 in Escalon, California is committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace for its employees, as well as protecting the local community and the environment from chemical releases.\n\nPURPOSE \u00bf BTQCL \u00bf Escalon Cellars has developed an accidental release prevention programs for preventing or minimizing the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, and flammable chemicals. Through review and analysis of the following elements, BTQCL-Escalon Cellars has examined methods to reduce the likelihood that employees or the community may be exposed to hazardous chemicals due to catastrophic release:\n\nElement 1 \u00bf Hazardous Chemical Process Review \u00bf examined the hazardous chemicals employed, mechanical systems\u00bf integrity and design, employee training, standard operating procedures, and auditing and inspection techniques employed. \n\nElement 2 \u00bf Hazard Analysis Techniques \u00bf examined the potential hazards present, consequences of the failure of engineering controls, human factors, and failure siting. The Hazard and Operability Analysis (HAZOP) technique was chosen and employed for this purpose. \n\nElement 3 \u00bf Review of Past Accidental Releases and Consequences.\n\nElement 4 \u00bf Off-site Hazard Assessment \u00bf determined the off-site impacts of release based on worst-case and alternative release scenario analyses. The vulnerable zones for the release covered by highly hazardous chemicals were estimated using a computer assisted air dispersion modeling program.\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES \u00bf Risk Management Program (RMP) requirements are typically triggered by manufacturing, handling, using, storing, processing, or on-site movement of certain quantities (referred to as threshold quantities) of chemicals deemed as hazardous. At the BTQC-Escalon Cellars facility, anhydrous ammonia process is the RMP regulated substance.  Anhydrous"

The local fire department is invited to tour the winery\u00bfs hazardous material storage areas annually.\n\nEmployees are notified to evacuate by: 1) winery siren, 2) verbal instructions, and/or 3) two-way radio communication.\n\nIt is primarily the Security Department and Cellar Manager\u00bfs responsibility to make the proper notifications in case of an emergency release.\n\nImmediate verbal notifications to agencies upon the release of hazardous materials from BTQC-Escalon Cellars may include: local fire department (9-1-1); National Response Center (800-424-8802); California Office of Emergency Services (800-852-7550); San Joaquin County Environmental Health (559-468-3420); and the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board \u00bf Fresno Office (559-445-5116). \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY \u00bf Barrel Te"
