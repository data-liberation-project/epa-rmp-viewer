Shell has therefore developed a Risk Management Program to prevent accidental releases of toxic and flammable substances that can cause serious harm to the public and the environment and has implemented mitigative measures should any releases occur.  \n\nThe Shell Agat Terminal is a 200-acre facility that stores petroleum hydrocarbons in aboveground bulk storage tanks and flammable gas in the form of propane, also known as LPG.  Shell stores no listed toxic substances subject to 40 CFR 68.130.  The only listed substance that Shell stores at the Agat Terminal is propane (a regulated flammable substance), which is resold to retailers on-island who sell it to home owners for cooking and heating of water.  The maximum amount of propane that is stored at the Agat Terminal is 5000 barrels in a 38-foot diameter steel sphere.  \n\nThe 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act (CAA) outline the actions to be taken by facilities to prevent and mitigate accidental releases of chemicals such as propane into the atmosphere and reduce their potential impact on the public and the environment.  In keeping our commitment to safety and security, Shell has developed an Emergency Response Plan (ERP) to handle general release prevention and a propane-specific release and emergency response.  As part of the ERP, the facility has chosen to have an Emergency Response Team (ERT) to control and abate accidental releases of hazardous material. The ERT coordinates efforts with local emergency agencies and organizations to mitigate peripheral emergency issues within and beyond the facility fence lines.\n\nAlthough Shell is prepared for any release of propane or petroleum hydrocarbons, we believe that prevention of such releases is even more important.  Towards that end, we regular"

      "SummaryText": "ly inspect and maintain the propane sphere, conduct training and emergency response exercises, and ask professional personnel knowledgeable in the storage and transfer of propane to come and audit our facility.  We regard this prevention program as the reason that we have not had any propane release within the last six years at the terminal. \n\nShell has already submitted in mid-2005 an updated Emergency Response Plan to the US Coast Guard.  We will continue annual updating and refresher training for site personnel, have planned mechanical changes to the propane sphere to improve safety, will assess the integrity and functionality of the existing sprinkler system and upgrade as necessary at the sphere and loading gantry.  Additionally, we have engaged Shell US Pipeline to assess the cathodic protection system and upgrade as needed, plus they will conduct asset monitoring of the propane facility."
