Basin understands the shared value of safety and environmental protection for our employees, the public and the communities we serve as a vital component of our energy infrastructure.\n\n\n\n(b)    STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nThe Basin Stampede Terminal is operated by Basin Transload LLC (Basin). Rail cars of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) are stored on railroad tracks, while awaiting future transportation to another storage location or destination facility for off-load.  Once the LPG is sold, the rail cars are transported to the purchaser. LPG storage may exceed a threshold quantity.\n\n\n\n(c) GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Basin Stampede Terminal is operated as a  midstream terminal facility consisting of a truck LACT, atmospheric storage tanks, pipeline equipment and a private railroad siding used for staging and transferring liquid petroleum products to rail cars. Several additional buildings are present to support employees and terminal operations including terminal office, maintenance shop, on-site apartments for employees, foreman trainer and several operational equipment structures.\n\n  \n\nThe covered process for this location is solely the storage of LPG rail cars on tracks within the private siting.  No LPG product transfer or otherwise handling except for routine rail car inspections are conducted.\n\nThe Basin Stampede Terminal is regulated as a Program Level 3, CAP facility.

      "SummaryText": "n steps incorporated for the covered process include the following:\n\n-Periodic rail car inspections are conducted per an established schedule and in compliance with United States Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations.  \n\n-While the rail cars are in the yard, Basin employees conduct periodic safety inspections of the rail cars and surrounding property.  Basin conducts, or arranges for, rail car maintenance as needed while the rail cars are on site based on inspection results or established maintenance intervals.\n\n-Safety information has been developed for the covered process chemical, process, and equipment.\n\n-A hazard review consisting of a Fire Safety Analysis (FSA) and hazard analysis checklist was performed\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases from the covered process that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage within the last five years.  This statement does not incorporate other processing operations at the location not under the control of Basin or any other previous site operators.\n\n\n\n(e) EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe facility has developed an Emergency Response Action Plan (ERAP), which has been coordinated with local emergency response groups, including the local fire department.  Basin has also contracted with a private hazardous material response contractor who is available 24-hours per day on an on-call basis.  Basin is responsible for coordinating the notifications required to initiate an emergency response. The ERAP provides the essential planning for effectively protecting the public and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n\n\n(f) PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nCompliance with Basin environmental, health, and safety standards and expectations form the framework for continuous safety improvement.  Specific actions that will be taken in the future "
