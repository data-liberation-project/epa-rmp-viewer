Basin conducts, or arranges for, rail car maintenance as needed while the rail cars are on site based on inspection results or established maintenance intervals.\r\n-Safety information has been developed for the covered process chemical, process, and equipment.\r\n-A hazard review consisting of a Fire Safety Analysis (FSA) and hazard analysis checklist was performed\r\n\r\n\r\n(d) FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThere have been no accidental releases from the covered process that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage within the last five years.  This statement does not incorporate other processing operations at the location not under the control of Basin or any other previous site operators.\r\n\r\n(e) EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe facility has developed an Emergency Response Action Plan (ERAP), which has been coordinated with local emergency response groups, including the local fire department.  Basin has also contracted with a private hazardous material response contractor who is available 24-hours per day on an on-call basis.  Basin is responsible for coordinating the notifications required to initiate an emergency response. The ERAP provides the essential planning for effectively protecting the public and the environment during emergency situations.\r\n\r\n(f) PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nCompliance with Basin environmental, health, and safety standards and expectations form the framework for continuous safety improvement.
