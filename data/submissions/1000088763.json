Mitigation systems used are sprinkler systems, firewalls, and chemical neutralization. The process and unloading areas can be monitored by portable TDI monitors and two permanently mounted continuous read TDI monitors located at the storage tanks and pourline head. Operator training and refresher training are conducted as needed or on a yearly basis.\r\n\r\nThe facility has not had an accidental EHS-related release in the last five years plus.\r\n\r\nThe facility's Emergency Response Program was designed and updated according to the EPA Integrated Contingency Plan Guidance document. The plan defines the response organization, coordination with city, county, state, and contracted emergency response organizations, equipment available on-site, response procedures, training, notification procedures, emergency scenarios, and drills. The plan is updated periodically according to our requirements or from deficiencies uncovered from periodic tabletop and actual drills and evacuations. The plan was distributed to the LEPC, local police and fire departments\r\n\r\nThe facility plans no major safety improvements at this time since all current state-of-the-art for design and operation is implemented."
