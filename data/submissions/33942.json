If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received and used for reacting with phosphoric acid to produce a non-hazardous liquid fertilizer.\n\nThe maximum quantity stored would be 169 000 pounds  in a railcar.  The maximum amount handled would be one rail tank car.\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous ammonia, K-61.1 published by ANSI and the standards of the US OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 Storage and handling of Anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia  in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths,  injuries, evacuations,  sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\nThe facility has a written emergency response plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38 and has provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III.  The facility has a written emergency response program in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\nSafety improvement is an ongoing  process at the facility.  Periodic evaluation  are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
