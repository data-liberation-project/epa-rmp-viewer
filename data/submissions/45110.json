      "SummaryText": "The International Paper Eastover Mill is committed to operating in a manner that provides for the safety of its employees and neighbors and for the protection of the environment. A key element of this commitment is the safe and proper handling of chemicals. Controls have been implemented to prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances. In the event of an accidental release, mitigation steps are taken to stop, control, contain and clean up the release.\n\nThe International Paper Eastover Mill is an integrated pulp and paper manufacturing facility on a 4400-acre site in the southeastern portion of Richland County, South Carolina.  Chlorine dioxide is primarily utilized at the site to bleach pulp. This substance is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions.\n\nThe Eastover Mill is committed to continuously improving the safety of its processes. One example of this commitment is the elimination of the use of chlorine for bleaching. Chlorine was eliminated from the bleaching process in December 2001. Additionally, ongoing activities including training, process hazard analysis and auditing are utilized to identify ways to continuously improve the operation of these processes.\n\nThe following prevention elements for the chlorine dioxide system are employed at the mill: \n\nProcess Safety Information: A variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure the safe operation of this system is maintained. A Material Safety Data Sheet documents the physical properties of this chemical. Design standards are utilized to ensure that process safety information is incorporated into the construction and maintenance of this system. \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis: Process hazard analysis (PHAs) were conducted on the chlorine dioxide system. PHAs are structured ways to identify and reduce the hazards of a system. Routine review of these PHAs is performed as well. \n\nOperating Procedures: Written operating procedures have been developed and are maintained."

      "SummaryText": " These procedures define how tasks related to the process operations should be performed. They are used to train operators and serve as guides for appropriate steps to be taken during both normal operations and process upsets. \n\nMaintenance: The chlorine dioxide system is properly maintained. Preventative maintenance is routinely performed on this system. Work on this system is limited to employees and contract personnel who have received specific training on the maintenance and hazards of this system. \n\nCompliance Audits: Periodic Audits are conducted to ensure compliance with the regulatory requirements and International Paper policies. \n\nIncident Investigation: All incidents that could reasonably result in a serious injury to employees, the public or the environment are investigated. All employees are encouraged to report any such incident. The results of the investigations are documented and appropriate actions are implemented.    \n \nTraining: Personnel are trained in the operating procedures to help ensure safe and effective performance of their assigned tasks. \n\nThe facility has a written emergency response plan to mitigate and minimize the affects of any accidental release. Trained response personnel and equipment are on site 24 hours a day. Training on and drills of the response plan are routinely conducted. The response plan has been communicated to local emergency response officials, who have participated in drills at the facility. As defined by the rule, one accidental release has occurred in the past five years. No permanent injury resulted from this accident and information learned was used to improve our prevention programs."
