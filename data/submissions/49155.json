Wastewater from the City and\nnearby Walkersville, Maryland is received and treated at the\nfacility.  The Walkersville, Maryland wastewater is treated\nwith a minimal amount of chlorine and subsequently directed\nto the wastewater treatment plant for Frederick County\n(Ballenger Creek WWTP).  The City wastewater is treated\nthrough a series of settling basins, clarifiers, sand\nfilters, chemical treatments and post-aeration before being\ndischarged to the Monocacy River.  Based on an assessment of\nthe chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems used at the facility\n(chlorine storage greater than 2,500 pounds and sulfur\ndioxide storage greater than 5,000 pounds), the WWTP is\nrequired under Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations\n(CFR) Part 68 and the United States Environmental Protection\nAgency (USEPA) to develop and implement a Risk Management\nPlan (RMPlan).  The chlorine treatment system consists of\neight (8) 1-ton containers (four (4) in use, four (4) as\nbackup).  Similarly, the sulfur dioxide treatment system\nconsists of six (6) 1-ton containers (three (3) in use,\nthree (3) as backup).  The City operates the chemical\ntreatment systems in accordance with standard industry\npractices and monitors the performance of each system on a\nregular basis.  The safety of all WWTP operations are\ncontinually reviewed and improved through an internal safety\ncommittee that meets at a minimum on a quarterly basis.  It\nis the policy of the City of Frederick to adhere to all\napplicable federal, state and local laws.\n\nUSEPA's RMPlan provisions are intended to have facilities 1)\nprepare for and prevent the potential for a catastrophic\nrelease or explosion and 2) coordinate emergency response\nactivities both internally and"

However, should such an event occur, the City WWTP\nwill follow the contents of this plan in response to the\nemergency or potential emergency.\n\nUnder 40 CFR 68, facilities are required to comply with the\nRMPlan requirements for re-submittal of their plan within 5-\nyears after their initial submittal.  Our re-submittal is\ndue on May 19, 2005.  Compliance with this rule includes an\nelectronic submittal to USEPA of required data elements\nusing EPA's RMP*Submit 2004 software.  The RMPlan and the\ndata elements required in the submittal were developed based\non USEPA's guidance documents including: RMP*Submit 2004\nUser's Manual:  Accidental Release Prevention Requirement;\nRisk Management Program Requirement Under Clean Air Act\nSection 112(r)(7); Amendments to the Submission Schedule and\nData Requirements:  A Checklist for Resubmitting Your Risk\nManagement Plan (RMP) For Chemical Accident Prevention.\n\nAfter determining that the chlorine and sulfur dioxide\ntreatment systems were applicable processes, the City WWTP\nperformed a program applicably assessment to determine the\nspecific RMP requirements for the chemical treatment\nsystems.  This assessment is dependent on the following four\nfactors.\n\n\n\n1)   Five-Year Accident History:  The chlorine and sulfur\ndioxide systems have never had an accidental release since\nthey were installed in 1987.\n2)   SIC Code of the Facility:  The facilities SIC Code is\n4952, sewerage systems.\n3)   Applicability of OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM)\nRegulations:  The treatment process is subject to the OSHA\nPSM standard outlines in 29 CFR 1910.119.  Since the worse\ncase analysis identified impacted offsite public receptors\nand the facility is subject to OSHA's PSM regulations, the\ntreatment processes are subject to Risk Management Program\n3.\n\nThe City of Frederick has also ensured that the facility i"
