This commitment is embraced by each member of our team, no matter what position or area. Our active role includes an obligation to point out any deficient safety or environmental practices that are observed anytime, anywhere. Positive reinforcement will be our primary motivation tool to benchmark satisfactory performance. Safety hazards or environmental concerns are exposed and relayed to team members without fear of reprisal or resentment. Great safety and environmental records are a team effort.\n\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\n\nThe facility is located on a nominal 5 acre site, with paved shipping and receiving areas. The major structures and their designated functions are: Warehouse w/ docks; Receiving Area w/ docks; Machinery Spaces; Production Areas; Coolers and Freezers. The facility produces dairy products for its distributors. The facility operates an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system to produce space cooling, product cooling, and process equipment cooling. The refrigeration system is designed to provide: operating flexibility (through availability of multiple operating equipment combinations); economy and efficiency of operations (through the use of operating pressures commensurate with the degree of cooling required); optimal safety performance: and, consistency of operation, utilizing programmable logic controllers (PLCs) to monitor, record, operate, and modulate refrigeration equipment as conditions require. Major equipment components include: compressors, condensers, receivers, recirculators and other vessels, and a variety of heat exchangers (evaporators, air handlers, etc.).\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\n\nThe facility has implemented a Process Safety Management program for its ammonia refrigeration process operation and maintenance. The PSM Program has been incorporated as both policy, and most "

Among the many safety features present at the facility are:\n\nOSHA Process Safety Management Program, and EPA Prevention Program.\n\nAmmonia detection and alarm.\n\nEyewash and safety showers throughout ammonia distribution areas.\n\nPersonal protective equipment, including emergency respirators.\n\nEmergency communication systems.\n\nTraining Programs, such as Chemical Safety, Safe Work Practices, and others.\n\nPlant Safety Committee, trained, involved, and motivated.\n\nPlant Safety Acknowledgement System.\n\nPeriodic Safety Meetings.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nThere have been no accidents or injuries related to the ammonia refrigeration system during the past five years.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nThe \"Emergency Action Plan\" has been developed in accordance with OSHA 1910.38. The plan addresses fire, explosion, spills or releases of toxics, severe weather, and other criteria. The plan details response actions by facility personnel for such emergencies, safety and emergency equipment, communication responsibilities,\n\nand coordination with off&#8208;site responders, as well as notification of federal and state agencies. The plan includes \"Emergency Response to Anhydrous Ammonia,\" specifically addressing incidents involving ammonia refrigeration. Select employees have been trained in the use of Self- Contained Breathing Apparatus unit, and in hazardous material response action, anticipating that they would work in cooperation with the off-site responding HazMat Team.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nThe facility is continually working to improve safety in all areas, as well as within the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system. The facility encourages input from operation and maintenance personnel, as well as vendor and agency inspectors, and responds to address potential improvements. The facility places a high emphasis upon training of personnel in the areas of safety"
