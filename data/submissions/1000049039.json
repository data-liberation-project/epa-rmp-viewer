This summary is presented in response to the requirements of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 (40 CFR 68) and Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.  The Highwater Ethanol facility is subject to the RMP rule due to the storage of natural gasoline denaturant, a regulated flammable mixture, above the threshold quantities.\n\n\n\n1. Accidental release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nHighwater Ethanol is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from any hazardous substances used in its chemical manufacturing process, specifically natural gasoline. It is the policy of Highwater Ethanol to comply with all Federal, State and Local laws. The Highwater Ethanol facility has a detailed Emergency Response Plan that is utilized to respond to any accidental releases. \n\n\n\nIn the event that a release does occur, the facility's response is described in our emergency response plan.  The emergency response plan includes procedures to coordinate response actions with local emergency response personnel as well as any potentially affected neighbors.  In addition, the emergency response plan is used to familiarize local emergency response personnel with the types of material handled and internal emergency response procedures.\n\n\n\n2. Facility Description and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nHighwater Ethanol operates an ethanol manufacturing facility located in Lamberton, Redwood County, Minnesota.  The facility is a corn-based denatured ethanol fuel production plant.  Ethanol is produced through the conversion of corn starch to sugars and then the sugars are converted to ethanol through a continuous fermentation and distillation process. The facility stores natural gasoline, which is used as a denatura"

General Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nHighwater Ethanol has programs in place to address accidental release prevention measures required by EPA, process safety management (PSM) requirements from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and notification requirements of EPA's Emergency Response and Community Right-to-Know regulations.  The facility complies with PSM for the management of ethanol, fuel additives and natural gasoline denaturant.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nHighwater Ethanol has implemented an employee participation program.  All process safety information, process hazard analysis (PHA) results, recommendations, and action items, incident investigations, compliance audits, operating procedures, emergency response plan, and records of management of change are available to the operating personnel.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis and Process Safety Information\n\nThe facility utilizes the What If process hazard analysis (PHA) methodologies.  The PHA identified the following potential major hazards: fire, explosion, over-pressurization, corrosion, overfilling and equipment failure.  The facility utilizes process controls such as vents, relief valves, check valves, manual shutoffs, interlocks, alarms and procedures and grounding equipment to prevent or limit releases.  \n\n\n\nHighwater Ethanol keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the facility.  The facility also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, piping and instrument drawings.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures and Training\n\nHighwater Ethanol maintains written procedures that address all modes of process operations and the facility has developed and implemented a comprehensive trai"

The procedure includes a contractor screening process and hazard awareness, safety and emergency procedures training.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews\n\nHighwater Ethanol conducts a pre-startup safety review (PSSR) for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe facility's mechanical integrity program includes written procedures, training, and regular inspections and equipment testing procedures to maintain facility equipment in safe operating condition.  \n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe facility's management of change (MOC) program reviews all proposed changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures, materials, and design conditions prior to implementation of the change.  Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by a process change.  \n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nHighwater Ethanol has procedures to promptly investigate any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a release of a regulated substance.  The procedure establishes the minimum guidelines and activities of the incident investigation program in order to reduce the likelihood of repetitive occurrences of events which could reasonably lead to catastrophic releases.

Five-Year Accident History\n\nThe facility has not had any accidents reportable under RMP within the past five years.  \n\n\n\n5. The Emergency Response Program\n\nHighwater Ethanol's emergency response program is described in our emergency response plan.  The purpose of the emergency response plan is to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The emergency response plan addresses aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. \n\n\n\nIn addition, Highwater Ethanol has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  We work with the local fire department and emergency responders to ensure the proper execution of our plan.  The emergency response program will be updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes.\n\n\n\n6.
