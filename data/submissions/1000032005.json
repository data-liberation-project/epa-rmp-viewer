Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\n\n\nAt this distribution facility, we handle chlorine and sulfur dioxide, which are considered hazardous by the EPA.  The same properties that make chlorine and sulfur dioxide valuable as commodity chemicals also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as that of our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine and sulfur dioxide, and the training of our personnel.\n\n\n\nOur emergency response program for chlorine and sulfur dioxide is based upon The Chlorine Institute's Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of our immediate neighbors.\n\n\n\nBeginning in early 2013, we plan to operate a transfer process (tank trailers to rail cars) of a product that contains toluene diisocyanate above threshold amounts.  The same dedication to safely handling existing products will be applied to this new operation.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\n\n\nOne of the primary purposes of this facility is to store chlorine and sulfur dioxide for distribution to our customers which include water treatment facilities and general industry.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are received in Department of Transportation (DOT) approved 150 pound cylinders and ton containers and are shipped in the same packages.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are not used, manufactured, or repackaged at this facility.  Access to the site is restricted to Harcros employees, and authorized contractors and visitors.  The storage of chlorine and sulfur dioxide containers is subject to RMP "

The product will not be manufactured or used at this facility.  The handling of toluene diisocyante is subject to RMP Program Level 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps\n\n\n\nThis distribution facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility is operated in accordance with recommendations from The Chlorine Institute and with the Responsible Distribution Process of the National Association of Chemical Distributors.  For the toluene diisocyante transfer process, we will be receiving expert guidance from the product supplier and using the recommendations they follow as members of the International Isocyanates Institute.\n\n\n\nA summary of our Prevention Program\n\n\n\nSAFETY INFORMATION - Our facilities maintain current copies of Material Safety Data Sheets for all hazardous chemicals stored including Chlorine, Sulfur Dioxide and the Toluene Diisocyanate product.  This facility has access to all relevant Chlorine Institute pamphlets.  Much of the information in these pamphlets is applicable to the storage of sulfur dioxide also.  In addition, we have access to numerous documents about the properties and safe handling of toluene diisocyanate and related compounds.\n\n\n\nHAZARD REVIEW - A hazard review is conducted for all regulated processes at least every 5 years.  For chlorine & sulfur dioxide storage, we primarily use a checklist prepared by the Chlorine Institute, which is relevant to our operations.  For the toluene diisocyanate transfer, we perform a Zurich Hazard Analysis. At least one hourly employee (warehouse personnel or driver) takes part in all hazard reviews.  Corrective or preventative actions discovered during these reviews are documented and addressed i"

In addition, we have procedures and checklists for the toluene diisocyanate process based on information obtained from our supplier.\n\n\n\nTRAINING - All new drivers and warehouse personnel attend a 3 to 4 day training workshop covering a variety of safety, environmental, and regulatory topics.  Workers at facilities that store chlorine & sulfur dioxide and transfer toluene diisocyanate receive additional training on the hazards, health effects, and operating procedures specific to those chemicals.  Refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.\n\n\n\nMAINTENANCE - For the sulfur dioxide and chlorine container storage process, we perform visual inspections of containers when received and before loading for delivery to customers.  In addition, we perform daily inspections and routine maintenance on the forklift trucks used to move containers. The simple toluene diisocyante process has procedures for maintaining vent scrubber controls, the dryer and controls for our compressed air system, and the transfer hoses.  In addition, all containers and vehicles are maintained per U.S. Department of Transportation requirements.\n\n\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION - We have an Incident Investigation Standard Operating Procedure which requires operation managers to document and investigate incidents involving injuries and environmental releases, as well as \"near-misses\" that could have lead to injuries and releases.  These reports are reviewed by corporate safety personnel and are shared with all facilities within the company.  Corrective actions proposed as a result of these investigations are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDIT - A compliance audit is conducted at least every 3 years for every process to assure the documentation and procedures fully comply with the RMP regulations.  Deficiencies discovered during audits are corre"

Five year accident history\n\n\n\nIn the past 5 years, this facility has had one accident that met the criteria for reporting in this section:\n\n\n\nOn December 13, 2007, a chlorine release of about 18 pounds was caused when an operator did not follow proper startup procedures.  Valves that had been opened to perform necessary maintenance were not closed before startup, introducing liquid chlorine into a section of piping not designed for that condition, and leading to piping failure.  Automatic control equipment detected the leak shutting off automatic valves and minimizing the amount released.  As a result of the release, about 30 people temporarily evacuated nearby businesses as a precaution.  We retrained personnel and changed procedures to have valves double checked before startup.  Shortly after this incident, we stopped chlorine and sulfur dioxide packaging operations at this facility and now only store toxic gases in containers filled elsewhere.  This eliminates the possibility of the same type of release from happening again at this facility.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. The emergency response program\n\n\n\nThis facility's emergency response program for incidents involving chlorine and sulfur dioxide is based upon The Chlorine Institute's Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities. This plan is reviewed annually and updated when required. All response team members attend annual refresher training including the use of response equipment on simulated leaks. We work closely with our suppliers, customers, public responders, and The Chlorine Institute to continuously improve our emergency response capabilities.\n\n\n\nOur response program is for chlorine and sulfur dioxide leaks only. We will not respond to other types of emergencies including those involving toluene diisocyanate, but will assist trained public and private emergency response personnel if required. In addition to the chlorine response plan, we have a regularly updated Emergency A"

The recently completed Hazard Review for the Toluene Diisocyante process included recommendations for improved secondary containment, better rail car access, and obtaining additional information on the monitoring of vent vapor controls. These will be completed before the process is started.  \n\n"
