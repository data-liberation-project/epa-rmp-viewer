The audit team includes those knowledgeable in the process, operations personnel, and at least one person trained in audit techniques and practices.

The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\n- The five-year accident history [40 CFR 68.155(d)]:\nBCS has had no accidental releases during the past five years that meet the criteria for an accidental release as discussed in 40 CFR 68.42.\n\n- The emergency response program [40 CFR 68.155(e)]:\nBCS is a non-responding facility. The facility maintains a written emergency response plan, which has been written in accordance with OSHA PSM requirements. The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including: proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, if a release occurs.\n\nEmployees receive training on the procedures to be followed in an emergency scenario. The emergency response plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the facility processes. Periodic drills or tabletop exercises are conducted to test the response plan. BCS has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (i.e., fire department).

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology, procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.\n\nChanges are reviewed to:\n\n1)\tEnsure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, and;\n2)\tVerify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.\n\nIncident Investigation [40 CFR Part 68.81]\nBCS investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.

The reference documents are maintained on file at the facility.\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure considerations, is provided in Safety Data Sheets (SDS) which are kept on site at the facility. For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the operations procedures manual. The facility maintains the process within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure, temperature and electrical ratings. This information, in combination with procedures and equipment operating history, provides a basis for inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis [40 CFR Part 68.67]\nBCS has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nBCS primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies, evaluates, and makes recommendations to management of the potential hazards associated with the process as well accident prevention and mitigation measures. T"

      "SummaryText": "- The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source [40 CFR 68.155(a)]:\nBones Condensate Stabilizer (BCS) is committed to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\n- The stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\nBCS is a centralized oil and gas handling facility consisting of separators, condensate stabilizers, an emergency flare system, pressurized and atmospheric storage tanks. The site handles condensate, gas and water produced by on-going operations.\n\n- The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps [40 CFR 68.155(c)]:\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place for the processes at the facility.\n\nEmployee Participation [40 CFR Part 68.83]\nEmployees of BCS are encouraged to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility accident prevention program.\n\nProcess Safety Information [40 CFR Part 68.65]\nBCS keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters an specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configurat"
