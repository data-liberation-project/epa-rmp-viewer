The facility has an ammonia refrigeration system that provides refrigeration capacity to the following:\r\n(5) Cold Storage Rooms\r\n(3) Precool Rooms\r\n(1) Hallway\r\n\r\n1.2.2 Facility Location\r\n\r\nSunkist Consolidation Services is located at 970 E Myer Ave, Exeter, CA 93221. The latitude and \r\nlongitude of the high pressure receiver is 36.276272, -119.131139. The facility is located approximately 0.25 miles east of state highway 65 and 3.5 miles south of state highway 198 in a rural area surrounded primarily by agricultural land.\r\n\r\nAccording to FEMA Flood Map Service, the facility is located in an area with 0.2% annual chance of flood.\r\n\r\nSunkist Consolidation Services is not located in an Alquist-Priolo Fault Zone as defined by the California Department of Conservation. In addition, a review of United States Geological Survey (USGS) fault maps revealed that there are no faults in close proximity to the site. The USGS 2018 One-Year Model revealed that Sunkist Consolidation Services has a 1-2% chance of experiencing potentially minor-damage due to ground shaking in 2018.\r\n\r\n1.2.3 Description of Covered Process\r\n\r\nThe refrigerated areas are equipped with air-cooling evaporators and accumulators as required for flooded operation.

Each compressor has an integral oil separator that receives the high pressure vapor and separates residual oil from the ammonia so that the oil can be returned to the compressor. The compressors are equipped with high discharge pressure cutouts to shut the equipment off if the pressure exceeds the setpoint. Under normal conditions, the compressors contain both high and low pressure vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nEvaporative Condenser\r\nThe purpose of the evaporative condenser is to reject the heat absorbed in the evaporators to the atmosphere. The evaporative condenser receives high pressure, superheated vapor from the compressors and supplies high pressure liquid to the high pressure receivers. The condenser uses air and water to cool the warm ammonia as it passes through a series of tubes within the condenser. As the cooling medium of air and water draws the heat from the vapor, the refrigerant condenses into a liquid and flows to the high pressure receivers. Under normal conditions, the evaporative condenser contains high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nProcess Classification\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at Sunkist Consolidation Services consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping.

The flooded accumulators supply, by gravity, low pressure liquid to the associated evaporators. Liquid and vapor returned from the evaporators is separated inside the flooded accumulators to allow only the vapor to be returned to the main suction accumulator. Under normal conditions, the flooded accumulators contain low pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nAir-Cooling Evaporators (Flooded)\r\nThe purpose of the flooded air-cooling evaporators in the cold storage rooms is to remove heat from the air in order to maintain a predetermined space temperature. The air-cooling evaporators receive liquid from a flooded accumulator. The evaporators contain a set of continuous coils through which the low pressure liquid flows. Due to the low pressures and temperatures maintained in the evaporator, the liquid refrigerant absorbs a great deal of heat from the surrounding area and evaporates. To increase the rate of heat removed, the evaporators use an electric fan to move warm air over the coils of cold liquid ammonia. Once the liquid has evaporated to form low temperature and pressure vapor, it returns to the supplying vessel.

The main suction accumulator receives vapor from the flooded accumulators and separates any residual liquid from the vapor to allow only the vapor to be piped to the suction of each compressor. Liquid in the main suction accumulator drains by gravity into the liquid transfer vessel. The main suction accumulator is equipped with a high level float switch that is wired to shut down the compressors in the event of a high level situation. This prevents liquid ammonia from entering the compressors. Under normal conditions, the main suction accumulator contains low pressure vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nLiquid Transfer Vessel\r\nThe purpose of the liquid transfer vessel is to transfer liquid from the low side of the refrigeration system back to the high pressure receivers. The liquid transfer vessel receives liquid from the main suction accumulator. Once the liquid level in the liquid transfer vessel reaches the float switch, the three way solenoid valve is energized for a period of time causing the liquid transfer vessel to become subject to high pressure and allowing the liquid to drain by gravity into the high pressure receivers. Under normal conditions the liquid transfer vessel can contain either high or low pressure liquid and vapor.\r\n\r\nCompressors\r\nThe purpose of the compressors is to raise the temperature and pressure of the low pressure gas in order to reject the heat absorbed in the evaporators to the atmosphere. The compressors receive low pressure vapor from the main suction accumulator and discharge high pressur"

It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\r\n\r\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active logbook of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \r\n\r\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\r\n\r\nSunkist Consolidation Services has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\r\n\r\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\r\n\r\nSunkist Consolidation Services's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\r\n- California Emergency Action Plan - Title 8 CCR \u00a73220\r\n- Federal Emergency Action Plan - Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.38 \r\n\r\nStrategically, we will respond minimally to a release. Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \r\n\r\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\r\n\r\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nSunkist Consolidation Services has implemented many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, Sunkist Consolidation Services continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\r\n\r\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all"
