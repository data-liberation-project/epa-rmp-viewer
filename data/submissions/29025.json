Recently, Abengoa Bioenergy Corporation has undergone a management change. Once operated under High Plains Corporation, the facility now operates under Abengoa Bioenergy Corporation.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies:\n\nAbengoa Bioenergy Corporation has a commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\n\nAbengoa Bioenergy Corporation's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\nAbengoa Bioenergy Corporation ethanol plant is located in York, York County, Nebraska.\n\nThe facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  The regulated substance under the RMP program is Anhydrous Ammonia.  Abengoa Bioenergy Corporation has determined that the radius of impact from a worst-case release would be about 3.6 miles; due to the amount of ammonia stored on site.\n\nOff-site Consequence Analysis Results:\n\nThe worst case scenario at the facility is the release of all 40,000 pounds of ammonia creating a toxic cloud.  The worst-case scenario is based on the release of all ammonia stored on site.  The worst case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 3.6 miles from the center of the plant.  Rural residence homes are located within this 3.6 mile radius.\n\nAlthough Abengoa Bioenergy Corporation has numerous controls in place to prevent such a release and to ma"

      "SummaryText": "nage potential consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario.\n\nSince the facility qualifies as a Program 3 due to the close proximity of public receptors, Program Safety Management has to be completed for this facility.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nAbengoa Bioenergy Corporation has not had any spills on site in the five years.  The facility is subject to RMP upon delivery of substances onsite.\n\nEmergency Response Program Information:\n\nThe Abengoa Bioenergy Corporation ethanol plant has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including a Health and Safety Plan.  An SPCC has also been revised and implemented in accordance with applicable regulatory standards and timeframes.\n\nThe facility also conducts employee training as part of facility activities.  Abengoa Bioenergy Corporation's corporate policy places the utmost importance on worker, public and environmental safety, which is reflected in facility plans and training activities.\n\nA safety inspection and a review of the facility's emergency response plan has been completed in conjunction with this RMP revision."
