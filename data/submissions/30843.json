This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Processing and storage of fruit (Blueberries)..  We have 1 regulated substance present at our facility.  These substances include  and Ammonia (anhydrous).  Ammonia (anhydrous) is used for Industrial Refridgeration.                                        .\r\n\r\nThe maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) at our facility is 21549.37 lb..\r\n\r\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\r\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  For alternative release scenario analyses we have employed the EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration  Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Ammonia Refrigeration .  In this scenario 15347.995 lb. of Ammonia (anhydrous) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.   At Class F atmospheric stabil"

In this scenario 4766.229 lb. of Ammonia (anhydrous) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.   Passive mitigation systems such as enclosure(s) are also taken into account to calculate the scenario.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 1.6 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.\r\n\r\nOne alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a release from Ammonia Refrigeration .  The scenario involves the release of 5000 lb. of .  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 60 minutes.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by neutralization and emergency shutdown system(s).  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia (anhydrous) is 0.19 miles.\r\n\r\nAnother alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a release from Ammonia Refrigeration .  The scenario involves the release of 1000 lb. of .  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 60 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia (anhydrous) is 0.07 miles.\r\n\r\n4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out"

The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on 10/30/2002.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Reviews\r\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Jasper Wyman & Son .  The most recent review was performed on 07/21/2002.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nJasper Wyman & Son  conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  The most recent comliance audit was conducted on 10/30/2002.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nJasper Wyman & Son  promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions"
