The worst case release scenario for Chlorine would be the failure of a pressurized chlorine cylinder valve, and the sudden release of it's contents (2000lbs) in 10 minutes. The distance would 0.9 miles as estmated by the EPA's PMP* Comp.\n\n  The alternative release scenario would be avalve sheared off releasing 2000 pounds of liquid chlorine in 15 minutes. The distance to the toxic end point would be o.2 miles asa determined by the EPA's RMP* Comp.\n\nIV. The James B. M"
