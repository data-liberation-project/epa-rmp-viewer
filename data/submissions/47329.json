Facility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\nThe primary activities at the New Martinsville facility are towards the manufacture of polyurethane intermediates.  The polyurethane intermediates include aromatic isocyanates like polymeric diphenylmethane diisocyanate.  Polyether and polyester polyols are also produced.  The New Martinsville facility uses or stores eight of the RMP listed chemicals on the site as of December 8, 2006.  Of the eight chemicals covered, five are raw materials, one is an intermediate, one is a finished product, and one is a neutralizing agent for a safety system.  All eight chemicals were modeled using worst case release parameters as a screening exercise to determine the worst case scenario for the facility.  The New Martinsville site TDI plant was shut down and dismantled in 2006. The TDI plant was the location of the worst case and alternative scenarios for phosgene and the alternative scenario for ammonia.  The phosgene and ammonia scenarios a"

      "SummaryText": "re also present at the New Martinsville site, polymeric diphenylmethane diisocyanate plant (MR-I).  Phosgene continues to be the worst case scenario chemical followed in order of potential off-site impact by ethylene oxide, toluene diisocyanate, chlorine, propylene oxide, ammonia, formaldehyde, and ethylene diamine.\n\n3.  Worst Case Scenario for the Facility\nThe worst case release scenario for the New Martinsville facility is the rupture of a phosgene solution vessel. Because of the low storage temperature and the solution concentration, the release to the atmosphere occurs through evaporation from a pool.   Using dispersion modeling (PHAST software), this results in an endpoint distance that reaches offsite receptors. This release assumes no mitigation other than containment in a dike.\n\n4.  Alternative Release Scenarios\nAlternative scenarios were developed for all of the RMP chemicals. The alternative scenario for phosgene has the largest potential impact distance of the group. In this scenario it is assumed a leak of 35% phosgene solution develops from the phosgene solution feed system, and is released into the diked area.  However, mitigation limits the release of phosgene to the atmosphere.  Mitigation in this case includes immediate activation of the steam ammonia curtain, and isolation of the line and neutralization of the solution in the dike within 20 minutes.  Under typical weather conditions as suggested in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance the distance to the endpoint reaches offsite receptors.\n\n5.  Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe New Martinsville Plant complies with all elements of the OSHA PSM Rule and the EPA RMP Rule.  There are safety procedures, standard operation emergency procedures, accident investigations, hot work and line opening permits, extensive training programs, on-site emergency response teams, vessel inspection programs, and experienced personnel both in the salaried and hourly"

Five Year Accident History\nThere have been no accidents in the past five years.  There have been no releases in the past five years with off-site consequences.  There has never been any offsite impact from the New Martinsville facility resulting from the release of chemicals listed in the rule. \n\n7.  Facility Emergency Response Program\nThe New Martinsville facility Emergency Response System consists of volunteer emergency response teams scheduled on each rotating shift.  There are 185 emergency response team members.  They receive 16 to 50 hours of on-site training annually with some disciplines receiving off-site training as well in specialized subjects, such as fire fighting, rescue, incident command and Hazmat.  An E-Team organization provides secondary support and is staffed by Technical and Managerial Personnel.  The E-Team's main function is to assist and advise the Emergency Response Teams and communicate with outside agencies.  The plant belongs to an industrial mutual aid group called NORIMAC (Northern Ohio River Industrial Mutual Aid Council) that provides mutual aid between the various industries, government agencies, and service organizations in the area.  Community warning sirens are placed in residential areas within 2 miles of the plant and have been in operation, as part of the CAER program, for more than twenty years."
