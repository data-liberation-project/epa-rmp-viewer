      "SummaryText": "O'Ryan Oil and Gas owns and operates the Big R Plant.  The Big R Plant is a newly constructed facility that will receive gas from an area oil and gas production facility flowline. The gas is processed in the plant with amine and nitrogen rejection units which separates the lighter hydrocarbons, including methane, ethane, propane, butane and pentane, forming a Natural Gas Liquid (NGL) product. The NGL product is stored in two pressurized bullet tanks with volumes of 45,000 gallons each and operating pressure of ~200 psi.\n\nA total rupture of the 45,000 gallon NGL tank resulting in a vapor cloud explosion would pose the worse-case scenario for the Big R Plant. The 45,000 gallon tank has been evaluated for total tank rupture using the RMP*Comp offsite consequence analysis resulting in a distance to endpoint of 0.5 miles. No public receptors are within a 0.5 mile radius of the NGL tank. The worst-case scenario would not affect anyone within the endpoint of the off-site consequence analysis. Therefore, this RMP has been evaluated for a Program 1 level RMP under 40 CFR 68. The Big R Plant is located in a remote area and is not normally occupied.\n\nSince the facility is newly constructed, there is no accident history to report. Should an emergency involving the Big R Plant NGL system occur, it is O'Ryan's policy to notify the Navarro County Sheriff's Office and request that they coordinate response to the emergency. This policy has been discussed with the Sheriff's Office.\n"
