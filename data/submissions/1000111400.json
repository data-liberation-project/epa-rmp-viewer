A copy of the ERM has been provided to the Local Emergency Planning Committee of Potter/Randal County. The ERM includes steps to take in case of an uncontrolled release of hazardous substance. The initial step would be to contact the Potter/Randall County Emergency Response system which in turn will contact other emergency response agencies to aid in controlling access to the facility by the public. \n\nPlanned changes to improve safety [40 CFR 68.155(f)]:\n\nScout Fain has several efforts in progress to improve safety and their prevention program. This includes a better system to track open action items that stem from PHAs, MOCs, and other prevention programs, as well as an RBI assessment for the Mechanical Integrity program. Scout has also just completed their 5-year PHA and are tracking and implementing the PHA\u0092s recommendations.\n\nScout Fain has completed this report to provide the public with information about our activities at this facility.  We believe that the many controls instituted to maintain a safe operation, and our commitment to continuous improvement that an incident affecting our employees or the surrounding area is unlikely to occur."

      "SummaryText": "The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source [40 CFR 68.155(a)]:\n\nThe Fain Gas plant under Scout Energy Partners (Scout Fain) is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that encompasses design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training. Robust engineering controls are in place to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. The Fain gas plant is a non-responding facility for releases of the RMP-listed chemicals, so the site utilizes an Emergency Action Plan.\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\n\nThe Fain Gas Plant consists of two natural gas processing plants operating in parallel. Processes involved include: gas conditioning through amine stripping, condensate stabilization, dehydration using TEG and molecular sieve technology, NGL extraction, Nitrogen rejection, and Helium recovery. Gas condensate is transported via pipeline. The natural gas liquids (NGL) are transported by pipeline from the facility. The Helium recovered is compressed and transported via pipeline to market. The remaining residue gas, mostly methane, is directed to pipeline for transport.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps [40 CFR 68.155(c)]:\n\nScout Fain is not required to implement the Program Level 3 prevention program requirements under the RMP regulations because they are eligible for RMP Program Level 1. However, Scout Fain is required to comply with the requirements for preventing or minimizing the consequences of catastrophic releases of flammable or explosive chemicals codified under the Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations (29 CFR 1910.119). The required elements of the PSM program relevant to general accidental release prevention are listed below:\n-\tEmployee Participation\n-\tProcess Safety Inform"
