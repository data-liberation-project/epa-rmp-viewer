The mixture is used as a propellant for aerosol paint cans.\r\nFinished goods are transferred to the warehouse for storage and distribution. Mixtures of propellant, flammable liquids, and paint solids are stored in 12- or 18-ounce cans. Approximately 240,000 pounds of propellant may be stored in the well protected warehouse at any one time.\r\nPropellant is a flammable and potentially explosive gas. The propellant is not inherently toxic.\r\n2.1\tPOTENTIAL RELEASE SCENARIO\r\n2.2\tWORST-CASE SCENARIO\r\nConsistent with the RMP rule requirements, a worst-case release from the largest single container was analyzed to assess the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint. This facility only stores 12- and 17- ounce cans of finished goods and has no associated process piping or vessels, therefore the worst-case and alternate-case release scenarios would be the same. The release scenarios analyzed and the endpoints evaluated are based on the guidance contained in the USEPAs off site Consequence Analysis Guidance.\r\n3.0\tACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nThere have been no accidental releases of propellant at the Rust-Oleum, Riverside, California warehouse in the last 5 years that have resulted in death, injury, or significant property damage on site; or off-site death, injury, property damage, evacuation, sheltering in place, or environmental damage.\r\n4.0\tPREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nAlthough a formal, documented prevention program is not required by the RMP rule for Program 1 processes, a number of design and operational controls are in place to decrease the severit"

The most significant controls are described below:\r\n\r\nThe warehouse is designed as an aerosol warehouse in accordance with the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA)   Manufacture and Storage of Aerosol Products code (NFPA 30B).\r\n\r\nAll electrical equipment meets the requirements of the National Electric Code (NFPA 70).\r\n5.0\tEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Rust-Oleum, Riverside facility has implemented a detailed written Emergency Response Plan (ERP). The ERP is intended to address all emergencies at the facility, including incidents related to a release of propellant.\r\n\r\nThe ERP includes coordination with the local fire department, and evacuation of personnel in the facility. The ERP identifies specific individuals and their responsibilities, and identifies procedures for emergency medical care."
