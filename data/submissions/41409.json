This guidance document used the SACRUNCH atmospheric dispersion model to construct lookup tables that relate the quantity and rate of ammonia released to the endpoint distance.\n\n2.1 WORST-CASE RELEASE\nThe worst-case release is considered to be defined (according to the RMP Rule) by the catastrophic rupture and complete loss of the maximum contents of the HP receiver (approximately 50,784 pounds of ammonia) over a 10-minute period.  Using the specified worst-case meteorology contained in the Model Plan, the distance to the endpoint for a worst-case release was estimated to be 13,834 feet or 2.62 miles.\n\nAlthough the worst-case consequence analysis is required by the RMP, it should be considered a highly unlikely event.  Design, construction, and operation of the HP receiver is such that worst-case failure is extremely remote.  The receiver was designed and constructed in accordance with the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (Section VIII), and was certified and stamped by the National Board of Pressure Vessel Inspectors (National Board).

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n1.0 SOURCE AND PROCESS DESCRIPTION\n1.1 SOURCE\nThe CSL Behring L.L.C., Bradley, Illinois, pharmaceutical manufacturing facility is subject to the United Stated Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) for Accidental Chemical Release regulation (40 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] 68) because it has a refrigeration system that contains more than the threshold quantity (10,000 pounds) of anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) (Chemical Abstract System [CAS] Number 7664-41-7).  Anhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas at ambient conditions.  The ammonia refrigeration system is used to control the processing and room temperature for plasma-derived and related products.  It is a closed system that contains approximately 85,000 pounds of ammonia in various physical states (gas, liquid, and saturated vapor).  The vessel that can contain the largest volume of ammonia is the high-pressure (HP) receiver. The vessel operates at approximately 150 to 180 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) and can contain as much as 50,784 pounds of liquid ammonia.  However, during typical operation, the vessel holds only about 10,000-15,000 pounds.  Most of the ammonia equipment is located indoors.  The HP receiver, condensing towers, some chillers, and most piping runs are located outdoors.\n\nAmmonia is the oldest and most common refrigerant in general industrial use throughout the world.  It is a high capacity refrigerant that operates at reasonable pressure.  At this facility, personnel exposure to more than a small leak is rare because ammonia operates within a closed system of vessels, piping, and equipment and its self-alarming properties allow for immediate detection and response.\n\n1.2 PROCESS DESCRIPTION\nCSL Behring's ammonia refrigeration system is a two-stage system consisting of a high pressure (HP) side and a low pressure side.  The Building No. 4 chillers operate on the low side (i.e., low pressure) to quickly chill alcohol or cool room air.  Ammonia"

      "SummaryText": "suction from the Building No. 4 equipment at about -10 psig passes through the low side accumulator before entering the low-back compressors.  Liquid ammonia in the low side suction is trapped in the low side accumulator and returned to the high side accumulator.  The booster compressor discharge is desuperheated in the high side accumulator before entering the high side compressors.\nThe high side compressor suction draws from the high side suction accumulator at about 20 psig.  This accumulator receives suction from various chiller units.  Excess ammonia liquid that collects in the high side accumulator is removed and returned to the system.\n\nThe major discharge from the high side compressors (hot gas), at 150 to 175 psig, is vented to 15 condensing towers.\n\nThe condensed liquid is returned to the HP receiver where it is fed to the low and high side equipment, including the chillers and room coolers.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is well protected by the existence of specific safety systems and hardware, including safety relief valves, engine room ventilation, and system safety interlocks.  Safety relief valves protect the HP receiver, compressor discharge, condensers, suction accumulators, oil pots, and pump-out system from the hazards associated with overpressure.  Safety interlocks include HP and high temperature alarms and cutouts for the compressors, as well as high level floats and sensors for vessels.\n2.0 POTENTIAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\nCSL Behring's refrigeration system is a totally closed system.  Historically, releases of ammonia from industrial refrigeration systems most often occur from leaking valves, malfunctioning pressure relief devices, or inadvertent releases during repair activities.  While these incidents can impact employees, this facility has never experienced a release of a reportable quantity that represented an off-site impact (i.e., beyond the property line).\n\nConsistent with the RMP rule requirements, two specifically defined release scen"

      "SummaryText": "the system.\n\n\nThere are only two potential causes for a worst-case scenario involving an HP receiver:  (1) the internal pressure increases uncontrollably and ruptures the vessel from the inside; or (2) rupture of the vessel wall occurs due to inadvertent contact (e.g., vehicular) from the outside.\n\nThe vessel at CSL Behring is operated well below the design pressure (i.e., maximum allowable working pressure) of 250 psig and because of the safety factors built into the ASME Code, a fourfold pressure excursion, to approximately 1,000 psig, would have to occur before a worst-case vessel failure.  Such pressures could not be generated internally.  The only logical external cause of high pressure would be flame impingement or surface heat from a high challenge fire adjacent to the vessels.  If this were to occur, the vessel is equipped with safety relief valves (SRVs) set to relieve internal pressure at 250 psig.  A high pressure excursion would not occur as long as the SRVs continued to function.  Actuation of the SRVs would result in an ammonia release similar to that described in Section 2.2 for the alternative-release scenario.  The SRVs are on a 5-year replacement schedule, in compliance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidance contained in IIAR Bulletin Number 109, Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safe Ammonia Refrigeration System, in an effort to ensure that they will function properly when required.\n\nFurthermore, inadvertent vehicular contact with the vessel is unlikely since the unit is protected with substantial barrier protection designed to preclude this occurrence.  (The vessel is located beneath the evaporative condensers.)\n \nThe worst-case release scenario is unlikely for the following additional reasons:\n\n\u00c2\u00b7 The worst-case weather conditions which were used for this scenario are uncommon;\n \n\u00c2\u00b7 Typically, the receiver contains only 10,000-15,000 pounds of ammonia;\n \n\u00c2\u00b7 Industry standards were followed for the manufacture and q"

This release is representative of a small pipe or vessel leak.  Because the HP receiver and some piping are located outdoors, passive (building) mitigation was not used to reduce the release rate or the distance to the endpoint.  Active mitigation was considered, because it is believed that emergency responders could identify and stop the leak in less than 60 minutes.  However, a rapid response does not change the TEP distance obtained from the Model Plan.\n \n Using the specified meteorology contained in the Model Plan, the distance to the endpoint for the more likely release scenario was estimated to be 450 feet or 0.1 miles.\n \n As with the worst-case scenario, the alternative-release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n \n\u00c2\u00b7 Industrial standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of these lines;\n \n\u00c2\u00b7 Ammonia is not corrosive in this service;\n \u00c2\u00b7 The fact that most of the lines are elevated minimizes potential damage from fork lifts;\n \n\u00c2\u00b7 T"
