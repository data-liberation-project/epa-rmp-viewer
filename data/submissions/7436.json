The facility functions as a storage for the fertilizer used by Farmlands 600,000 producer-members to grow the crops which provide high-quality, low-cost food for families around the world.\n\nFacility snapshot\n\nAnnual volume of 30,000 tons of anhydrous ammonia is put through the Farmland facility that has been supplying co-ops in southern Minnesota and northern counties in Iowa for 26 years.  As a storage facility, the Vernon Center facility provides a vital link in the chain of Farmland inputs.  Anhydrous ammonia, produced at Farmlands nitrogen manufacturing facility in Enid, OK, is shipped to the Vernon Center facility by pipeline where it is stored until needed by local co-ops for their patrons fields.  By eliminating much of the shipping costs for the co-ops the terminal helps contain the cost of fertilizer for Farmland member-owners as well as provide a convenient location for them to get their product.\n\nImpact on the community\n\nWith an annual budget of over $400,000, Farmland provides a considerable economic benefit to the Vernon Center community.  Farmland is committed to customer service and the facility is available to service member-owners as needed throughout the year.  \n\nEmployee snapshot\n\nFarmland contracts the operation of this facility to the MAPCO Ammonia Pipeline Inc. The contractors's 3 full time employees provide years of experienced service to the area cooperatives.  Major maintenance projects for this facility are performed by Farmland maintenance personnel.  These Farmland employees are trained in all aspects of terminal maintenance including electrical and mechanical troubleshooting.  \n\nPollution Prevention Policy\n\nFarmland Industries Inc., is committed to protecting the environment and preserving o"

Consistant with Farmlands Policy, the contract employees of this facility are committed to the prevention of accidental releases.  Accidental release prevention is critical to the safe operation of this terminal, the safety of its employees and the community.\n\nTo achieve its accident and accidental release prevention goals, Farmland is committed to the following:\n\n7 A knowledgeable, motivated and highly trained contract employee group\n7 A well-designed facility that is maintained and operated in a superior manner\n7 Implementation of a Comprehensive Process Safety Management and Prevention Program\n7 Continual review and improvements that enhance safety and accident prevention\n7 Excellence in safety programs and practices, and a superior safety and accident record\n7 Planning, preparation and training for emergency response\n\nThe Vernon Center facilityl has had a written Emergency Response Plan in effect for many years as required by the RMP and other EPA and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) rules.

The impact of these potential releases must be quantified in accordance with release criteria dictated in the rule.  The projected impact distance is determined using EPA defined atmospheric conditions and is intended to provide a conservative estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected.  According to the EPA, the worst-case scenario is intended to ensure that no potential risks to public health are overlooked, but the distance to an endpoint estimated under worst-case should not be considered a \"public danger zone\".  Possible causes or the extreme improbability that such releases may occur are not considered.\n\nThe alternative release scenario definition is a release that is more likely to occur than the worst-case release; however, as with the worst-case, the alternative release improbability is not taken into consideration.\n\nWorst Case Toxic Release - Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nAmmonia is a colorless gas with a strong pungent odor, and is one of the most widely used in"

A large amount of industrial ammonia is reacted with carbon dioxide to make urea fertilizer, or reacted to make ammonium nitrate fertilizer.  Ammonia is also frequently used as a refrigerant for the storage of perishable foods.\n\nAmmonia vapors can be irritating to the nose, throat, eyes and skin.  Direct liquid contact to the skin can cause severe burns.\n\nFarmland has considered potential worst-case releases from the refrigerated atmospheric storage tank which is passively mitigated by a secondary containment dike.\n\nFarmlands hypothetical worst-case scenario involves an anhydrous ammonia release from the terminals 28,000 ton atmospheric storage tank.  As required by the rule, the worst case release assumes that this entire quantity is released  as a result of a catastrophic failure of the tank and subsequently evaporates from the diked pool.  This unlikely event was modeled with a publicly available model (DEGADIS) and the resulting end point distance is expected to be conservative.  The impact of this release scenario is predicted to extend beyond the facility boundary and impact public receptors.\n\nWe believe this scenario is a hypothetical worst-case event dictated by the rule and extremely unlikely to occur for many reasons.  In addition to the stringent design controls for this type of storage vessel, facility maintenance and inspection programs address the integrity of process and storage vessels, including this one, and largely preclude such massive and unlikely failures.\n\nAlternative Case Toxic Release - Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nMore likely release events than the hypothetical worst-case tend to concentrate in areas where the ammonia product is handled, such as loading, refrigeration area and other transport activities.  Generally, significantly lower quantities are involved due to numerous shutdown "

The valve is assumed to fail and release ammonia for 1 minute before employee intervention stops the release.  The impact of such a release was modeled with a publicly available model (DEGADIS) which shows that the impact of the release would extend off-site under typical ambient conditions.\n\nPlanned Changes for Safety Improvements\n\nSafety improvements are a continual and ongoing process at the facility which is facilitated by the Prevention Program/Process Safety Management Program.  Formal process hazard analysis is conducted at least every five years, but review is constant through management of change procedures, operator training, incident investigation and mechanical integrity programs.  As a result, changes relevant to safety occur continuously as needs are identified through these procedures and policies."
