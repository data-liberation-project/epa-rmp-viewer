Administrative and Engineering Controls in place to mitigate or reduce the possibility of an accidental release of ammonia.The PSM program is currently under revision/update.\n\n* Electronic ammonia detection located in each machine room bay for a total of three (3) sensors.\n*  Detection system activates a central audible alarm system throughout the facility to alert personnel that a potential emergency exists.\n*  Machine room detection activates exhaust fans to vent room as soon as possible. Exhaust fans blow out of room away from personnel to eliminate potential exposure during venting.  Louvers also open on south wall of machine room to provide cross flow during the ventilation sequence.\n*  High and low level switches are installed on all pressure vessels (excluding oil pots) to alert refrigeration personnel of any deviations from normal operating conditions within that particular vessel, or the refrigeration system as a whole. \n*  Safety relief valves are configured to all pressure vessels, condensers and oil separators to eliminate possible over pressurization conditions within those associated pieces of equipment and throughout the system.\n*  Refrigeration operators make rounds every four (4) hours and log equipment status to track system performance.  \n*  Production operates 6:00 am - 12:00 pm, with fire watch/security trained personnel on duty to cover the off shift hours as well as  holidays.  During off shift hours a refrigeration tech is on call for securtiy to notify in case of an emergency.\n*  Periodic maintenance program is in place to ensure the entire refrigeration system is maintained in optimum operational and mechanical condition at all times.",
