      "SummaryText": "A.  The Shamokin-Coal Township Joint Sewer Authority Chlorination Station has been installed to disinfect the (Authority treated wastewater) flow discharged from the Authority as treatment facility.  The chlorination station is located along the Shamokin Creek within the facility, fenced area.  The station includes a chlorination room, which contains liquid chlorine containers, a chlorinator, and various safety equipment, and a utility water pump room.  The amount of chlorine handled is two one-ton containers.  Addiitional one-ton cylinders are stored in reserve.  The facility is normally unmanned.  Wastewater treatment operators visit the facility daily and respond to any trouble alarms which may occur.\n \nB. The off-site consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified as \"worst-case release\" and \"alternative scenario\".  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the...maximum quantity in the largest vesselA?is released as a gas over 10 minutes,\" due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenerio is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario\".  \nAtmospheric dispersion modeling has to be performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to the \"toxic endpoint\" selected by EPA of 3 ppm, which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Associateion (AIHA) as the \"maximum airbourne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\"  The residential populationwithin a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance has to be defined, \"to estimate the population potentially affected\".  \n\nTh"

      "SummaryText": "e worst case release scenario at the Authority's Chlorination Station involves a failure of the two ton containers which could be connected concurrently (a total of 4,000 lb. of chlorine).  The off-site consequence analysis for this scenario was performed for two sets of conditions.  The first set followed conditions pre-defined by EPA, namely release of the entire amount as a gas in 10 minutes, use of the 1-hour average ERPG-2 as the toxic endpoint, and consideration of the population residing within a full circle with radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance.  EPA set these conditions to facilitate the performance of the off-site consequences analysis; however the assumptions used may be unrealistic because:\n\n1.  Only about 26% of the compressed liquefied chlorine released to the atmosphere flashes as a vapor.  The remaining unflashed liquid forms liquid-droplet aerosols.  This results in the formation of a very dense chlorine cloud consisting of vapor and liquid droplets. \n2. Only the population within an elliptical plumm extending downwind of the relase point is potentially affected. This plum area, or footprint, is approx. 6% (1/20) of the area of the full circle.  \n3. However, the actual lowest mean wind speed is 6.0 mph in August, based upon Williamsport NWS data.  (See p.1 of the Hazardous Material Off-Site Response Plan, 6/1997). Therefore, the actual condition is not 1.5 meters per second as described by the EPA Worst-Case Scenario information, but rather is approx. 3.0 meters per second.  \n4. The topography of the geographic area to the South, SW and SE of the chlorination sta. rises 820-840 ft. above the ground elevation at the SCTJSA facility and effectively blocks the dense chlorine gas.  \nThe topography of the geographic area to the NE, in the direction into which a chlorine cloud would most probably be directed by the prevailing winds, is less severe, with various rises of 100-280 ft. above the chlorination station group surface for a dist"

Beyond this distance, the topography again becomes more tortuous, with elevations rising to 520-580 ft. above surface elevations at the chlorination station.  This topographic condition would again function as a barrier to a dense chlorine cloud.  \n\nEPA mandated meterological conditions, namely Stability F, wind speed of 1.5m/sec., highest daily max. temperature (116F), and average humidity (65%) were used for both sets.  \nWhen atmospheric dispersion modeling for the worst-case scenario was performed using the EPA assumptions, a distance to toxic endpoint of 5.4 mi. and an estimate of residential population potentially affected of 25,200 was obtained.  When the same modeling was performed with the second set of conditions, namely using the actual low mean wind speed of 3.0 meters per second, and consideration of the plume footprint only, a distance of toxic endpoint of 2.0 miles and an estimate of population potentially affected 1,200 resulted.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the failure of a single one tone container containing 2,000 pounds of chlorine.  The amount of chlorine rleased is 2,000 lbs. at an average rate over 10 minutes, the relase would be inside a structure, and would therefore be mitigated by the regulatory factor of .55.  The actual release would be 110 lbs. per minute.  Using the actual weather conditions, which is 3.0 meters per second low annual mean speed in August, the estimated distance traveled to the toxic endpoint is 1.2 miles.\n\nD. The general Authority accidental release prevention program includes:  Operators trained to perform cylinder convections and cylinder handling; maintenance and replacement of cylinder appurtenances; daily inspection of Chlorination building; availiability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA); and audible and visible alarmsystem in place.\n\nE. There have been no accidental releases of chlorine at the Authority's facility in the past five (5) years.\n\nF. The"
