It is the responsibility of each facility's management to ensure that all corporate and regulatory laws, rules, policies, and/or procedures are followed.  It is the responsibility of each employee to adhere to these laws, etc. and to conduct themselves in a safe manner when performing their tasks.\r\n\r\nThe NPX ONE Corporation has embraced and is committed to safety and environmental excellence. The corporation has an established Process Safety Management (PSM) program at the Reading, PA location that manages the pentane system. Audits are performed on each facility to ensure that the program is being adhered to and facility management is responsible to correct any recommended deficiencies of an audit.\r\n\r\nThe facility has a safety operations program that supports worker and public health, safety, fire security and environmental issues.  The facility has written and published an \"Emergency Operations Manual (EOM)\" to provide guidance and procedures to follow in an emergency situation for in-house emergency commanders, management staff, and workers.  The manual's format is a \"what if\" type book that covers all emergencies that are perceived to be able to happen to the facility from security emergencies to chemical spills or leaks.  The facility has also organized, trained, and equipped an in-house Emergency Response Team covering all shifts and trained/equipped to OSHA 1910.156 regulations for an interior/exterior fire brigade.\r\n\r\nPreplans are a part of the EOM and the brigade trains on the plans.  The plans are reviewed annually and the brigade trains quarterly for fire suppression/prevention, annually for Confined Space/High Angle Rescue, annually for Hazardous Materials Technician Review (OSHA 1910.120), annually (each shift) for total plant evacuation, and annually for first aid to the ERT American Red Cross level.\r\n\r\nThe NPX ONE Rea"

The containers are used primarily as red meat packaging trays, poultry trays, and market ready type containers.  During the initial process, known as extrusion, the pellets are heated under pressure along with colorants and blowing agents in an extruder machine and then discharged as foam around a die and over a mandrel that cools and slices the foam into sheets.  The sheet is rolled on a winder and set to age.  After aging is complete, the roll of sheet is thermoformed by heating the sheet and molding the parts, which are cut out of the sheet and packed for customers.\r\n\r\nC)  OVERVIEW OF BLOWING AGENT\r\n\r\nOne of the blowing agents in foam manufacturing is n-Pentane, which is injected into the extruder barrel at high pressure and at low volume to assist in creating \"cells\" in the liquified plastic to manufacture foam.  The n-Pentane is pumped through a continuous loop system at relatively low pressure and returned to its underground pump storage tank.  Each extruder machine uses n-Pentane as required, on demand.  In addition to the pump storage tank, there is an additional underground storage tank that is a static (no pumps) tank and is interconnected (piped) to each other.  The n-Pentane is transferred from the static tank to the pump tank via a siphon pipeline.  Each tank holds 19,800 gallons and can only be filled to 90% due to safety interlocks installed in the filling system.  The receiving area, filling system, and tank storage are enclosed by a 10 foot high chain link fence which is inside the f"

All gates are locked.\r\n\r\nN-Pentane is delivered to the facility by truck tankers that hold up to 9,000 gallons or 47,250 lbs. and is unloaded, by gravity, through a modern tank filling system that includes a diked capture system equal to the capacity of the tanker.  A static grounding system is interlocked with the unloading air valve that stops the unloading action if the ground connection is interrupted.  The capture vault, tanker, unloading station, and the immediate area are protected by an AFFF firefighting foam fixed system that can discharge 2,300 gallons of foam per minute. In the past, n-Pentane has been received by a rail tanker car of 30,000 gallons or 157,500 lbs. capacity.  The unloading method is essentially the same as for truck tankers. NPX ONE is currently unable to receive a rail tanker car due to the loss of three fixed foam stanchions from a sinkhole collapse that was repaired. The remaining stanchions provide adequate coverage for truck tanker unloads.\r\n\r\nD)  WORST CASE SCENARIO\r\n\r\nThe worst case scenario assumes a flammable hydrocarbon vapor cloud detonation from a boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion (BLEVE) of 39,800 gallons or 208,000 lb. of n-Pentane from both underground storage tanks. RMP*(Comp A\u00bf  calculations for this volume of pentane. )\r\n\r\nThe likelihood of an actual BLEVE of the two UST tanks is unlikely due to the multilayered safety devices that have been installed at the unloading rack area. In addition to passive safety devices, there are safe unloading procedures based on training programs that must be followed for safety management of the product.\r\n\r\nE)  ALTERNATE WORST CASE SCENARIO\r\n\r\nThe more likely incident is a ruptured unloading hose from a highway tanker truck.  As an alternate scenario, the ruptured hose from a \"pull away\" accident or a horizontal split of the hose casing (due to wear or accidental damage) would cause a pool, which could ignite creatin"

Pentane is only unloaded during daylight hours during the routine business week.  During this time period, the facility Emergency Response Team is populated and equipped to respond to an emergency involving pentane.  Flammable liquid firefighting and Hazardous Material Incident Management and Mitigation is part of the ongoing training of this team.\r\n\r\nF)  FIVE YEAR HISTORY\r\n\r\nThis facility has not had an accident in the past five years.\r\n\r\nG)  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe NPX ONE Reading facility believes in the prevention of a spill release and has installed an unloading facility to assist in accomplishing this goal along with a selected group of \"A\" level Mechanics who are specially trained per the pentane unloading procedure to offload these tankers.  NPX ONE does believe, however, that the unexpected can happen and therefore has taken several preventative steps to suppress/mitigate a fire and/or spill should it occur, regardless of the unlikelihood of the possibility.  To insure the immediate suppression of a fire that could impact the tanker vessel, an A.F.F.F. firefighting foam system is installed over, under, and around the tanker truck or car and is heat activated.  The facility has a well-trained and motivated in-house response team and members of the team occupy the facility on a continuous basis, 7 days a week, 52 weeks per year.  The team trains on the process of flammable liquid firefighting and flammable gas firefighting.\r\n\r\nThe team has several documents that guide its actions during the emergencies that would involve pentane.
