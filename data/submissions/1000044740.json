The liquid is circulated as needed to the evaporators where heat is absorbed and removed from the medium.  The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system is a closed loop industrial refrigeration system.  The ammonia is not used or mixed in any manner with other chemical processes.\r\n\r\nA Worst-Case Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis and an Alternative Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis were performed identifying the public and environmental receptors within the toxic endpoint concentration radius of 200 ppm.  The results are mitigated by the fact that most of the refrigeration equipment is inside the Suffolk, Virginia facility's building. \r\n\r\nJMS Foodservice, LLC has a detailed Emergency Action Plan (EAP) for their facility.  The purpose of this plan is to provide the means for rapidly determining the appropriate response for any emergency that may develop at the facility such as an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  JMS Foodservice, LLC conducts scheduled drills of the emergency action plan.\r\n\r\n \r\nTo address the five year accident history is not an issue, since the facility for the past 5 years has no history of reportable ammonia releases.  To prevent and/or minimize any potential future release of anhydrous ammonia, JMS Foodservice, LLC has implemented a detailed Process Safety Management program (Preventative Program 3) developed for their facility in Suffolk, Virginia.  The Preventative Program 3 provides extensive maintenance and operator/mechanic training to ensure that the system's mechanical integrity is maintained for the life of the covered process.  Program 3 also incorporates administrative controls when modifications are made to the covered process (ammonia refrigeration system), so that the training and preventative programs are updated as the system expands and changes.\r\n\r\nJMS Foodservice, LLC has and will incorporate or address a"

A recent change was the replacement of the system's evaporative condenser in 2013 for corrosion concerns, thus assuring an extended safe operating life for this system."
