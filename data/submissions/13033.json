We invest significant resources in accident prevention, such as, considering safety in design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our facilities.  We implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  However, if a release should occur, personnel are trained to mitigate the release and evacuate the facility if necessary.  Additionally, we have reviewed our facility with local emergency responders to familiarize them with our site and on how to respond to emergencies at our location. \n\nThe Echo Springs plant is a Program Level 1 and has no reportable releases in the 5-year accident history records that resulted in onsite or offsite consequences.  Furthermore, ESP does not process, produce, or use any of the regulated \"Toxic\" substances above the threshold quantities.  There are no environmental or public receptors within the flammable, vapor-cloud explosion, for the worst-case scenario at a 1-psi endpoint of 0.5 miles.   \n\n2.0 Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\nThe Echo Springs Plant, located near Wamsutter, Wyoming, processes natural gas to produce NGL and pipeline quality residue gas. This is accomplished through a cryogenic process. \n\nThe maximum amount of regulated substances that can be onsite are:\n\n              Natural gas:              80,000 pounds\n              NGL:                        640,000 pounds\n\n3.0 Offsite Consequence Analysis Results: \n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS), associated with a release of a flammable substance from the processing plant, is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank containing NGL (TXP-1 Product Storage Tanks).

The endpoint was determined by application of the EPA's OCAG methodology. \n\nThere are no Program Levels 2 or 3 at the Echo Springs facility and therefore, no alternative release scenarios were considered. \n\n\n4.0 GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThis facility complies with all the prevention program parts of a Level 1 Risk Management Program facility. In addition, Echo Springs Gas Plant complies with all 14 points of OSHA's Process Safety Management program. In complying with both the letter and the spirit of both of these programs, Echo Springs Plant was designed, built, operated, and maintained in accordance with appropriate industry codes and standards. \n\nOf particular note in the Accident Prevention Program is:\n\n 1. PHA's and Incident Investigations are performed as needed or required by plant personnel.\n\n 2. Safety Audits are performed by all personnel.\n\n\n5.0 FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe Echo Spring's facilities have an excellent record of accident prevention over the past 5 years.  Over the last 5 years there has not been any significant releases involving a regulated substance that has resulted in significant on-site or off-site effects.\n\n6.0 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\nThe Echo Spring's facilities maintain a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect workers and public safety, as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of fire or explosion.  The procedures address aspects of emergency response, including first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans, and accounting for personnel after an evacuation and notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs. The processing facilities also have procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment.  Employee"

The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modification made to the facility process.  The emergency response program is administered by the regional safety administrators.  When changes are made to the program, employees are informed and trained on the changes.\n\nThe overall emergency response program of the Echo Spring's facilities is coordinated with the local fire department and the Carbon County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meeting with the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Echo Spring's personnel have communications capability with the appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g. fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. Echo Springs plant personnel conduct an annual review of the facility and process/regulated substance hazards with local emergency responders. \n\n\n\n7.0 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nThe Echo Spring's personnel resolve all findings from PHAs, some of which may result in modifications to the process.  The following types of changes are planned in response to the results of PHA, safety audit, and incident investigation findings:\n 1. Add ESD/ Siren hand station at front gate.\n 2. Smoke detection in MCC building.\n 3. Improve Emergency Shutdown system by modification of the yard valves."
