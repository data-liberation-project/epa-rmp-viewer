Over a 10-minute period under meteorological conditions of Class D stability and 3 m/s wind speed, eq. 7 of the aforementioned guidance yields a distance of 0.24 miles to the toxic end point.\n\nPart V   Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nCertco uses the OSHA PSM CFR 29 1910.119 standard procedures to prevent accidental releases of ammonia.  Written safe operating procedures and a maintenance and inspection checklist are used daily by our ammonia refrigeration trained staff of three people.  The maintenance manager is a former board member and president of the local refrigeration engineers and technicians association (RETA) and has received 24-hr emergency training and continues to receive annual refresher training.  Two other ammonia maintenance personnel have 24-hr emergency training and continue to receive annual refresher training as well.\n\nPart VI   5 Year Accidental Release History\n\nDuring the past 5 years, there have been no releases from this facility.\n\nPart VII   Emergency Repsonse Program\n\nCertco's emergency response starts with employee training on what to do incase of a release.  We have a written off-site plan coordinated with Dane County local emergency planning committee (LEPC) that is reviewed jointly on an annual basis.  We also work closely with the Fitchburg Fire Department in conducting fire department personnel walk-through familiarization tours.  We conduct periodical drills with the assistance of the fire department.  There is also a list of names and phone numbers on who to contact in case of an ammonia spill that is posted throughout the plant.\n\nPart VIII   Planned Changes\n\nCurrent plans for changes include continued training for main"

These programs help our facility to prevent the release of ammonia, which is our only chemical with potential for release to the atmosphere in the local community, as well as fires or other natural disasters.  Overall these programs help prevent accidents, injuries, and avoid physical property damage.\n\nOur safety program is applied to the ammonia refrigeration system to promote safe operation and help prevent accidental releases as well as all other aspects of our business operations including fork lift operator safety training, fire safety training and other generally accepted safety prodedures applicable to food storage warehouses.\n\nOur operator/maintenance personnel receive specialized training in safe operating procedures for ammonia refrigeration and they have a combined total experience operating this system in excess of 102 years.\n\nAdditionally, we have an emergency off-site plan filed with the Dane County emergency planning commission, which is reviewed with them annually, and we work closely with the Fitchburg Fire Department on site to keep fire department personnel current and familiar with our operations.\n\nWe maintain special ammonia safety equipment at the facility and we also have an electronic ammonia leak detector system that is continuously monitored by our security contractor.\n\nThese policies and procedures help prevent accidents and protect our plant, our workers, and the public in our community.\n\nPart II   Facility Description & Chemical Process\n\nCertco Inc. is a wholesale grocery warehouse with a total area under roof of 392,612 Sq.

Ft. of freezer space that is refrigerated by a central ammonia refrigeration system that was designed and constructed by nationally recognized ammonia refrigeration engineers and contractors.  This refrigeration process is located in the Southwest corner of the facility.  It is comprised of five vessels, six low stage compressors, six high stage compressors, and six liquid pumps, which are housed in the engine room on the second floor.  There are six evaporators located in the cooler, six evaporators located in the freezer rooms and six evaporators located in three penthouses on the roof.  There are four evap-condensors also located on the roof.  There are a variety of insulated pipes connecting all of the aforementioned components of this system.\n\nAll of the products stored in the cooler and freezers are consumer packaged general refrigerated and frozen foods.  A Manning Model 20 Analgas ammonia leak detector with audible alarm protects the entire ammonia refrigeration process area.  This alarm is continuously monitored by ADT Security Systems, who will notify one of three people on a call list of a leak, who will be responsbile for taking corrective actions.\n\nPart III   Worst Case Release Scenario\n\nFailure of the condenser return line to the high pressure receiver with a capacity of 3840 Lbs. Limited to 50% or 1920 Lbs by engineering operating design plus 4000 Lbs. From compessor discharge limited by total high stage compressor resulting in a ten minute release under worst case weather conditions (type F stability) per model RMP table 4-2 ammonia would travel (1.4 miles) to its toxic end point.\n\nThis scenario is unlikely because that type of weather is uncommon.
