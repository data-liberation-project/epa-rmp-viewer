This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the propane system. The facility policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent the foreseeable release of regulated substances. \r\nEmployees and contractors at the Rolls-Royce Test Cell facility are subject to an up-to-date training program. The program includes on the job hands-on training. Competency is assessed through oral tests, demonstration, and observation. \r\nIn accordance with state and federal guidelines, the Rolls-Royce Test Cell facility must perform a Process Hazard Analysis every five (5) years (last performed on January 19, 2018) and a Compliance Audit every three (3) years. From these evaluations, preventative and mitigative measures were identified at the facility. These include, but are not limited to: Vents, Relief Valves, Check Valves, Manual Shutoffs, Automatic Shutoffs, Alarms and Procedures, Backup Pump and Grounding Equipment.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\r\nThe primary activity at the facility is industrial engine testing. The largest vessel storing propane in the system is the Propane Storage Tank. The total inventory of the flammable propane mixture at the facility is 125,100 lbs., reported as 130,000 lbs., which classifies the process as a CalARP Program 3 process, which is regulated by Cal/OHSA and OSHA PSM regulations as well. Propane is considered hazardous because it is explosive and exposure to this substance can cause skin burns, frostbite and asphyxiation.\r\nThe facility uses process area monitors to detect and identify if propane is present. If an individual has been exposed to propane the following guidelines corresponding to the type of exposure should be followed:\r\n\u00bfInhalation - Remove person to fresh air."

Obtain prompt medical attention immediately.\r\n\u00bfIngestion - Ingestion of propane is not a likely route of industrial exposure.\r\n\u00bfSkin contact - Immediately remove all contaminated clothing. Rinse skin with lukewarm water and shower if necessary. Call a poison center or physician immediately.\r\n\u00bfEye contact - Rinse cautiously with water for several minutes. Remove contact lenses if present and continue rinsing. Call a poison center or physician immediately.\r\n\u00bfLeak/Gas fire - Do not extinguish unless leak can be stopped safely. Eliminate all ignition sources if safe to do so. \r\nTo reduce the chance of exposure, fire or explosion, or reduce the impact if an exposure happens the facility has installed a sprinkler system and deluge system in the test cell as mitigation measures.\r\n\r\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\r\nScenario Description: Per the CalARP Regulations, one worst-case release scenario has been defined for the propane system. The worst-case release scenario demonstrated the outcome of the Propane Storage Tank losing its entire inventory of propane (125,100 lbs.), which resulted in a radius of concern of 0.4 miles in which the propane reaches a distance to the overpressure endpoint of 1 pound per square inch (psi). This release has the potential to reach 0 housing units and 0 people based on 2010 U.S Census data. Additional details can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation. \r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary\r\nScenario Description: Per the CalARP Regulations, one alternative release scenario has been defined for the propane system. The alternative release scenario was determined by evaluating the most likely scenario that could result in a significant hazard. For this facility, the alternative release scenario involves the puncture of the outside of the Propane Storage Tank by an external projectile, resulting in a hole with a 1 inc"

The Emergency Action Plan details policies and procedures in the event of a dangerous situation such as: fire, earthquake, chemical hazards/propane leak, and terrorists' threats. A detailed Emergency Action Plan can be found in the program binder which specifies emergency numbers, evacuation procedures, emergency exits, and specific responses to individual hazards.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nThe PHA study has been conducted to examine mitigation measures to improve safety at the facility.
