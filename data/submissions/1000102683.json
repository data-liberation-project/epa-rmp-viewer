The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including management of the process involved in the release, adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas. The plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response. \n\nTo ensure preparedness, quarterly emergency drills are conducted to enhance skills and tactics for responding to an accidental chemical release. Critiques are held on drills and actual events. \nEmergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  The site maintains an on-site team of HAZMAT-trained responders and fire brigade members, each equipped with the necessary tools and equipment to respond to on-site emergencies.   \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY/Process Safety\n\nThe Carrollton site maintains a strong commitment to continually looking for new ways to improve safety performance.  Since the 2017 RMP submittal, several initiatives have been implemented or expanded with the goal of improving process safety: increased use of pre-task hazard analysis methodology, more extensive process hazard analysis, implementation of a Behavior Based Performance (BBP) program, improved Procedure Use Policy, and strengthening of the mechanical integrity program. \n\nIntegration into the Dow Chemical Company has helped to further reinforce the emphasis on strong process safety programs and management systems.  The following initiatives are being implemented to strengthen and improve process safety performance: \n\n\u2022\tImplementation of Dow's Layers of Protection Analysis (LOPA) tool.  This tool identifies events and scenarios that can lead to undesired consequences.  Analysis of available independent layers of protection is performed.  If the available layers of protection are deemed insufficien"

These investigations are undertaken to identify the root cause of the event as well as any other key learning opportunities.  This results in the generation of a corrective action plan to address the key findings and prevent a reoccurrence.  The results are also communicated to impacted parties.  \n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Carrollton site believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. Site employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues, report issues and opportunities in a timely manner and to recommend improvements to processes, procedures, workflows, and other tools.  Our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analysis.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Carrollton site utilizes contractors to perform routine and specialized maintenance, construction, and general infrastructure maintenance.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is performed as part of a comprehensive contractor qualification process. \n\nThe Carrollton site has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's scope of work.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe emergency response program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Detailed emergency response plans have been developed.  These are coordinated with local emergency response resources and verified with the Carroll County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\nThe Carrollton site maintains a written emergency response plan to deal with acc"

Mechanical integrity inspections may also occur as a result of any questionable findings found during routine work.   A member of the Mechanical Integrity Department conducts all testing and inspection while assisted by the Reliability Department for engineering support.  Monthly Plant Assessment Team meetings are conducted to discuss PM\u2019s with operations, reliability and integrity teams.  \n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe Carrollton site utilizes a formal management of change (MOC) process for all modifications to process equipment, procedures, raw materials, and processing conditions.  Like-for-like changes are exempt.  Approval of the proposed change by a list of subject-matter-experts is required prior to the change(s) being implemented.  \n\nPrior to implementation and/or commissioning, process operators and any other personnel impacted by the respective change are made aware of the change and are trained as required to accommodate the modification.  \n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at the Carrollton site. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction is complete, equipment is sufficiently prepared and operating and maintenance procedures are prepared for safe startup.  Area and site leadership has the responsibility of providing final startup approvals.  \n\nCompliance Audits\n\nInternal audits are carried out at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.  Self-assessments are periodically conducted to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are effectively in practice.   \n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Carrollton site promptly conducts a root-cause investigation of any incident that has resulted in o"

Key elements include:\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified, evaluated, and controlled.  The tools used to carry out these analyses include:  Reactive Chem/Process Hazard Analysis (checklist assessment) using What If checklists, internal audits, reactive chemistry evaluations, and Layers of Protection Analyses (LOPA).  The studies are completed by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in process operations and engineering/support.  These studies are revalidated at regular intervals. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting operations within our covered processes, the Carrollton site maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround. The information is annually certified and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\n\nThe facility has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided on a continuing basis.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Carrollton site maintains a mechanical integrity program that includes a documented preventative maintenance (PM) and GMISS (Global Mechanical Integrity Safety Standard) inspection program for a variety of process components.

A majority (by mass) of these monomers are intermediates that are consumed on-site (via reaction with water) to produce siloxane materials that are the building-blocks for finished silicone products.  Other monomers are shipped via rail tank car or tank truck to other Dow Silicones facilities or directly to external customers for use in a variety of products.  RMP-listed substances are required as raw materials to produce these chlorosilane monomers.  I-pentane and n-pentane are generated by side-reactions that occur during the production of chlorosilane monomers.    \n\nThe 2022 RMP submittal includes five (5) process units, these are the same process units that were included in the 2017 submittal.  Two of the five process units include a combination of non-organic chemical production, storage, and loading/unloading facilities while the remainder are transportation/rolling-stock related.  \n\nSince the 2017 submittal, there have been no additional facilities that process and/or store RMP listed substances.  The 2022 RMP submittal reflects current Carrollton site operation.  It includes evaluation of the inventory of process equipment, interconnecting piping and intermediate and product storage \u2013 and the composition of those respective inventories.      \n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Dow Silicones Carrollton Site has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.
