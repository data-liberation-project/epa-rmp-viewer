(El Paso Field Services) Anse La Butte Terminal has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of facility?s processes.  The El Paso Field Services? policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nEl Paso Field Services owns and operates the Anse La Butte Terminal located in St. Martin Parish, Louisiana.  The Anse La Butte Terminal serves as a storage facility for natural gas liquids and natural gas liquid products.  Propane, n-butane, isobutane, and refinery grade butane are received by tank trucks and pipeline, and are stored in underground salt dome caverns and delivered as and when required by tank trucks and pipelines.\n\nThe Anse La Butte Terminal was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Based on process knowledge, El Paso Field Services identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site.  Listed flammable substances which are stored above threshold quantities at the Anse La Butte Terminal are propane, isobutane, n-butane,refinery grade butane, and the flare composite.   Based on worst case analysis, the distance to the endpoint exceeds the distance to public receptors.  In addition, the Anse La Butte Terminal is subject to OSHA PSM.  Therefore, the Anse La Butte Terminal is classified as a Program 3 process under the ARP program.\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nFlammable Substances ?

      "SummaryText": "elease of flammable substances is 1 psi overpressure (i.e., 15.7 psia), resulting from a vapor cloud explosion. The ARP Program requirement for flammables assumes an instantaneous release and vapor cloud explosion.  A yield factor of 10 percent of the available energy released in the explosion shall be used to determine the distance to the explosion endpoint.  Since the worst-case release scenario for a flammable substance is based on the assumption that the entire quantity of the substance forms a vapor cloud, passive mitigation systems are not applicable.  Isobutane is the worst-case flammable release with a 0.43-mile distance to the endpoint.\n\nFlammable Substances - Alternative-Case Scenario\n\nA single alternative release scenario for all flammable substances is required under the ARP program.  A hypothetical, but likely to occur, release scenario has been identified for isobutane as follows.  A 3-inch pipe on the truck rack is sheared during loading, causing the entire contents to empty from the truck.   The isobutene will vaporize and may ignite in a vapor cloud explosion with an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure or a vapor cloud fire with an endpoint of the lower flammability limit (LFL) for isobutane.  The alternative-case release of isobutane resulted in a 0.29-mile distance to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint and less than 0.10 mile distance to the LFL endpoint.  \n\nToxic Substances\n\nThe Anse La Butte Terminal does not have any toxic substances held above the threshold quantity.  Therefore, analysis of worst-case or alternative case release scenarios for toxic substances is not required.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Anse La Butte Terminal.  Because the processes at the terminal that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA?s) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements "
