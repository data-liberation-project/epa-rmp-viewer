      "SummaryText": "Facility Description:\n\nThe Linde Gas and Equipment Inc. facility in Newark, New Jersey is a industrial gas plant that handles and / or stores acetylene gas. The Newark facility receives acetylene in bulk trailers from which it then fills gas cylinders for distribution to customers.  The facility had the ability to produce acetylene on-site through calcium carbide generation and then compress it into cylinders for distribution by truck, but that operation is currently shut down and has been disconnected indefinitely.\n\n\n\nRegulated Substances:\n\nThis facility uses, manufactures or stores a chemical listed in part 68 of tile 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, beyond a threshold quantity, as established by the EPA;\n\n-Acetylene which is compressed into individual cylinders for sale to customers.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Policy:\n\nLinde is dedicated to being the best performing  industrial gas company in all aspects of our business, including Safety, Health and Environmental Affairs. Our safety, health and environmental policies call for a commitment to protecting the health & safety of our employees, neighbors and the surrounding environment. This is a basis for engineering  and construction programs that produce equipment and process systems that minimize the possibility of accidental releases and operational safety programs that ensure the safe operation of our facility. Linde is committed to continuous improvement of these programs.\n\n\n\nPrevention program:\n\n    In accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and EPA's Risk Management Rule, our Newark, N.J. facility has a comprehensive accident prevention program in place. This program is built around safety concepts such as;\n\n- Technical documentation of Process Safety Information, describing the physical properties of the hazardous substances, the safety systems in place to control these substances and the critical operating parameters of the associated systems and equipment.\n\n- Procedures and progr"
