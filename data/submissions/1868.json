This annex provides for (1) mitigation of chemical effects, (2) preparation for measures that save lives and minimize damage, (3) adequate response to chemical spills both on site and off site, as well as, (4) reacovery to normal or phase down level.\n\nAn emergency plan exists and involves municipal and community government and industry.

The emergency plan has a clearly defined procedure for the sharing of hardware and expertise with external resources.  The emergency plan is periodically tested by the simulation of emergencies and is upgraded.  The plan has undergone actual testing in a real emergency, and this was followed by a detailed analyses on the functionability of the plan.  Speed regulation for trains are strictly enforced in the area.  Train speeds are constantly monitored and violators prosecuted and fined.  Rails are aligned and leveled lin the area at least once a year, using special rail-testing devices designed for this purpose.  A hardware inventory including heavy equipment, absorbants, containment devices, etc., has been established by a planning committee for emergencies involving the assessment area.  Sewer shut-off points do not exist for the retainment of hazardous materials that may leak into sanitary and storm sewers."
