Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Country Pride Services in Fulda, Minnesota are strongly committed to employee, public, and\n\nenvironmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release\n\nprevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance,\n\nand employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement\n\nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does\n\noccur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of\n\nthe release.  We also coordinate our response efforts with the Fulda Fire Department, which provides\n\nadditional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\n\nammonia stored in one 12,000-gallon tank, six 1,850-gallon nurse tanks, four 1,450-gallon nurse\n\ntanks and twenty 1,000-gallon nurse tanks at our facility in Fulda, Minnesota (Figure 1).  The\n\nmaximum amount stored is 41,565 gallons (213,893.5 pounds) at  85% standard maximum storage\n\ncapacity including the capacity of the on-site nurse tanks.   The largest single storage vessel at our\n\nfacility contains 52,489.2 pounds at  85% standard maximum storage capacity.\n\n\n\n  3.
