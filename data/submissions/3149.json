The site is approximately 115 acres in size, and is located in a predominantly urban area of Benton.  The site is serviced with electricity, water, natural gas, and sewer lines.  The water lines, natural gas lines and sewer laterals enter the site from the west.\n\tThe western, active portion of the site is mostly occupied by scrap metal piles, loading docks, and a railroad spur.  A 90 ton chlorine car is also on the west side.  Access to the property is to the south side as well as employee parking.  The entire site is fenced.\nOperation Description\n\tThe site process involves the sorting, grading, processing (removing organics via a rotary kiln), melting, and alloying of metals for sale.  As part of the sorting process, large aluminum scrap is shredded or crushed, and ferrous metals are removed using a magnetic process.  A dryer with a secondary combustion unit and baghouse is used to remove impurities from the aluminum scrap such as moisture, paints and resins.\n\tThe sorted aluminum is charged into one of three furnaces where the metal is melted.  Once melted, various additives are used to modify the composition and hence the physical characteristics of the metal.  The metal is degassed by bubbling nitrogen through the molten metal.   Magnesium is removed by bubbling chlorine through the melt to form magnesium chloride.  Materials kept on-site for the process are aluminum, magnesium, zinc, copper, silicon, sodium, beryllium, and strontium.  Approximately 8,000,000 pounds of these materials are on-site at"

The tanker is connected into piping through which chlorine as a liquid flows to a vaporizer at a pressure of 100 psi. \n     The vaporizer heats the chlorine to the vapor state by a recirculated hot water electric heater which is thermostatically controlled.  Chlorine gas exits the vaporizer through regulators and into a piping manifold.  Each furnace has its own chlorine supply pipe and flowmeter which regulates the pressure.\n     At each particular furnace the chlorine gas passes a shut off valve, then through another flowmeter, and then through a needle valve where its flow is regulated by the furnace operator to the molten metal pump.  Close to the needle valve is the tubing connection that connects to a carbon lance which feeds the gas to the pump housing.
