The Santa Maria Facility handles hazardous materials onsite, and recognizes a responsibility to safely operate the facility in order to protect the employees, surrounding community, and the environment.  The Facility has taken a proactive stance to promote the overall safe operation of the processes, with programs to prevent accidents from occurring, planning for emergencies, and maintaining the equipment needed if an emergency does occur.  The RMP formalizes existing programs and procedures so that these programs may be reviewed more efficiently.\r\n\r\nThe Santa Maria Facility processes crude oil into intermediate products for further processing at other locations to produce gasoline.  The Facility receives crude oil from many sources via pipeline, stores it in tanks onsite, and processes the crude oil into products to be shipped elsewhere by pipeline, railcar, and truck.  The refining process separates the crude oil into four products: gas oil, naphtha (pressure distillate), sulfur, and coke (solid carbon based material).  The sulfur is generated because oil contains significant quantities of sulfur that must be removed to produce gasoline. The gas oil and naphtha products are also stored in the Facility's Storage Tanks prior to shipping by pipeline, while the solid sulfur and solid coke are shipped offsite by truck or railcar.   The Facility also has the utility and support systems required to provide for safe operation of the plant, including a power generation facility to make use of gas generated in the Refining Process.\r\n\r\nThe RMP effort at the Facility was divided into three phases.

Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a Management of Change Team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment. The Santa Maria Facility incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use, and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.  Quality Assurance is determined as part of the Management of Change Program.

The Management of Change procedure has been implemented in order to ensure that all installations and changes to equipment are made in a manner that ensures safety and operability.    Whenever equipment or installations are modified, new facilities are added, or process changes are necessary, a review by appropriate Engineering, Operations, Maintenance, Safety, and Environmental personnel is conducted.   For all changes, a Management of Change proposal is submitted for consideration through our KMS Resolution Tracker system. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other Facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tEnsure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, and\r\n\u00bf\tVerify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change\r\n\r\nProjects proceed from the initial MOC proposal through a planned sequence of signoffs designed to ensure that all parties are aware of the changes being implemented.  Affected Process Safety Information, including chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, is updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.  Prior to startup, the MOC procedure requires a Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) described above.
