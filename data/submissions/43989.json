      "SummaryText": "Our facility has one 12000 gallon storage tank and equipment for receiving ammonia from truck transports and transferring ammonia from storage to nurse tanks for pickup by customers.  It is our policy to meet and exceed all local, state, and national standards relating to storing and transferring of ammonia.\n\nAlthough ammonia is a toxic substance, our records show that we have never had any accidents or released any ammonia with off-site consequences.  The following is a list of safety freatures we use to minimize damage from any unusual occurences:\n\n1.  Excess flow valves to shut off flow from the tank if a line or hose is accidentally broken. \n2.  Pressure relief valves are installed on top of the storage tank to prevent excess pressure buildup. \n3.  Holding rack w/ locking covers on all pipe and hose valves to prevent any unauthorized use.  \n4.  Welded pipe barrier around storage tank to prevent accidental contact.  \n\nTo further ensure safe operation of the facility, our employees are trained in handling ammonia and we reveiw by video and on hand throughout the year the procedures for safe transfer and storage regulations.  We also request the Floydada Volunteer Fire Department to make a visual inspection of the facility and discuss their response in case of an accidental release. \n\nWe have analyzed the worst-case release defined by the EPA and using the OCA Guidance, we determined that a release of the total 12000 gallon tank would extend 2.8 miles from our facility.  Our company policy is to never fill the storage tank more than 85% of its capacity.  It is extremely unlikely that an event such as EPA's worst-case scenario will ever occur, therefore it is more likely a hose break caused by a pull away could happen.  The impact from a broken pipe or hose would only extend .30 miles and would be shut down by excess-flow valves."
