(CDPI) are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is the basis of having a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with all processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls, both engineering and administrative, to prevent possible releases of not only regulated substances, but all potentially hazardous materials. If such a release were to occur, we are prepared to work closely with the local Emergency Response agencies such as the Fire Departments and the LEPC in providing trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n\nFacility Overview\n\nChemDesign Products, Inc (CDPI) is a custom manufacturer of a wide variety of fine organic chemicals with the end uses of our products many and varied.  It offers a broad range of manufacturing flexibility for its customers and produces materials for the paper, electronics, agricultural and other industries.  \n\n\n\n\n\nTitanium Tetrachloride\n\nTitanium Tetrachloride is received as a liquid in 1,500 lb cylinders. The isotainer can only be transferred to a vessel with the use of 25 psi.  The reaction will be done under blocked in conditions to ensure full conversion of titanium tetrachloride to the desired product prior to venting off the reactor to the caustic scrubber prior to work up and isolation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
