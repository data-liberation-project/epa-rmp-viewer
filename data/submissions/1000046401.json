This document has been revised and updated in order to address the following issues:\r\n\u00bf\tAccomplish the required 5 year RMP revision process, and,\r\n\u00bf\tAddress the Program status change from Level 2 to Level 1.\r\nThe RMP addresses the requirements of the California Accidental Release Program (CalARP) as adopted by the State of California as outlined in California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19. These requirements build upon the provisions of the \"general duty clause\" of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, and the federal RMP program requirements in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 68, which require the following activities of all facilities which produce, process, store, or handle listed substances:\r\n\u00bf\tidentify hazards\r\n\u00bf\tdesign and maintain a safe facility\r\n\u00bf\tprevent releases\r\n\u00bf\tminimize consequences of releases\r\nThe accepted approach to accomplishing the above is to have a documented RMP, which outlines all the steps and procedures a facility will take to prevent and mitigate accidental releases. OMEC has chosen to revise and implement this RMP in support of continued operations of the aqueous ammonia process systems in order to fulfill its obligations with respect to the General Duty clause and to protect its employees and the surrounding community from the effects of accidental releases.\r\nPursuant to 40 CFR 68 and the CalARP regulations, the following summary is given:\r\nThe RMP applies to the OMEC facility located at:\r\n606 De La Fuente Court, San Diego, CA 92154\r\nThe OMEC facility is a natural gas fired combined cycle (2X1) nominal rated 596 megawatt (MW) powerplant.

This plant is located at 606 De La Fuente Court, San Diego, California 92154. The facility utilizes combined-cycle combustion turbine technology in the electrical generation process. The project consists of (2) natural gas fired turbines and associated duct burners, a single steam turbine, and associated support equipment. \r\nThe Otay Mesa Energy Center LLC is comparable to the majority of Calpine's energy centers; the OMEC is a combined-cycle design that enables it to generate electricity up to 40 percent more efficiently than traditional natural gas-fueled facilities. The project also incorporates best available emissions control technology. The turbines are equipped with dry low nitrogen (NOx) combustors and \"selective catalytic reduction\" (SCR) for the control of emissions of oxides of NOx. The SCR system uses aqueous ammonia as the reduction reagent. As such, the facility has the required systems to store and distribute aqueous ammonia for the SCR process.\r\nThe facility is storing aqueous ammonia on site in a stationary non-pressurized storage tank with a capacity of approximately 16,000 gallons. Aqueous ammonia solution of 29.4 percent (or less) by weight ammonia is being used. Administrative controls limit the actual tank storage capacity to 85 percent of maximum design capacity, i.e., 13,600 gallons. The tank is situated within a secondary containment area of sufficient size and volume to contain the entire contents of the tank plus the rainfall from the worst-case storm scenario. The ammonia storage and handling facilities is equipped with continuous tank level monitors, temperature and pressure monitors and alarms. In additio"

These totes have a capacity of less than 400 gallons each and store aqueous ammonia in solutions less than 20% ammonia by weight.\r\n1.1\tRMP PROGRAM LEVEL\r\nStorage of 13,600 gallons of aqueous ammonia results in the on-site presence of ammonia in quantities in excess of the State CalARP substance threshold for ammonia of 500 pounds. Presently, the CalARP regulations do not contain an exemption for aqueous ammonia solutions. The federal RMP regulations per 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 68 contain an exemption for aqueous ammonia solutions less than 20 percent with a threshold value of 10,000 pounds. Since the facility is proposing the use of 29.4 percent aqueous ammonia, these exemptions would not apply to the current facility, and as such, the facility must prepare and maintain a RMP for aqueous ammonia. The existing facility is not subject to the Process Safety Management provisions of 29 CFR 1910 and California Code of Regulations (CCR) Title 8 Section 5189. Based on the above, including the accident history, and a lack of potential offsite impact receptors, the existing facility is being re-classified as a Program Level 1 source. \r\n1.1.1\tRMP Management System\r\nThe OMEC facility has included in its current management system the required elements to oversee the implementation of the RMP program elements.

      "SummaryText": "duced to atmospheric pressure, i.e., the evaporation of ammonia gas from the aqueous fluid would be negligible as opposed to a release of anhydrous ammonia which would be rapid and much more severe with respect to offsite impacts.\r\n\u00bf\tPer Risk Management Program Guidance for WWTPs, EPA-OSWER, October 1998, ammonia emissions from aqueous ammonia releases are only calculated for the first 10 minutes of the spill life. EPA states that the release of ammonia from the aqueous solution should only be used for the first 10 minutes after which the ammonia in the pool or diked area will be more dilute than it was initially and will be evaporating much less rapidly. This qualifier applies to all emissions scenarios except to the alternate case for which a conservative assumption was made that all ammonia contained in the spilled product would be released within 10 minutes.\r\n16.1\tEMISSIONS CALCULATION PROCEDURES\r\nEmissions of ammonia from the aqueous solution were calculated for the worst case scenario using the following equation:\r\nQR = (1.4)(LFA)(A)(Tcf)\r\nWhere: LFA, for 29-30% aqueous ammonia ambient liquid factor (0.026), or for 19% aqueous ammonia (0.015):\r\nA, is the surface area of the spill or release, sq.ft.,\r\nQR, is the emission in units of lbs/min.\r\nTcf, temperature correction factor (not used as the San Diego CUPA specified 25 C for all worst case OCA analyses)\r\nThe LFA factors are based on data presented in RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance, April 15, 1999, Table B-3 and Appendix D.2.2 respectively.\r\nThe surface area for non-diked spills is based on a spill depth of 1 cm. The spill surface area can be calculated as follows:\r\nSfc.Area (m2) = (total gallons spilled)/(2.642)\r\n(m2) X (10.76) = sq.ft.\r\nFor purposes of maintaining a conservative emission release for the alternate scenario, all ammonia contained within the total spill for non-diked (ground surface) releases was assumed emitted over the 10-minute time frame. It should be noted that the unloading are"
