EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nNational Beef California, LP (National Beef) owns and operates a beef slaughter house and packing plant in Brawley, California.  On site, National Beef has an ammonia refrigeration system which contains anhydrous ammonia, a regulated hazardous substance, for the refrigeration of meat at the facility.  The maximum intended inventory of anhydrous ammonia on site is above the threshold quantity listed in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 68.130.\n\nBecause the quantity of anhydrous ammonia exceeds the threshold quantity, National Beef is required to implement a Risk Management Program (RMP) at the Brawley, California plant which includes three (3) major elements: hazard assessment, prevention program, and emergency response program.  The submission of the RMP Plan presents the details of the RMP compliance measures conducted by National Beef.  National Beef closed on the transaction to acquire the Brawley, California plant on May 30, 2006.  This submission represents a first-time submission of an RMP for this facility.\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nNational Beef is committed to the protection of the safety, health, and environment in our routine operations and emergency responses.  Our prevention and emergency response practices are developed to protect the public as well as our own employees.  It is our policy to comply with applicable laws, and to support and work with local emergency response agencies.  To implement this policy, the following plans are maintained and implemented at the Brawley facility:\n\nEmergency Response Plan\nProcess Safety Management (PSM) Program\nRisk Management Program\n\nThese programs and procedures provide comprehensive planning for accidental and emergency situations. \n\n\n1.2 Description of National Beef and the Regulated Substance Handled\n\nThe National Beef California, LP Brawley, California plant located at 57 East Shank Road is a"

      "SummaryText": " beef slaughter house and packing facility.  Live cattle are received and slaughtered, and fresh meat is cut and packaged.  The ammonia refrigeration system provides the necessary refrigeration of the meat.  In addition, the ammonia refrigeration system is utilized to provide some cooling for the plant itself.  There are approximately 70,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia located within the closed-loop ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nDuring the warmer months of the year when the outside wet-bulb temperature is high, National Beef will rent and utilize as needed three evaporative condensers to enhance cooling capacity for the ammonia refrigeration system.  In addition, a small ammonia system separate from the large primary plant system is used to provide chilled water for processing cattle hides.  The equipment and information associated with the evaporative cooler and small independent system are incorporated in this RMP to ensure their safe operation and maintenance.\n\n1.3 The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nNational Beef has specific process controls in-place to minimize the risks of spills.  National Beef is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management Program (PSM).  National Beef has a preventative maintenance program in place to address maintenance of all vital parts of the ammonia refrigeration system.  All inspection and testing procedures are addressed within this program.  In addition, there are many safety controls installed within the system.  These include an interlock system, relief and check valves, manual and automatic shutoffs and alarms located within the ammonia refrigeration system.  \n\n1.4 Five year Accident History\n\nNational Beef acquired the Brawley, California plant on May 30, 2006; there have been no accidental releases since that time.\n\n1.5 The Emergency Response Program\n\nNational Beef's emergency response policies summarize the actions to be taken in response to a chemical spill.

Local emergency responders are familiar with the facility and the hazards of release.\n\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nNational Beef makes safety a first priority in its every day operations to ensure a safe working environment for all of its employees. National Beef is committed to continuously improving the facility's safety and working practices through employee involvement and development.\n\nA Process Hazard Assessment (PHA) was recently performed at the National Beef facility.  A number of safeguards identified during that PHA are being implemented to improve the safety of the anhydrous ammonia process as well as reduce the chances and magnitude of any anhydrous ammonia spill."
