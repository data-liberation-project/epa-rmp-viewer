Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nBaker Petrolite Corporation (BPC) is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nWe have one (1) regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is acrolein [2-Propenal].  The regulated substance at our facility is stored and distributed to our customers.  Acrolein [2-Propenal] is stored in a pressurized vessel to minimize emissions during storage.  There is no material handling of acrolein except moving of containers.\n\n3.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68.  In additional to 40CFR68, the BPC - Jena facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119 and EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of our release prevention program that are in place at our facility.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nBPC A? Jena maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with acrolein.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nBPC A? Jena conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What if Checklist.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified "

Jena maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as transportation, storage and emergency operations.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.  \n\nTraining\nBPC A? Jena has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees that are operating processes are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with this process.  New employees receive basic training in operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided at least every two (2) years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nBPC A? Jena conducts documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper functions.  Equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, relief and vent systems, and any piping.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe timely manner.  In addition at the Taft Manufacturing Plant in Taft, California, each acrolein container undergoes a visual inspection and pressure testing of the valving, fittings, and container after every trip.  Every 5 years, the container valves and replaced and the continers undergoes a third party inspection and hydrotesting.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at BPC A? Jena to manage changes in technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly "

Jena.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operations.\n\nCompliance Audits\nBPC A? Jena conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every three (3) years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nBPC A? Jena promptly investigates any incident(s) that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the releases from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nBPC A? Jena truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  BPC employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facilityA?s implementation to the RMP rule in particular information resulting from process hazard analysis.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, BPC A? Jena hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor involving a covered process, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  BPC A?

Jena has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases of a regulated substance over the past five (5) years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release of acrolein [2-Propenal] during this period.  \n\n5.    Emergency Response Plan\nBPC A? Jena carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public.  Emergency response drills and coordination with local responders are conducted annually.  \n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n6.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nBPC continually strives to improve procedures and equipment to ensure safety for our employees and our communities. BPC A? Jena will coordinate and improve coordination with local emergency responders annually.  In addition, the location will enhance its active mitigation of the regulated substance by constructing a new secondary containment area and other mitigation features.  "
