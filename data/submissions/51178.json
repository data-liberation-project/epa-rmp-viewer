Both facilities are operated by Ormat-Nevada, Inc. and located in Heber, California.  The 2008 update addresses the installation of one new, 16-Megawatt Integrated Two-Level Unit Ormat Energy Converter Unit at Heber 2 which increases the quantity of isopentane used at Heber 2.  The 2008 update also includes revised off-site consequences analyses for the Heber 1 and Heber 2 isopentane processes that reflect the use of the Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres [ALOHA \u00ae] Model.\n\nBoth Heber facilities have processes that contain greater amounts of isopentane than the state and federal threshold planning quantities for this flammable substance established under Section 112(r) of the federal Clean Air Act and Article 2, Chapter 6.95 of the California Health and Safety Code.  Both Heber facilities also have processes that contain chlorine in amounts greater than the threshold quantities for this toxic substance established under these codes.  The chlorine and isopentane processes at Heber 1 and Heber 2 are subject to the Program 3 requirements for the RMP.\n\nThe updated RMP meets the requirements of the federal Risk Management Program contained in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68 and the requirements of the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program contained in Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5 of the California Code of Regulations. The quantities of the two regulated substances handled at the facilities also exceed the threshold quantities in the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) process safety management regulations in 29 CFR 1910.119 and require hazard assessment under that program.\n\nBoth Heber 1 and Heber 2 use chlorine for the control of microbiological growth in the cooling towers. The chlorine is delivered in Department of Transportation (DOT)-approved containers, stored in secure areas with leak detectors, held"

      "SummaryText": "in place by seismic straps, and manually activated by trained operators. The RMP describes the processes and equipment used to handle the delivery, storage, monitoring, detection, and injection of chlorine into the circulating water at both these facilities. The plan provides details on the changes to these systems that have been implemented at these facilities in the past five years and includes the plans for additional safety measures in the event of an accidental rupture of flexible lines, a failure of the leak detection equipment, or a fire in the cooling tower areas.  The 2008 modifications to Heber 2 do not change or modify the Heber 1 or Heber 2 chlorine processes; thus, this 2008 RMP update does not update the Heber 1 and Heber 2 chlorine processes or off-site consequences analyses.  \n\nBoth Heber 1 and Heber 2 use isopentane as the working fluid in the Rankin cycles for its Ormat Energy Converter Units.  The isopentane is delivered by qualified suppliers, stored in a secure area designed for seismic loads, pumped to the individual units, and circulated and recovered through a closed-loop system. The plants have leak detection monitors and fire protection equipment installed throughout the isopentane process area. The RMP describes the current methods of delivery, storage, transfer, use, and recovery of this flammable substance at the geothermal facilities and includes a description of the vapor recovery and evacuation units installed at Heber 1 and Heber 2. The RMP includes additional safety measures to reduce the risk of damage from release of this flammable substance.  \n\nThe RMP includes the specifications for the safe handling of both regulated substances and describes the training programs for employees, operators, emergency responders, and contractors on site. It summarizes the inspection and preventive maintenance programs for the chlorine and isopentane delivery, storage, and chlorination systems and describes the incident investigations, compliance a"

The 2008 modifications to Heber 2 increase the total quantity of isopentane stored on-site and result in greater off-site consequences than the Heber 2 2006 RMP.  The use of the ALOHA \u00ae Model also results in greater off-site consequences for Heber 1 than described in the Heber 1 2006 RMP.  Thus, this RMP update considers the 2008 Heber 2 modifications and revises the off-site consequences analyses for Heber 1 and Heber 2 isopentane process per the results of the ALOHA \u00ae Model. \n\nWith the implementation of the Ormat Nevada, Inc. safety and operating procedures described in the RMP, there have been no reportable accidents at Heber 1 and Heber 2 in the two years since the last RMP was prepared.  No reportable accidents occurred in the previous five year RMP update either.  No releases of chlorine or isopentane at the facilities have resulted in death, injury, or substantial damage to onsite facilities nor have any releases of chlorine or isopentane caused offsite evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nOrmat-Nevada, Inc. has an Emergency Response Plan in place that provides for the notification of the public, evacuation of the sites, and procedures to be undertaken in the event of an accidental release of chlorine or isopentane at these facilities.\n\nOrmat-Nevada, Inc. is submitting this RMP to the Department of Toxic Substances Control, the Administrating Agency for the CalARP Program."
