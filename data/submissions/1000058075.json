              "Description": "PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nMethanex USA, LLC ? Geismar Site (the \"facility?) views the health and safety of its employees and the community in which it operates as its top priority.  The facility has implemented a robust OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program to protect its people, the local community, and the integrity of process equipment.  The following sections will provide an overview of the various elements of the facility's PSM program.\n\n\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe cornerstone of the PSM program is Process Safety Information (PSI).  PSI defines the chemical hazards, equipment, and technology in a given process.  Maintaining the PSI enables the facility employees involved in operating covered processes to identify and understand the hazards posed by such processes involving OSHA OSM Highly Hazardous Chemicals.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs).  This information is maintained in a centralized location for quick reference by all employees and can be accessed from the intranet homepage from any workstation.  The facility documents safety-related-limits for parameters (e.g., temperature, flow, composition) and ensures that the process is maintained within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems, such as automatic shutdown systems.\n\n\n\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature rating, and electrical rating of equipment.  In combination with written procedures and trained personnel, this information facilitates that the safety features in the process are not compromised and provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes.\n\n\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nThe facility has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, processes are systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \n\n\n\nThe facility primarily uses the Hazards and Operability Study (HAZOP) PHA methodology to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP methodology is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  This technique may be supplemented using the ?What If?, ?Checklist? or ?What If/Checklist? techniques.  PHA team members include operations, maintenance, and engineering personnel who are familiar with the process being reviewed.  In addition, one member must be knowledgeable in the specific PHA methodology being used.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures, if applicable. \n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are compiled by the PSM Engineer for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo help minimize the potential that process controls and/or process hazards could eventually deviate significantly from the original designed safety features, the facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operational.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained for the life of the facility.\n\n\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\n\n\nTo facilitate safe and reliable operation of process equipment, the facility maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) initial startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency operations, (5) emergency shutdown, (6) normal shutdown, and (7) startup following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are required to be reviewed and certified annually as current and accurate.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the facility maintains key process parameter documents that provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nTRAINING\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the facility has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive classroom training on basic operating principles and the operating procedures of their assigned process unit.  The training includes, but is not limited to, an emphasis on unit specific safety and health hazards, emergency response procedures, and company policies.  After successfully completing their training, a new operator is paired with a certified on the job trainer to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through written and oral tests, field demonstration, skills observation) they possess adequate knowledge to perform duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to maintain their skills and knowledge at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every three years.  Records for classroom, on the job, and refresher training are maintained onsite and include the employee's name, date of training, and the means used to verify that the employee understood the training.\n\n\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\n\n\nThe facility has procedures and practices related to maintaining the integrity of pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, process controls, pumps and compressors, emergency shutdown systems, and critical instrument systems in a safe operating condition.  The mechanical integrity program includes (1) conducting training for maintenance personnel, (2) ongoing inspection and testing (and resolution of inspection results, as applicable) of various types of process equipment, (3) correcting identified equipment deficiencies, if applicable, and (4) quality assurance measures to verify the equipment's suitability for the process application for which they will be used.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the facility requires employee participation in the development, implementation, and continuing improvement of the mechanical integrity program through a feedback and review process.\n\n\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\n\n\n\nThe facility has a comprehensive system to manage changes to its covered processes.  This Management of Change (MOC) system requires that changes (except for ?replacements in kind?) to items such as process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures and changes to stationary sources that affect a covered process be properly reviewed an authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) confirm the technical basis of the proposed change, (2) determine the impact of the change on process related safety and health, (3) confirm modifications to operating procedures, (4) confirm the necessary time period for the change, and (5) confirm authorization requirements for the proposed change.  In addition, the procedure includes a step for informing and training employees involved in operating the process and maintenance and contractor employees whose job tasks will be affected by a change in the process. \n\n\n\nPRE-STARTUP REVIEW\n\n\n\nThe facility conducts a pre-startup safety review (PSSR) for any new facility or facility modification that is significant enough to require a change in PSI.  In addition, major projects and maintenance turnarounds require a PSSR to be completed.  The purpose of the PSSR is to confirm that (1) construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications, (2) safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and adequate, (3) PHAs has been performed and recommendations have been resolved or implemented before startup for new facilities, (4) requirements contained in MOC are met for modified facilities, and (5) training of each employee involved in operating the process has been completed prior to introducing highly hazardous chemicals to a process.  The Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) uses departmental checklist to verify all aspects of readiness. \n\n\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\n\n\n\nThe facility's performance relative to the provisions of 40 CFR 68 is required to be evaluated at least once every three years, with a report summarizing the RMP Compliance audit teams findings.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to  management for resolution.  The compliance audit report is required to be reviewed to promptly determine and document resolution of the audit team?s findings.  The two most recent compliance audit reports are required to be retained.    \n\n\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATIONS\n\n\n\nThe facility promptly investigates all RMP incidents that resulted in, or could have resulted in an RMP incident involving fire, explosion, material release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury affecting site personnel or the community.  All incidents that result in, or could have resulted in, a catastrophic release of a highly hazardous chemical must be investigated as promptly as possible, but no later than 48 hours following the incident.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts, and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation teams include personnel who are knowledgeable in the process involved in the incident, contract employees if work involved a contractor, and other employees with appropriate knowledge and experience to thoroughly investigate and analyze an incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five (5) years so that reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.     \n\n\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\n\n\nThe facility encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  The facility's written employee participation plan outlines the various ways that employees can participate, including, but not limited to, the following activities: (1) Assist the Responsible Care Department; (2) Become a member of PHA teams; (3) Form chartered committees to promote process and personal safety; (4) Actively participate in incident investigations; and (5) MOC program.  In addition, all employees have access to PHAs and all other information required to be developed for RMP.\n\n\n\nHOT WORK PERMITS\n\n\n\nThe facility has a hot work permit procedure in place for all work performed at or near covered process areas.  The intent of the hot work permit is to ensure workers are aware of the hazards associated with hot work and to confirm the appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and safety measures are being utilized before the work begins.  The permit documents that the OSHA fire prevention and/or chemical protection requirements have been implemented prior to beginning the hot work operations.  The permit specifies the dates on which the work is authorized and identifies the specific process/equipment on which hot work is to be performed.  All permits are retained until the workers have completed the hot work operations.\n\n\n\nCONTRACTORS\n\n\n\nThe contractor safety program includes a contractor screening process and a Contract Coordinator.  Before selecting contractors to perform any work on or near covered process areas, the safety performance of the contractor and contractor safety programs are evaluated.  \n\n\n\nIn addition to performing their work in a safe manner, contractors must (1) utilize the appropriate knowledge and skills to understand the process, (2) recognize potential safety and health hazards in their workplace, (3) inform plant personnel of any hazards identified while working, (4) understand what to do in an emergency situation using the emergency response plan, and (5) understand and follow site safety rules and safe work practices.  \n\n\n\nVerification that the contractor is fulfilling his or her responsibilities and is abiding to all relevant safety programs and procedures are maintained before, and throughout, all work in or near covered process areas by responsible facility personnel.  \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE \n\n\n\nThe facility maintains a written Emergency Response Plan (ERP), which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire and/or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs.  In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to plant processes.  The ERP changes are administered through the MOC process, which include informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\n\n\nThe overall ERP is coordinated with the Ascension Parish Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee with local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.   The facility has around-the-clock communication capabilities with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., Sheriff's department) to facilitate notification of the public and receive a quick response.  \n\n\n\nTypes of RMP site-specific prevention steps include the following:\n\n-Release detection (e.g., process alarms, process area detectors);\n\n-Release containment and control (e.g., pressure relief valves, check valves, automatic shutdown systems, redundant instrumentation, dikes); and\n\n-Release mitigation (e.g., fire extinguishing systems, emergency shutdown devices, and trained operations/emergency response personnel).\n\n",

              "Description": "PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nMethanex USA, LLC ? Geismar Site (the \"facility?) views the health and safety of its employees and the community in which it operates as its top priority.  The facility has implemented a robust OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program to protect its people, the local community, and the integrity of process equipment.  The following sections will provide an overview of the various elements of the facility's PSM program.\n\n\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe cornerstone of the PSM program is Process Safety Information (PSI).  PSI defines the chemical hazards, equipment, and technology in a given process.  Maintaining the PSI enables the facility employees involved in operating covered processes to identify and understand the hazards posed by such processes involving OSHA OSM Highly Hazardous Chemicals.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs).  This information is maintained in a centralized location for quick reference by all employees and can be accessed from the intranet homepage from any workstation.  The facility documents safety-related-limits for parameters (e.g., temperature, flow, composition) and ensures that the process is maintained within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems, such as automatic shutdown systems.\n\n\n\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature rating, and electrical rating of equipment.  In combination with written procedures and trained personnel, this information facilitates that the safety features in the process are not compromised and provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes.\n\n\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nThe facility has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, processes are systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \n\n\n\nThe facility primarily uses the Hazards and Operability Study (HAZOP) PHA methodology to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP methodology is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  This technique may be supplemented using the ?What If?, ?Checklist? or ?What If/Checklist? techniques.  PHA team members include operations, maintenance, and engineering personnel who are familiar with the process being reviewed.  In addition, one member must be knowledgeable in the specific PHA methodology being used.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures, if applicable. \n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are compiled by the PSM Engineer for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo help minimize the potential that process controls and/or process hazards could eventually deviate significantly from the original designed safety features, the facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operational.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained for the life of the facility.\n\n\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\n\n\nTo facilitate safe and reliable operation of process equipment, the facility maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) initial startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency operations, (5) emergency shutdown, (6) normal shutdown, and (7) startup following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are required to be reviewed and certified annually as current and accurate.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the facility maintains key process parameter documents that provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nTRAINING\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the facility has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive classroom training on basic operating principles and the operating procedures of their assigned process unit.  The training includes, but is not limited to, an emphasis on unit specific safety and health hazards, emergency response procedures, and company policies.  After successfully completing their training, a new operator is paired with a certified on the job trainer to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through written and oral tests, field demonstration, skills observation) they possess adequate knowledge to perform duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to maintain their skills and knowledge at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every three years.  Records for classroom, on the job, and refresher training are maintained onsite and include the employee's name, date of training, and the means used to verify that the employee understood the training.\n\n\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\n\n\nThe facility has procedures and practices related to maintaining the integrity of pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, process controls, pumps and compressors, emergency shutdown systems, and critical instrument systems in a safe operating condition.  The mechanical integrity program includes (1) conducting training for maintenance personnel, (2) ongoing inspection and testing (and resolution of inspection results, as applicable) of various types of process equipment, (3) correcting identified equipment deficiencies, if applicable, and (4) quality assurance measures to verify the equipment's suitability for the process application for which they will be used.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the facility requires employee participation in the development, implementation, and continuing improvement of the mechanical integrity program through a feedback and review process.\n\n\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\n\n\n\nThe facility has a comprehensive system to manage changes to its covered processes.  This Management of Change (MOC) system requires that changes (except for ?replacements in kind?) to items such as process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures and changes to stationary sources that affect a covered process be properly reviewed an authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) confirm the technical basis of the proposed change, (2) determine the impact of the change on process related safety and health, (3) confirm modifications to operating procedures, (4) confirm the necessary time period for the change, and (5) confirm authorization requirements for the proposed change.  In addition, the procedure includes a step for informing and training employees involved in operating the process and maintenance and contractor employees whose job tasks will be affected by a change in the process. \n\n\n\nPRE-STARTUP REVIEW\n\n\n\nThe facility conducts a pre-startup safety review (PSSR) for any new facility or facility modification that is significant enough to require a change in PSI.  In addition, major projects and maintenance turnarounds require a PSSR to be completed.  The purpose of the PSSR is to confirm that (1) construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications, (2) safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and adequate, (3) PHAs has been performed and recommendations have been resolved or implemented before startup for new facilities, (4) requirements contained in MOC are met for modified facilities, and (5) training of each employee involved in operating the process has been completed prior to introducing highly hazardous chemicals to a process.  The Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) uses departmental checklist to verify all aspects of readiness. \n\n\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\n\n\n\nThe facility's performance relative to the provisions of 40 CFR 68 is required to be evaluated at least once every three years, with a report summarizing the RMP Compliance audit teams findings.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to  management for resolution.  The compliance audit report is required to be reviewed to promptly determine and document resolution of the audit team?s findings.  The two most recent compliance audit reports are required to be retained.    \n\n\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATIONS\n\n\n\nThe facility promptly investigates all RMP incidents that resulted in, or could have resulted in an RMP incident involving fire, explosion, material release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury affecting site personnel or the community.  All incidents that result in, or could have resulted in, a catastrophic release of a highly hazardous chemical must be investigated as promptly as possible, but no later than 48 hours following the incident.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts, and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation teams include personnel who are knowledgeable in the process involved in the incident, contract employees if work involved a contractor, and other employees with appropriate knowledge and experience to thoroughly investigate and analyze an incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five (5) years so that reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.     \n\n\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\n\n\nThe facility encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  The facility's written employee participation plan outlines the various ways that employees can participate, including, but not limited to, the following activities: (1) Assist the Responsible Care Department; (2) Become a member of PHA teams; (3) Form chartered committees to promote process and personal safety; (4) Actively participate in incident investigations; and (5) MOC program.  In addition, all employees have access to PHAs and all other information required to be developed for RMP.\n\n\n\nHOT WORK PERMITS\n\n\n\nThe facility has a hot work permit procedure in place for all work performed at or near covered process areas.  The intent of the hot work permit is to ensure workers are aware of the hazards associated with hot work and to confirm the appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and safety measures are being utilized before the work begins.  The permit documents that the OSHA fire prevention and/or chemical protection requirements have been implemented prior to beginning the hot work operations.  The permit specifies the dates on which the work is authorized and identifies the specific process/equipment on which hot work is to be performed.  All permits are retained until the workers have completed the hot work operations.\n\n\n\nCONTRACTORS\n\n\n\nThe contractor safety program includes a contractor screening process and a Contract Coordinator.  Before selecting contractors to perform any work on or near covered process areas, the safety performance of the contractor and contractor safety programs are evaluated.  \n\n\n\nIn addition to performing their work in a safe manner, contractors must (1) utilize the appropriate knowledge and skills to understand the process, (2) recognize potential safety and health hazards in their workplace, (3) inform plant personnel of any hazards identified while working, (4) understand what to do in an emergency situation using the emergency response plan, and (5) understand and follow site safety rules and safe work practices.  \n\n\n\nVerification that the contractor is fulfilling his or her responsibilities and is abiding to all relevant safety programs and procedures are maintained before, and throughout, all work in or near covered process areas by responsible facility personnel.  \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE \n\n\n\nThe facility maintains a written Emergency Response Plan (ERP), which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire and/or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs.  In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to plant processes.  The ERP changes are administered through the MOC process, which include informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\n\n\nThe overall ERP is coordinated with the Ascension Parish Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee with local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.   The facility has around-the-clock communication capabilities with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., Sheriff's department) to facilitate notification of the public and receive a quick response.  \n\n\n\nTypes of RMP site-specific prevention steps include the following:\n\n-Release detection (e.g., process alarms, process area detectors);\n\n-Release containment and control (e.g., pressure relief valves, check valves, automatic shutdown systems, redundant instrumentation, dikes); and\n\n-Release mitigation (e.g., fire extinguishing systems, emergency shutdown devices, and trained operations/emergency response personnel).\n\n",

The facility produces methanol from natural gas by reforming the gas with steam and then converting and distilling the resulting synthesized gas mixture to produce pure methanol.  The facility contains the following RMP-regulated substances: methane, hydrogen and ammonia.  The final product, pure methanol, is stored in dedicated tanks before being transferred to loading facilities.\n\n\n\nThe facility's risk management program and maximum chemical inventory were evaluated and it was determined that the facility's processes render the facility subject to 40 CFR 68 requirements. The facility has two (2) identical RMP covered processes and both processes, Geismar 1 and Geismar 2, each contain approximately 13,000 pounds of an NFPA-4 flammable mixture.  Additionally, each process contains approximately 240,000  pounds of a 29.4 percent ammonia solution which is used for purposes of flue gas NOx reduction by means of selective catalytic reduction.  Moreover, the processes render the facility subject to the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) - Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, codified in 29 CFR 1910.119.  As such, given that the facility has to comply with OSHA PSM standards and the fact that RMP offsite consequence analysis worst-case modeling yields the potential for offsite impacts, the facility is subject to RMP Prevention Program 3 Requirements. \n\n\n\nThe facility maintains a management system and associated policies, procedures, standing instructions, programs, and work practices that are related to RMP Prevention Program elements.

The facility has implemented a robust OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program to protect its people, the local community, and the integrity of process equipment.  \n\n\n\nRMP FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nNo accidents have resulted from the existing Geismar 1 or Geismar 2 processes. \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe facility maintains a written Emergency Response Plan (ERP), which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire and/or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs.  In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to plant processes.  The ERP changes are administered through the MOC process, which include informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\n\n\nThe overall ERP is coordinated with the Ascension Parish Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee with local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.   The facility has ar"
