If an emergency were to occur, it is this Facility's policy to notify the Schererville (primary), Griffith, and Hartsdale Fire Departments and the Lake County LEPC, as appropriate through the 911 service.  Medical emergencies will require notification of the Saint Margaret Mercy Hospital and associated ambulance service via 911 [hospital non-emergency number: (219) 865-2141 / ambulance non-emergency number: (219) 838-4444].  The Facility currently maintains a trained incipient stage fire and hazardous material emergency response team (First Responder Operations Level) to respond to small or initial stages of an emergency.\n\nThe Buckeye Terminals LLC - Hartsdale Station is a pipeline breakout station, including the liquified butane blending system (direct injection into refined product [gasoline] pipelines).  The Risk Management Program covers the butane blending system including the associated piping, the 87,659 gallon vessel, the blending skid, sampling unit, and the truck offloading station.\n\nThe Facility's worst case scenerio is the failure of the blending system's 87,659 gallon liquified butane vessel when filled to the greatest amount allowed (fill shutoff device at 85%) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The Facility's alternate scenerio (most-likely with significant impact) is a BLEVE.\n\nThe Buckeye Terminals LLC- Hartsdale Station complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Accident Prevention Rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D - Program Level 3).  Additionally, this plan meets the requirements of the U.S. Department of Labor- Occupational Safety and Health Administration Prosess Safety Management regulations for Highly Hazardous Chemicals (29 CFR Part 1910.119).  This butane blending system is designed, "

      "SummaryText": "constructed and maintained to meet or exceed the NFPA #58 requirements for Liquified Petroleum Gas Storage and Transfer.\n\nTo date this Facility has never had an accident involving the butane blending system (operational since October 2002) resulting in deaths, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in-place.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the Hartsdale Station butane blending system, it is the policy of the Facility to initially contact the Schererville Fire Department and request their assistance.  The Facility maintains a trained (annually) incipient fire and hazardous substance emergency response team, as referenced above.  The Facility's emergency response plans are coordinated with the Schererville Fire Department and the Lake County LEPC.  The Schererville Fire Department is aware of the Facility's butane blending system, access via Division Steet to Cental Avenue, and available fire suppresion equipment including 20 lbs. ABC fire extinquishers, 350 lbs. wheeled ABC extinquishers, and water sources (nearest hydrant available at approximately 150 ft distance).  Buckeye Terminals LLC- Hartsdale Station maintains a vegetation contol program to minimize plant growth within 10 ft of the system."
