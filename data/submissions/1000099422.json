      "SummaryText": "This Executive Summary briefly reviews the major elements of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the Blue Flint Ethanol, LLC (Blue Flint Ethanol) facility located in Underwood, North Dakota.  This summary is presented in response to the requirements of the United States Environmental Protection Agency under 40 CFR Part 68 and 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.  The Blue Flint Ethanol facility is subject to the RMP rule due to the storage of natural gasoline denaturant, a regulated flammable mixture, above the threshold quantity.  This RMP submittal is for the 5-year RMP update.\n\n\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \n\nBlue Flint Ethanol is committed to protecting the environment and operating facilities in a manner that promotes the safety of employees and the general public.  Management has adopted and implemented policies that adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  The design and construction of the facility has incorporated physical and operational safeguards to prevent accidental releases.  Through the proper design, installation, operation and maintenance of the equipment, and the training of our personnel, Blue Flint Ethanol has minimized the hazard to human health and the environment from fires, explosions, or any unplanned sudden or non-sudden release of hazardous materials.  \n\n\n\nIn the event that a release does occur, the facility's emergency response actions are described in its integrated contingency plan.  The contingency plan includes procedures to coordinate response actions with local emergency response personnel (i.e. law enforcement, fire, and rescue departments, emergency medical services, hospital and government personnel) as well as any potentially affected neighbors. In addition, the contingency plan is used to familiarize local emergency response personnel with the types of material handled and internal emergency response procedures.\n\n\n\n2.

      "SummaryText": "he Blue Flint Ethanol facility is a nameplate 50 million gallon per year, corn-based dry-mill denatured ethanol plant. Ethanol is produced through the conversion of corn starch to sugars and then conversion of the sugars to ethanol (i.e. grain alcohol) through a continuous fermentation and distillation process. \n\n\n\nRegulated substances stored at the facility include natural gasoline which is used as a denaturant in the ethanol fuel product.   \n\n\n\n3. Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nBlue Flint Ethanol has programs in place to address accidental release prevention measures required by EPA, process safety management (PSM) requirements from OSHA, and notification requirements of EPA's Emergency Response and Community Right-to-Know regulations.  The facility complies with PSM for the management of ethanol, fuel additives and natural gasoline denaturant.  \n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nBlue Flint Ethanol has developed an employee participation program.  All process safety information, process hazard analysis (PHA) results, recommendations, and action items, incident investigations, compliance audits, operating procedures, emergency response plan, and records of management of change are available to the operating personnel at any time. \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis and Process Safety Information\n\nThe facility utilizes the hazard and operability study (HAZOP) process hazard analysis methodology.  The PHA identified the following potential major hazards: fire, explosion, over-pressurization, corrosion, over-filling and equipment failure.  The facility utilizes process controls such as vents, relief valves, check valves, manual shutoffs, automatic shutoffs, interlocks, alarms and procedures, grounding equipment and excessive flow devices to prevent or limit releases.  \n\n\n\nBlue Flint Ethanol keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the facility.

The facility also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, piping and instrument drawings.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures and Training\n\nBlue Flint Ethanol maintains written procedures that address all modes of process operations, including normal operations, manual operation, regeneration, and emergency shutdown. The facility has developed and implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in facility operations.  \n\n\n\nContractors\n\nThe contractor safety procedures establish minimum guidelines and activities in order to assure that the contractor's employees follow safe work practices and procedures.  The procedure includes a contractor screening process and hazard awareness, safety and emergency procedures training.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews\n\nBlue Flint Ethanol conducts a pre-startup safety review (PSSR) for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe facility's mechanical integrity program includes written procedures, training, and regular inspections and equipment testing procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief systems, pumps, emergency shutdown systems, and controls in a safe operating condition.  \n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe facility's management of change (MOC) program reviews all proposed changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures, materials, and design conditions prior to implementation of the change.

The procedure establishes the minimum guidelines and activities of the incident investigation program in order to reduce the likelihood of repetitive occurrences of events which could reasonably lead to catastrophic releases.  Investigations will be undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent a similar release in the future.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nThe facility will conduct audits of the provisions of RMP to verify that procedures and practices developed under the standard are adequate and are being followed.  The audit will include a review of documentation and process safety information, inspection of the physical facilities, and interviews with all levels of plant personnel.\n\n\n\n4.
