This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility\u00bfs processes.  It is the practice of Enterprise Products Operating LLC. (Enterprise) to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Iowa City Terminal located in Johnson County, Iowa is owned by Enterprise Termianls and Storage LLC and is operated by Enterprise Products Operating, LLC.\n\nThe Iowa City Terminal is a wholesale terminal facility for the storage, loading and redelivery of flammable hydrocarbon liquids and NGL\u00bfs.  The facility receives, via attached pipelines, a mixed ethane / propane and pure propane products for storage in underground DOT regulated cavern storage.  The facility also has three above ground propane storage tanks that serve as bulk storage for the propane terminal operations.    Propane is odorized with ethyl mercaptan and delivered to tanker trucks at the Iowa City Terminal.\n\nThe Iowa City Terminal was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Enterprise identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site based on facility knowledge.  Propane is the only listed flammable substance which is stored above the threshold quantities at the Iowa City Terminal.  Ethyl mercaptan, which is used for odorizing the project loaded into the tanker trucks, is also stored at the facility but is present below the threshold quantity..  The Terminal is subject to the"

There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Iowa City Terminal.  The operations at the terminal are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation, and are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard.  This summary addresses each of the PSM program elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nActive employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the terminal\u00bfs PSM program is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals.  Employee involvement helps to insure that all perspectives regarding PSM compliance and accident prevention are considered and that the best ideas are implemented.  Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all aspects of safety and health issues concerning the employees and the public.\n\nEnterprise strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs.  These programs include regularly scheduled safety meeting, tail-gate safety meetings, hazard communications, Safety Suggestion Forms, a \u00bfnear-miss\u00bf reporting system and special training programs such as emergency response training, first aid training, etc.\n\nEnterprise actively seeks employee involvement in the development and conduct of all accident prevention"

Accident prevention is discussed at the regularly scheduled safety meetings and/or during special training sessions if necessary.  Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors and to bring any questions, comments or suggestions forward for open discussion.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nComplete and accurate written process safety information concerning process chemicals, process technology and process equipment is essential to an effective PSM and RMP program as well as completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis.  The process safety information will be useful to the operators, the team performing a process hazard analysis and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.  Process safety information is readily available to all employees.  Enterprise keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain a safe operating process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemicals inventories and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).\n\nEnterprise also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure ratings, temperature ratings and electrical rating of equipment.  This information in combination with written procedures and trained personnel provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to insure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Iowa City Terminal has a comprehensive program to help insure that hazards a"

Within this program, each portion of the facility is systematically examined to identify hazards and insure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nEnterprise primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and What-if/Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of Enterprise staff which has operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps insure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help insure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the terminal periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the responses to the team findings are also documented and retained.\n \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Iowa City Terminal maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations such as; (1) start-up, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, ("

These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.  Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.\n\nThe intent of the operating procedures is to provide workable, useful and clearly written instructions for conducting operating activities.  To have effective operating procedures, the task and procedures directly and indirectly related to the covered process must be appropriate, clear, consistent and most importantly communicated to employees.  Operating procedures are specific instructions or details on what steps are taken or followed in carrying out the stated procedures.  The specific instructions include the applicable safety precautions and appropriate information on safety implications.\n\nTraining\n\nIn addition to training on operating procedures, the Iowa City Terminal has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the terminal.  New employees receive basic training in pipeline, storage and terminal operations.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to insure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at lease every three years.  All of this training is documented for each operator including the means to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Iowa City Terminal uses contractors during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

In addition, the Iowa City Terminal evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the contractor selection process.  Enterprise personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to insure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\nThe Iowa City Terminal conducts a PSSR on any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to insure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Iowa City Terminal has well established practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment.  The basic aspects of this program include (1) training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting equipment deficiencies, when identified and (5) applying quality assurance measures.

The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\n\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe operations at the Iowa City Terminal have hazards that must be managed to insure continued safe operation.  The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all operations at the Iowa City Terminal, including the RMP covered terminal operation.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe Iowa City Terminal has safety features throughout the terminal area to help contain/control a release, to quickly detect a release and reduce the consequence of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n \n\nRelease Detection\n\n?\tHydrocarbon (hazardous gas) detectors and ala"

Over the past five years there have been no large or small releases, with no injuries or offsite consequences.  \n\n\nEmergency Procedures Information\n\nThe Iowa City Terminal maintains a written emergency procedure, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The procedures are for the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the terminal facilities.  The emergency procedure changes are administered through the Management of Change process.\n \n\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Iowa City Terminal is coordinated with the Johnson County Emergency Management (LEPC)."

      "SummaryText": "This coordination includes periodic meetings with the anticipated first responder, the West Branch Fire Department.  The Iowa City Terminal has around-the-clock communications capability with the local police and fire department, which provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  The Iowa City Terminal also provides periodic site orientation and refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the terminal.  \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Iowa City Terminal resolves all findings from PHA\u00bfs, some of which result in modifications to the storage and loading operations.  Additionally, employee recommendations to improve the safety of the storage and loading operations are reviewed and implemented if they are judged to be effective in improving terminal safety or reducing accident risk.  At the present time, the following change that should help to improve operating safety is planned at the terminal:\n\n?\tAdditional catwalks are planned for installation in several locations around the facility to improve employee access to equipment and technician operating safety."
