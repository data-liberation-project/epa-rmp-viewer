Our management conducts comprehensive annual audits to measure regulatory compliance including those governing the safe handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia.  Management requires a timely written response with the completion date of all recommendations resulting from the audits.\n\nFarmers Mill & Elevator, Inc. has appointed a \"site safety coordinator\" as an extension of management to monitor the day to day safe work activities, maintain the regulatory record keeping, conduct regular safety meetings and conduct employee training.  \n\nFarmers Mill & Elevator, Inc. is a wholesale and retail farm supply distribution center.  We store and distribute a wide variety of pesticides and fertilizers including Anhydrous Ammonia.  Ammonia is received by the truckload and is handled and stored on-site and is a regulated substance by the EPA requiring us to comply with the Risk Management Program.  We sell anhydrous ammonia to grower customers in 500 gallon, 1,000 gallon and 1,500 gallon nurse tanks.  The customer applies the ammonia into the soil as a source of nitrogen fertilizer for growing agricultural crops.\n\nFarmers Mill & Elevator, Inc. maintains (2) 500 gallon nurse tanks, (33) 1,000 gallon nurse tanks and (26) 1,500 gallon nurse tanks for customer delivery.  Our combined storage capacity in nurse tanks is 34"

The largest single-storage vessel at our facility contains 140,000 pounds.\n\n\"Worst-Case Scenario/Alternative-Case Scenario: This facility has developed a worst-case and alternative-case scenario however it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as security-sensitive information as requested by EPA\"\nOur ammonia system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shut-offs and emergency shut-off valves.  The loadout risers used for the purpose of filling the nurse tanks are protected by excess flow valves and fill line breakaways to immediately stop the flow of ammonia if a line or a hose fails.  All of the main storage tank valves and the riser load valves are locked when not in use.\n\nOur ammonia system is inspected on a regular basis with maintenance and preventive maintenance scheduled and documented.  Liquid and vapor valves, hoses, excess flow valves, gauges and relief valves are replaced when necessary and/or according to the guidelines in the ANSI standards.\n\nTraining is provided to all employees at least annually, whenever there is a change in the process or whenever competency with the regulations is questioned.  The training consists of classroom lecture, current videos, testing and certification and on the job training.\n\nThere has been no accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caused deaths, injuries, property  or environmental damage including evacuations on or off site.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our ammonia system, it is our policy to notify the local community fire department and request that they respond to the emergency.
