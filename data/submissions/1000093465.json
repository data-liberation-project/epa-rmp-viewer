The facility is designed as a vertically integrated polyvinyl chloride (PVC) manufacturing facility that also produces intermediate products, including chlorine (and caustic soda as a byproduct), ethylene dichloride, vinyl chloride monomer, hydrochloric acid, and ethylene. This facility has been designed in a manner that minimizes the potential for accidental releases. Shintech is committed to operating this facility in a manner that is safe for the plant workers, the public, and the environment. Shintech has many years of experience and an excellent environmental and safety track record. Shintech strives to protect and promote the health and safety of its employees, its neighbors, and others who may be affected by activities at the facility, and to limit adverse effects on the physical environment in which its activities are carried out. Shintech has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility. \n\n\n\nOne part of these systems is a risk management program that helps manage the risks at the facility and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) rule 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule), and the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) regulation (LAC 33:III.Chapter 59). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMP) describing the risk management program at the facility. An initial RMP for the facility was submitted to EPA via the RMP Submit Program in June 2008. Pursuant to LAC 33:III.Chapter.59, the registration was submitted to the LDEQ within 60 days of the stationary source becoming subject to this regulation. Shintech registered with LDEQ in June 2008. If anything changes within the registration, it will be submitted t"

      "SummaryText": "o LDEQ within 60 days of the change. Likewise, Shintech will update its RMP at least once every five years or when changes at the facility require revisions to the RMP. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP executive summary requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the facility.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES \n\n\n\nShintech is committed to minimizing potential risks to the general public, to the facility employees, and to the environment. \n\n\n\nA fundamental part of this commitment is the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances in and around the facility. The facility utilizes engineering controls, inspection programs, and detailed procedures to prevent accidental releases. In the event of a release, the facility has well-trained emergency response teams to contain, mitigate, monitor, and stop the release. The facility has fully staffed and trained emergency response teams for firefighting and emergency rescue. In addition to handling the release, the facility also participates in established communication systems to alert the community in the event of a significant release. Through the coordination with the local emergency planning commission (LEPC), the facility has the ability to provide emergency notification to the local community through cable override systems, radio broadcasts, and/or through an automated telephone notification system.\n\n\n\nDEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT A MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\n\n\nThe Shintech Environmental Manager is responsible for the development and implementation of the risk management program for the facility. However, the specific responsibilities for certain aspects of that program will be delegated to other personnel who will report either directly or through other management personnel to the Environmental Manager. Similarly, responsibility for the RMP offsite consequence analysis and five-year accident history has been delegated"

      "SummaryText": " to the Environmental Supervisor. The Safety/Security Supervisor is responsible for Emergency Response and Process Safety Information. Furthermore, it is the facility's policy that safe operation is part of everyone's job; therefore, many other site personnel will also be involved in RMP activities on an ongoing basis. See RMP Management System in Appendix B for a layout of the facility personnel's responsibilities. \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nBecause the facility is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, and because the OSHA PSM requirements are very similar to the EPA RMP requirements, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements. The PSM program at this facility has been extended by the facility, where necessary, to satisfy EPA's Program Level 3 accident prevention program requirements.\n\n\n\nShintech has developed a management system to oversee implementation of the RMP elements. Shintech assigns responsibility for implementing individual requirements of the program to identified persons exhibiting respective qualifications.

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and recommendations from these updates are documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES \n\n\n\nThe facility maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. Procedures are maintained current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made to the process. In addition, the facility's operating procedures provide guidance on how to respond to events that result in exceeding safe operating limits for specific process or equipment parameters. The written operating procedures are readily available to operators and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nTRAINING \n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the facility has implemented a training program for all employees involved in operating a process. All operations employees receive basic training in the facility operations.
