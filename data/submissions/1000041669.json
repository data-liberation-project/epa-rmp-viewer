The Facility Policy:\r\n\r\nThe Facility owner, management, and employees of Gavilon Fertilizer, LLC are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  Local responders are encouraged to visit the Facility to gain first hand knowledge of the site. Employees are required to hold monthly safety meeting and include sections of the management plan in those meetings.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with local fire departments, and other authorities to mitigate any release, and to minimize the impact of a release on the population and environment.\r\n\r\nII.   Facility Information:\r\n\r\nThe primary activity of the Facility is to distribute agricultural fertilizer for the farming industry in the area.  Part of the fertilizer comes in the form of Anhydrous Ammonia, here after referred to as ammonia.  Ammonia is received, store, and used in the production of non-hazardous liquid fertilizer solutions. Ammonia is an important \r\nsource of Nitrogen for agricultural crops during the spring and fall of the year.\r\n \r\nThe maximum quantity that can be stored at the facility is 131,000 pounds.  The typical method of receiving ammonia is by truck transport containing 40,000 pounds. The transports are unloaded into the stationary storage tank.  A pump transfers the ammonia to the batch process. Batch processes are intermittently operated. \r\n\r\nIII.  Accidental Release Prevention:\r\n   \r\nThe Facility takes guidance from material published by the American National Standards  Institute Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia K61.1, and Compressed Gas Association CGA G-2 for design, construction, and maintenance of the process equipment.  The Facility also has a Process Safety  Program that dovetails the RMP. The Facility tries to minimize the amount of ammonia held or stored at the facility through management ju"
