Hillshire Brands - Storm Lake operations include slaughtering, de-boning, and some processing. Hillshire Brands - Storm Lake has been in operation at this facility for over 45 years providing quality meat products and over 650 jobs to the local community.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\n\n\nHillshire Brands is committed to protecting the health of its employees, the surrounding community, and the environment. It is Hillshire Brands policy to maintain a safe and healthy workplace, protect the environment, and comply with all applicable regulations, including 40 CFR 68, as applicable. Accidental releases are kept small or eliminated and emergency response readiness is maintained through our processes implemented per requirements of these regulations.\n\n\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nHillshire Brands is required to maintain low temperatures in the food processing areas of the plant that are within standards required by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to ensure quality in the final products. Hillshire Brands also operates freezers and coolers for product storage.  Hillshire Brands uses anhydrous ammonia (the 112(r) regulated substance) as a refrigerant to maintain the facility within the required range of operating temperatures and to operate the freezers and coolers. Anhydrous ammonia is an industry-standard refrigerant for meat processing plants. Hillshire Brands' refrigeration system, consisting of receivers, compressors, evaporators, condensers, and piping, contains over 10,000 pounds of anhydrous amm"

In addition, Hillshire Brands' ammonia refrigeration system is designed and constructed in accordance with accepted industry standards and good engineering practices. \n\n\n\nHillshire Brands has also developed and implemented a PSM program pursuant to OSHA regulations and as such, has evaluated the system for the potential of anhydrous ammonia releases. Some of the controls installed to prevent catastrophic releases of ammonia are process equipment (pressure relief valves, backup pumps, and manual shutoffs) and automated controls (automatic level controls and automatic process shutdown).  In addition, Hillshire Brands has trained approximately 20 personnel to respond to potential ammonia releases (HAZWOPER team).\n\n\n\nHillshire Brands has developed standard operating procedures for all employees and contractors that have contact with the ammonia refrigeration system that incorporate safety measures into the procedures.  These safety procedures were developed by refrigeration system operators and are reviewed on an annual basis.  Hillshire Brands encourages employee participation in development of the control measures used at the plant by means of company newsletters, employee participation meetings, and training sessions.  Pursuant to written management of change procedures established by Hillshire Brands, any changes to the operating procedures are to be communicated to affected employees.\n\n\n\nHillshire Brands understands that maintaining the refrigeration system in good working order is essential to preventing accidental releases; therefore Hillshire Brands has implemented a preventative maintenance program.
