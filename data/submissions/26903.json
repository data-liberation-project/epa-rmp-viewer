Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\nJCI is committed to being a responsible member of any community in which it has operations by giving top priority to operating in a safe and environmentally sound manner. Corporate policy dictates that facilities continuously identify methods to provide the safest working environment possible to its employees and to reduce the risk to the community and environment through implementation of inherently safer technology and procedures. This commitment to safe and environmentally sound operations is documented in the corporate policy and compliance/procedure manuals, which are available to all employees. This facility stresses safe and environmentally sound operations in employee training programs, and in written materials available at the facility. This facility\u00bfs safety and environmental programs include monthly safety meetings of all employees. JCI has an environmental manual and a safety manual that cover general environmental and safety best practices and compliance topics. Each employee at this facility has access to the environmental and safety manuals that cover topics specific to this facility. There are regularly scheduled safety and environmental audits conducted by facility management, and periodic safety and periodic safety and environmental audits of the facility conducted by JCI corporate personnel. This risk management program document has been prepared to meet the requirements of the U.S. Environment Protection Agency\u00bfs Risk Management Program regulations as stated in 40 CFR Part 68 (Appendix A).\n\n2. The JCI Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe primary function of this facility is to protect public health by supplying chemicals including chlorine and sodium hypochlorite to disinfect bulk water systems. The primary operations conducted at this facility include that distribution of inorganic chemicals and repackaging of inorganic gases. Chemicals are brou"

Any residual compressed gas is absorbed in an appropriate solution and sold as product. The regulated substance handled by this facility is chlorine.\n\n3. The Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe WCS for toxic substances at this facility is the instantaneous release of the entire contents of a single 90-ton chlorine railcar. This is the scenario that is estimated to create the greatest distance in any direction to a chlorine toxic endpoint of 0.0087 milligrams per liter (mg/1). Chlorine is a dense toxic gas stored as a liquid under pressure at atmospheric temperature. For the WCS release analysis, the following assumptions were made: a ground-level release of 180,000 pounds of liquid chlorine over 10 minutes; generally flat, unobstructed (rural) terrain surrounding the facility; and atmospheric conditions of 1.5 meter per second (mps) wind speed, F stability class, and 77 degrees F ambient temperature. Although there are numerous installed control measures that, in an actual event, would mitigate the release, no credit for mitigation measures was taken into account for this scenario as required by the RMP regulations. Dispersion modeling of the WCS was conducted using RMP*Comp version 1.03. RMP*Comp was developed for use in performing the OCA required under EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Planning rule.\n\nTo assist in emergency response planning, this facility has developed an ACS as required by the RMP regulations. ACS and hazard assessment results are useful for assessing the potential hazards posed by the facility and developing or assessing emergency response plans to respond to such an event. These scenarios are unlikely, but are physically possible. For the ACS analysis, the following assumptions were made: rural terrain surrounding the facility and atmospheric conditions of 3.0 mps win"

As allowed by the RMP regulations, active mitigation measures were considered and are described under each scenario. This facility conducted dispersion modeling of the ACS using RMP*Comp.\n\nThe ACS associated with the release of toxic substances at this facility is a crack in a whip (transfer) line at the 1-ton chlorine cylinder filling station. This facility believes that this scenario, although unlikely, could occur based on its knowledge of similar accidents that have occurred at other chlorine facilities. A whip line crack would not result in a significant release of chlorine from a tank or vessel, because chlorine detectors continually monitor the area and the railcar unloading station is equipped with automatic shutdown valves. However, a whip line crack could result in a 5-second jet release of liquid chlorine from a process line or a gas cylinder from a height of 1 meter. Five seconds was the estimated maximum time required for an operator or emergency responder to respond to an alarm from area detectors and close the valve on the whip line. The estimated size of the crack in the line is equivalent to a 1/8-inch diameter hole. The amount of chlorine released from an open, 6-foot long, 1/8-inch diameter opening in the line at 165 pounds per square inch gauge (psig), would be 7.5 pounds, including the volume of chlorine in the line, at a rate of 89.9 pounds per minute.\n\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe prevention programs described in this facility\u00bfs Safety, Engineering, and Safety Training Manuals represent integrated administrative controls intended to ensure the safety of workers, the public, and the environment. Many of these prevention programs (e.g., PHAs, compliance audits, incident investigations) result in the development and implementation of additional safeguards (administrative and engineering controls).

The covered processes are also equipped with alarms to alert personnel when the operating parameters exceed the allowable limits. This facility developed procedures and conducted training of personnel to familiarize them with the consequences of exceeding allowable limits (safety and operability) to ensure the correct response to the alarms. Safeguards to prevent, detect, or mitigate accidental releases of regulated substances are described in the facility\u00bfs Safety, Engineering, and Safety Training Manuals.\n\n5. The Five-Year Accident History\n\nThis facility compiled a five-year accident history (1997 - present) for all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries,  or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage as required by the RMP regulations. The five-year accident history allows the Fort Lauderdale Facility to explain to the community the factors causing or contributing to accidental releases, the on-site and off-site impacts of accidental releases, and the procedural and technological changes made to minimize the likelihood that these accidental releases will never occur again. The intent of this information exchange is to create an informed community, while also documenting that accidental releases are investigated and concrete changes are made to protect against recurrence.\n\nPersonnel at the Fort Lauderdale Facility reviewed all incident investigation reports from January 1, 1997 to the present to identify accidental releases of extremely hazardous substances that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. Three accidental releases were identified.\n\n6. The"

Instead, the facility is included in the written community emergency response plan. These activities are coordinated through the Broward County HazMat.\n\nThe Fort Lauderdale facility does though have a detailed Emergency Action Plan to cover minor incidents at the facility. The facility\u00bfs Contingency Plan Manual covers these activities.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nStudies associated with prevention program elements such as PHAs, incident investigations, management of change, and compliance audits are regularly conducted at this facility to verify designs and to identify potential hazards. Recommendations may be developed as a result of those studies and as a result of equipment inspections, safety meetings, review of industry experience, technology improvements, and employee suggestions. Once formulated, recommendations are reviewed and corresponding actions items are developed to implement each recommendation.\n\nJCI Fort Lauderdale personnel reviewed the following documents to identify all action items that were formulated to reduce the risk (severity or likelihood) of an incident that could have plausibly resulted in an off-site consequence (i.e., the emergency response planning guideline level 2 [ERPG-2] developed by the American Industrial Hygiene Association for toxic gases): \n\n- Accident Investigation Reports\n- Job Safety Analyses\n- Standard Operating Procedures\n\nNo action items meeting the selection criteria were identified."
