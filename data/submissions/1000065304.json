      "SummaryText": "The 590,000 foot facility serves as a holding and distribution warehouse for factory packaged household, commercial and industrial chemicals. Products include sanitation and maintenance products like detergents, hand care, degreasers, deodorants, lubricants and pest control solutions.\r\nProducts are received by truck at numerous docks on the Northside of the facility. Products are moved to dedicated storage areas within the warehouse based on product type which is programmed into the computerized inventory control system. Aerosols products are stored in the Aerosol Storage Room. Flammable liquids are stored in flammable liquids room. Corrosives are stored depending on the products pH in either the base or acid rooms. As needed, products are pulled and staged at docks along the South sides of the facility for shipping to end users. Cross docking is conducted where products are received from one carrier, staged at the loading docks and shipped out as partial loads the same day.\r\nThe warehouse has been constructed with five separate fire rated areas. Early suppression Fast Response (ESFR) sprinklers have been installed within 12 inches of the exterior walls throughout the facility. In rack sprinklers have been installed in each of the four tiers of the aerosol and flammable storage racks. The building is 100% sprinkled. Fire protection valves are electronically supervised with a central station signaling system. Separate storage areas have been constructed with fire rated walls, 2 or 3-hour fire rated automatically closing fire doors. Fire Department is within one mile of the facility. The warehouse has an access control system, fencing, perimeter lighting and physical barriers.\r\nThe Worst Case Release scenario was defined by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The endpoint distance is defined in the RMP Rule as the distance from the point of detonation to a point of an overpressure of 1 pound per square inch (psi).  The worst case scenario was further clarified"

      "SummaryText": "in correspondence from Mr. Jim Makris, EPA Director Chemical Emergency Preparedness and Prevention office, to Mr. John E. DiFazio, Jr., Senior Counsel for the Chemical Specialties Manufacturers Association (CSMA).  According to Mr. Makris, the worst case scenario would be categorized by the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single vessel or process line failure. Based upon this definition, the worst case release scenario could be considered that of a single retail sized 12 ounce aerosol container. However, to be conservative, this RMP assumed an entire pallet of 1,224, 12 oz. aerosol containers, containing 50 percent isobutene, propane, butane or dimethyl ether, the most distant end point was determined to be 0.06 miles, with no effect on any public receptors or have any off site consequences. The facility emergency response plan provides guidance to include local emergency responders such as police, fire, and rescue as appropriate. \r\nFacilities subject to the RMP rule are also required to report accidents and releases occurring in the last five years in which exposure to a regulated flammable substance, overpressure generated by an explosion of the substance, or radiant heat generated by a fire involving the substance led to death, injury, or response or restoration activities at an environmental receptor on-site or off-site. The facility certifies in the RMP submission to the EPA that during the past five years, no accidental releases have occurred involving regulated flammable substances from the warehousing of aerosol products.\r\nBased upon the above information, the Zep Georgia Distribution Center (GDC) warehousing operations have been characterized as a Program 1, single process facility."
