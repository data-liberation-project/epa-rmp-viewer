Additionally, specific training is required in all aspects of the operation of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes for those who operate the processes. Training in maintenance and repair of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide process equipment is conducted with all employees who are required to maintain and repair any part of the system.\n\n\n\nDecatur Utilities has developed a chlorine and sulfur dioxide Emergency Response Program to fulfill the requirements of OSHA Part 1910.38. The Emergency Response Program is coordinated with the local and state emergency response plan.\n\n\n\n\n\nPart 68.155 Section B\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled \n\n\n\nThe Dry Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant has one stationary source capable of holding twelve (12) 1-ton containers of chlorine as well as one stationary source capable of holding eight (8) 1-ton containers of sulfur dioxide.

The management system clearly delineates accountability and responsibility of specific elements of the program to the appropriate Risk Management Plan Team Member.\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nCurrent process safety information is available to all operators of the covered processes and maintenance employees in accordance with CFR 40 Part 68.48. Safety information includes current SDS sheets, maximum intended inventory, safe upper and lower temperatures, pressures, and flows, process equipment and material specifications, safe operating procedures and codes and standards used in the design and construction of the process.\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nA Hazard Analysis has been performed for the Program II covered processes. A checklist was used from Exhibits F-26, F-27, and F-28 of the EPA Supplemental Risk Management Program for Wastewater Treatment Plants.  Causes of potential accidental release scenarios were investigated and safeguards put in place to prevent a release.  The process hazard analysis was documented and is updated every five years.\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nProcess operating procedures were reviewed, documented, and refresher training conducted with all plant operators and maintenance employees.  Operating procedures cover all phases of process operations including system startup, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and startup following an emergency shutdown.  \n\n\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nChlorine and sulfur dioxide safety training is performed at least once every 3 years.
