The Facility Policy\n        The Board of Directors, management, and employees of Farmers Supply Co-op (the facility) are commited to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, the Pondera County Disaster & Emergency Services, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n        -The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizer for sale to farmers.\n\n        -Anhydrous Ammonia is recieved, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.\n\n        -The maximum quantity stored would be 39,700 pounds in our semi trailer.  The maximum quantity handled would be 39,700 pounds which would be in the semi trailer.\n\n3. The worst case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\n         a. The worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of the semi trailer released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 39,700 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 3.1 miles.\n\n          b. The alternative release scenario would be the release of 11,908 pounds through a leak in a pipe that is two inches in diameter over a two minute time frame.  This represents the maximum amount of product that can feasibly exit through the afore men"

The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .83 miles.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\n        The facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n5. The Five-year Accident History.\n\n         a. There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n             -have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\n             -to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. The emergency response program.\n\n          -The facility has provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title lll (EPCRA).\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n           Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
