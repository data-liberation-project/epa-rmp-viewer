The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident of a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to refinery management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees and contractors who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the refinery periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  PSM compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to refinery management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe processes at the refinery have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to the refinery Program 3 processes.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human er"

The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\n\nRelease Detection\n  Hydrocarbon and H2S detectors with alarms.\n  Cameras and monitors.\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n  Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases.\n  Scrubbers to control/neutralize hydrocarbon or chemicals.\n  Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual/automatic)\n  Automated shutdown systems for specific parameters.   (e.g., high level, pressure, temperature)\n  Vessels to permit partial removal of process inventory.\n  Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases.\n  Redundant equipment and instruments (e.g., uniterruptible power supply, backup pumps)\n  Relief devices.\n\nRelease Mitigation\n  Fire suppression and extinguishing systems.\n  Deluge system for specific equipment.\n  Trained emergency response personnel.\n  Personal protective equipment.\n  Blast-resistant buildings to protect control systems.\n\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nThe refinery has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past 5 years.  There have been no RMP reportable incidents in the past 5 years.\n\nEmergency Response Program Information:\n\nThe refinery maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a relea"

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to information created as part of the refinery accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the refinery and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the refinery has a number of initiatives that address process safety and employee issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe refinery keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.

The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program., each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe refinery primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.

This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as unit startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators, and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nThe refinery also maintains a Key Process Parameter Document that provides guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process and equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written proc"

      "SummaryText": "edures for process operations, the refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in refinery operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, shills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe refinery uses contractors to supplement its workforce.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has procedures in place to ensure that contractors perform their work in a safe manner, have the appropriate knowledge and skills, are aware of the hazards in their workplace, understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, understand and follow site safety rules, and inform plant personnel of  any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with a process overview, information about safety and health hazards, emergency response plan requirements, and safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the refinery also evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Refinery personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe refinery conducts a PSSR for an"

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements were properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe refinery has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include conducting training, developing written procedures, performing inspections and tests, correcting identified deficiencies, and applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on an overview of the process, safety and health hazards, applicable maintenance procedures, emergency response plans, and applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.
