The natural gasoline is stored in a 56,400-gallon above ground floating roof bulk liquid storage tank and is introduced to the 200-proof ethanol in the final stage of production.  The denaturant tank is located in the facility's tank farm containment area which consists of secondary containment berm and impervious synthetic liner.  Center Ethanol has evaluated the worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the reportable substances.  An emergency response program for these scenarios has been prepared and implemented.  Center Ethanol has coordinated emergency response with the local authorities and conducts periodic emergency response drills.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\nThrough completion of this RMP, Center Ethanol has complied with the EPA Chemical Accident Prevention requirements under 40 CFR Part 68 and the Occupational Health and Safety Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements under 29 CFR 1910.119 for the denaturant storage tank and handling systems.  Process safety information and operations/maintenance procedures are documented on-site.  Periodic functions such as process hazard analyses, employee emergency response and process operations training, management of change reviews, and process safety inspections are conducted on a regular basis.  Audits of the overall RMP will be conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA regulations.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\nCenter Ethanol began operations in 2008 and does not have a history of accidents which may have caused death, injuries, environmental or property damage, evacuations or in-place sheltering since the startup of operations."

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\nCenter Ethanol Company, LLC (Center Ethanol) operates a fuel ethanol plant located in the village of Sauget, St. Clair County, Illinois.  The plant is permitted to produce 63 million gallons of denatured ethanol per year (Construction Permit 06030020).  In accordance with the United States Environmental Protection Agency's Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions at Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68, Center Ethanol has completed a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for covered processes that contain an RMP listed toxic or flammable substance at a quantity exceeding the corresponding program applicability threshold. \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nCenter Ethanol is committed to the protection of its employees, the community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process specifically pentane as a constituent of the natural gasoline used as the ethanol denaturant to make the fuel ethanol unfit for human consumption.  It is the policy of Center Ethanol to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  In the event of an emergency, including an accidental release of natural gasoline, it is the policy of Center Ethanol to notify the National Response Center, Illinois Emergency Management Agency, and the Local Emergency Planning Committees for St. Clair County, Illinois, and to evacuate all non-essential employees and all visitors from the facility.\r\n\r\nRegulated Substances Handled\r\nThe facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn and a process by-product known as dry distillers grain with solubles, which is used as a livestock feed.  The fuel ethanol production process requires use of a denaturant (natural gasoline) which is reported to contain up to 30 percent pentane, up to 30 percent isopentane, and up to 5 percent butane, which are RMP regulated flammable substances.  The maximum amount of natural gasoline on-site is estimated to be approximately 353,"
