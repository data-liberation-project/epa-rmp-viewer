It is our policy to adhear to all applicable Federal, State, and local regulations. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately vacate the premises, move to a safe location, and notify the Lohrville Volunteer Fire Department (via a 911 call) and request that it respond to the emergency. Incidental to the notification to the fire department, a call to the Region 5 LEPC will be made.\n\nWhile we have planned for an emergency, it is acknowledged that a real emergency will be unexpected and may very well be different and cannot be ensured to duplicate what may have been planned. In reality, the situation that develops may not happen in the manner in which it has been planned. In that event, what we may have planned will serve only as a guideline to follow.\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility describes certian procedures that are intended to minimize the hazzards assiciated with human health and the environment from fires, explosions, the sudden and unexpected release of chemicals (i.e., Anhydrous Ammonia), tornadoes, bomb threats or other accidents or acts of God which might occur on our premises.\n\nThe primary emergency response coordinator for the Lohrville, Iowa location is Don Stelling, location manager. His work and 24-hour emergency response telephone numbers are provided in the Registration Section of this document. The 24-hour emergency response number provided in that section also provides a telephone tree for additional individuals who are available and can respond to an emergency at that location.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE ANHYDROUS AMMONIA STORAGE/DISTRIBUTION PLANT AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED AT NEW COOPERATIVE, INC.

In this instance, nurse tanks are parked in a lot that is not situated on continguous property to the bulk plant. At any one point in time between 1-20 nurse tanks could be parked in this lot awating pickup or delivery to area crop producers. The specific address of the parking lot is described in the registration section of this document.\n\nTHE WORSE-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\nThe worse-case senario is the failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), resulting in the release of the total volume in a gaseous (hazardous ammomia vapor cloud) form. According to EPA's RMP* Comp (Version 1.06. The alternative release scenarion involves the transport delivery vehicle pulling away from the intake lines into the storage plant without disconnecting the transfer hoses. \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable State and local codes and regulations. The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with ANSI Standard k-61.1-1995 and State Law.\n\nIn addition the company has specific operating procedures in place intended to minimize the potential for an accidental (and potentially catastrophic) release of anhydrous ammonia. Finally, NEW Cooperative, Inc. has extended to the LOHRVILLE Volunteer Fire Department the opportunity to visit our anhydrous ammonia plant, to participate in mock emergency simulation training, and to avail themselves of specific anhydrous ammonia health hazard information and training provided by the company.\n\nFIVE- YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nNEW Cooperative, Inc.

In the unlikely event that the Lohrville Volunteer Department is unable to adequately respond to an emergency at our Rands location, mutual aid (reciprocal agreement between neighboring fire departments) will be summoned. We have discussed this policy with the fire department and Region 5 LEPC. Members of the fire department and the LEPC have inspected our anhydrous plant.
