Sulfur dioxide is piped from a ton-container to each chamber using pipe and ball valves. When in use, each chamber receives 80-90 lb of sulfur dioxide gas.\r\n\r\n1.2.2 Facility Location\r\n\r\nNational Raisin Exeter Dehydrator is located at 26783 Road 176, Exeter, CA 93221. The latitude and longitude of the high pressure receiver is 36.274861, -119.183722. The facility is located approximately 5 miles south of state highway 198 in a rural area surrounded primarily by agricultural land.\r\n\r\nAccording to FEMA Flood Map Service, the facility is located in an area with a 0.2 pct annual chance flood hazard. The minimal chance of flood hazard does not pose an imminent threat to the sulfur dioxide process equipment.\r\n\r\nNational Raisin Exeter Dehydrator is not located in an Alquist-Priolo Fault Zone as defined by the California Department of Conservation. In addition, a review of United States Geological Survey (USGS) fault maps revealed that there are no faults in close proximity to the site. The USGS 2018 One-Year Model revealed that National Raisin Exeter Dehydrator has a <1% chance of experiencing potentially minor-damage due to ground shaking in 2018.\r\n\r\n1.2.3 Description of Covered Process\r\n\r\nThe sulfur dioxide process at National Raisin Exeter Dehydrator consists of a storage area for ton containers and an injection area where sulfur dioxide is added to the chambers an"

As needed, isolation valves for the chambers are opened and either 80 lb (Chambers 2-12) or 90 lb (Chambers 13-24) of sulfur dioxide is injected into a chamber. \r\n\r\nThe sulfur dioxide is consumed by the product. When the proper amount of sulfur dioxide has been injected into the chamber the isolation valve for the chamber is closed. \r\nEmpty containers are picked up by the vendor for refilling.\r\n\r\nProcess Chemistry\r\n\r\nNational Raisin Exeter Dehydrator utilizes sulfur dioxide (SO2) as an antioxidant to protect the color and flavor in the dried fruit products that are produced. The sulfur dioxide is injected into the sulfur dioxide chambers through piping connected to a sulfur dioxide ton container. All sulfur dioxide gas permeates into the fruit and acts as a color preserving agent. \r\n\r\nSafety Systems\r\n\r\nSecure Container Storage\r\nAll ton containers are chocked and stored securely in a designated storage area.\r\n\r\nSignage\r\nSulfur-dioxide storage areas and piping are clearly marked.\r\n\r\nProtective Clothing\r\nPersonnel engaged in operations that will be subject to high or unknown concentrations of sulfur-dioxide will be provided with protective gloves, safety glasses, boots, pants, and/or a long sleeve shirt that are impervious to sulfur-dioxide.\r\n\r\nLocal Exhaust\r\nLocal exhaust ventilation is used when there is potential exposure to sulfur dioxide levels in excess of allowable standards.\r\n\r\nFencing\r\nThe sulfur-dioxide storage area is fenced with barbed wire on top of the fence to guard against trespassing. The fence is locked when unoccupied.\r\n\r\nGas Detector\r\nA portable sulfur-dioxide gas detector is used by applicators throughout the duration of the gassing process.\r\n\r\nRespirator\r\nAll applicators are equipped with a half-face cartridge respirator that must be worn throughout the duration of the gass"

Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\r\n\r\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, National Raisin Exeter Dehydrator has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\r\n\r\nFor the future, National Raisin Exeter Dehydrator now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a living document.
