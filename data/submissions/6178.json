      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nU.S. Growers Cold Storage has implemented emergency response policies in order to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nU.S. Growers maintains an emergency response committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Emergency Response Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes. \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe U.S. Growers Cold Storage facility is located between Boyle and Alcoa (the whole block) on East 44th Street (north side), Vernon, California.  U.S. Growers consists of three facilities that use ammonia for refrigeration, Areas 1, 2, and 7.\n\n Area 1 was built in 1996 with start up in January 1997.  \n Area 2 was built in 1998 with start up in October 1998.\n Area 7 was built in 1950\n\nAreas 1 and 2 utilize the same engine room equipment while Area 7 has a separate engine room.  The three areas are connected via a common liquid and suction header; however, they are operated separately as there is a valve in each header that is closed during normal operations.  The two separate ammonia refrigeration processes are closed systems that cycle the refrigerant, or ammonia, from liquid to gas and back again.  The processes, consisting of vessels, piping, valves, and process equipment, cycle ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order"

      "SummaryText": "to provide refrigeration for product and process equipment.\n\nChanges in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature: lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature.  Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat.  Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize.  Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid.  Typical operating conditions range from approximately 7 psig on the low pressure side of the system to 160 psig on the high side.  \n\n\u0015 Ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the refrigeration process.\n\n\u0015 The total ammonia inventory is 33,000 pounds.  The maximum intended inventory of ammonia at the U.S. Growers facility is 15,000 pounds in Area 7 and 18,000 pounds at the Areas 1&2 plant.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\nWorst Case Release Result Summary:\nThe worst case release scenario is a release of the total quantity of ammonia in the largest vessel in the ammonia refrigeration system, taking into account administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity in the vessel.  The Liquid Recirculating Unit #1 (located in the Engine Room) is the largest vessel in the system (with a capacity of 4000 gallons of ammonia, equivalent to 22,000 pounds of ammonia) and is assumed to contain the total charge of the Areas 1 & 2 system (18,000 pounds of ammonia) for the worst case scenario.  Since the Unit is enclosed by the facility, passive mitigation effects were taken into consideration when determining the release rate of ammonia to the outside atmosphere.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used: 1.5 m/s and F stability.  This facility is located in an urban setting.  The maximum potential downwind distance to 200 ppm was determined using Exhibit 4-4 from EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Facilities, November 1998.  This potential release scenario reaches off-site and may affect population re"

      "SummaryText": "ceptors.  No environmental receptors are affected by this potential scenario.\n\nAlternative Release Result Summary\nThe alternative release scenario was that of a 0.25 inch diameter leak of high pressure liquid ammonia for one hour.  The quantity of ammonia released in one hour at this rate is 7560 pounds.  This release could occur due to a gasket rupture, pinhole leak, flange seal leak, valve bonnet seal leak, etc. In addition, this release could occur outside; therefore passive mitigation measures were not utilized. The meteorological conditions used were 3 m/s and D stability. This facility is located in an urban setting.  The maximum potential downwind distance to 200 ppm was determined using Exhibit 4-5 from EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Facilities, November 1998.  This potential release scenario reaches off-site and may affect population receptors.  No environmental receptors are affected by this potential scenario.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nAdministrative Measures:\nThe facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines and standards including the following:\n\n\u0015 IIAR Bulletin 107, Suggested Safety and Operating Procedures When Making Ammonia Refrigeration Tie-ins\n\u0015 IIAR Bulletin 109, Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safe Ammonia Refrigeration System\n\u0015 IIAR Bulletin 110, Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\n\u0015 IIAR, A Guide to Good Practices for the Operation of an Ammonia Refrigeration System\n\nIn addition, U.S. Growers has implemented a Process Safety Management program for compliance with the OSHA 1910.119 regulation since September 1993.\n\nBuilding Codes:\nThe facility was constructed to comply with the current edition of all applicable codes, ordinances, regulations, and requirements of the local, county, state, and national bodies having jurisdiction.

U.S. Growers Cold Storage participates in many in house and regulatory functions that insure constant training to their employees in regards to Emergency Response.  \n\nU.S. Growers Cold Storage also meets 26 times a year to discuss regulatory requirements of the RMPP (OES), PSM (OSHA), Rule 1415 (AQMD), as well as other issues that affect compliance.  The purpose of these meetings is to inform all maintenance employees of any changes in the system, operating procedures, and any changes that might occur in the regulations.\n\nThe Crisis Emergency Response Hazardous Materials document (CER) is designed to assure proper protection during a crisis/emergency situation.  In the event of an emergency that could threaten human health or the environment, the Emergency Coordinator shall assess the situation and determine if area evacuations are necessary.
