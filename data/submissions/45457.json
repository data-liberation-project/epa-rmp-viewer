The Facility Policy\n\n    MFA Incorporated, and the employees of the MFA Bulk Fertilizer Plant near Brookfield are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Brookfield Fire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n    The primary activity at the facility is the receiving, storage and distribution of dry fertilizer, and anhydrous ammonia for direct application as a crop nutrient.\n\n    The maximum quantity stored would be 175,245 pounds in railroad tank car delivering product. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a railroad tank car holding approximately 175,245 pounds.  The facility has sixteen 1,000 gallon nurse tanks, therefore the facility total maximum storage would be 384,801 pounds.\n\n3. The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n    The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, 1981\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., the Missouri Anhydrous Ammonia Law, and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n4. The Five-year Accident History\n\n    There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n5. The Emergency Response Program.\n\n    The facility has;\n\n    a. a written emergency action plan, in accordance with "
