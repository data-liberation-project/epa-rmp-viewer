Our prevention and emergency response practices are developed to protect the public as well as our own employees.  It is our policy to comply with applicable laws, and to support and work with local emergency response agencies.\n\nDFA-Cabool has a refrigeration system which contains anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) in an amount greater than the threshold under the Risk Management Program (RMP) of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) according to Section 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR 68).  The refrigeration system is designed and operated according to good engineering and safe work practices.\n\nDFA-Cabool has established an Emergency Response Program that provides for trained personnel on call in the event of a release.  DFA-Cabool is also coordinated with the Cabool Fire Department and the Texas County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\nDFA-Cabool has an excellent safety record in preventing and minimizing releases of ammonia.\n\nFacility Information\nThe DFA-Cabool facility processes and packages dairy related products.  DFA has on site an ammonia refrigeration system used to maintain product freshness, to meet processing requirements, and to provide cooling for employee comfort.  DFA-Cabool is subject to the requirements of 40 CFR 68 because the refrigeration system contains more than the 10,000-pound threshold for ammonia, a regulated hazardous substance.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nDFA-Cabool has an accidental release prevention program to prevent and minimize the effects of a spill or release of ammonia.  This program includes a training program for all operators and maintenance personnel, written maintenance and operating pro"

As stated previously, DFA-Cabool\u00c2\u00bfs Emergency Response Program provides for trained personnel on call in the event of a release.

Plant ammonia trained personnel will initiate emergency shutdown procedures. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nSafety improvements are an on-going process at this facility.  Periodic inspections and evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations.  There are no additional specific regulated substance safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
