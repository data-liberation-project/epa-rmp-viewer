As part of this commitment, Domtar has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the hazardous chemical processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the facility and addresses compliance with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Regulation 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RM Plan) describing the Risk Management Program at each facility.  This document is intended to satisfy the RM Plan requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the Risk Management Program at DomtarA!A|s Nekoosa Mill, with regards to the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia at the companyA!A|s effluent treatment plant.  This plan has been updated, as of June 2009, to satisfy the five-year update requirement of the RMP rules.\nThe Risk Management Program at the facility consists of four elements:\n1.    A hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that may have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of the substances regulated by the RMP rule (Anhydrous Ammonia) - see topic 1.3;\n    \n2.    A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than the threshold quantity of the regulated substances (covered processes) - see topic 1.4;\n    \n3.    An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of the regulated substances from the covered processes - see topic 1.6; and \n\n4.    A management system that delineates responsibility for implementing and maintaining the Risk Management Plan.\n\nInformation further "

In fact, the facility has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards that are designed to minimize the potential for the release of any hazardous substance and injuries and damage resulting from the release of a hazardous substance.\nDomtar minimizes the potential releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility. When hazardous substances are used at the facility, the equipment is carefully designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\nDomtar limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs. The facility trains workers to respond to upset conditions, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs. In addition, the facility is working with the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) to help ensure that injuries and/or environmental damage will not occur in the event that a release does occur.\nThe safety programs at Domtar consist of a number of elements, only, some of which are required by the RMP Rule.  This Risk Management Plan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at the facility that are required by the RMP Rule.\n\n1.1    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nDomtar is committed to the safety of workers and the public, as well as the preservation of the environment through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The facility implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of the hazardous substances.  These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operati"

Domtar provides response training for upset conditions to facility personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local emergency response organizations.\n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, the facility has established a management system directed by the General Manager, Nekoosa Mill.\n\n1.2    Description of Regulated Process / Substance \nDomtar owns and operates a wastewater treatment facility used by the Nekoosa Mill to treat its effluent.  Anhydrous ammonia is used as a nutrient in the wastewater treatment.  The anhydrous ammonia is stored under pressure (215 pounds per square inch, gage), as a liquid, in a 17,170-gallon capacity tank (water capacity), with administrative controls in the process safety information and operating procedures limiting storage to 85% of capacity.  Maximum storage is 85,850 pounds at the density of 5 #/gal.  The nutrient is fed to the aeration basin via a submerged transfer line.  The covered process, as defined by the OSHA PSM process boundary, includes the storage tank and 1-inch diameter transfer line.\n1.3    Off-Site Consequence Analysis\n\nDomtar performed an off-site consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of the regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.  The off-site consequence analysis consists of evaluating both a worst-case release scenario and an alternative release case scenario.  The facility does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur. An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) might occur at a facility like the Domtar wastewater treatment plant and (2) would resu"

The alternative release scenarios will help the Local Emergency Planning Committee improve the community emergency response plan.\nThe main objective of performing the off-site consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).  The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance:  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less.\nWhen considering the release of a toxic substance, such as anhydrous ammonia, most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are likely.\nThe RMP Rule includes specific requirements for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by Domtar.  These requirements include:\n\nA???    One worst-case release scenario for a toxic substance in a Program Level 3 process (one scenario representing anhydrous ammonia), and \nA???    One alternative release scenario for each toxic substance in a Program Level 3 process (one scenario representing anhydrous ammonia).\n    \n    The following information summarizes the off-site consequence analysis performed by Domtar.\n    \n    1.3.1 Program Level 3 Process - Anhydrous Ammonia Wastewater Treatment System\n    The worst-case release scenario for the Anhydrous Ammonia Wastewater Treatment System is the failure of the storage tank, releasing 85,850 pounds of the toxic material as a gas over a 10-minute period.  The predicted impact distance where concentrations are greater than the toxic endpoint extends beyond the Domtar facility property.  The RMP*Comp Model predicts an impact to a distance of 5.4 miles.

There are also several environmental receptors.\n    The alternative release scenario for anhydrous ammonia is a break in the one-inch diameter transfer line from the bottom of the storage tank, releasing gaseous ammonia for a period of 15 minutes before workers detect and shut down the process.  Considering the tank is under pressure (215 pounds per square inch, gage), and there are no pumps used, the choked flow formula (equation D-11 in the OCA Guide) is used to calculate the release rate from the tank.  According to Table 4-4, this rate is 2,231 pounds per minute, resulting in the release of 33,458 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, which, due to its buoyancy in air and low boiling point, is assumed to vaporize quickly and form a gaseous jet release at ground level. The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint for anhydrous ammonia for the alternative release scenario is 0.80 mile using the RMP*Comp Model.  The estimated population within a circle of this radius is 220.  Several public receptors are also located within this distance; e.g., another industrial facility, a recreational park, and subdivisions.  There are also several environmental receptors.\n    \n    1.4 Accidental Release Prevention Program\n    Domtar has always used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Beginning in 1992, the facility formalized this prevention program for the Anhydrous Ammonia Wastewater Treatment System to comply with the 14 elements of the Occupational Safety Administration and Health AdministrationA!A|s (OSHAA!A|s) Process Safety Management (PSM) Prevention Program.

Employee Participation   The facility has developed a written employee participation program for the covered process to help ensure that the safety concerns of Nekoosa employees are addressed.  The facility encourages active participation from personnel in the development and maintenance of the prevention program activities of all processes at the facility.  Employees are consulted on, and informed about, all aspects of the RMP Rule prevention program, including the development of Process Hazard Analysis and Operating Procedures.\n    2. Process Safety Information   The facility maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure the safe operation of the process.  The documents address (1) the hazards of the chemicals used in the process, (2) the technical data of the process, and (3) the design basis and configurations of the equipment used in the process.  The facility ensures that this process safety information is maintained, accurate, and available to all Nekoosa employees, and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).

Process Hazard Analysis   Domtar/Nekoosa performs and periodically updates process hazard analyses (PHAs) of the covered processes to help identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.  A team composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a team leader with experience in performing process hazard analyses is assembled to analyze the process.  The facility primarily uses the \"What If /Checklist'A!A? technique, to perform this analysis.  The PHA team prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including recommendations. Responsibility for resolving the recommendations is assigned to personnel and, when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the process are implemented.\n    \n4.
