If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Aplington Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.                               This facility is a anhydrous ammonia retail outlet to the area farmers. Consisting of two storage tanks a 18000 gal & a 11500 gal. tank and associated pumps and plumbing.                                                             Our worst case scenario is failure failure of one 18000 gal. storage tank when filled to the greatest ammount , resulting in a vapor cloud. according to EPA model RMP COMP we would have a release of 8000 lbs. per min. for 10min. affecting an area of 5.1 miles and a population of 3448 people.                   This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all state and local codes and regulations.     We have never had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caused death injuries property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in place.                                                                           In the event of an emergency involving our ammonia plant it is our policy to notify the Butler County Sheriff Office and Aplington Fire Department through 911 to request that they respond to the emergency. We have discussed this policy with the fire department members :members have inspected our ammonia plant.          At this time there are no plans to change our facility for improved safety."
