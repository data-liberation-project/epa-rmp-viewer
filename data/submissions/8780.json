In addition, a comprehensive risk management program has been developed to prevent accidental releases.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nThe alternative release scenario is most likely to occur than the worst-case scenario.  For the CAWWTF, it is assumed that the pipe manifold connecting the two 1-ton chlorine or sulfur dioxide containers fails and the chemical is released for 2.5 hours.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint for the alternative release scenario is 0.42 miles for chlorine and 0.39 miles for sulfur dioxide.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe City of Fort Myers is in compliance with 40 CFR 68.  The City has conducted a comprehensive review of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems as well as administrative, technical, operating and maintenance procedures, in addition to the other required program elements of the regulations.  The Risk Management Program addresses actions to minimize the likelihood of an accidental release and to minimize the impact if one occurs.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe CAWWTF has had one sulfur dioxide release which is documented in this form.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThis facility has an emergency response program that is coordinated with the Lee County Comprehensive Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that has been prepared in accordance with all local, state and federal regulations.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe hazard review resulted in the development of a list of improvements and an implementation schedule.  This is included in the Risk Management Plan (RMP).  Continued training and practices documented in the RMP will continue to improve safety at the facility.  Some of the more significant improvements are listed below:\n\nTo Be Completed by August 1999\n\n Include trunnion wheels in a regular maintenance program.\n\nDue to the chemical nature of chlorine, any wor"

Hot work permitting should be implemented.\n\nAmmonia that has exceeded its shelf life is no longer effective in detecting leaks.  Ammonia should be replaced every 60 days, with a date placed on the test bottle each time it is refilled.\n\nBecause the pigtail is the weakest point in the chlorine system, it is important to replace the pigtails at least once every six months.\n\nIncrease operator training in the use of escape units.\n\nTo Be Completed by November 1999\n\nChlorine containers must be rotated in the trunnions to properly align the valves prior to connection.  Procurement of a specialized F-wrench for this use is recommended.\n\nTo Be Completed by January 2000\n\nAn annual preventive maintenance (PM) and replacement program for the chemical system should be prepared and implemented.  The PM program should include the following equipment: \n\nMetal manifold piping (replace every ten years)\nCl2/SO2 PVC system (replace every 5 years)\nInjector plugs\nInjector check valves\nVacuum regulators\nChlorine inductors\nVent line from pressure relief valve          \n\nIn case the vacuum regulator fails while it is open, a sensor with an alarm system should be installed on the vacuum release line.          \n\nThe manifold pressure gauge should be moved to a better location.  The valve should be tagged to identify its function and operating positions.  \n\nReplace air flow/indicator light that lets workers know that the ventilation system is working prior to entering the chlorinator room.\n\nInstitute quarterly tests of the sensors and detectors to verify their proper function.\n\nFor increased safety of operators during a container change out, add a face shield requirement to the hookup procedure.

A bridge crane would accomplish this. \n\nContainers could potentially be damaged by hitting a nearby wall during container movement.  Consider installing an impact resistant stop.\n\nRoller type trunnions make it easier to maneuver containers into proper alignment without rolling containers by hand.  Consider changing the fixed cradles to a roller type trunnion.\n\nAlign containers during off loading from the delivery truck, rather than later.\n\nThe solenoid valve on the chlorinator discharge piping is not necessary for system operation.  It should be removed.\n\nTo avoid low flow of injector water, consider providing a redundant water supply to the injectors.\n\nFor increased notification to operators of a potential chemical leak, provide redundant SO2 detectors at inside and outside locations.\n\nResearch methods for securing containers in the event of a flood, hurricane or severe storm event."

      "SummaryText": "It is the policy of the City of Fort Myers to operate safe wastewater treatment facilities, reducing to the greatest extent possible any hazards associated with our processes and reducing  any subsequent risk to the surrounding community, employees and the environment.  It is also our policy to work with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies, and promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork to provide an effective contingency plan in the unlikely event that a process incident occurs at one of our facilities.\n\nRegulated Substances\n\nThe primary activity at the Central Advanced Wastewater Treatment Facility (CAWWTF) is municipal wastewater treatment.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are the only 40 CFR 68 regulated substances at the facility.  Chlorine is used primarily as a disinfectant.  Sulfur dioxide is used for dechlorination.  The maximum amount of chlorine at the facility is 20 tons.  The maximum amount of sulfur dioxide at the facility is 10 tons.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario (WCS)\n\nThe Worst-Case release scenario according to EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance document is the greatest amount held in a single vessel.  The worst-case scenario is the complete release of chlorine from a one-ton container.\n\nThe chlorine and sulfur dioxide toxic endpoints defined by 40 CFR Part 68 is 0.0087 mg/l which is equivalent to 3 parts per million by volume (ppm).  According to the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) Emergency Response Planning Guideline (ERPG)-2, this toxic endpoint is specified as the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\n\nThe SLAB computer model was used to simulate the worst-case scenario.  The maximum distance to toxic endpoint is 2.93 miles for chlorine and 3.55 mile"
