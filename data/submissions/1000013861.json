The safety and health of all personnel and the protection of the environment are important to the Company.  The control of accidents will be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the facility.\n\n\n\nThe Company will have a Plant Safety Program.  The primary objective of the Plant Safety Program is to achieve maximum efficiency and safety performance.\n\n\n\nTo accomplish the CompanyA?s goal in preventing the accidental releases of ammonia an minimizing the impact of any release, the facility has developed (an will implement) a Program to comply with the EPAA?s Risk Management Program regulation (Risk Management Program fro Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).  Emergency Response programs have been developed as well.  The objectives of the RMP/PSM programs are to prevent the accidental releases through use of good operating procedures and mechanical integrity of the ammonia refrigeration system.  The Plant Manager is ultimately responsible for the management of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs.\n\n\n\n(b)The substances that are handled at the facility;\n\n\n\nRALCORP will operate a storage facility where raw and processed cookie doe will be stored in free-standing racks.  An important part of the this operation is keeping this aforementioned material cold.  For this, anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) will be used as the refrigerant.  The maximum intended inventory is 14,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system will be a closed loop system whereby liquid ammonia from the High Pressure Receiver located in the Engine Room supplies on Reci"

During cooling, the refrigerant (ammonia) is pumped through the cooler units for cooling and returns to the Recirculation System in both liquid and vapor form.  The vapor is drawn into the screw compressors through the suction line where they are compressed and discharged through piping to the ammonia condenser located outside.  Forced air and recirculated water cool and condense the vapors.  From the condensers, the ammonia drain by gravity back to the High Pressure Receiver, thus completing the loop.  Ammonia is a non-corrosive chemical; therefore, does not deteriorate the inside of vessels, line or valves provided they are carbon steel (not copper).  It also carries a small amount of oil from the compressors that would tend to further protect the inside surfaces.  All vessels containing ammonia will be ASME pressure rated at 250 psi or higher which is higher than the maximum operating pressure.  All pressure vessels will be Permitted by the State of Utah and inspected according to the State requirements.\n\n\n\n(c)Each worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario, including without limitation, administrative controls and mitigation measure taken to limit the distances to the endpoint for each scenario;\n\n\n\nThe Worst-Case release scenario involves the release of 8,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia over a 10 minute period which would result due to a failure of the high pressure receiver.  This quantity is considered in the event that (for some reason) the entire system charge would be A?pumped downA? into the High Pressure Receiver and the HP Receiver should rupture.  Pressure vessels are never to be filled to more than 80% or 85% or their capacity and the 8,000 pounds is based on 100% of the vessel.  Under this Worst-Case scenario and the prescribed A?staleA? air and wind conditions, ammonia could travel 1.1 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.\n\n\n\nThe Worst-Case rlease scenario is highl"
