This includes common practices outlined by the Chlorine Institute and the National Association of Gas Chlorinators.\n\nAll employees must complete a safety training program which includes materials published by the National Association of Gas Chlorinators and The Chlorine Institute.  Only employees who have completed training certification for Level 2 Technician status may transfer chlorine to 20 pound cylinders.  Additional safety equipment on site includes a ton container cradle device which allows ton containers to be rotated in place to assist in inspection and repair if ever needed.  In addition, the facility is equipped with a ventilation system capable of providing an air exchange of up to 15,000 cubic feet per minute.\n\nThe chlorine one ton containers,  the transfer process equipment, and the transfer cylinders, are all located indoors providing security management for all containers.  No filled containers are stored outside. This policy is in place to prevent vandalism, sabotage, and tampering. \n\nThe facility produces no hazardous wastes.  Every chemical by-product from the transfer process is reclaimed and used in swimming pool water treatment allowing no environmental wastes.  This business eliminates our customers' need to buy, transport, handle, and dispose of hazardous materials required for swimming pool water treatment. This provides a major benefit to the environment.  \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere is no accident history.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nSplish Splash Pool Chemicals, Inc. has an Emergency Action Plan that is coordinated with the City of Phoenix Fire Department.  This plan outlines the personnel to contact in the event of a release.  The facility plans to contact 9-1-1 and evacuate all employees in the event of a chlorine release.
