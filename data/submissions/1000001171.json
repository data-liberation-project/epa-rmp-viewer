The President administers the company's safety and environmental policies. He is also responsible for various inspections to ensure compliance, and oversees the entire safety and environmental programs.  These programs include, hazard communications, employee safety manuals, manufacturers documentation, Emergency Action Plan, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\nFACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\n\nThe process is located at 519 West Lone Cactus Drive, #101, Phoenix, AZ 85027.  The chlorine transfer process for Splish Splash Pool Chemicals, Inc. consists of chlorine one-ton containers which are the storage vessels.  Chlorine liquid is dispensed from the one ton container through a filling manifold to a 20 pound cylinder. \n\nThe maximum quantity of chlorine on site is 12000 pounds.\n\nThere are four full time employees on site; however, there are additional employees that pick up supplies in the morning and are on the road all day.  They may stop back at the end of the day to unload the vehicle.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nSplish Splash Pool Chemicals, Inc. has a Process Safety Management program in place to manage the handling of chlorine.  Splish Splash Pool Chemicals, Inc. does not use any outside contractors at the facility; therefore, they do not have a contractor safety program in place.

This includes common practices outlined by the Chlorine Institute and the National Association of Gas Chlorinators.\n\nAll employees must complete a safety training program which includes materials published by the National Association of Gas Chlorinators and The Chlorine Institute.  Only employees who have completed training certification for \"Level 2 Technician\" status may transfer chlorine to 20 pound cylinders.  Additional safety equipment on site includes a ton container cradle device which allows ton containers to be rotated in place to assist in inspection and repair if ever needed.  In addition, the facility is equipped with a ventilation system capable of providing an air exchange of up to 15,000 cubic feet per minute.\n\nThe chlorine one ton containers,  the transfer process equipment, and the transfer cylinders, are all located indoors providing security management for all containers.  No filled containers are stored outside. This policy is in place to prevent vandalism, sabotage, and tampering. \n\nThe facility produces no hazardous wastes.  Every chemical by-product from the transfer process is reclaimed and used in swimming pool water treatment allowing no environmental wastes.  This business eliminates our customers' need to buy, transport, handle, and dispose of hazardous materials required for swimming pool water treatment. This provides a major benefit to the environment.  \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere is no accident history.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nSplish Splash Pool Chemicals, Inc. has an Emergency Action Plan that is coordinated with the City of Phoenix Fire Department.  This plan outlines the personnel to contact in the event of a release.  The facility plans to contact 9-1-1 and evacuate all employees in the event of a chlorine release.
