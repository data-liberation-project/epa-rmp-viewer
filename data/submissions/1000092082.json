Communication to plant personnel is routinely held to inform and train employees on improvements learned from the incident reporting management system.\r\n\r\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\r\nJayhawk utilizes the LOPA (layer of protection analysis) for process hazard analysis of each covered process.  This detailed analysis guides the site in determining specific prevention measures to preclude accidents. Jayhawk Fine Chemicals capital plan includes projects to improve occupational safety and environmental protection. One aspect of Jayhawk Fine Chemicals capital project planning process is driven by the review of hazards during the LOPA PHA process. This process often identifies best available technologies which are routinely employed to reduce risk. A distributed control system (DCS) is utilized to improve control of operating processes.

An alternative scenario has been selected for each chemical that, although still very unlikely to occur, has a higher probability of occurrence than the worst-case scenario, in accordance with U.S. EPA guidance.\r\nResidential population, public receptors and environmental receptors were assessed for each chemical within the radius of its associated endpoint. In most there was residential population, no environmental receptors, and the only public receptor that appears in the available data is the Boston Mills School located one-half mile east.

Therefore, there are no public receptors within the maximum endpoint radius of the alternative case scenarios.\r\n\r\nAcetaldehyde\r\nA more likely scenario for acetaldehyde is the failure of the railcar unloading system.

The alternative scenario for anhydrous ammonia is the failure of a 1-inch line releasing all of the contents of a tank. \r\nThe off-site consequence analysis indicates that there are no environmental receptors for the anhydrous ammonia tank (alternative case). The demographic data indicates that there are approximately 1 person located within the radius of the alternative case scenario.\r\n\r\nChlorine\r\nA more likely scenario for chlorine is the failures of a single cylinder during handling. Therefore, the alternative scenario involves the release of chlorine from the liquid side of a cylinder. \r\nThe off-site consequence analysis indicates that there are no environmental receptors for the chlorine cylinders (alternative case). The demographic data indicates that there are approximately 1 person located within the radius of the alternative case scenario.\r\n\r\nIsopropyl Chloroformate\r\nA more likely scenario for isopropyl chloroformate is the puncture of 55-gallon drum during process operations. \r\nThe off-site consequence analysis indicates that there are no environmental receptors for the isopropyl chloroformate drum (alternative case). The demographic data indicates that there are approximately 0 persons located within the radius of the alternative"

The demographic data indicates that there are approximately 14 persons located within the radius of the alternative case scenario.\r\n\r\nMethyl Chloride\r\nA more likely scenario for methyl chloride is the leak from cylinder or ISO during process operations.  \r\nThe off-site consequence analysis indicates that there are no environmental receptors for the Methyl Chloride leak (alternative case). The demographic data indicates that there are approximately 1 person located within the radius of the alternative case scenario.\r\n\r\nPropylene\r\nA more likely scenario for Propylene is the failures of a transfer line or hose. Therefore, the alternative scenario involves the release of Propylene through a 3-inch rupture in a container. \r\nThe off-site consequence analysis indicates that there are no environmental receptors for the Propylene alternative case scenario. The demographic data indicates that there are approximately 0 persons located within the radius of the alternative case scenario.\r\n\r\nPhosphorous Trichloride (PCl3)\r\nA more likely scenario for PCl3 is the failure of a charge pipe during process operations.  \r\nThe off-site consequence analysis indicates that there are no environmental receptors within for the PCl3 drum (alternative case). The demographic data indicates that there are approximately 14 persons located within the radius of the alternative case scenario.\r\n\r\nTetramethylsilane\r\nA more likely scenario for Tetramethylsilane is a process line leak during process operations.\r\nThe off-site consequence analysis indicates that there are no environmental receptors for the Tetramethylsilane leak ("

There have been no off-site consequences involving regulated processes, or regulated chemicals, at the facility. There is no five-year accident history involving either regulated processes or chemicals that involve personnel injury, death, or significant property damage.  \r\n\r\n(e)\tThe facility has an Emergency Response Plan intended to protect human health and the environment. There is a procedure for the notification of local emergency response agencies and the public. Training is provided to all employees on the Emergency Response Plan and the emergency equipment available at the facility. This Emergency Response Plan is updated as often as necessary, but not less than once every three years.  Emergency response is provided by the Galena, KS Fire Department with mutual aid assistance agreements with Columbus, and Baxter Springs, KS Fire Departments. Columbus is located approximately 10 miles northwest of the facility, and Baxter Springs is located a"
