The industrial area within which Jayhawk property and manufacturing operations are located is known locally as the Jayhawk Plant, dating back to its creation in the 1940s. That portion of the Jayhawk Plant Site containing Jayhawk property, buildings and equipment will be referred to hereinafter as the \"Facility\". \n\n\n\n    The Facility is located on approximately 850 acres of a 2,200-acre industrial complex. Jayhawk's Unit 1 encompasses approximately 29 acres and Unit 2 encompasses approximately 25 acres. The Facility is located approximately 3.5 miles north of the junction of Kansas Route 66 and U.S. Highway 400 at Riverton, Kansas. \n\n\n\n    The regulated substances handled at Jayhawk include:\n\n1.

The tanks and cylinders have safety devices and systems to prevent or minimize the effect of any accidental release. An alternative scenario has been selected for each chemical that, although still very unlikely to occur, has a higher probability of occurrence than the worst-case scenario, in accordance with U.S. EPA guidance.\n\nResidential population, public receptors and environmental receptors were assessed for each chemical within the radius of its associated endpoint. In most there was residential population, no environmental receptors, and the only public receptor that appears in the available data is the Boston Mills School located one-half mile east. This school was investigated and no longer exists. Therefore, there are no public receptors within the maximum endpoint radius of the alternative case scenarios.\n\n\n\nAcetaldehyde\n\nA more likely scenario for acetaldehyde is the failure of the railcar unloading system.

Mutual aid response times are approximately 30 minutes from the initiation of the notice. There is a Jayhawk staffed Emergency Response Team which has training in incipient stage fire response. Additional support is provided through coordination of the emergency with outside agencies through use of the plant telephone and emergency notification system.\n\n\n\n(f)    Apart from compliance with specific guidelines, the policy of Jayhawk Fine Chemicals is also aligned to continuous development, especially in terms of plant and occupational safety, environmental protection, protecting the health of its employees, product safety, transportation safety and site security.  Specifically, JFC operates with a policy of investigating near misses and incidents and includes findings into updates of our safety management policies and procedures.  Communication to plant personnel is routinely held to inform and train employees on improvements learned from the incident reporting management system.\n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nJayhawk utilizes the LOPA (layer of protection analysis) for process hazard analysis of each covered process.  This detailed analysis guides the site in determining specific prevention measures to preclude accidents. Jayhawk Fine Chemicals capital plan includes projects to improve occupational safety and environmental protection. One aspect of Jayhawk Fine Chemicals capital project planning process is driven by the review of hazards during the LOPA PHA process. This process often identifies best available technologies which are routinely employed to reduce risk. A distributed control system (DCS) is utilized to improve control of operating processes. This system is updated routinely to maintain the safety of our processes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
