      "SummaryText": "The Upper Leon River Municipal Water District (MWD) (District) operates the Proctor Water Treatment Plant (WTP) which is located at 2250 Highway 2861, Comanche County, Texas.  The Proctor WTP provides potable water to the cities of Comanche, De Leon, Dublin, Gorman, Hamilton and surrounding rural communities.  Chlorine gas is used in the disinfection process at the Proctor WTP.  Up to 15,500 pounds (lbs) of chlorine may be stored at the Proctor WTP.  Because the stored quantity of chlorine onsite exceeds the threshold quantity for chlorine (\u00a768.130; Table 1), the District developed this Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The Proctor WTP is subject to Program 2 RMP requirements (\u00a768.12(c)).  A Management System overseen by the District's General Manager (GM) is implemented to ensure that the RMP and associated Prevention Program are implemented correctly and maintained up-to-date. The District's accidental release prevention and emergency response policies include commitments to safety and to implementation of safe procedures to ensure accidental releases of chlorine gas are prevented.\r\n\r\nThe accidental release prevention program (Prevention Program) includes required elements of 40 CFR Part 68 such as safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigation.  Detailed documentation of each element of the Prevention Program is contained within the text of the RMP.  Operator training is key to the effectiveness of the Prevention Program. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) licensing program for water operators is used as a training tool, along with site-specific RMP training.  TCEQ licensing testing and on-site observation and demonstration are used to evaluate comprehension of all training materials.  Written operating procedures are used in conjunction with on-the-job training to ensure that certified WTP operators are proficient in performing their duties before being allowed to work wi"

      "SummaryText": "th chlorine storage and feed systems.  Certified WTP operators conduct daily inspections and any problems with the chlorine systems are corrected and documented. In addition, the certified WTP operators ensure that the equipment used in the disinfection process is maintained according to the manufacturers' recommendations (\u00a768.56(a)).  Because of these efforts, the WTP has not had a chlorine release that resulted in an injury, either on-site or off-site, within the previous five (5) years (\u00a768.42(a)).  As part of the Program, the District will periodically perform compliance audits, hazard reviews and incident investigations, according to a predetermined schedule described in the RMP and as needs dictate.  These compliance audits and hazard reviews document any planned changes to improve safety (\u00a768.50 & \u00a768.58).\r\n\r\nThe Proctor WTP complies with the emergency response regulations per Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR \u00a71910.38, as well as with applicable fire codes and the standards set forth by the Chlorine Institute. The Proctor WTP is a non-responding facility for emergency response. The WTP is included in the Comanche County Local Emergency Planning Committee's (LEPC) regional Emergency Response Plan. Coordination activities are conducted in accordance with \u00a768.93 with the LEPC and the first responders [the City of Comanche Volunteer Fire Department (VFD)] at least annually, and more frequently if necessary. WTP operators are trained to contact the Comanche County dispatch via 9-1-1 in the event of a release.  The Comanche County dispatch contacts the nearest first responder unit (typically the City of Comanche VFD) which coordinates the emergency response according to the County's Emergency Response Plan, including the evacuation of surrounding residents when required (\u00a768.90(b))."
