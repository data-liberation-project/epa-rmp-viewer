Sweet inlet gas enters the plant from high-pressure field gathering stations.  Martin County treats and processes flammable gas and liquid mixtures in an amount greater than the threshold quantity containing any of the following RMP-regulated constituents:\n\n?    Methane\n\n?    Ethane\n\n?    Propane\n\n?    Isobutane\n\n?    Butane\n\n?    Isopentane\n\n?    Pentane\n\nThe only RMP-regulated toxic constituent present at Martin County, which is part of the liquid amine treating process, is hydrogen sulfide; however, quantities at this facility are well below the threshold quantity. \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nWTG is committed to ensuring a safe work environment for all its employees, contractors, and vendors.  The Martin County Gas Plant has a detailed Emergency Response Plan which all employees are trained on and have readily available in their control room.  WTG conducts drills and coordinates annual mock emergency simulations at the Facility in conjunction with the local responders.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\nThe Martin County process is covered by OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of highly hazardous chemicals (PSM) regulation.

Thus, the current PSM improvement initiative is heavily focused on this key element as employees are becoming more actively involved in the implementation of each element of PSM.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\nComprehensive reviews of the available process safety information (PSI) have been conducted.  Updates to the maximum intended inventory (MII) and piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs) have been completed.  Heat and material balances have been thoroughly documented.  A company-wide study is underway to ensure relief valves have been properly designed and sized for the specific application.  A comprehensive electronic web-based system utilized for timely access to information has been built, implemented, and made available to all personnel involved with operating the process.  \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA):\n\nA new PHA team including experienced operating personnel (operations and maintenance), WTG engineers, Process Control personnel, safety representatives, and PSM representatives conducted a PHA revalidation from July 6, 2020 through August 6, 2020.  The final report was published December 11, 2020 and contains an accompanying list of action items.  A tentative completion date for all action items is June 30, 2022; however, this is subject to change.  Results and recommendations from these analyses have been actively shared with employees.  Additionally, a process safety tracking tool has been developed and implemented for the interactive tracking of PHA action items to closure.  This tracking tool is used to generate reminders on a set frequency along with status updates of pending action items every month.\n\n\n\nOperat"

WTG will also be publishing operating procedures to the company's electronic web-based system.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change (MOC) and Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR):\n\nImprovements to the MOC procedure and associated checklists are in progress to capture all process related changes.  Requirements for the identification, evaluation, control, and authorization of modifications to plant design and operations prior to the implementation to ensure that the risk of new or existing hazards are properly managed is available to all personnel.

These checklists are Appendices to the Company's MOC procedure and are available online from the company's electronic web-based process library. \n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity (MI):\n\nWTG is committed to maintaining the physical integrity of all equipment to prevent failures.  The MI program is being reestablished within WTG to include a MI computerized program that will integrate with the Company's maintenance program to track the code required inspection requirements of all affected equipment and document equipment history accordingly.
