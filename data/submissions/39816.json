Baker Petrolite Corporation has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility as part of this commitment. One part of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at Baker Petrolite and also compiles with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (RMP rule). A requirement of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management prepared for the Baker Petrolite Bayport facility. The purpose of this document is to satisfy the RMPlan requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at Baker Petrolite.\n\nThrough the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances, Baker Petrolite is committed to the safety of its' employees, the public population, and the preservation of the environment. Baker Petrolite implements reasonable controls to prevent identifiable releases of hazardous substances. In the event of a significant accidental release, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain these releases. If a release event occurred, Baker Petrolite would evaluate the release, evacuate workers as required, contact the LaPorte police department (LEPC) dispatcher to inform them of the release, and prevent or reduce the consequences of the release. Baker Petrolite has established a program with the LaPorte local emergency planning committee (LEPC), LaPorte fire department, and the Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA) to warn the community if an release occurs that could affect the community.\n\nBaker Petrolite is a specialty chemical manufacturer of chemical products for use i"

The Baker Petrolite Bayport plant ensures the processes are maintained within these limits by using process controls and monitoring equipment, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems. An evaluation of consequences of deviation is included in Bayport PSM manual. The following information is maintained by the plant engineering department: materials of construction, piping and instrument diagrams, electrical classifications, relief valve design, ventilation system design, design codes and engineering standards employed in the plant, and safety system interlocks/suppression systems. A program is in place for all process equipment to comply with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.\n\nBaker Petrolite has a comprehensive program to identify and control hazards associated with various processes. Each process is systematically examined to identify process hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. Baker Petrolite uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis method to perform these systematic reviews. The HAZOP team consists of people who have operating, maintenance, and engineering expertise. The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the processes as well as accident prevention and makes suggestions for additional measures as needed. The team findings are then documented and all approved changes are implemented for corrective action. These periodic reviews are conducted on a 5 year cycle and will continue until the covered process is no longer operating. Again, the team findings are documented and retained.\n\nBaker Petrolite maintains written procedures for the manufacture of specialty chemicals.

An ARS is a more realistic scenario that is more likely to occur than the WCS at a facility such as Baker Petrolite. The ARSs will help the LEPC to improve the community emergency response plan.  If you are interested in this information, please contact our RMP coordinator at (281) 291-3206\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at Baker Petrolite Bayport manufacturing facility. Because the processes at the Baker Petrolite Bayport plant regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nBaker Petrolite encourages plant employees to participate in all areas of process safety management and accident prevention. Employee participation ranges from updating technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. The employees have access to all information contained in the Baker Petrolite plant accident prevention program. One of the ways to address process safety and employee safety issues is in the monthly plant safety committee meetings. The committee consists of plant operators and management personnel.\n\nBaker Petrolite keeps a variety of technical documents that used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. Chemical specific information is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS). The MSDS are maintained and located in the QC Laboratory building.

With the production of many various types of chemical products, Baker Petrolite uses seven chemicals which are above the RMP threshold quantities. They include anhydrous ammonia, aqueous ammonia, ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, formaldehyde, ethylenediamine, and methyl chloride. All of the covered processes involving these chemicals are Program 3 processes for RMP rule compliance purposes. The following is a summary of the individual chemicals and the covered processes:\n\n1. Anhydrous ammonia is used as a reactant in the production of specialty chemicals instead of neutralization.                           \n2. Aqueous ammonia is stored in a pressure vessel type storage tank within dike containment. Aqueous ammonia is used as a neutralization chemical agent in the production of chemical intermediates. \n3. Ethylene oxide is stored in two pressure vessel type storage tanks, each with individual dike containment. Ethylene oxide is used in the ethoxylation of chemical intermediates. \n4. Propylene oxide is stored in two pressure vessel type storage tanks, each with individual dike containment. Propylene oxide is used in the propyloxylation of chemical intermediates. \n5. Formaldehyde is stored in an aboveground vertical fixed roof storage tank. Formaldehyde is used in the production of chemical resin type intermediates. \n6. Ethylenediamine is stored in an aboveground vertical fixed roof storage tank. Ethylenediamine is used in the production of chemical intermediates..\n7. Methyl Chloride is stored in a methyl chloride railroad tank designed for the storage of methyl chloride.

The prevention program previously summarized applies to all the Program 3 EPA RMP covered processes at the Bayport plant. These prevention program procedures help to prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by human or equipment failures. Baker Petrolite has safety equipment and features on all units to help contain or control a release and reduce the consequences of a release. The types of safety features used on various chemical process equipment for release detection are: hydrocarbon detectors with alarms, process alarms, and video monitors. The types of equipment features used for containment or control of releases are: process relief valves, tank scrubbers to control vessel or storage tank emissions, valves to permit isolation of process equipment, automated shutdown systems (high level, high temperature, no agitation) for specific process parameters, dike walls, backup electrical power generator for certain critical equipment, and backup firewater pumps. Baker Petrolite uses the following types of equipment for release mitigation: Fire suppression and extinguishing systems, firewater deluge system for specific processes, trained emergency response personnel, and personal protective equipment.\nBaker Petrolite investigates all incidents that result in or could have resulted in a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, personal injury, or environmental loss. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident. Corrective actions are taken in response to the team's findings.
