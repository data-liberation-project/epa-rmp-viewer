Risk Management Policy and Management System\nIt is the goal and principle of our business to manage process safety systems as a means to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of process contents.  Effective process safety management will contribute to the prevention of acute process and equipment failures with the consequent prevention of the effects of such failures.\n\nProper performance of the procedures risk management program is intended to satisfy our commitment of Environmental, Health, and Safety responsibility to the public, our employees, customers and all those who are stakeholders in our business endeavors.  Further, applicable laws and regulations will be satisfied.\n\nThe risk management program was integrated into the facility Process Safety Management System.  The goals of this Process Safety Management (PSM) System are achieved through implementation of the procedures outlined in the Chapters of the PSM Manual:\n\n     Chapter 2: Employee Participation\n     Chapter 3: Operating Procedures\n     Chapter 4: Training\n     Chapter 5: Contractors\n     Chapter 6: Process Safety Review\n     Chapter 7: Mechanical Integrity\n     Chapter 8: Hot Work Permits\n     Chapter 9: Managing Change\n     Chapter 10: Incident Investigation\n     Chapter 11: Emergency Planning and Response\n     Chapter 12: Process Safety Information\n     Chapter 13: Process Hazard Analysis\n     Chapter 14: Compliance Audits\n\nThe Process Safety Management (PSM) Council under the Direction of the Process Safety Management Coordinator is responsible for the overall management of this manual.

Facility Description\nAvery Dennison Chemical Division manufactures pressure-sensitive adhesives that are used in label and tape applications.  Some interesting uses of our adhesives are for self-adhesive postage stamps, battery tester labels, and Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages.  The facility employs approximately 65 employees.  The facility prouduces adhesives through batch polymerization of monomers in both water-based or solvent-based systems.  An important chemical used in this process is vinyl acetate which is regulated by the Risk Management Program regulation.  Vinyl acetate is stored in one storage tank at the facility (maximum 84,000 pounds) and is used in all reactor systems at the facility.  Vinyl acetate is the only chemical at the facility subject to the Risk Management Program regulation.\n\n3. Worst-Case Scenario and Alternative Release Scenarios\nIt is unlikely the scenarios described in this document will occur, EPA regulation defines worst-case and alternative scenarios without regard to their likelihood.  To limit the potential for accident, vinyl acetate is always shipped containing a polymerization inhibitor.  Properly inhibited, vinyl acetate is stable under recommended storage conditions.  At this facility, vinyl acetate is stored out of direct sunlight under cover in a diked tank.  The tank is positioned on electronic scales and any potential leak can be visually observed.  The piping system is double walled with interstitial monitoring.  The loading area is also co"

The storage, handling, and use of this chemical at the facility greatly limits the potential for accidental release.\n\nThe facility worst-case scenario and alternative scenarios were presented to the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) in March 1998.  This information was also available to the public during an open house the facility hosted for the community in September 1998.\n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO\nThis scenario involves the rupture of the storage tank resulting in a spill of 84,000 pounds.  The liquid vinyl acetate will be contained in a dike that surrounds the storage tank and this will limit evaporation to 6 pounds per minute.  The resulting distance to endpoint is 0.11 mile.  The scenario did not account for emergency response actions by trained facility personnel such as spill removal to mitigate release to the air.  Facility personnel are trained to respond to such emergencies. It is important to note that the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) has long used a distance of 0.5 mile for emergency planning for this facility. \n\nALTERNATIVE SCENARIO 1\nThis scenario involves the failure of the transfer hose during unloading of a 6,000 gallon tank truck delivery.  The entire contents will be spilled, but the liquid will be contained with a concrete spill containment.  The liquid vinyl acetate will evaporate at 100 pounds per minute and result in a distance to endpoint of 0.16 mile.  The scenario did not account for emergency response actions by trained facility personnel such as stopping the liquid release and using vapor suppression foam (AFFF) and spill removal to mitigate release to the air.  Facility personnel are trained to respond to such emergencies.\n\nALTERNATIVE SCENARIO 2\nThis scenario involves a runaway reaction in a 6,000 gallon reactor resulting in a release of 4,400 pounds vinyl acetate based on the following assumptions: 50,000 pound batch, "

      "SummaryText": "44% of batch is vinyl acetate, 75% of batch is polymerized, and 80% of the unreacted vinyl acetate is released from the reactor. The resulting distance to endpoint is 0.08 mile.\n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThe facility complies with the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) rule.  An outline of the facility program is listed in section 1 of this summary. \n\n5. Five-year Accident History\nThe facility has had no accidental releases of vinyl acetate in the last five years.  Further, there have been no off-site accidental releases of vinyl acetate in the history of the facility which dates back to 1972.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\nThe facility maintains a written emergency response plan and conducts regular drills and training for facility response personnel.  Presently the response team has 11 members trained to the haz-mat technician level.  A full inventory of emergency equipment is maintained at the facility.  The facility plans are coordinated with the emergency response plans of the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), the local fire department, and the county hazardous materials response team.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nThe facility follows a policy of continuous improvement in the area of risk management and process safety management."
