The operations at the Medina facility include the processing and storage of perishable prepared food products for public consumption.  These products are packaged and distributed throughout the eastern United States under several familiar brand names. Sandridge has been in operation at this facility for 20 years providing quality products and over 450 jobs to the local community.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nSandridge is committed to protecting the health of its employees, the surrounding community, and the environment.  It is Sandridge corporate policy to maintain a safe and healthy workplace, protect the environment, and comply with all applicable regulations, including 40 CFR 68 and the Occupational Safety and Health Administrations (OSHAs) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation, 29 CFR 1910.119. \n\n\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nTo ensure the quality of Sandridge?s ingredients and final products, refrigeration is necessary to maintain the low temperatures required for the food processing and storage areas of the plant.  These requirements are promulgated and monitored by the United States Department of Agriculture, the Ohio State Department of Agriculture, and the United States Food and Drug Administration.  To achieve this, Sandridge uses anhydrous ammonia, the 112(r) regulated substance, as the refrigerant in the cooling system.   The refrigeration system at Sandridge Food Corporations Medina facility is a closed loop system and consists of compressors, condensers, receiver vessels, pumps, evaporators, heat exchangers, air handling units, and the associated piping for this equipment.  Ammonia is the only regulated substance, covered by the EP"

Furthermore, there has not been a reportable release of ammonia from the system since its initial installation in 1990. \n\n\n\nWorst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nAs required by 40 CFR 68 Subpart B, Sandridge Food Corporation has evaluated a worst-case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia using the parameters specified by the EPA.  The worst-case release scenario was developed following EPA regulations, however, based on the facilitys operating history, it is not considered by Sandridge Food Corporation to be a likely release scenario for the facility.  A more realistic release scenario (alternative case release) was developed in accordance with the EPA requirements.  This scenario considers the facility?s 20-year history of operational experience and the potential hazards identified in the process hazards analysis (PHA) study conducted by Sandridge.\n\n\n\nThe PHA study was performed to ensure that the potential hazards associated with the ammonia refrigeration system were identified and evaluated to minimize their potential for occurrence.  The analysis was conducted in accordance with OSHA and EPA requirements.\n\n\n\nWorst case and alternate release scenarios were developed using the methodology given in the EPAs Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.  The details of the chosen scenarios are located within the Risk Management Program that is located on site.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nTo prevent, detect, and mitigate accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia, Sandridge has implemented several precautionary measures including process and equipment controls, operating procedures, preventive maintenance programs, employe"

In addition, the ammonia refrigeration system was designed and constructed in accordance with recognized industry codes and standards and good engineering practices. \n\n\n\nSandridge has also developed and implemented a Process Safety Management (PSM) program pursuant to OSHA regulations and as such, has evaluated the refrigeration system for the potential to release anhydrous ammonia. Some of the controls installed to prevent, detect, or mitigate catastrophic releases of ammonia include process equipment (pressure relief valves, check valves, backup pumps, and manual shutoffs), process alarms, and automated controls (automatic shutoffs, microprocessor control, ammonia leak detection systems, and electrical distribution system grounding). \n\n\n\nSandridge has developed standard operating procedures for all employees and contractors that have contact with the ammonia refrigeration system. These procedures incorporate safety measures to prevent employee injury, equipment damage, and accidental releases. The procedures were developed by a team consisting of personnel from operations and maintenance, plant engineering, and Sandridge?s PSM contractor. Pursuant to written management of change procedures established by Sandridge, any changes to the operating procedures are communicated to affected employees.\n\n\n\nSandridge understands that maintaining the refrigeration system in good working order is essential to preventing accidental releases; therefore Sandridge has implemented a preventative maintenance program. The preventative maintenance program is scheduled, documented and managed to ensure that regular maintenance occurs on the system. In addition, equipment inspections are performed throughout the year to confirm the mechanical integrity of critical refrigeration system components.\n\n\n\nTo ensure that the control measures at Sandridge are effective in maintaining the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system and other plant equipment"

Each audit incorporates a review of process safety information, process hazards analyses, operating procedures, training programs, system mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-start up safety review procedures, compliance audit procedures, incident investigation procedures, employee participation programs, hot work permit procedures, and the contractor safety management program.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the facilities and/or records of Sandridge are inspected and audited by the following:\n\n\n\nThe City of Medina Fire Department\n\nThe Ohio State Department of Agriculture\n\nThe United States Department of Agriculture\n\nThe United States Food and Drug Administration \n\nSandridge insurance carrier also conducts independent loss prevention audits every year.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe Sandridge plant is included in the written community emergency response plan developed by the Medina County Local Emergency Planning Commission (Medina County LEPC). In addition, Sandridge has developed an emergency action program designed to protect both employees and the community in the event of an ammonia release, fire, or other emergency. This program is fully described in a document entitled, SANDRIDGE FOOD CORPORATION EMERGENCY AND FIRE EVACUATION PROCEDURES. Included in the document are measures to be taken by Sandridge including emergency notifications, on-site and off-site coordination, ammonia release procedures, and evacuation procedures. \n\n\n\nTo ensure that local government response agencies are familiar with Sandridges facility and their emergency procedures, facility tours have been conducted with the following local agencies: City of Medina Fire Department, Medina County Local Emergency Planning Commission\n\n\n\nThe Sandridge facility is located in an industrial park outside the City of Medina and as a result, there"

Many of these changes have been implemented to improve safety and further minimize the potential for accidental releases of ammonia. These changes include process equipment and piping upgrades, the installation of additional ammonia detection equipment throughout the plant, and the installation of a new computer-based control system to monitor and control all refrigeration system operating parameters."
