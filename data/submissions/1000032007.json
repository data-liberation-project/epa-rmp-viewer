The plant is designed to procdess natural gas and recover liquid products from natural gas by physical separation and cryogenic means.  Section 112(r) of the CLean Air Act applies to Kenedy Gas Plant because the plant handles and stores a mixture of methane, ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, pentane, and isopentane in excess of threshold quantities.  Two requirements of this section specifically apply to operations at the plant:\n\n1.  Purpose and General Duty Clause - The essence of the gneral duty clause is that an owner/operator that stores and used hazardous chemicals in any quantity has a fundamental obligation to ensure a safe operation and to have plans in place in the event of an accident to appropriately manage the situation.  ETC TX - La Grange Acquisitions, LLC is committed to ensuring the safe operation of the Kenedy Gas Plant, as well as all of its other operations, to ensure a safe workplace for our employees and a safe location for our neighbors in the community.  ETC TX  - La Grange Acquisitions, LLC has procedures in place to prevent accidents and is committed to emergency preparedness both for our facility and community-wide by coordinating with the Karnes City Volunteer Fire Department.\n\n2.  Risk Management Plan - The Kenedy Gas Plant processes natural gas, recovers natural gas liquids and produces pipeline quality natural gas.  This process involves the handling and storage of chemicals in excess of thresholds.  ETC TX - La Grange Acquisitions, LLC mamagement has been very aware of the potential hazards posed by the handling and storage of natural gas liquids.  Programs have been established to prevent any accidental releases and to train personnel for emergency response in the event of a release.\n\nThese programs are documented and described in this Risk Management Plan.\n\nFor planni"

Using the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables and Equations, a potential radius of impact due to the explosion was calculated to extend 0.63 mile.  Demographic information indicates that XX residences and XX industrial sites are located within the radius.  However, it should be emphad that the probability of the worst-case catastrophic event evaluated in this report is extremely remote - far less than natural catastrophies such as tornadoes and floods that could produce much more severe and extensive damage and injury.  A consideration of the 0.63 mile radius has been incorporated into our notificaiton and emergency response planning.\n\nETC TX - La Grange Acquisitions, LLC also considered the impact of a more likely release.  This alternative release is characterized as an accident during loading of liquids from a truck into one of the bullet storage tanks at the site.  If the truck driver failed to disconnect the transfer hose prior to departure, upstream piping and equipment could potentially be damaged, resulting in a release of a mixture of natural gas liquids under pressure.  The duration of this release could be up to ten minutes, based on the time needed to close the valves.  Using EPA's OCA guidance, the impact distance of a potential explosion of the vapor cloud formed after this release was calculated to be 0.16 mile.  XX residences and XX industrial sites are located within this radius.  \n\nETC TX - La Grange Acquisitions, LLC has implemented safety precautions and procedures designed to prevent and mitigate catastrophic releases.  ETC TX - La Grange Acquisitions, LLC has active operating, maintenance, training and inspection procedures.
