Accidental release prevention and Emergency Response policies \n\nWe at Ca\u00f1on City Water Treatment Plant are committed to employee, public and \nenvironmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive\n accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, \ninstallation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training \nassociated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement \nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  \nUnforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency \nresponse personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. \nWe are also completely coordinated with Ca\u00f1on City Fire Protection District\n which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nWe have 1 regulated substance present at our facility which is Chlorine.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 6000 lbs.\n\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, \nincluding administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the \ndistances for each reported scenario\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we\n have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP \nOffsite Consequence Analysis Guidance. The following paragraphs provide \ndetails of the chosen scenarios.\n\nToxic Worst-case analyses\n\nThe Worst Case scenario involves a catastrophic release from Disinfection.  \nThe scenario involves the release of 2000 lb. of Chlorine in a gaseous form over \n10 minutes. The Release rate (lbs/min) is calculated to be 200. A distance to \nendpoint of 5.4 miles is obtained which affects  a residential population of 26577 \nwithin this distance.\n\n\nToxic Alternative-case analyses\n\nThe Alternative Case scenario involves a catastrophic release from Disinfection. \n The scenario involves the rele"
