We at the City of Petaluma Wastewater Treatment Plant - Oxidation Ponds (Petaluma WWTP) use chemicals, too. For example, we use chlorine to disinfect our water to provide safe water discharges to the environment or for irrigation uses. Storing large quantities of chlorine can be a hazard. We take our safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as we do take providing the environment safe disinfected water. \n\nTo increase our workers' safety as well as that of the general public, in November 1999, we will be bringing on line a new disinfection system that uses a solution of sodium hypochlorite instead of gaseous chlorine. This will eliminate the potential hazards associated with chlorine.\n\nThe following document describes what could happen if there were to be an accident between now and November 1999, or prior to the discontinued use of chlorine gas for disinfection, and includes the steps we take everyday to ensure a safely operating plant, and what to do in the event of an emergency.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe City of Petaluma accidental release prevention policy involves proven technology and staff that has been well trained on operation and maintenance practices. All applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures. \n\nThis document complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program, under Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990, 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68 and the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program under California Code of Regulations (CCF) Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5.

This document summarizes our existing health and safety programs, our internal management response team, policies, procedures, and on-going actions that are designed to prevent or minimize impacts of accidental releases of chlorine to the environment. The Petaluma WWTP has prepared a detailed and comprehensive emergency response plan to handle any potential accidental releases that is designed to safeguard both on- and off-site people. To date, we have had an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring. We have had no chlorine releases that caused safety or health problems (no deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in-place) at the Petaluma WWTP in the past 5 years.\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substances Information\n\nThe Petaluma WWTP, operating since 1973, is located at 4400 Lakeville Highway in the City of Petaluma in Sonoma County. The plant, located on a 162-acre property, is about 2 miles south of downtown Petaluma and 3/4 mile east of the Petaluma River. Wastewater is initially treated at the treatment plant at 950 Hopper Street. From there it is pumped to oxidation ponds at 4400 Lakeville Highway for additional treatment. Final clean and disinfected water is either discharged into the Petaluma River or pumped to customers as reclaimed water for golf course and agricultural irrigation. Wastewater treatment at the WWTP includes screening, grit removal, sedimentation, biological oxidation and chlorination before final discharge or reclamation use. The Petaluma WWTP handles wastewater flows up to 22 million gallons per day (MGD), with an average flow of between 4.0 to 5.2 MGD.\n\nChlorine is stored in up to 9 one-ton cylinders. Gas phase chlorine under pressure is withdrawn from one of two sets of on-line chlorine containers. Each set contains three 1-ton chlorine cylinders. As many as 3 back-up cylinders are stored in the same room"

This chlorine storage exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the RMP rule. \n\nThe pressurized chlorine gas from the 1-ton containers is reduced to vacuum, passed through a chlorinator and injected into the final effluent. The resulting chlorine solution is metered into the effluent wastewater for final disinfection. Chlorine leak detectors continuously monitor for leaks in the bulk storage area and in the chlorination room. Other alarms include chlorine feed and residual malfunction. These alarms are annunciated at the chlorine control panel, as well as, in the case of a leak an audible alarm and red flashing warning light on top of the building. The alarm is also sent to an autodialer and an alarm company for response.\n\nThe bulk storage tanks and the chlorinators are enclosed in separate rooms. The chlorinator room is equipped with a ventilation system. Emergency showers and eye wash stations are provided outside the storage room. Self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) equipment is worn whenever connections or maintenance activities are being made to the chlorine system. SCBA equipment is also available at the response team locker location at the Booster Pump Station No. 1, just off the site.\n\nAccess to the Petaluma WWTP is controlled at the Lakeville entrance by a gate. Visitors and contractors must be approved by Petaluma WWTP staff prior to entry into the facility. Operating staff are onsite during the day, during the water reclamation season, and alarms notify on-call staff during off-hours of any problems or situations that require follow-up investigations. \n\nThe chlorination facilities are also provided with an emergency generator. The generator will start within 3 seconds of a loss of electrical power and will supply power to the leak detectors, lighting, and ventilation systems.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Re"

      "SummaryText": "sults\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two release scenarios, identified as \"worst case\" and \"alternative\" release scenarios. The worst-case scenario requires that that single largest vessel or pipe be evaluated for off-site impacts. An alternative release scenario for chlorine was a break in a pigtail connection to a chlorine tank. \n\nThe worst-case scenario assumes that the entire contents of the largest single container are released, regardless of how improbable that may be. In addition, only \"passive\" mitigation methods such as buildings or dikes (for liquids) can be considered. Passive mitigation, as defined, requires no mechanical, electrical, or human input. The regulations require that the worst-case scenario assume atmospheric conditions that are conservative and result in large impact areas. According to EPA's rule, the toxic gas worst-case scenario must assume the release of the single largest vessel or container over a period of 10 minutes. This dictates a release rate of 2000 pounds in 10 minutes or 200 lbs/min. For worst-case scenarios, releases are assumed to take place without consideration for physical cause or likelihood of occurrence.\n\nThe bulk tank rupture resulting in a chlorine release could be caused by catastrophic events, such as an earthquake. The released liquid is assumed to quickly volatilize and to disperse as a vapor cloud. The distance to the toxic endpoint was estimated using the EPA model RMP*Comp version 1.06. The EPA toxic endpoint is conservatively set by EPA to ensure public notification and that local emergency respond planning takes into account the greatest possible impacted area surrounding the release point. In practice this type of total release of a bulk tank would be unlikely and never occur during the lifetime of the plant. The EPA toxic endpoint is 3 ppm. In addition all required EPA-model input parameters where included in completing this activity, including conservative meteorological condit"

The distance to the chlorine toxic endpoint (3 ppm) was determined to be 3.0 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is more of a possible release scenario that could occur compared to the worst-case release scenario. Unlike the worst case release scenario, active controls can be applied to minimize the leak or impacts. Active controls consist of mechanical, electrical, or human input. The scenario used was a rupture of a pipe leading from the bulk tank to the chlorinator. The tanks and associated piping are all in a building; and the building mitigation was considered. Under this scenario, the amount of chlorine released was calculated to be 14.6 lbs/min. This scenario assumes the release occurs for 60 minutes, an estimated time for plant operators to respond to the event.\n\nThe same modeling approach was used as for the worst-case release scenario, except meteorological conditions were adjusted to the more likely conditions of Stability D Class, wind speed of 3.0 meters per second, average air temperature of 77 degrees F, and average humidity of 50 percent. The distance to the chlorine toxic endpoint (3 ppm) was determined to be 0.2 miles. The area within the distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.13 square miles.

The team consisted of process operating and maintenance experts and process design engineers. The PHA technique used was the What-If study, per acceptable approach guidance from EPA. The PHA was lead by a knowledgeable person on the type of process being reviewed. This review will be updated again within a five-year period or whenever there is major change in the process.

This program has been coordinated (reviewed) by the City of Petaluma Fire Department. This program includes an emergency response notification plan. Emergency response drills and drill evaluations are conducted at least every 12 months; emergency operation and response procedures are also reviewed at that time.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSeveral changes to improve safety (recommended actions) were identified for the chlorination process during the 1999 Process Hazard Analysis under the federal EPA RMP program. It is expected that the recommended actions will be evaluated and implemented by November 1999. The implementation of these recommendations will further improve the safety of the covered processes.\nExecutive Summary\n\nIntroduction\n\nChemicals are widely used in industry, in the home, and in the environment. They are transported on roads, water, and railways. We at the City of Petaluma Wastewater Treatment Plant - Oxidation Ponds (Petaluma WWTP) use chemicals, too. For example, we use chlorine to disinfect our water to provide safe water discharges to the environment or for irrigation uses. Storing large quantities of chlorine can be a hazard. We take our safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as we do take providing the environment safe disinfected water. \n\nTo increase our workers' safety as well as that of the general public, in November 1999, we will be bringing on line a new disinfection system that uses a solution of sodium hypochlorite instead of gaseous chlorine. This will eliminate the potential hazards associated with chlorine.\n\nThe following document describes what could happen if there were to be an accident between now and Novemb"

All applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures. \n\nThis document complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program, under Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990, 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68 and the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program under California Code of Regulations (CCF) Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5. The Petaluma WWTP has a chlorination system that uses chlorine gas fed from liquid chlorine containers. This document summarizes our existing health and safety programs, our internal management response team, policies, procedures, and on-going actions that are designed to prevent or minimize impacts of accidental releases of chlorine to the environment. The Petaluma WWTP has prepared a detailed and comprehensive emergency response plan to handle any potential accidental releases that is designed to safeguard both on- and off-site people. To date, we have had an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring. We have had no chlorine releases that caused safety or health problems (no deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in-place) at the Petaluma WWTP in the past 5 years.\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substances Information\n\nThe Petaluma WWTP, operating since 1973, is located at 4400 Lakeville Highway in the City of Petaluma in Sonoma County."

      "SummaryText": " The plant, located on a 162-acre property, is about 2 miles south of downtown Petaluma and 3/4 mile east of the Petaluma River. Wastewater is initially treated at the treatment plant at 950 Hopper Street. From there it is pumped to oxidation ponds at 4400 Lakeville Highway for additional treatment. Final clean and disinfected water is either discharged into the Petaluma River or pumped to customers as reclaimed water for golf course and agricultural irrigation. Wastewater treatment at the WWTP includes screening, grit removal, sedimentation, biological oxidation and chlorination before final discharge or reclamation use. The Petaluma WWTP handles wastewater flows up to 22 million gallons per day (MGD), with an average flow of between 4.0 to 5.2 MGD.\n\nChlorine is stored in up to 9 one-ton cylinders. Gas phase chlorine under pressure is withdrawn from one of two sets of on-line chlorine containers. Each set contains three 1-ton chlorine cylinders. As many as 3 back-up cylinders are stored in the same room as the cylinders that are on-line. This results in a maximum inventory of 9 cylinders containing a maximum chlorine content of 18,000 pounds. This chlorine storage exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the RMP rule. \n\nThe pressurized chlorine gas from the 1-ton containers is reduced to vacuum, passed through a chlorinator and injected into the final effluent. The resulting chlorine solution is metered into the effluent wastewater for final disinfection. Chlorine leak detectors continuously monitor for leaks in the bulk storage area and in the chlorination room. Other alarms include chlorine feed and residual malfunction. These alarms are annunciated at the chlorine control panel, as well as, in the case of a leak an audible alarm and red flashing warning light on top of the building. The alarm is also sent to an autodialer and an alarm company for response.\n\nThe bulk storage tanks and the chlorinators are enclosed in separate rooms. The chlorinator room is equi"

Self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) equipment is worn whenever connections or maintenance activities are being made to the chlorine system. SCBA equipment is also available at the response team locker location at the Booster Pump Station No. 1, just off the site.\n\nAccess to the Petaluma WWTP is controlled at the Lakeville entrance by a gate. Visitors and contractors must be approved by Petaluma WWTP staff prior to entry into the facility. Operating staff are onsite during the day, during the water reclamation season, and alarms notify on-call staff during off-hours of any problems or situations that require follow-up investigations. \n\nThe chlorination facilities are also provided with an emergency generator. The generator will start within 3 seconds of a loss of electrical power and will supply power to the leak detectors, lighting, and ventilation systems.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two release scenarios, identified as \"worst case\" and \"alternative\" release scenarios. The worst-case scenario requires that that single largest vessel or pipe be evaluated for off-site impacts. An alternative release scenario for chlorine was a break in a pigtail connection to a chlorine tank. \n\nThe worst-case scenario assumes that the entire contents of the largest single container are released, regardless of how improbable that may be. In addition, only \"passive\" mitigation methods such as buildings or dikes (for liquids) can be considered. Passive mitigation, as defined, requires no mechanical, electrical, or human input. The regulations require that the worst-case scenario assume atmospheric conditions that are conservative and result in large impact areas. According to EPA's rule, the toxic gas worst-case scenario must assume the release of the single largest vessel or container over a period of "

For worst-case scenarios, releases are assumed to take place without consideration for physical cause or likelihood of occurrence.\n\nThe bulk tank rupture resulting in a chlorine release could be caused by catastrophic events, such as an earthquake. The released liquid is assumed to quickly volatilize and to disperse as a vapor cloud. The distance to the toxic endpoint was estimated using the EPA model RMP*Comp version 1.06. The EPA toxic endpoint is conservatively set by EPA to ensure public notification and that local emergency respond planning takes into account the greatest possible impacted area surrounding the release point. In practice this type of total release of a bulk tank would be unlikely and never occur during the lifetime of the plant. The EPA toxic endpoint is 3 ppm. In addition all required EPA-model input parameters where included in completing this activity, including conservative meteorological conditions - Stability F class, wind speed of 1.5 meters per second, temperature (77 degree F), and average humidity (50 percent). \n\nThe results of the dispersion modeling analysis for this worst case release scenario indicate that this scenario has an offsite impact. The distance to the chlorine toxic endpoint (3 ppm) was determined to be 3.0 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is more of a possible release scenario that could occur compared to the worst-case release scenario. Unlike the worst case release scenario, active controls can be applied to minimize the leak or impacts. Active controls consist of mechanical, electrical, or human input. The scenario used was a rupture of a pipe leading from the bulk tank to the chlorinator. The tanks and associated piping are all in a building; and the building mitigation was considered. Under this scenario, the amount of chlorine released was calculated to be 14.6 lbs/min. This scenario assumes the release occurs for 60 minu"
