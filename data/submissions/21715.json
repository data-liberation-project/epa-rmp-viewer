This\n\ncommitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training\n\npersonnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our\n\nprocesses. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of\n\nregulated substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control\n\nand contain the release.\n\n\n\nThe Jameson gas plant, located near Silver in Coke County, Texas, produces natural gas liquids\n\nfrom natural gas. These natural gas liquids are comprised primarily of ethane, propane, butane and\n\ngasoline. Some of the chemicals produced or used include methane, ethane, propane, hydrogen\n\nsulfide, diethanolamine, triethylene glycol, butane, and gasoline.\n\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\n\n\nThere are no toxic chemicals stored at the Jameson gas plant above the EPA Threshold Quantity.\n\nThe threshold quantity is the level set by EPA for each toxic or flammable chemical which if\n\nstored at the site requires compliance with the EPA's Risk Management Program regulations.\n\nGenerally, if the amount of a substance stored on-site is less than the threshold quantity, there is\n\nlittle danger to the public. The plant does process natural gas containing hydrogen sulfide, which\n\nis a regulated substance.\n\n\n\nThere are several flammable substances stored at the site above the 10,000 pound threshold\n\nquantity for flammables. Examples of flammables at the site include ethane, propane, butane and\n\ngasoline. The worst-case scenario associated with a release of flammable materials is a vapor\n\ncloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of a 57,634 gallon storage tank containing\n\npropane. Based on EPA analysis, the distance away from the plant affected in this worst-case\n\nscenario would be "

      "SummaryText": "approximately 0.54 miles. \n\n\n\nA more probable release scenario would involve the release of propane from a transfer line during\n\nloading operations. Based on loading a truck in one hour, we would release approximately 1500\n\ngallons in 10 minutes, at which time our operators would detect and isolate the line or gas\n\ndetection would alarm and the plant could be shut down. The affected distance based on EPA\n\nguidance is approximately 0.15 miles, or approximately 790 feet.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Jameson gas plant has a very active accident prevention program in place, primarily based on\n\nthe OSHA Process Safety Management regulations. A summary of some of the accident\n\nprevention programs that are in place follows.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Jameson gas plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe\n\noperation of the processes. These documents include material safety data sheets for all chemicals\n\non-site, up-to-date process and instrumentation drawings, equipment data sheets on all vessels\n\nand equipment and process parameter safety limits. This information, in combination with written\n\nprocedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance\n\nactivities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety\n\nfeatures in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nThe Jameson gas plant has a very comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with\n\nthe various processes are identified and controlled. Each process is systematically examined to\n\nidentify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. The\n\nwhat-if/checklist analysis technique is used to perform these evaluations. The analyses are\n\nconducted using a team of people with operating, maintenance, engineering and safety experience.\n\nThis team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process, as well as"

All approved recommendations from the\n\nPHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. \n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate\n\nsignificantly from the original design and to ensure that new technology is used where\n\nappropriate, the Jameson gas plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.\n\nThese periodic reviews will be conducted at least every 5 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe Jameson gas plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process\n\noperations. These procedures are used as reference by experienced operators, and provide a basis\n\nfor consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and certified\n\nas current and accurate.\n\n\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nOur employees at the Jameson plant have an average experience of over 10 years. This level of\n\nexperience provides a great level of expertise throughout the facility. Ongoing training is\n\naccomplished through routine safety meetings, scheduled training in new processes and refresher\n\ntraining on operating procedures. \n\n\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe Jameson gas plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased\n\nmaintenance or to assist with specialized projects. Contractors are advised about safety and health\n\nhazards, emergency response requirements and safe work practices prior to their beginning work.\n\nIn addition, the company evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the\n\nselection of a contractor. Gas plant personnel routinely monitor contractor performance to ensure\n\nthat contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nThe Jameson gas plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain our equipment in\n\na safe operat"

Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (such as high pressure or\n\n      high level in a vessel).\n\n4.    Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases.\n\n5.    Atmospheric relief devices\n\n\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n\n\n1.    Fire suppression and extinguishing systems. We have two main types of fire suppression\n\n      - monitors with water spray nozzles to cool equipment in case of fire and numerous fire\n\n      extinguishers of several sizes throughout the facility. In gas plants such as Jameson gas\n\n      plant, the control of fire is more dependent on restricting sources of fuel than on putting\n\n      out the fire.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe Jameson plant has not had an incident over the past five years which has impacted off-site\n\npeople or structures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe Jameson gas plant maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to\n\nprotect worker and public safety. The program consists of procedures for responding to a release,\n\nincluding the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substan"

      "SummaryText": "ce is accidentally released.\n\nThe procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical\n\ntreatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation,\n\nnotification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs. \n\n\n\nIn addition, the Jameson gas plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection and\n\ntesting of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of\n\nemergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to\n\nperform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated\n\nwhen necessary, based on modifications made to gas plant processes or other plant facilities\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Jameson gas plant is coordinated with the local\n\nemergency response organizations and the emergency planning committee. This coordination\n\nprovides a means to notify the public in case of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating\n\nquick response to an incident. The facility has recently participated in a joint simulation drill with\n\nthe local emergency planning coordinator of Coke County and several local emergency response\n\nagencies. Not only did we learn more about their capability, but they became more familiar with\n\nour operations and how to respond in case of an incident.\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\n\nThe Jameson gas plant has had very safe operations over its history. However, the facility\n\ncontinually looks for improvements, both to the process and to safety issues at the facility. Our\n\ncompany is very active in promoting coordination between the local emergency response agencies\n\nand our facility personnel. Ongoing communication between our facility and the emergency\n\nresponders is an integral part of our operations."
