The Risk Management Plan (RMP) is organized to correspond with specific U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP, Program 3 of 40 CFR 68, definitions and requirements of Subpart G, including: \r\n\u00bf\tIntroduction;\r\n\u00bf\tOtto and Son's policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\r\n\u00bf\tFacility identification and regulated substances covered processes;\r\n\u00bf\tHazard Assessment;\r\n\u00bf\tPrevention Program;\r\n\u00bf\tFive-Year Accident History;\r\n\u00bf\tEmergency Response Plan; \r\n\u00bf\tEmergency Communications;\r\n\u00bf\tSpill Reporting / Environmental Release Procedures;\r\n\u00bf\tPlanned changes to improve safety; and\r\n\u00bf\tManagement Program\r\n\r\nII.\tOtto & Son's Policies To Protect Health, Environment, and Safety\r\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at Otto & Sons; this RMP formalizes and documents these activities. Otto & Sons is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and to the environment. It is Otto & Sons policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations.\r\n\r\nThis RMP has identified potential hazards and has taken steps to design and maintain a safe facility in order to prevent releases, and minimize the consequences of accidental releases, which could occur. RMP addresses potentially catastrophic chemical releases that could result in immediate harm and acute health effects to offsite receptors (public and environmental).

Response activities will be coordinated with the Cook County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and the Chicago Fire Department Station 49. This coordination effort includes providing the fire departments with site diagrams and hazardous material information, meeting with fire department personnel to discuss facility operations/processes, and periodic on-site inspections by fire department personnel.\r\n\r\nThe facility maintains an ERP on file at the plant. According to the ERP, facility employees are responsible for investigating and assisting the fire department (if necessary) with response to accidental releases of ammonia. The plan includes annual training of all employees on evacuation procedures and emergency notification procedures. The plan also includes annual training for emergency response team members. It identifies the Emergency Response Coordinators, Evacuation Coordinators and alternates. In addition to the facility ERP, the plant is included in a community emergency response plan developed by the City of Chicago. Otto & Sons coordinates with the Chicago Fire Department Station 49 (which includes a HAZMAT Team) on emergency response activities. \r\n\r\nThe facility has a windsock present onsite (located on the top of the building over the engine room) for use in determining wind direction in the event of an ammonia release.\r\n\r\nResponders receive HAZWOPER training through classroom instruction and drills. HAZWOPER training includes the first responder awareness level, the first responder operations level and hazardous materials technician training.

The facility processes ready to cook and fully cooked bacon and ground beef and processes and packages chili, beans and other kettle cooked specialties. The NAICS code for the processes at the facility is 311612.  Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to maintain temperature in the production and storage areas.\r\n\r\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. There is one RMP regulated refrigeration system onsite that is used for refrigerating meat products. The system originally contained a charge of 21,000 pounds of ammonia.  The amount of ammonia currently present in this refrigeration system is approximately 26,000 pounds, which is above the minimum threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds. \r\n\r\nAn area map identifying the site location is included as Appendix A. \r\n\r\nIV.\tHazard Assessment - Worst Case Scenario (WCS)\r\nAppendix B consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the worst-case scenario.
