The primary activity at this facility is the storage, blending, and sale of fertilizers, including the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received by tanker truck and stored in two (2) above-ground pressure tanks.  Aqueous (aqua) ammonia is produced in the on-site converter by mixing anhydrous ammonia and water and then stored in above-ground tanks.  Anhydrous ammonia is transferred to field application tanks and aqua ammonia is transferred to tanker trucks for delivery to farmers.\n\nThe Risk Management Program (RMP) component for preventing accidental releases is embodied in the Process Safety Management (PSM) Program elements included in this CalARP Program document.  The PSM elements are summarized in Chapter 7 (Prevention Program).\n\nThe processes are equipped with numerous administrative and engineered controls (safeguards) to enhance the safety of the systems.  These safeguards include procedures and work practices, as well as safety devices integral to each system.  See Standard Operating Procedures and the Process Safety Information manual for a detailed description of the safety features.\n\nStanislaus Farm Supply maintains an Emergency Action Plan as described in 29 CFR 1910.38 and 8 CCR 3220.  This plan is designed to implement the required notifications and safe evacuation in the event of an accidental release or impending emergency.\n\nStanislaus Farm Supply employees working on or around the ammonia processes are trained to understand, at a minimum:\n\n?   Chemical Hazards as per OSHA Hazard Communication Program (29 CFR 1910.1200).\n?

These procedures apply to contractors who work on the system and employees who are trained to perform any operational or maintenance activities.\n?   Emergency Evacuation procedures in the event of an accidental release of ammonia.  These procedures are provided, or otherwise conveyed, to visitors to the vicinity of the ammonia processes, as well as to employees and contractor employees.\n?   Hot Work Permits protect the facility from fires or other accidents involving welding on the system outside the shop area.\n?   Lock-Out / Tag-Out procedures protect mechanics and operators from accidental return of ammonia or electrical power to equipment undergoing repairs.\n?   Incident Investigation of all ammonia releases of any amount (including near misses) allows Stanislaus Farm Supply to review procedures in place and discuss any changes that may improve work place safety.  These procedures also protect the community in the vicinity of the facility.  All incident investigations must commence within 48 hours of the incident and be completed in a timely manner."
