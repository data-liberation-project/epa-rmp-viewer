The primary activity at the facility is the production of fuel grade ethanol.  Processes involved in this activity include a) the receiving and milling of corn, b) liquefaction of the milled corn to produce mash, c) fermentation of the mash to produce beer, d) distillation of the beer to produce ethanol, and e) denaturing of the ethanol.  \n\nThe regulated substances under the RMP program are Anhydrous Ammonia and Denaturant (natural gasoline) which are considered a toxic substance and flammable mixture, respectively. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and used in the liquefaction process to adjust pH levels. The maximum quantity of ammonia stored would be 102,420 pounds in one storage tank. Denaturant is added to the ethanol at the end of the process so the final product is not fit for human consumption.\n\nSterling Ethanol, LLC has determined that the radius of impact from a worst-case release would be approximately 5.6 miles; due to the amount of anhydrous ammonia stored on site.  The radius of impact for a worst-case denaturant release is approximately 0.5 miles.\n   \nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies:\n\nSterling Ethanol, LLC is committed to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\n\nSterling Ethanol, LLC's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the re"

The two ethanol tanks, two final product tanks, and denaturant tank are all located in a large bermed tank farm containment area that is separated from the plant.  A release from one of these tanks would not be able to migrate off-site, and a fire resulting from a release could be quickly extinguished.  \n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., the Standards of the U. S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of anhydrous ammonia\" and the Standards of OSHA, 29 CFR 1910.119 \"Process safety management of highly hazardous chemicals.\"  The anhydrous ammonia tank is located outside of the main process building and equipped with remotely actuated emergency shut off valves and excess flow shut off valves.  The process building, where the ammonia is used, is ventilated, has high ceilings with a large volume of air into which the lighter-than-air ammonia vapor can generally and easily move above the operating floor and personnel. \n\nAdministrative controls for both the denaturant and anhydrous ammonia include following good engineering practices for maintenance of the systems as designed and installed. Also, administrative controls include following written operating procedures, and utilizing specified personal protective equipment (PPE) for tasks when potential for exposure exists. Sterling Ethanol, LLC conducts employee training as part of facility activities.  Lastly, operations at both the tank farm and anhydrous ammonia tank can be overseen from the Control Room. \n\nFacility personnel at Sterling Ethanol, LLC are not trained to be first responders to large incidents on-site. Sterling Ethanol, LLC has coordinated with the Sterling Fire Department for emergency response procedures.  Sterling Ethanol, LLC has also contracted with a private hazmat company"

If a release were to occur the following response practices are to be implemented: \n\nIncidental Releases (Small Discharge Scenario)\n\nA release is considered an incidental release and does not require immediately notifying the Plant Manager or the EH&S Coordinator if the following is true:\n\nA?    The released hazardous substance can be absorbed or otherwise controlled at the time of release by employees or other trained persons present;\nA?    The release is either inside or outside facility buildings, within secondary containment, on an impervious surface and does not reach pervious surfaces (i.e., soil) or storm water drainage;\nA?    The released hazardous material is less than 25 gallons;\nA?    The release would not have posed a threat to human health and the environment if the release had not been immediately controlled.\n        \n        In response to an incidental release, the following steps will be taken:\n\n1.    If an employee observes a release, the employee will immediately notify a supervisor who will then assess the release.  The employee and/or supervisor may attempt to stop the flow of product if doing so poses no threat or harm.  If the supervisor decides the release does not constitute a threat to human health or the environment and does not require assistance by personnel outside the immediate area of the spill, then clean-up will begin.\n2.    The supervisor or assigned trained personnel will clean-up the spill.  Employees or trained personnel cleaning up the spill will be attired in the necessary personal protective equipment (i.e., goggles, material-compatible synthetic gloves, boots, etc.).  If necessary, clean-up will be preceded by an attempt to stop the discharge, restricting traffic through the spill area, and limiting migration of the release by laying berms of absorbent materials.\n3.    The supervisor or trained personnel will absorb the released material with appropriate disposable materials.  The plant has speedi-dry, sand, and spi"

The Coordinator will complete and submit the proper spill forms and reports required by state and federal agencies.\n\nBoth the truck and railcar loading/loadout areas have been equipped with containment devices. The truck loadout area is concrete and designed to direct the flow of potential spills to drains under this area. The drains are then directed into the tank farm's secondary containment area. A catchment basin is also located immediately below the railcar loadout. A spill to the railcar loadout catchment basin also drains back to the tank farm secondary containment via underground piping. Spill response materials are available throughout the facility to deal with minor spillage, as necessary. Spills shall be cleaned and removed promptly by trained employees. \n\nAdditional Information Specific to Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nUnlike spills of many other liquid products, anhydrous ammonia will immediately evaporate at ambient temperature and pressure. It will not travel overland and into drainage systems at the plant. Therefore, traditional spill containment practices will not work in responding to the release. Facility employees are not trained as first responders for an anhydrous ammonia release and the local Fire Dept. (911) or emergency contractor should"

Although ammonia vapors are lighter than air in some cases ammonia will hug the ground and drift. \nA?    Ammonia has excellent warning properties which may allow escape before concentrations affect health. Many people can detect ammonia odor at 1 to 5 parts per million which is a hundred times less than what is immediately dangerous to life and health. \nA?    Preplan your escape route prior to working near anhydrous ammonia. \nA?    Carefully approach with the wind at your back or perpendicular to incident source. \nA?    If ammonia vapors are drifting across a road, no vehicles should be permitted to drive into the cloud.\nA?    Shelter in place or evacuate those residences down wind depending upon the expected ammonia air concentrations.\n\nOff-site Consequence Analysis Results:\n\nThe worst case scenario at the facility is the release of 102,420 pounds of anhydrous ammonia creating a toxic cloud.  The worst-case scenario is based on the release of all ammonia stored on site.  The worst case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 5.6 miles from the center of the plant.  Public receptors are located within this 5.6 mile radius.  For denaturant the worst-case scenario at the facility is the release of 676,250 pounds of denaturant creating a vapor cloud explosion.  The worst-case scenario is based on a release from the entire denaturant tank and both final denatured ethanol storage tanks.  The worst case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 0.5 miles from the center of the facility.  Public receptors are also located within the 0.5 mile radius.\n  \nAlthough Sterling Ethanol, LLC has numerous controls in place to prevent such a release and to manage potential consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario.\n\nSince Sterling Ethanol, LLC qualifies as a Program 3 due to the close proximity of public receptor"

The ARS is the release of 541,000 pounds of denaturant creating a vapor cloud explosion, which are the contents from just the denaturant tank.  The ARS endpoint is approximately 0.5 miles from the center of the facility.  The ARS for a toxic release of anhydrous ammonia is a leak for a 10-minute duration.  The ARS endpoint is approximately 1.3 miles from the center of the facility.  There are public receptors within both radiuses that would be affected by the alternative releases.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or denaturant in the past five years that: Caused any death, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the continuation of safe conditions. Updates to OSHA regulations, as well as other regulatory updates, are received by email and postal mail to be evaluated by staff regularly. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia and denaturant safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\nEmergency Response Program Information:\n\nSterling Ethanol, LLC has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including a Health and Safety Plan and Emergency Response Plan in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38.
