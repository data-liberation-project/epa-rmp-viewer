Chattanooga Propane Terminal personnel periodically monitor contractor performance with respect to their safety obligations, and provide contractors with applicable safety performance feedback.\n\nPre-startup Safety Review (PSSRs)\n\nThe Chattanooga Propane Terminal conducts a PSSR for any new or modified process that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to see that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check that construction is in accordance with the design specifications and required safety systems are operationally ready.  A PSSR also verifies that appropriate safety, operational and maintenance procedures are in place, and adequate training has been provided to the appropriate personnel.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.  When new facilities are commissioned, a PHA is included in the PSSR.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Chattanooga Propane Terminal has established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include (1) utilization of appropriately trained maintenance personnel, (2) developing written procedures, and (3) performing inspections and tests, and correcting identified deficiencies.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process,  (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable main"

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment operating history, provides a basis for inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes so safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Chattanooga Propane Terminal has a comprehensive program to identify and control hazards associated with the various processes that are identified and controlled.  Within this program, the process is systematically examined to identify potential hazards and controls in place to manage these hazards, and recommend additional controls, as appropriate.\n\nThe facility uses a variety and combination of applicable methodologies to conduct PHA\u00c2\u00bfs.  These PHAs address (1) facility siting, (2) human factors, (3) qualitative evaluation of a range of the possible safety and health effects of failure of controls on personnel, (4) and one or more of the following methodologies appropriate to determine and evaluate the hazards of the process (a) What-if; Checklist, or (b) Hazard and Operability (HAZOP).  PHA\u00c2\u00bfs are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience, engineering expertise, and is led by a person with specific knowledge of the PHA method used.  This PHA team identifies and evaluates potential hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and then makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures.\n\nThe PHA team recommendations are forwarded to local management for resolution.  Implementation of additional prevention and/or mitigation options in response to PHA recommendations is based on a relative priority ranking assigned by the PHA team.  The approved prevention a"

The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.\n\nThe Chattanooga Propane Terminal periodically revalidates these PHAs.  These PHAs are revalidated at least every 5 years, and will be conducted at this frequency until the process no longer contains hazardous chemicals above the threshold quantities.  The recommendations from these revalidated PHA\u00c2\u00bfs are also forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of each revalidated PHA recommendation is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Chattanooga Propane Terminal maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed by qualified knowledgeable personnel and annually certified as current and accurate.  In addition, the Chattanooga Propane Terminal maintains information on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Chattanooga Propane Terminal has implemented a comprehensive training program for employees involved in operating the process.  New operational employees receive training on the Chattanooga Propane Terminal\u00c2\u00bfs operating procedures and basic training in process operations, if they are not already familiar with such operations.

After operators demonstrate adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years, or more frequently upon request.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including demonstrated skills used to verify that the operator understood the training.  Process maintenance personnel are trained in their perspective duties for maintaining the mechanical integrity of critical process equipment and systems.  Operational and maintenance personnel also receive training on the procedures for conducting hot work permitting; management of change; and other appropriate safe work practices.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Chattanooga Propane Terminal uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the Chattanooga Propane Terminal has procedures in place to verify that contractors perform their work in a safe manner.  These contractor safety procedures include steps to verify contractors (1) have the appropriate knowledge and skills to perform their jobs safety, (2) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (3) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (4) understand and follow site safety rules and (5) inform facility personnel of any potential hazards that they introduce or find during their work.

The investigation team documents its recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these recommendations to facility management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation teams\u00c2\u00bf recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the recommendations.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help determine that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Chattanooga Propane Terminal periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate in these audits.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to facility management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team\u00c2\u00bfs findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\nSPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe process at the Chattanooga Propane Terminal has potential hazards that mush be managed for continued safe operation.

The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency duties.  The emergency action plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the process or other Chattanooga Propane Terminal facilities.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the facility has been coordinated with the Chattanooga Fire Department.  This coordination includes periodic emergency response drills and meetings with the local fire department personnel.  The Chattanooga Propane Terminal is manned 24 hours a day and has around-the-clock communication capability with the local fire department.  This interface provides the means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe facility personnel are continually developing ways to improve the safety of the facility.  This is done through responsibility matrices and training which is a vital part of any safety program.  Training is conducted according to a systematic schedule.  All new and modified equipment is designed with approved safety controls and devices.  Additionally, the facility will consider all safety measures resulting from safety audits, PHA\u00c2\u00bfs and safety meeting to mitigate potential accidents and to improve safety."

Employees also participate in safety meetings, resolving certain safety concerns, and updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information pertaining to the process and critical equipment.\n\nEmployees have access to all information created as part of the facility\u00c2\u00bfs accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in a written employee participating plan that is maintained at the Chattanooga Propane Terminal.  This employee participation plan addresses each accident prevention program element.\n\nIn addition, the Chattanooga Propane Terminal has a number of initiatives under way which address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the facility, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and facility management.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Chattanooga Propane Terminal keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific inventories, safety interlocks, suppression systems, vent and relief studies, and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS\u00c2\u00bfs).  For specific process area, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the equipment specifications and operating procedures.  The Chattanooga Propane Terminal maintains the process within these limits by using process controls, monitoring instruments, training personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdow"

      "SummaryText": "Risk Management Plan\nCHATTANOOGA PROPANE TERMINAL\nExecutive Summary\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Chattanooga Propane Terminal has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and/or notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Chattanooga Propane Terminal is located at 530 Manufacturers Road, just east of U.S. Highway No. 27 in Chattanooga, Tennessee.  The Chattanooga Propane Terminal provides storage and terminal operations for propane.  Propane is typically delivered to the facility via railcar and shipped out via trucks.  The storage capacity at the facility exceeds the RMP threshold quantity for propane.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe process at the Chattanooga Propane Terminal is regulated by both the Environmental Protection Agency\u00c2\u00bfs (EPA\u00c2\u00bfs) risk management program (RMP) rule and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u00c2\u00bfs (OSHA\u00c2\u00bfs) process safety management (PSM) standard.  Because RMP accident prevention requirements for this process are essentially the same as PSM, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements, and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program at the Chattanooga Propane Terminal.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Chattanooga Propane Terminal encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention, including process hazard analyses, incident investigations, and the developme"
