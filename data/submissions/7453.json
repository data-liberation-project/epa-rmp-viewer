Specifications for ammonia process are collected and provided in one place for easy reference.  Details such as maximum intended inventory; safe upper and lower temperatures; safe upper and lower pressures; and codes and standards used to design, build, and operate the processes are on file at the facility.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis \n\nIn 1997, detailed Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was conducted for the ammonia system equipment and procedures.  To further assess the integrity of the ammonia system for the preparation of this RMP, an ammonia system checklist was used to assess the overall general condition of the ammonia system operation and maintenance, including human factors that affect personnel performance and system integrity.  The PHA will be updated again within a five-year period or whenever there is major change in the process.  A list of recommended actions were developed to further improve the ammonia safety and staff is currently evaluating these recommendations.  Staff will document the completion of recommended actions.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nMDWASD Hialeah WTP has prepared written operating procedures that provide clear instructions or steps for safely conducting activities relating to the ammoniation process.  They are consistent with the ammonia Process Safety Information.  Written operating procedures include: initial startup, normal operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and start up after emergency shutdown.  In addition, Hialeah WTP developed Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for the following steps in the ammoniation  process: receipt of ammonia delivery and ammonia release/spill response.  Operating procedures will be developed and put in place prior to any new process equipment coming on line or changes made in the handling of ammonia equipment, and reconfiguration of the facilities."

The shut-off valves can also be activated by pressing one of the emergency shut-off buttons.  The emergency shut-off buttons are located on the exterior wall of the ammonia control on the interior wall of the chlorine room, and on the wall of the flocculators near the chlorine system expansion chambers.  When the button is pressed and the valves close, both ammonia supply sources are isolated from the system.\n\nThe pressure relief valves mounted on the storage tanks are equipped with three-way isolating (flapper) valves, which can be utilized to isolate one of the two relief valves. The three-way valve allows either of the two safety relief valves to be isolated while the second relief valve maintains protection for the storage tank. \n\nA spring loaded check valve is located on the liquid fill line, inside each storage tank.  The check valve prevents liquid ammonia from backflowing out of the storage tank while the tank is being filled or in the event the isolation valve was to fail or leak.\n\nAmmonia leak detectors provided near the ammonia storage tanks and inside the ammoniator room monitors continuously for ammonia leaks.  If ammonia gas is detected at 10 ppm, the alarm sounds.\n\nThe Hialeah WTP is surrounded by a perimeter fence and locked security gates.  The plant operates three shifts with employees onsite 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.\n\nThe Hialeah and Preston (adjacent to Hialeah) WTPs are provided with a backup emergency power generator that supplies power to the entire facility.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two ammonia release scenarios, identified as worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario.

The alternative scenario is defined as more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.\n\nAmmonia is the only regulated toxic substance stored and handled at the Hialeah WTP, which is subject to the RMP rule.  Thus, ammonia was selected for the worst-case release scenario.  Only passive or administrative controls are allowed under this scenario to reduce off-site impacts.  The scenario used for the Hialeah WTP is the rupture of one ammonia tank of maximum capacity of 12,000 gallons resulting in the release of 67,200 pounds of ammonia over a 10-minute duration.  Administrative controls are used to limit the filling of the bulk tank to only 12,000 gallons.  There are no passive mitigation at the Hialeah WTP for the ammonia storage tanks; thus, the ammonia release rate will be 6,720 lbs./min.\n\nThe released anhydrous ammonia is assumed to form a denser-than-air cloud consisting of ammonia vapor and liquid droplets (aerosols) and then disperse in the atmosphere.  The distance to the toxic endpoint was estimated using the EPA's RMP*Comp software (version 1.06).  The toxic endpoint selected by EPA rules for ammonia is 200 ppm, which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  The toxic endpoint was conservatively set by EPA to ensure public notification and that local emergency response planning takes into account the greatest possible impacted area surrounding the release point. EPA-mandated meteorological conditions, namely atmospheric Stability Class F, wind speed of 1.5 meter per second, highest daily maximum temperature (77 deg F), and average relative humidity (50%) were used for the worst-case release scenario analysis.  The results of the dispersion analysis indicated that the worst-case release scenario has offsite impacts.\n\nRMP rules require that a scenario which results in offsite toxic endpoint distance and is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario should be selected as the alternative release scenario,"

Unlike the worst-case scenario, the alternative release scenario may consider active mitigation such as automatic shutoff valves, excess flow valves, and containment with scrubbers.  Active mitigation is defined as requiring mechanical, electrical, or human input.\n\nThe alternative release scenarios must consider the facility accident history and/or failure scenarios identified in the process hazard analysis.  A review of the past five-year accident history data for the ammoniation facility pursuant to these rules indicated that there were no ammonia releases, which could have resulted in offsite (outside the Hialeah WTP boundary) toxic endpoint distances.  Similarly, no credible accident scenario was identified from the process hazard analysis, which would reach offsite.  Thus, an acceptable/credible alternative release scenario had to be selected based on expert judgement. \n\nThe alternative release scenario selected involves the release of ammonia from a crack or hole in the piping connecting the storage tanks in the ammoniation processes.  It is assumed that the crack or hole, which develops in the piping (diameter 1-inch), corresponds to a hole of 0.3125-inch (5/16-inch) diameter.  The control room would have been warned of the ammonia leak by the ammonia monitors installed at the facility.  It is assumed that approximately ten minutes would be required for operators or an emergency response team to respond and activate the remote controlled shutoff valves.  The ammonia release rate for this alternative release scenario was estimated at 180 lbs./min.  No passive mitigation was considered for the estimation of ammonia release rate.  However, human input in closing the shut-off valve was taken into account as an active mitigation, which will reduce the quantity of ammonia released to the atmosphere.\n\nThe alternative release scenario toxic endpoint distance was estimated using lookup table from EPA's Wastewater Treatment Plant RMP"

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nChlorine is the most commonly used substance for disinfecting drinking water. The addition of chlorine or chlorine compounds to water is called chlorination.  Chlorination is considered to be the most important process for preventing the spread of water borne disease in drinking water.  There are two methods of chlorination, breakpoint chlorination and chloramination.  The breakpoint chlorination process consists of adding enough chlorine to the water to satisfy the chlorine demand so that free available chlorine residual can be measured.  Chloramination is the process of adding chlorine and ammonia to water, which produces a mono-chloramine residual.  The chloramination process lowers the trihalomethane levels in the finished water.\n\nThe Miami-Dade Water & Sewer Department (MDWASD) Hialeah Water Treatment Plant (WTP) uses chlorine and ammonia for disinfecting and lowering the trihalomethane levels in the finished drinking water to protect public health per state and federal water quality standards.  Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine and ammonia can create hazardous situations.  The Hialeah WTP does not store chlorine on site, it imports chlorine via underground pipeline from the MDWASD's John E. Preston Water Treatment Plant.  The quantity of chlorine present in the pipeline is less than the RMP threshold and therefore this process is not subject to the Risk Management Program/Plan (RMP) requirements.  The Hialeah WTP takes safety obligations in storing and using all chemicals, including ammonia as seriously as it takes care in providing safe drinking water.\n\nThe Hialeah WTP ammonia handling process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule.  This rule requires submission of a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  An integral part of the RMP is a summary of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility, including a description of the possible consequences in case of an accid"

The Hialeah WTP uses a permitting program to ensure that hot work is conducted safely on or near a process involving ammonia. \n\nInternal Compliance Audits\n\nInternal compliance audits will be conducted every 3 years to verify compliance with the programs and procedures contained in the RMP.  The Hialeah WTP will assemble an audit team that will include personnel knowledgeable in the Risk Management Program rule and in the process.  This team will evaluate whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the Risk Management Program rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process.  The results of the audit will be documented, recommendations resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program will be implemented.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Hialeah WTP investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release (serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment) so that similar accidents can be prevented.  An investigation team is assembled and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.  Information found during the investigation is reviewed by affected staff and added or used to revise operating and maintenance procedures.\n\nFive-year Accident History Summary\n\nNo ammonia releases that could have caused safety or health hazard (deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place) occurred at the"

      "SummaryText": "Hialeah WTP during the last five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program Summary\n\nThe Hialeah WTP is a first responder, plant employees respond to ammonia accidental releases.  Depending on the severity of the accidental release, external resources such as the Hialeah Fire Department may be solicited to aid in handling an ammonia release.  As part of the emergency response program, the Hialeah WTP has developed and implemented an emergency action plan for the purpose of protecting public health and the environment.\n\nThe emergency response plan has been coordinated with local response agencies (Hialeah Fire Department).  The main elements of the emergency response plan are: (1) ammonia response flow chart, responsibilities of various personnel at the facility, duties of on-scene incident commander, site response team, and site safety representative, (2) details of emergency recognition and prevention at the facility, (3) procedures for planning and coordination with off-site emergency response organizations, and (4) details of the training program for all employees involved with the ammoniation process. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nNumerous changes to improve safety (recommended actions) were previously identified for the ammonia process in 1997 for ammoniation system equipment and procedures, when a Process Safety Management (PSM) Plan was prepared.  All of these recommended actions have been evaluated for implementation as required."

      "SummaryText": "which is a regulated toxic substance under RMP rule.  Ammonia is stored in two storage tanks of capacity 15,000 gallons (primary tank) and 2,000 gallons (auxiliary tank).  The quantity of ammonia in the tank is determined by means of a float gauge which is calibrated to report the percent of the total capacity based on depth of ammonia in the tank.  These tanks are filled up to 80 percent of their capacities.  Thus, the maximum quantity of ammonia in a single vessel present at the Hialeah WTP will be 12,000 gallons.  The maximum quantity of ammonia present at the Hialeah WPT at any given time exceeds the listed threshold quantity in the EPA rule.  It also exceeds the listed threshold quantity in the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard.\n\nAmmonia is brought to the treatment plant in ammonia trucks and transferred to the bulk storage tanks.  Gaseous ammonia is supplied to the ammoniators under pressure from the top of the storage tank.  The ammonia gas flows through piping to a pressure-reducing valve, which reduces the pressure to a range of 30 to 40, psig.  From the pressure reducing valve (pressure regulator), the ammonia gas then flows through piping to ammoniators located in the ammoniator room.  The ammoniator room houses three ammoniators, each ammoniator is equipped with a rotameter and an orifice for controlling the feed rate manually.  Downstream of the ammoniators, the ammonia gas from each ammoniator flows into a common manifold.  The ammonia flows through this single pipe to the feed points in the treatment process. \n\nHialeah WTP ammonia system is equipped with a number of safety features to protect the employees and the surrounding community from exposure resulting from accidental release or minimize the consequences of an ammonia leak.  The four important safety features are (1) shut-off valves, (2) pressure relief valves, (3) check valves, and (4) ammonia leak detectors.  The shut-off va"
