The same properties that make propane and NGL valuable as a fuel also makes them necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling propane and NGL to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to employees personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is the policy of HILCORP ENERGY COMPANY to adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and local rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle propane and NGL combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility combined with the safe handling and procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\r\n     Our emergency response program is based upon OSHA's Process Safety Management regulations.
