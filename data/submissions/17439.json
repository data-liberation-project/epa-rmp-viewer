      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\nThe Accidental Release Prevention Risk Management Program rule (40 CFR Part 68) is similar to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management Program, which is designed to protect workers from accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The Risk Management Program rule addresses over 100 chemical substances, 77 of which are acutely toxic and 63 of which are flammable gases, and the accidental release of these substances.  The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) estimates that over 100,000 sources are covered by the rule, including chemical manufacturers and wholesalers, certain retailers, potable water treatment systems, wastewater treatment plants, ammonia refrigeration systems, and federal facilities.\nThe Jefferson Street Water Treatment Plant (WTP) falls under this regulation because of the on-site storage of ammonia and chlorine.  The amounts stored for both chemicals are well above the threshold limit specified by the USEPA, thereby making the facility subject to compliance with the regulation.  The Jefferson Street WTP personnel have complied with the USEPA Risk Management Program rule and have completed an Accidental Release Prevention Program (ARPP) Plan that contains the following required information:\n7 A management system (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart A);\n7 A hazard assessment that establishes the worst-case and alternate release scenarios and their impact on the population and the environment (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart B);\n7 A prevention program that includes safety information, a hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigations. (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart C); and\n7 An emergency response plan (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart E).\nThe following subsections discuss details of the plan that have been implemented at the Jefferson Street WTP.\nRELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nThe Jefferson Street WTP facility in Laredo, Texas has an excellent re"

      "SummaryText": "cord in preventing and minimizing releases of ammonia and chlorine.  The emergency response policies at this facility ensure that emergency response coverage is available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  Adequate provisions have been implemented to coordinate activities with outside agencies, such as the Laredo Fire Department HAZMAT team, in the event of an emergency.   In the event of a release, plant staff will contact the Laredo Fire Department.  The staff will receive training to enable an on-site staff response prior to the arrival of the Laredo Fire Department HAZMAT team. \nREGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe Jefferson Street WTP uses chlorine combined with ammonia to disinfect water.  The Jefferson Street WTP has a 10,000-gallon bulk storage tank for ammonia onsite.  However, this vessel is only filled to 85% capacity based on administrative controls; therefore, only 8,500 gallons of ammonia are stored onsite.  This amount translates into a quantity that exceeds the threshold limit of 10,000 pounds set by the USEPA.  The Jefferson Street WTP regularly maintains 26 one-ton chlorine containers onsite.  This amount translates into a quantity that exceeds the threshold limit of 2,500 pounds set by the USEPA. \nPROCESS DESCRIPTION\nThe Jefferson Street WTP is located on the banks of the Rio Grande River, which serves as the source for raw water.  Water is treated at the plant and subsequently pumped to the distribution network of pipelines, pump stations, and storage tanks.  \nThe existing ammonia feed facility at the Jefferson Street WTP consists of a 10,000-gallon bulk storage tank as well as piping and miscellaneous valves used to deliver ammonia to three feed points: the Lower Plant Raw Water Mixing Basin, the Upper Plant Flocculation Effluent, and the Distribution System.  A release of ammonia gas can potentially occur at the ammonia storage area as well as at the three ammonia process areas.  \nThe existing chlorine facilities at the Jefferson Street WTP consist of sto"

The process areas are comprised of chlorine feed equipment, including chlorinators and rotameters as well as piping, miscellaneous valves, and vacuum regulators.  A release of chlorine gas can potentially occur at the storage areas as well as at the process areas. \nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\nThe storage and process areas for both ammonia and chlorine have associated hazards that can potentially affect on-site employees and the off-site population and environment.  The USEPA requires that one worst-case release scenario for the facility and one alternate release scenario for each regulated chemical be reported.  \nWorst-Case Scenario\nThe worst-case release scenario that creates the greatest distance in any direction to an endpoint offsite involves an ammonia release.  The largest potential release of ammonia would occur through a valve failure on the 10,000-gallon tank located onsite.  This valve failure could potentially release all 8,500 gallons of ammonia as a gas.  Under Section 68.25(c)(1), the release time for a chemical such as ammonia is 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls were not applicable to the worst-case release at this plant.\nThe EPA-approved modeling program ALOHA was used to characterize the effects of the worst-case scenario of an ammonia release at the Jefferson Street WTP.  The distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm was determined to be 2.8 miles.  The estimated affected residential population is 85,000 people.  Commercial, industrial and residential areas would be affected in the worst-case release scenario. \nAlternate Scenarios\nOne alternate release scenario for ammonia was modeled for the Jefferson Street WTP.  The release was established as a line break in the piping from the ammonia tank.  Given that maintenance rounds are conducted every two hours, a release of ammonia from a >-inch diamet"

The distance to the USEPA defined toxic endpoint of 200 ppm was determined to be 0.05 miles.  The estimated affected residential population is 22 people. \nAnother alternate release scenario for the Jefferson Street WTP was modeled for a chlorine release.  The release was established as a disconnected <-inch pigtail.  Given that maintenance rounds are conducted every two hours and chlorine alarms are present nearby, a release time of 10 minutes was used.  The distance to the USEPA defined toxic endpoint of 3 ppm was determined to be 0.97 miles.  The estimated affected residential population is 17,000 people. \nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe Jefferson Street WTP carries out consistent operation and maintenance of its ammonia and chlorine equipment, utilizing only fully trained personnel.  The management enforces consistent operation through discipline for operational deviations.  \nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe accident history for the Jefferson Street WTP was reviewed for the period from June 1994 through June 1999.  During this period of time, no accidental releases of ammonia or chlorine had occurred.  \nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nAs mentioned earlier, this facility has developed an Emergency Response Program in which plant employees will be trained in the initial response to a release.  The plant is staffed 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  Plant operators are required to make rounds for inspection and monitoring of the plant processes at least every two hours.  Once a leak is detected, the Laredo Fire Department will be contacted.  \nThe Emergency Response Plan includes: (1) procedures to follow in the event of either an ammonia or chlorine emergency, (2) information about the frequency of employee emergency response training, and (3) a detailed description of the emergency response training to be implemented.\nThe Laredo Fire Department has been"

The most notable planned changes include the following: \n\n7 Ensure that the delivery drivers follow set procedures during the deliveries of ammonia and chlorine. The staff will develop a procedure for the truck driver or vendor to follow while on plant grounds.  It is anticipated that the vendor can then be subjected to this procedure at the time of the plant's next bid for chemical purchase.  The existing vendor will likely accept these requirements voluntarily to ensure customer satisfaction.\n7 Consider installing SCBAs closer to the chlorine areas.\n7 Consider the need for automatic kill switches.  These switches would be useful during an emergency if the processes have to be shut off immediately.  Remote switches also eliminate the danger of plant personnel having to manually shutdown the chlorine and ammonia systems.  Emergency shutdown procedures should be developed and implemented in the training sessions.\n7 Consider installing ammonia gas detection equipment near the storage and process areas as well as chlorine gas detection equipment near the storage areas.  An audible and visual alarm should send a signal to a manned facility.\n7 When the plant facilities are expanded or upgraded in the future, consider the design and construction of containment buildings to encompass the ammonia storage tank as well as to separate the chlorine storage areas from the process areas.  Additional consideration should be given to the capability to chemically neutralize any accidental releases of ammonia and chlorine.  The conversion to a nongaseous ammonia compound might be considere"
