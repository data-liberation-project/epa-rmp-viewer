      "SummaryText": "THE NIAGARA FALLS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe Olin facility, located on Buffalo Avenue in Niagara Falls, NY is part of Olin Corporation. The Niagara Falls Plant has over 100 years of operations.\n\nMaintaining open, positive relationships with the communities is a priority at our plant. We understand that we are an integral part of the community. We support the Olin Community Advisory Panel which was formed in the early 1990's and is comprised of community members who represent near neighbors, business, and education. Semiannually members gather with plant management to share information on topics of mutual interests.  \n\nMany items we use every day depend on the products manufactured at the Olin Niagara Falls Plant.  Our primary products, chlorine and caustic soda, are used to make everything from paper products, textiles, water treatment, household bleach, pharmaceuticals, vinyl products and household goods.\n\nOlin has a safety and environmental program, which relies on the fundamental belief that all accidents are preventable. Our goal is zero incidents. To help ensure that an emergency situation with off-site implications is unlikely to occur, Olin has put six layers of safety and environmental protection in place: Employees, Mechanical Integrity, Process Hazard Review, Process Controls, Safety Systems, and Emergency Preparedness.\n\nFACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\n\nOur facility produces chlorine, sodium hydroxide (caustic), hydrogen, hydrochloric acid (HCl <37%) and sodium hypochlorite (bleach) as a Chlor/Alkali manufacturing facility. Chlorine is produced using membrane electrolyzers. Caustic is produced at 33% strength and is evaporated to 50%.  The chlorine produced is loaded directly into railcars, with minimum on site storage. We do consume chlorine on site in the manufacture of bleach and HCl.  In our process, we use the following chemical that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant off-site consequences in the event of a substantia"

Chlorine is used on site in the production of HCl and Bleach.\n\nAlso included in the RMP list of Regulated Substances and handled at the Niagara Falls facility, but exempt from the regulation are Hydrogen, and Hydrochloric Acid solutions. In the case of Hydrogen, the volume on site is less than the RMP threshold quantity. This product is shipped by pipeline to near industrial neighbors to be processed into a liquid form. Hydrochloric Acid solution falls under RMP regulation in concentrations of 37% or greater.  At the Niagara Falls facility, we produce for internal consumption and for sale, HCl (<37%).\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS \n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management system address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n*  Process Safety Information\n*  Process Hazard Analysis\n*  Operating Procedures\n*  Training\n*  Mechanical Integrity\n*  Management of Change\n*  Pre-startup Review\n*  Compliance Audits\n*  Incident Investigation\n*  Employee Participation\n*  Hot Work Permit\n*  Contractors\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nEmployees:\nWell trained experienced employees are our most important resource in operating our plant and in protecting the community.\n\nMechanical Integrity:\nThe comprehensive inspection and testing program greatly reduces the probability of equipment failure.  We utilize certified and accredited inspectors for inspection and testing.  We also have input from our Area Equipment Integrity Team (AEIT) which meets to discuss equipment issues.\n\nHazard Reviews/PHA's:\nHazard Reviews/PHA's have been conducted on all systems handling hazardous materials, as well as on all new designs prior to operation.  Hazard Reviews identify things tha"

Our goal is zero incidents. To help ensure that an emergency situation with off-site implications is unlikely to occur, Olin has put six layers of safety and environmental protection in place: Employees, Mechanical Integrity, Process Hazard Review, Process Controls, Safety Systems, and Emergency Preparedness. \n\nThese individual elements of our preventive program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention. We also work in conjunction with the Niagara Falls Fire Department and the Niagara County L.E.P.C. to respond to any off-site releases.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at the facility.  During the past five years, we have had no off-site impacting accidental chemical releases as defined by the RMP rule. We did have two releases that resulted in an on-site injury. One on 5/4/21 and one on 5/18/2023 as shown in Section 6.\n\nWe do conduct formal incident investigations to identify and correct the root causes of the events.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nWe maintain an emergency respon"

The key to minimizing the effect of an accidental release is to get the right people and equipment to the scene quickly, including both on-site and off-site emergency responders.  Olin Niagara maintains our own response team, Olin Corporation Emergency Action Network (OCEAN) and equipment to minimize response time.  We also work in conjunction with the Niagara Falls Fire Department and the Niagara County L.E.P.C. to respond to any off-site releases.\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of this chemical.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nOlin continues to look more closely at Process Safety. We capture Process Safety incidents and near misses in our Action Management Tool (AMT) alert system. At Niagara we trend one lagging indicator and twenty-three leading indicators for Process Safety and well as focus on our management systems to push toward our goal of being incident free. There has also been effort to strengthen operational discipline and standardize Olin procedures and management systems across our production facilities."
