The high pressure receiver receives high pressure liquid from the condensers and thermosyphon vessel and supplies high pressure liquid to each zone of refrigeration. The high pressure receiver is also used to provide storage for ammonia not being used in the process at any given moment. The high pressure receiver is equipped with a main liquid feed shut-off valve (king valve) that is clearly labeled and can be used to stop the flow of ammonia throughout the system. Under normal conditions, the high pressure receiver contains high pressure liquid and"

Each accumulator is equipped with an expansion valve which expands the high pressure liquid into a low temperature and pressure liquid as it enters the vessel. The flooded accumulators supply, by gravity, low pressure liquid to the associated evaporators. Liquid and vapor returned from the evaporators is separated inside the flooded accumulators to allow only the vapor to be returned to the main suction accumulator. Under normal conditions, the flooded accumulators contain low pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nAir-Cooling Evaporators (Flooded)\r\nThe purpose of the air-cooling evaporators is to remove heat from the air in order to maintain a predetermined space temperature. The air-cooling evaporators receive liquid from the flooded accumulators. The evaporators contain a set of continuous coils through which the low pressure liquid flows. Due to the low pressures and temperatures maintained in the evaporator, the liquid refrigerant absorbs a great deal of heat from the surrounding area and evaporates. To increase the rate of heat removed, the evaporators use an electric fan to move warm air over the coils of cold liquid ammonia. Once the liquid has evaporated to form low temperature and pressure vapor, it returns to the supplying vessel. Under normal conditions, the air-cooling evaporators contain low pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nMain Suction Accumulator\r\nThe purpose of the main suction accumulator is to prevent liquid from entering the compressors. The main suction accumulator receives vapor from the flooded accumulators and separates any residual liquid from the vapor to allow only the vapor to be piped to the suction of each compressor. Liquid in the main suction accumulator drains by gravity into the liquid transfer vessel. The main suction accumulator is equipped with a high level float switch that"

Under normal conditions, the main suction accumulator contains low pressure vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nLiquid Transfer Vessel\r\nThe purpose of the liquid transfer vessel is to transfer liquid from the low side of the refrigeration system back to the high pressure receiver. The liquid transfer vessel receives liquid from the main suction accumulator. Once the liquid level in the liquid transfer vessel reaches the float switch, the three way solenoid valve is energized for a period of time causing the liquid transfer vessel to become subject to high pressure and allowing the liquid to drain by gravity into the high pressure receiver. Under normal conditions the liquid transfer vessel can contain either high or low pressure liquid and vapor.\r\n\r\nCompressors\r\nThe purpose of the compressors is to raise the temperature and pressure of the low pressure gas in order to reject the heat absorbed in the evaporator to the atmosphere. The compressors receive low pressure vapor from the main suction accumulator and discharge high pressure vapor to the evaporative condensers. The compressors are equipped with high discharge pressure cutouts to shut the equipment off if the pressure exceeds the setpoint. Under normal conditions, the compressors contain both high and low pressure vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nEvaporative Condensers\r\nThe purpose of the evaporative condensers is to reject the heat absorbed in the evaporators to the atmosphere. The evaporative condensers receive high pressure, superheated vapor from the compressors and supply high pressure liquid to the high pressure receiver and thermosyphon vessel. The condensers use air and water to cool the warm ammonia as it passes through a series of tubes within the condenser. As the cooling medium of air and water draws the heat from the vapor, the refrigerant condenses into a liquid and flows to the high pressure"

Under normal conditions, the evaporative condensers contain high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nThermosyphon Vessel\r\nThe purpose of the thermosyphon vessel is to provide a supply of liquid ammonia necessary to cool the oil in the compressors. The thermosyphon vessel receives high pressure liquid from the condensers and supplies high pressure liquid to the thermosyphon oil cooler on each screw compressor. Excess liquid in the thermosyphon vessel is piped to the  high pressure receiver. High pressure ammonia vapor formed in each oil cooler is returned to the thermosyphon vessel. Under normal conditions, the thermosyphon vessel contains high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nOil Cooler\r\nThe purpose of the oil coolers is to remove heat from the oil being circulated through them. The oil coolers receive liquid from the thermosyphon vessel. High pressure liquid and vapor exits the oil coolers and is returned to the thermosyphon vessel. Under normal conditions, the oil coolers contain high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nSafety Systems\r\nAmmonia detection is installed for each refrigerated room/zone by either an ammonia sampling system, or standalone ammonia sensor. If ammonia is detected above 25 ppm in a refrigerated zone, the unit will send an alarm signal to Kern Security. Kern Security will page the refrigeration operator at M&L Cold Storage. During an alarm situation, the liquid feed solenoid valve that supplies the room will be shut down automatically.\r\n\r\nIf ammonia is detected in the machinery room in concentrations above 25 ppm, the unit will send an alarm signal to Kern Security, activate an audible horn, and a visible strobe light outside the machinery room. Kern Security will page the refrigeration operator at M&L Cold Storage. Additionally, the machinery room detector will automatically activate the emergency ventilation at 25 ppm.\r\n\r\nThe machinery room is equipped with two (2) roof-mounted emergency ventilati"

      "SummaryText": "Nevertheless, M&L Cold Storage continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\r\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved M&L Cold Storage's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that M&L Cold Storage's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\r\n\r\nM&L Cold Storage has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\r\n\r\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, M&L Cold Storage has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\r\nFor the future, M&L Cold Storage now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a living document. It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for M&L Cold Storage employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program M&L Cold Storage will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety."

Details regarding the relief valves are summarized below:\r\n\r\nEach relief valve has a set pressure equal to or less than the MAWP of the equipment that the relief valve protects;\r\nEach relief valve has a capacity which meets or exceeds the requirement of ANSI/IIAR 2-2014 Addendum A \u00a715.3.8;\r\nAll relief valves terminate into two (2) ammonia diffusion tanks;\r\nSelect relief valve assemblies are equipped with a relief vent indicator (RVI) to assist in recognizing that an overpressure event has occurred. Indicator flags are mounted to the shaft of the RVI on the outside of the housing. A paddle is set such that any sudden flow in the relief vent line pushes it down simultaneously raising the flags which then provide a clear signal that a relief valve has lifted. Stoppers mounted to the exterior prevent the flag/shaft from rotating more than the 90\u00ba swing;\r\nThe main suction accumulator is equipped with a high level float switch that is wired to shut down the compressors in the event of a high liquid level in the vessel. This prevents liquid ammonia from entering the compressors.\r\n\r\nProcess Classification\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at M&L Cold Storage consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping.
