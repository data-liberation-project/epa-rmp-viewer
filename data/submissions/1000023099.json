      "SummaryText": "IWI\n2125 Joe B. Jackson Parkway\nMurfreesboro, TN \nRefrigeration System Process Description\n\nOverview\n\nThis system is a single stage configuration utilizing Hanson controllers for system operation.  There are a total of three screw compressors that handle the refrigeration loads.  Two of the compressors (C-1 & C-3) operate on both a -22A?aF recirculator package and a +22A?aF package. Compressor C-2 can only operate on the lower temperature package.  All compressors also have a smaller side port that allows each to maintain the higher temp package.  \n\nThere are two separate suction temperatures.  A -22A?aF low temperature recirculator maintains the freezer rooms and a +22A?aF high temperature recirculator maintains the dock temperatures and convertible rooms at +30A?a or above.\n\nThere are two rooftop mounted evaporative condensers and both are connected to a remote sump.  There are also two plate and frame heat exchanger units for under floor heating. \n\nProcess Description\n\nLiquid Side:\n\nThe liquid supply for the system starts at the condenser.  The condenser removes heat from the superheated vapor discharged from the compressors such that the vapor changes to a liquid (condenses).  This condensed liquid leaves the condensers and flows to the thermosyphon receiver, V-1.  \n\nThe high-pressure liquid leaves thermosyphon receiver and feeds the high temp recirculator package. It also supplies liquid to all of the compressors for oil cooling.  The low temperature recirculators package gets fed liquid from the high temperature vessel.  \nThe low and high temperature recirculators are operated at -22A?XF and +22A?aF, respectively.  Float switches and solenoid devices control the liquid supply to V-2 and V-3.  The liquid from the low and high temperature recirculators is pumped to the different evaporator units in the plant.\n\nVapor Side:\n\nThe compressors pull ammonia vapor from both the high temperature recirculator and the low temperature recirculator vessels.  The pressure th"

      "SummaryText": "at this is pulled at, called the suction pressure, helps determine the temperature in which the respective areas are being cooled to. \n\nThe compressors remove the vapors from the high or low temperature recirculator through suction line and potentially through the side port depending on the load.  Regardless of the recirculator temperature on the suction side, the discharge of all the compressors is sent to the main discharge header, which feeds the condenser unit.  The condenser removes heat from the superheated vapor discharged from the compressors such that the vapor changes to a liquid (condenses).  \n\nAdditionally, as required, some of the superheated discharge vapors (hot gas) are diverted for use as a defrosting medium for the evaporators.  The hot gas is sent through the evaporators for removal of ice that has built up on the coils.\n\nDefinitions\n\nSingle Stage Compression System:\n\nA single stage compression system utilizes one or more compressors to pump the refrigerant vapor from the low-pressure side to the high-pressure side of the refrigeration system.  Each compressor discharges directly to the condenser units via a common header. \n\nRecirculator System\n\nA recirculator system is a combination of a vessel, pumps, valves and other components used to feed a refrigeration circuit.  The cycle center system supplies liquid to the various evaporators.  The outlet of the evaporators (consisting of liquid and vapor) is returned to the recirculator vessel for separation of the liquid and vapor.\n\nThe application can be either a low temp or high temp application. The liquid feed can be sub-cooled through an intercooler or fed directly from the receiver.\n\n\n"
