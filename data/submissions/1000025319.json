      "SummaryText": "This RMP is applicable to a natural gas liquids (NGL) pressurized storage tank.\n\n\n\nI.    Facility and Process Description \n\nAt this location, a natural gas Mechanical Refrigeration Unit (MRU) chills natural gas from area natural gas wells, delivered via pipeline. The unprocessed natural gas is dehydrated and chilled in the MRU. In the MRU, lighter materials, (e.g. methane, ethane), are extracted and re-introduced into the natural gas transmission pipeline. The remaining heavier materials, (e.g. propane, pentane), are stored in their liquid form in a pressurized NGL Storage Tank. NGLs are offloaded to a NGL tanker truck for transport to an offsite location for further processing.\n\n\n\nThe NGLs contain several regulated substances, (e.g. propane, n-butane, pentane, etc.), and the entire NGL mixture meets National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) rating 4 criteria for flammability. The amount of NGLs stored onsite is exceeds the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds. A risk management plan was drafted prior to onsite storage exceeding the threshold quantity.\n\n\n\nII.     Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nTo prevent accidental releases, the facility trains personnel on the operation of the pressurized natural gas liquids (NGL) Storage Tank and equipment using the National Propane Gas Association's (NPGA) Certified Employee Training Program (CETP), U.S. Department of Transportation training, manufacturer's training, and internal training. There are no employees permanently stationed onsite; however, at least one trained employee will be onsite to supervise tanker truck loading, consistent with their training and written operating procedure. Site conditions and some tank conditions are monitored 24-hours per day via telemetry at a centralized Control Center and supplemented with periodic visual inspections by trained personnel. Trained personnel conduct a monthly \"look, listen, and hear\" leak check. A visibly marked manual shutoff with notice is next to the tank.\n\n\n\nAccidental"

These technologies include integrated valve shutoff for all tank piping, over-pressure relief valves, excess flow valves, \"Smart Hose\" Flow Shutoff Valves, and emergency manual tank shutoff.\n\n\n\nIII.    Five-year Accident History \n\nThere have been no accidents at this site since the RMP was drafted and the site became operational. There is no five-year accident history, as the site has not existed for five years.\n\n\n\nIV.    Emergency Response Program \n\nIn the event of an emergency, the Control Center or any personnel that may be on-site will contact the local fire department to respond to the emergency. The local fire department also may respond based on their own notification via 911 or other emergency communication. The Energy Cooperative will provide technical assistance the local fire department during emergency response as required.\n\n\n\nV.    Planned Safety Improvements\n\nThe facility was designed to include integrated safety measures. The tank was designed and tested to ASME standards and API standards were used for all associated piping. There were no additional safety measures identified in the most recent process hazards analysis.\n\n\n\nVI.    Revisions\n\nThis RMP was revised to include updated maps, corrected scales, additional training requirements, and an updated Hazard Review and Compliance Audit conducted on October 31, 2013. The NGL Storage Tank maximum capacity was revised from 77,779 lbs. to 78,625 lbs. due to a change in the NFPA 59, Table B.2 Correction Factor from 1.0 to 0.988; there were no process changes made at the facility. A RMP inspection was conducted by the Ohio EPA Division of Air Pollution Control on June 10, 2014."
