Pepperidge Farm takes many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia.  These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure, a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the system, a training program designed to ensure that the system is operated by qualified personnel, and emergency response procedures which enable trained personnel to respond quickly to system upsets.\r\n\r\nThe Maintenance Manager is responsible for the management of the ammonia safety program.\r\n\r\n\r\nB.   Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nPepperidge Farm's Downingtown Plant produces frozen food products for sale to the public.
