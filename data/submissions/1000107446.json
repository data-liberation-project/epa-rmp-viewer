The Terminal handles and stores various grades of unleaded gasoline, diesel, butane, ethanol, and petroleum additives for distribution to retail and commercial end-users in the vicinity of Sewaren, NJ. The Terminal straddles State Street with most of its processing equipment and storage falling on the east side. This Risk Management Plan covers the Butane Railcar Offloading, Tank Blending, and Truck Loading/unloading process located on the west side. \n\nShell is committed to operating and maintaining processes in a safe, reliable and environmentally sound manner. Shell believes that excellent performance in health, safety, and the environment go hand in hand with operating reliably, and that outstanding HSE performance is of paramount importance.\n\nSewaren Terminal is designed, operated and maintained in a manner that protects the environment, as well as the health and safety of its employees, contractors and the community. Shell promotes health, safety, and the environmental stewardship through programs of awareness, compliance, prevention and protection. These programs include a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that Shell has designed and implemented, including:\n\nA. A description of the facility and the use of regulated substances\nB. An overview of the accidental release prevention programs\nC. A five-year accident history for accidental releases of regulated chemicals\nD. An overview of the emergency response program\nE. An overview of planned changes to improve safety\n\nA.

Sewaren Terminal is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety and health. Safety at the facility depends upon the manner in which butane is handled as well as the various safety devices incorporated into the design of the process. Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees, which reinforces the safety policies and procedures of the facility.\n\nSewaren Terminal has variable inventories of butane. The Butane Railcar Offloading, Tank Blending, and Truck Loading/Unloading System provides the Sewaren Terminal the capability to offload butane from railcars and trucks and blend the butane into gasoline tanks. In addition, it also allows for the direct transfer of butane from railcars to tanker trucks. The system consists of one (1) truck loading/offloading rack with three (3) bays, one (1) rail spur holding up to nine (9) butane railcars with two (2) rail offloading locations, one (1) air-eliminator, one (1) vapor return pump, two (2) liquid butane pumps, and associated piping and appurtenances. Butane can be offloaded from either tanker trucks at the three (3) loading rack bays or from railcars at the two (2) railcar offloading locations. The butane is then transferred to one of twelve above-ground, floating roof storage tanks for blending with gasoline. The System also provides the Sewaren Terminal the capability to transfer butane from railcars directly into tanker trucks. Truck loading can occur at Loading Rack Bays 2 and 3. Process safety controls include: \"Smart Hose\" (or equivalent) breakaway hoses at the truck offloading/loading stations, railcar excess flow valves, Snappy Joe Emergency Shutoff Valves, thermal/hydrostatic relief around all isolatable sections of piping, a pressure relief valve on the air eliminator, truck"

Access to the Sewaren Terminal is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel and authorized contractors/visitors.\n\nB. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION MEASURES\n\nThe accidental release prevention programs and emergency planning and response programs help to effectively manage the hazards posed by the regulated substances to employees, the public, and the environment. The covered process is regulated by the EPA RMP regulation 40 CFR Part 68 and NJDEP TCPA Title 7, Chapter 31, as well as the OSHA Process Safety Management standard 29 CFR 1910.119. The following accident prevention program elements are in place at the Sewaren Terminal:\n\n1) Employee Participation\n2) Process Safety Information\n3) Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) with Risk Assessments\n4) Standard Operating Procedures\n5) EHS Operator Training\n6) Contractors\n7) Pre-startup Safety Review\n8) Mechanical Integrity with Preventive Maintenance\n9) Work Permits\n10) Management of Change\n11) EHS Accident or Potential Catastrophic Event Investigation\n12) Emergency Response\n13) Compliance Audits\n14) Trade Secrets\n\nThese fourteen (14) individual elements of the prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases. The company and its employees are committed to the standards required by these management programs. In addition to the above elements, Sewaren Terminal also has specific prevention measures that are employed as part of the operating procedures and engineering and administrative controls to help contain/control a release, quickly detect a release, and reduce the consequences of a release. These are briefly summarized as follows:\n\nGeneral Risk Reduction and Safety Measures\n\n-Engineering and construction in accordance wit"
