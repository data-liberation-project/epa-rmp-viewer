In fulfilling this commitment, management systems are in place to provide the resources and training to maintain compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration?s (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, ensuring that safety is incorporated into the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes. Accident prevention is emphasized through strict operating procedures, safe work practices, ongoing training and administrative and operational controls. While continually striving to prevent accidental releases, should one occur, the refinery maintains a well-trained and equipped Emergency Response Team for fast response and incident mitigation and control.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Tosco Los Angeles Refinery Carson Plant, located in Carson, California, is a petroleum refinery that converts various crude oils into intermediate products. The Carson Plant supplies Tosco?s Wilmington Plant with these intermediate streams and they are subsequently used to produce gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and other petroleum products. Other co-products of the refining processing such as coke, sulfur, and carbon dioxide are sold directly from the Carson Plant. The refinery produces and/or uses regulated flammables, including propane, butane, hydrogen and mixtures of regulated flammable substances. Tosco?s Carson Plant does not exceed the EPA threshold quantity for any RMP regulated toxic substance.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nTosco?s Los Angeles Refinery, Carson Plant has no regulated toxics in quantities that exceed listed federal threshold values, therefore; this Risk Management Plan conta"

Controls to prevent and/or mitigate such a release were not considered during this evaluation, therefore; the butane is assumed to release, completely vaporize and ignite into a vapor cloud explosion. The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for these WCSs would include offsite impact.\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for flammable substances is a VCE resulting from a release of butane during railcar loading. The maximum distance to the 1-psi overpressure endpoint for this ARS includes offsite impact in the immediate vicinity of the refinery. \n  \nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe Tosco Los Angeles Refinery has a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that follows the elements found in the OSHA PSM standard to prevent incidents from occurring. The following is a summary of these elements and a description of the management system that is in place to implement the prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nActive employee participation is regarded as essential to the continuous improvement of the LAR PSM program, and hence in the prevention of accidents. LAR has a written employee participation policy that outlines the many ways in which employees are involved in the accident prevention program, and employees have access to all information generated within the program. All process hazard analysis teams include an experienced unit operator, and employees are also members of teams formed for compliance audits, incident investigations and pre-startup safety reviews. The plant emergency response team is comprised of qualified employees who receive specialized training and participate in "

Employee assistance is enlisted to develop training programs and operating procedures and compile other critical process information. Additionally, LAR has various safety programs designed to increase plant safety by encouraging employee involvement. \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nLAR maintains key technical documents that contain information essential to safe operation of the various processes. This information is accessible to employees to facilitate the identification and understanding of hazards posed by chemicals used or produced in the processes and includes chemical hazard, process technology and equipment information.\n\nMaterial Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs) have been compiled for all chemicals used onsite, whether or not they are deemed hazardous. MSDSs include information regarding a chemical?s toxicity, corrosivity, thermal and chemical stability, permissible exposure limits, hazardous effects of inadvertent mixing with other materials and other physical data.\n\nOperating Information Manuals have been prepared for the various process units. Information available in the manuals includes process flow diagrams, safe operating limits for process parameters, consequences of deviation from design criteria, controls, alarm and shutdown settings and inventory.\n\nEquipment design and construction documents on file include information such as process and instrumentation diagrams, construction specifications and materials and electrical classifications.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nLAR conducts a comprehensive program to identify potential hazards that may be associated with processes in the various units and thereby control/properly manage them.\n\nThe Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) technique is the type of process hazard analysis (PHA) utilized at LAR to ensure that a systematic study of each process is carried out.

Over the past 5 years, only one RMP incident has occurred. While this incident, in October 1997, resulted in the soiling of offsite properties with hydrocarbons, the properties were cleaned and no known health impacts resulted. All incidents of any kind, including near misses, that have occurred have been carefully investigated and critiqued to prevent recurrence. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe Los Angeles Refinery maintains a written emergency response program that is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the process and the environment. The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies, the public, and post incident cleanup and decontamination procedures. In addition, the refinery has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, testing and use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures to perform specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated based on modifications to refinery processes or other refinery facilities.  The emergency response program changes are administered through the Management of Change (MOC) program, which includes informing and/or training aff"

This includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The refinery has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate officials including the Fire Department and Law Enforcement.  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, as well as facilitating appropriate response to an incident.  The Los Angeles Refinery conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the local emergency response organizations and provide information to local emergency responders regarding hazards and locations of regulated substances in the refinery. \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nTosco?s Carson Plant is proud to announce the elimination of all federally regulated toxic substances in excess of threshold quantities. Formerly, chlorine was utilized in water treatment. Carson?s management reviewed its operations and in a commitment to worker and public safety, replaced chlorine with a safe bleach-based substitute. Additionally, at the Carson Plant it was feasible to replace high concentration aqueous ammonia with a much lower concentration that is not deemed hazardous by the federal EPA. Other safety enhancing projects underway at LAR include structural member fireproofing upgrades and deluge systems upgrades. \n\nSafety is a priority at LAR. The safety program includes various elements aimed at continuous improvement, such as annual computer-based training for all employees, annual refresher training classes, safety meetings conducted at least monthly and safety bulletins to alert personnel when a safety concern is noted.\n\nContinuous improvement is also an operational goal. Recommendations from process hazard analyses, audits, incident investigations and employee input provide opportunities to enhance the safety of the refinery.\n\nSeismic reviews of the facility have been con"

The worst-case scenario associated with state regulated toxic substances at the Carson Plant is a failure of a unit process vessel, resulting in the release of hydrogen sulfide over a 10-minute period. While the refinery has safeguards in place to prevent release and to mitigate serious consequences should a release occur, no mitigation was considered in evaluating this scenario. The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 30 ppm (0.042 milligrams per liter) for this WCS is offsite, outside the refinery.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for hydrogen sulfide is a line rupture. The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 30 ppm for this ARS would include offsite impact in the immediate vicinity of the refinery.\n\nThe release incident described in the five-year accident history section of the federal RMP is also valid for CalARP. The release of hydrocarbons that occurred in October 1997 included hydrogen sulfide. No health impacts resulted from this release.\n\nTosco?s prevention and emergency response programs are discussed in the federal summary.\n\n\n \nCONOCOPHILLIPS LOS ANGELES REFINERY CARSON PLANT\n RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\n\nCERTIFICATION\n\nTo the best o"
