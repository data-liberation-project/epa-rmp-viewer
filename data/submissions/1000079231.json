Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThis facility stores chlorine for tempering wheat and bleaching flour.  This facility observes safety precautions in handling chlorine to reduce the threat to workers, members of the community, and the environment, and adheres to applicable Federal and state rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which the facility handles chlorine, the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility, the safe handling procedures that are used, and the training of personnel.\n\n\n\nEmergency response for this facility is coordinated with the St. Louis Fire Department HazMat Team.  This includes procedures for notifying the HazMat Team in the event of an accident involving chlorine.\n\n\n\nB. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe regulated substance at this facility is chlorine.  Chlorine is stored in cylinders, and is used for tempering wheat and bleaching flour.\n\n\n\nC. Off-Site Consequence Analysis\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Scenario: As a worst-case scenario, it is assumed that the entire contents of a single chlorine cylinder is released as vapor over a ten minute period.\n\n\n\nAlternative Scenario: A more realistic release scenario involving chlorine would be a slow vapor release from a 1/4 inch hole resulting from a piping failure at a flange, joint, weld or seal.\n\n\n\nd. Accidental Release Prevention\n\n\n\nThe key concepts in this facility's prevention program are employee participation, appropriate design and maintenance of equipment, and appropriate training for employees.\n\n\n\ne. Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThis facility has not had any accidents involving chlorine that require reporting under EPA's Risk Management Rule.\n\n\n\nf. Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nEmergency response at this facility is coordinated with the St. Louis Fire Department HazMat Team, such that in the event of an accident, immediate emergency response measures can be implemented.\n\n\n\ng."
