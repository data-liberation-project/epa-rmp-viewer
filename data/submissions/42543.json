      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe City of Fredericksburg Wastewater Treatment Facility is located on Beulah Salisbury Road in Fredericksburg, Virginia.  The facility treats wastewater received from the City of Fredericksburg before discharging it into the Rappahannock River. The City of Fredericksburg Facility uses chlorine for disinfection and sulfur dioxide for dechlorination as part of its treatment process.  The facility receives chlorine and sulfur dioxide in one-ton (2,000-pound) cylinders.  The City of Fredericksburg Facility stores up to a maximum of seven cylinders of chlorine and five cylinders of sulfur dioxide at any given time.\n\nChlorine and sulfur dioxide are toxic substances regulated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program Rule [40 CFR Part 68].  The City of Fredericksburg Facility has prepared a Risk Management Plan (RMP) in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.\n\nAccident Prevention\n\nThe City of Fredericksburg Facility has used chlorine and sulfur dioxide in its treatment system for its entire operating history.  During that time, facility personnel have taken considerable care in the storage and handling of these substances.  The facility receives one-ton cylinders of chlorine and sulfur dioxide by truck, lifts them using a motorized crane designed specifically for moving one-ton cylinders, and places them on saddles designed specifically for the storage of these cylinders. Before accepting a cylinder, facility operators check the condition of the cylinder and inspect it for leaks.\n \nSensors are located within the chlorine and sulfur dioxide storage areas.  The chlorine sensor alarms when the chlorine concentration exceeds 1 part per million (ppm).  The sulfur dioxide sensor alarms when the sulfur dioxide concentration exceeds 10 ppm.  The alarms notify the operators of low concentrations of chlorine and sulfur dioxide in the storage areas so that the operators can respond immediately and correct the situat"

The facility treats wastewater received from the City of Fredericksburg before discharging it into the Rappahannock River. The City of Fredericksburg Facility uses chlorine for disinfection and sulfur dioxide for dechlorination as part of its treatment process.  The facility receives chlorine and sulfur dioxide in one-ton (2,000-po"
