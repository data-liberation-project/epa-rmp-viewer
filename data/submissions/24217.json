      "SummaryText": "Carter-Wallace, Inc.\nShippers Warehouse\nDallas, Texas\n\nRMP* Submita EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nJune 18, 1999\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nCarter-Wallace, Inc. is engaged in the manufacture and sale of a diversified line of Consumer  and Health Care products.  Carter-Wallace leases approximately 12,500 square feet of warehouse space within the Shippers Warehouse facility. The facility, which is a public warehouse located in Dallas, Texas, operates eight hours per day and five days per week. Carter-Wallace employees one person at the warehouse to oversee the Carter-Wallace operations.\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\n\nThe operations affected by the risk management plan (RMP) involve the receipt and storage of aerosol product in consumer size containers.   Product is moved throughout the warehouse via forklift trucks.\n\nVarious hydrocarbons are used as propellants in the aerosol products.  The hydrocarbons are defined by the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) as hazardous materials.  The USEPA enforces regulations designed to minimize the potential for an accidental release associated with handling hazardous materials. The aerosol product propellants are listed as hazardous due to flammability. \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Carter - Wallace operations at Shippers Warehouse have not had any major release of product or accidents within the five-year accident review period.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nThe USEPA accident prevention regulations require companies to analyze what is defined as a worst case release scenario. The worst case release scenario is defined as the sudden loss of containment of the product in the largest tank, vessel or container. The worst case release scenario assumes that several highly unlikely events occur simultaneously such as:\n\nCatastrophic failure of aerosol cans within a case;\nFailure of all automated safety and alarm systems;\nFailure of trained and experienced operators to respond appropriately; and\nThe event occurs during least likely stagnant meteorological conditions."

      "SummaryText": "\n\n Carter-Wallace used USEPA developed guidance (Risk Management Program Guidance for Warehouses) to complete the modeling of the worst case release scenario.  The modeling shows that there would be no impact on the surrounding community.\n\nThese results classify the Carter- Wallace operations as a USEPA defined Program 1 facility.  A Program 1 facility, as defined by the USEPA, presents a minimal risk to the community.\n\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nCarter-Wallace has developed programs to comply with the required environmental, health and safety standards. We take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals through:\n\nCompliance audits                                \nOperating procedures    \nAccident investigation \nTraining    \nEmployee participation\n\n\nIn addition to management programs, there are systems to control and mitigate potential accidental releases.  These systems include an early suppression, fast response sprinklers and portable fire extinguishers throughout the warehouse. These systems are routinely inspected.\nAll of the forklift operators are properly trained.\n \nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nCarter-Wallace has created a culture of continuous improvement of its safety program.  We train our employees to safely perform their assigned tasks.  We also encourage suggested changes or improvements that will help minimize the potential for unanticipated failure of operating equipment including the forklift trucks.\n\n\nEMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE\n\nCarter Wallace has an emergency response plan detailing procedures to respond to accidental releases and other emergencies. Our plan has been shared with local emergency response personnel. \n\nIn the event of an emergency affecting the local community, Carter-Wallace will work closely with local, county and stage agencies to help ensure public safety.  These agencies take the lead in informing the public on appropriate actions in the event of an emergency."
