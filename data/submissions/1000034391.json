This commitment is reflected in a comprehensive accidental release prevention program. This program addresses the design, installation, operation, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process equipment at the facility. \n\n\n\nJensen Meat's senior management is not only committed to offering superior service, but also to maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities. Jensen Meat's safety and environmental policies as they relate to the ammonia refrigeration system are administered by the Chief Operating Officer, who conducts inspections of the facility to ensure compliance.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe systems at 2550 Brittania Blvd., San Diego, CA were constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the 2010 California Fire Code, 2010 California Mechanical Code, 2010 California Building Code in place at the time of construction.  The facility was constructed in 2013.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration systems are closed systems that cycle the refrigerant, or ammonia, from liquid to gas and back again.  The systems, consisting of vessels, piping, valves, and process equipment, cycle ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for food processing and storage.\n\n  \n\nChanges in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature: lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature.  Low-pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat.  Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize.  Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed b"

Typical operating conditions range from approximately 18.6\"Hg on the low-pressure side of the system to 165.9 psig on the high side for System 1 and 17\"Hg on the low-pressure side of the system to 174 psig on the high side for System 2. \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Jensen Meat ammonia refrigeration systems have many safety features.  Much of the safety of the systems is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the systems.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with Cal/OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.  The facility conducts preventative maintenance and any necessary minor repairs in house, but an outside contractor is hired for major repairs or maintenance.\n\n\n\nThe facility including the ammonia systems was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code applicable at the time of construction, which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration systems.  These safety features include ammonia sensors in the engine room as well as sensors in the cold rooms and vent line.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine room and just outside of the engine room (condensers). All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that are piped to an ammonia diffusion tank.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, Jensen Meat has developed a preventive maintenance program that utilizes the services of a professional refrigeration contractor to complete regularly scheduled inspections and tests of the ammonia refrigeration systems as well as repairs as needed to process equipment.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe refrigeration system at Jensen Meat is of new construction at the time the PSM/RMP/CalARP documentation was submitted.  System start up is scheduled for May 2013 for System 1 and October 14, 2013 for System 2.  Therefore, there ha"

In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release, nor any releases or \"near misses\" that warranted an internal incident investigation.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Jensen Meat facility has an emergency action plan in effect.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP/CalARP document. This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe operator of the facility maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP and CalARP regulations.\n\n\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (conducted March 8, 2013 (System 1), April 22, 2013 (System 1), and October 1, 2013 (System 2)) generated mitigation measures (recommendations) to improve safety at the Jensen Meat facility located in San Diego, California.  The mitigation measures include additional training, key maintenance related tests/inspection, and enhanced emergency response policies and procedures.  The Jensen Meat safety committee is planning to complete several items, including the recommendations, over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.
