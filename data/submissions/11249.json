This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activity is the operation of a Natural Gas Processing Plant for the production of Liquified Petroleum Gases.  We have seven regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Methane, Ethane, Propane, Isobutane [Propane, 2-methyl], Butane, Isopentane [Butane, 2-methyl-], and Pentane.  These regulated substances are components of the inlet gas, the LPG product, and the residue natural gas\n\nThe maximum inventory of the regulated substances at our facility is:\n\nMethane\t\t\t\t  16,000 lb\nEthane\t\t\t\t  49,000 lb\nPropane\t\t\t\t  67,000 lb\nIsobutane [Propane, 2-methyl]\t  22,000 lb\nButane\t\t\t\t  38,000 lb\nIsopentane [Butane, 2-methyl-]\t  43,000 lb\nPentane\t\t\t\t  17,000 lb\n \n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo evaluate the worst case and alternate release scenarios, we have used EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.

Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response to an accidental release of a regulated substance.\n\n5.\tFive-year Accident History\nThe McLean Gas Plant has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases.  There have been no accidental release during the last five-year reporting period.\n\n6.\tEmergency Response Plan\nThe McLean Gas Plant has a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes phone numbers for notification of emergency responders and the local emergency response agencies.  We have also coordinated emergency response actions with the McLean Fire Department.  This Plan is periodically updated to reflect any pertinent changes that have taken place.\n\n7.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nThe developments and findings that result from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program are routinely evaluated to determine whether any changes could be made to improve safety at our facility.

The most recent PHA Update was performed on August 26, 1996.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, the McLean Gas Plant maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation, such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nThe McLean Gas Plant has a training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least once every three years, and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nThe McLean Gas Plant conducts documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on August 3, 1996.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.
