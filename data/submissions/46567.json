The procedures also discuss safe upper and lower process limits, consequences of deviation from the safe limits, and how to return the process to safe operations. The procedures are readily available to operations personnel, and are reviewed and certified annually. Safe work practices such as hot work, lockout and line breaking, are referenced in operating procedures, where applicable.\n\nTraining\nAll operations personnel of Sweeny Cogeneration Facility are initially trained in an overview of the ammonia process and the procedures to safely operate the process. Operations personnel receive refresher training every three years.\n\nContractors\nSweeny Cogeneration Facility uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors will work on or near the ammonia process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors are pre-qualified before performing work, aware of the hazards of the process, understand what to do in the event of an emergency, understand site safety rules, and inform plant personnel of any hazards they encounter during their work. AEP also evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection process.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSR)\nSweeny Cogeneration Facility conducts a pre-startup safety review for any new facility or significant facility modification. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety systems, procedures, training, and equipment are prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. A PS"
