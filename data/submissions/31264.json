      "SummaryText": "since 1923.  The Savannah plant is a manufacture of chemical additives to the pulp and paper industry.  For example, epichlorohydrin is used in the production of wet strength resins.  These resins are used in paper towels, napkins, tissues, etc, so that they hold their strength when they get wet.  Epichlorohydrin is a raw material for the process and is consumed in the chemical reaction to make the product.  The plant receives epichlorohydrin primarily in railroad tank cars and occasionally in tank trucks.  The epichlorohydrin is stored in a single 279,000 pound capacity tank within a containment dike which has adequate capacity to hold 110% of the volume of the tank. The railcar unloading area also drains drains into the tank containment dike.  A water blanket of 4 inches is maintained in the storage tank dike to reduce the potential for release of epichlorohydrin vapors in the event of a spill or leak into the dike.  \n\nAccident Prevention\nThe Hercules-Savannah facility complies with the OSHA PSM rule.  As a PSM facility, Hercules completes a detailed Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) every 5 years.  The PHA seeks to identify and address potential causes of incidents before they occur.  In addition, PSM training on safe handling of equipment and chemicals is conducted every three years for all Kymene area operators and all maintenance mechanics.  Management of Change (MOC) procedures are followed to ensure that any changes that occur in the Kymene process do not have the potential to result in an increased risk of a safety incident or an accidental release. In addition, routine maintenance is conducted under the facility\u00bfs preventative maintenance program to ensure that equipment critical to the safe handling of epichlorhydrin is maintained in good condition at all times. System interlocks ensure that incompatible chemicals are never mixed together.  \n\nEmergency Response \nThe facility maintains an emergency action plan.  All plant employees are trained in how to clean"

      "SummaryText": "up small spills and releases in their area, how to contain larger spills, and how to report a spill or release.  Due to the small size of our work force, we rely on emergency response contractors for clean up of significant spills of hazardous chemicals. \n\n\nFive Year Accident history \nWe have had no accidental releases of epichlorohydrin in the past five years.  Likewise, we have had no safety incidents involving the handling of epichlorohydrin.  \n\nPlanned changes to improve safety\nHercules just completed security upgrades at the Savannah location by installing camera surveillance of the front gate and parking area, installation of a new card key access system for plant employees, and improved perimeter fencing.   The facility conducts security background checks for new employees.  As of 2004, Hercules has requested that contractors perform security screening contract employees assigned to work at our facility and that contractors provide photo identification whenever they arrive at the facility. Routine security inspections of the plant grounds were initiated in June 2004 and are being conducted monthly."
