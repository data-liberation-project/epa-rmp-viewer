Simplot Company to provide a safe work environment for every employee and to protect them from injury and illness resulting from unsafe acts or conditions during hours of employment.  Simplot will also comply with all federal, state and local laws.  The California Manufacturing Manager has the responsibility for leadership of the safety and health program, for its effectiveness and improvement, and for providing the safeguards required to ensure safe conditions.\n\n\n\nAmmonia safety programs are key items in the plant safety and health program.  Simplot takes many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia.  These precautions include safety controls such as alarms and automatic shutdown devices which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions, a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel, and emergency response procedures which enable trained personnel to respond quickly to system upsets.\n\n\n\nB.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe J. R. Simplot Company, Lathrop facility produces fertilizer, industrial chemicals, and feed supplements. Two of the listed chemicals in 40 CFR 68.130, anhydrous ammonia and ammonium hydroxide, are processed, stored, and handled in quantities exceeding regulatory threshold limits.\n\n\n\nC.  Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia and ammonium hydroxide are used and stored in specific areas of the plant and employees assigned to these areas are trained to understand the hazards involved and to handle them safely.  Employees receive initial training and an annual refresher appropriate to the job when hired or when re-assigned.  The training includes methods to avoid accidental releases of hazardous materials, eme"
