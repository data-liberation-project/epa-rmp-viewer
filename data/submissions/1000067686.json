Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe North Sauty Creek Water Treatment Plant is strongly committed to employee, \n\npublic and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive \n\naccidental release prevention program in place that integrates areas such as design, \n\ninstallation, management practices, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee \n\ntraining associated with the chlorination process at our facility.  The chlorination system \n\nat our plant is designed to meet industry standards and is well maintained.  Appropriate \n\ncontrols and alarms are also in place to prevent possible releases of chlorine.  \n\nFurthermore, all applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency \n\n(EPA) Prevention Program Level 2 are adhered to.\n\n  \n\nIn the event an accidental release does occur, our facility is coordinated with the \n\nJackson County Emergency Management Agency, local fire and police departments, as \n\nwell as, Harcros Chemicals in Muscle Shoals, Alabama.  These institutions provide \n\nhighly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate effects of the \n\nrelease.\n\n\n\n2. Our Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nOur facility is a publicly owned water treatment plant.  Our primary activity is \n\ntreating potable water and pumping it into the Board?s distribution system for public use.  \n\nWe provide water to the residents, businesses, and industries in Scottsboro, AL and much \n\nof Jackson County, AL.  We have one regulated substance, Chlorine.  Chlorine is used \n\nfor disinfecting the water.  The maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 8,000 \n\npounds.\n\n\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario\n\n\n\n3.0    Hazard Assessment\n\n \n\nThe RMP Rule requires The Scottsboro Water, Sewer and Gas Board North Sauty Creek Water Treatment Plant \n\nto perform a Hazard Assessme"

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific \n\nPrevention Steps.\n\n\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release \n\nprevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA regulations.  The \n\nfollowing sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is \n\nin place at our facility.\n\n\n\nSafety Information\n\nOur facility maintains a record of safety information that describes the chemical \n\nhazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the chlorine \n\nprocess.\n\n\n\nHazard Review\n\nOur facility conducts a comprehensive overview and analysis of our chlorination \n\nsystem to ensure that the associated hazards are identified and controlled efficiently.  The \n\nmethodology used to carry out this analysis is a hazard review checklist specifically \n\ndesigned for water plants.  This checklist was designed to meet the requirements of The \n\nChlorine Manual published by The Chlorine Institute.  The analyses are performed by \n\nqualified personnel and are revalidated at regular intervals.  Any findings related to the \n\nhazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our chlorination process, \n\nour facility maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various \n\nmodes of operation such as i"
