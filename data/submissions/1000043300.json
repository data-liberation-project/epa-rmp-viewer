Inspections, maintenance and employee training are important components of our accident prevention program.\n\n\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies: The owners, management, and employees of Chippewa Valley Ethanol Co, LLLP are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of aqueous ammonia or denaturant by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training of all persons that work with the materials. Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. The facility also has prepared an Emergency Action Plan that addresses response to incidents and evacuation.\n\n\n\n2. Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled: The primary activity at Chippewa Valley Ethanol Co, LLLP is the production of ethanol from corn. Aqueous ammonia is received by truck, stored, and used in the ethanol production process as a buffer and nitrogen source during the fermentation process. The facility also uses natural gasoline as a denaturant for the final product. The natural gasoline is a flammable mixture (NFPA 4) that contains pentane and iso-pentane, among other ingredients.\n\n\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps: Chippewa Valley Ethanol Co, LLLP has implemented Process Safety Management and Risk Management Plan Prevention Programs to manage the use of its covered materials. These programs cover employee participation, process hazard analyses, training, standard operating procedures, mechanical integrity, emergency response, compliance audits, hot work and other safe work practices, process safety information, management of change, prestart- up safet"
