(Nu-Foam) plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, we handle toluene diisocyanate (TDI), which is considered hazardous and is regulated by the EPA.  The same properties that make TDI valuable for use at our facility also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in the handling of the substance.  TDI is considered a toxic substance, and associated safety precautions have been implemented to (1) prevent unnecessary human exposure, (2) reduce the threat to the health of our employees at the Nu-Foam Chattanooga plant, and (3) reduce the threat to nearby members of our community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to the safety of our employees and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Successful implementation of our accidental release prevention program will help ensure that emergencies are unlikely and reduce the likelihood that emergency response procedures will be needed.  Nevertheless, an emergency such as a release of TDI is possible.  We have emergency response procedures to help ensure that accidents will be mitigated properly without undue risk to the public, environment, employees, contractors, or other personnel within the plant.\r\n\r\nDescription of the facility and the regulated substances handled\r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to produce polyurethane foam, which is sold to other facilities and is used to produce furniture, bedding, carpet padding and a number of other products.  TDI is one of the reactants required to produce our polyurethane foam.  TDI is received by railcar and by tank truck, and is stored in two indoor storage tanks.  The maximum quantity of TDI stored in the process (i.e., in storage tanks and in up to seven standby railcars) at our plant is about"

Our Emergency Action Program/Contingency Plan includes procedures for responding to a release of TDI.  Our procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency action program is updated when necessary, based on modifications made to plant processes or other facilities, by using management of change procedures.  Personnel affected by changes in the program are informed and trained on those changes.\r\n \r\n The emergency response plan for the plant is coordinated with the LEPC.  This coordination includes providing them with a copy of the ERP and subsequent telephone call and invitation to tour the plant.  The plant has around-the-clock communications capability with the appropriate LEPC off"
