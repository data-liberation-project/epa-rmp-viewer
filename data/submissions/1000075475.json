After products are heated to the required temperature, the products are then subjected to an ammonia refrigeration process that reduces the temperature of the products to a refrigerated state.\n\n\n\nBecause the refrigeration process uses anhydrous ammonia, which is considered a highly hazardous chemical, and we have an amount on site that is considered above the federal \"threshold\" quantity, we are subject to various Federal, State, and Local Regulations.  One of these regulations is 40 CFR?68.10-42, which states that we must create and maintain a \"Risk Management Program\" (RMP).\n\n\n\nPart of our RMP is to implement a Process Safety Management Program (PSM).  The PSM program explains the steps we have and will take to prevent an accidental release of ammonia.  The PSM program evaluates the process design & technology, process changes, operational and maintenance activities and procedures, non-routine activities and procedures, emergency preparedness plans and procedures, training programs, and other elements that affect the process.\n\n\n\nThrough our ongoing implementation of the PSM/RMP program, McLane Classic Foods looks continuously for possible ammonia refrigeration system changes to improve safety in our facility.\n\n\n\nIn the unlikely event of an accidental release of ammonia, McLane Classic Foods policy is to immediately evacuate all employees, contractors, and visitors that may be affected to a safe location, account for those employees, contractors and visitors and call the Johnson County Fire Department to respond to the release.  No employees of McLane Classic Foods have been trained to respond to a release of ammonia and are not expected to participate in the mitigation o"
