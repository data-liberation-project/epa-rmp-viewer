Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Plan\nChicagoland-Quad Cities Express, Inc. carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response, including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, and notification of local emergency response agencies and the public.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our warehousing process that would require a modified emergency response."

It was previously revised to address additional data elements required to be included in all RMPs by June 21, 2004 per USEPA rule changes.\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Chicagoland-Quad Cities Express, Inc. - Bridgeview are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as hazardous materials segregation procedures, material handling equipment maintenance, and employee training associated with storage of hazardous materials at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nWe have one (1) regulated substance present at our facility:  formaldehyde.\n\nWe have varying inventories for this chemical.  For this reason we are filing this RMP report under the predictive filing concept.  Formaldehyde is a component of several customer-packaged materials that we store in our warehouse.  Maximum quantity of material stored is approximately 28,000 pounds.\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for reported scenario.\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used RMPComp.  Both the worst case and alternative scenarios will be a toxic liquid release with an endpoint of 0.012 mg/l.  Our results from the worst case and alternative scenarios indicate that we could have public and environmental receptors within the distance to the endpoint.  Population potentially impacted was estimated using United States Census Bureau data, and environmental receptors were determined using United States Geological Survey maps.\n\n4.

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nChicagoland-Quad Cities Express, Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards (MSDS) for the regulated substance.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducted a comprehensive study to ensure that hazards associated with our warehousing process were identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out this analysis was Industry Checklist, as recommended by CMA's Warehouse Assessment Protocol.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis were addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Chicagoland-Quad Cities Express, Inc. maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as segregation and storage procedures, use of forklifts, loading and unloading, examination of damaged containers, labeling of containers, and bracing, stacking and handling damaged containers.\n\nTraining\nChicagoland-Quad Cities Express, Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided on an yearly basis and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nChicagoland-Quad Cities Express, Inc. carries out highly documented maintenance checks on forklift equipment to ensure proper operations.  Materials handling equipment examined by these checks include forklifts.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n5.  Five-yea"
