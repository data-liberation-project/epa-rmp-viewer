(Nebraska Beef), located in Omaha, Nebraska, provides refrigeration for meat processed from carcasses.  Nebraska Beef\u00bfs senior management is not only committed to offer superior service, but also maintain a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  Nebraska Beef administers safety and environmental policies at the facility to ensure compliance with OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management (PSM) and EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Program (RMP).  These programs include forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers documentation, and the Emergency Response Plan.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system was installed at Nebraska Beef in 1995.  Nebraska Beef began operations at the facility in 1995.  The facility is located at 4501 South 36th Street, Omaha, Nebraska 68107.  The system was designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.\n\nThe system uses 75,322 pounds of ammonia to provide refrigeration for meat processed from carcasses.  The majority of the system including vessels and compressors is located within facility walls.  The condensers are mounted on the roof and all of the evaporators are located in their respective freezer/cold storage areas.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Nebraska Beef ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.    For example, the Nebraska Beef operates in accordance with OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management regulation.\n\nOther safety features of the ammonia refrigeration system include: ammonia sensors that sounds an alarm to the ammonia operator, re"

In particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\u00bf is used at the facility.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Nebraska Beef facility located in Omaha, Nebraska, has not had any reportable ammonia releases over the last five years (November 2000 through November 2005).\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nNebraska Beef has an emergency response plan in effect at the facility.  The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM document, which is maintained at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\nNebraska Beef maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes due to the renovation of the facility.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) performed on November 30, 2004, generated mitigation measures (recommendations) to improve safety at the Nebraska Beef facility located at 4501 South 36th Street, Nebraska 68107.
