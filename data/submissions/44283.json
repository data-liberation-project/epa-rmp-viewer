The system was designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.\n\nThe system uses 75,322 pounds of ammonia to provide refrigeration for meat processed from carcasses.  The majority of the system including vessels and compressors is located within facility walls.  The condensers are mounted on the roof and all of the evaporators are located in their respective freezer/cold storage areas.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Nebraska Beef ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.    For example, the Nebraska Beef operates in accordance with OSHA?s Process Safety Management regulation.\n\nOther safety features of the ammonia refrigeration system include: ammonia sensors that sounds an alarm to the ammonia operator, re"
