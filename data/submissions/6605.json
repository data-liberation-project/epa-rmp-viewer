The Plymouth Wastewater Treatment Plant has been designed by professional engineers and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  In the event of an emergency, the Plymouth Fire Department will be notified to respond to the emergency.\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled.  This facility is a wastewater treatment facility.  Chlorine is used for wastewater disinfection.  The chlorine system consists of two 2,000-gallon chlorine tanks and associated piping, valves, and other miscellaneous equipment.  A third chlorine cylinder is typically stored on site.\n\nThe worst-case and alternative release scenarios. The worst case scenario is the release of the largest quantity of the substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to a toxic endpoint.  The largest quantity stored in a single vessel is 2,000 lbs.  For the worst case analysis, it is assumed that this entire quantity is released over a ten-minute period.  The calculated distance to the worst case release assessment endpoint exceeds the distance to any public receptor as defined by 40 CFR Part 68.  The alternative scenario is a release caused by a faulty process connection.  It was calculated based upon a flashing liquid release where liquid chlorine flashes immediately to vapor and fine liquid droplets and is carried downward.  Based upon a review of USGS and USEPA information, no public receptors are within distance to the endpoint.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps. This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. The chlorine system is designed, installed, maintained, tested, and operated in accordance with state law.\n\nFive-year accident history.  No accidents involving the chlorine system that resulted "
