      "SummaryText": "The Buckeye Terminals, LLC. - Lima South Terminal complies with the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA)#58(2001 Edition) for Liquified Petroleum Gas Storage, and it is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws/codes.  If an emergency were to occur, it is the facility's policy to notify the Shawnee Township Fire Department, (distance from terminal is 0.5 miles) as well as the Allen County LEPC, as necessary.  Medical emergencies will require notification to the local Emergency Management Services (Shawnee Township) and St. Rita's Hospital.  This facility maintains a incipient stage fire extinguisher) trained personnel and hazardous materials response team (First Responder Level) to respond to small or initial stages of an emergency.  The Buckeye Terminals, LLC., - Lima South Terminal is a bulk gasoline (kerosene/deisel) storage facility, including butane blending operations.  The Risk Management Program (RMP) covers the butane blending system, including the associated piping and two 87,659 gallon storage tanks.  The facility's worst case scenario is the failure of one of the system's two 87,659 gallon storage tanks when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% at 60 Degrees Fahrenheit) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint (1PSI overpressure) extends off-site 0.6miles and includes public and environmental receptors.  The facility's alternate (most likely resulting in off-site impacts) release scenario is a BLEVE.  The resulting distance to the endpoint (1 PSI overpressure) extends off-site, but affects minimal residential areas.  The BLEVE has similar impacts.  The Buckeye Terminals, LLC - Lima South Terminal complies with the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) accident prevention rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR Part 1910.119), and all applicable state and local "

      "SummaryText": "laws and regulations.  This butane blending system is designed, constructed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA #58 and the manufacturer's (Texon L.P.) instructions. The Butane Blending System is approved by the State Fire Marshall. To date, this facility has never had an accident involving butane which has resulted in deaths, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.  In the event of an emergency involving the Buckeye Terminals, LLC. - Lima South Terminal's butane blending system, it is the policy of the facility to initially contact the Shawnee Township Fire Department and request their assistance.  Secondary response is provided by the City of Lima Fire Department and a variety of local volunteer departments (Perry Township Fire Department, etc.).  The facility maintains a trained fire brigade and hazardous materials response team.  The facility emergency response plans are coordinated with the fire department and the Allen County LEPC.  The Shawnee Township Fire Department has participated in RMP/PSM orientation/training session for this system (February 15, 2013) and is aware of the process.\n\n\n\nEfforts to improve system safety include a simplified electronic inspection mechanism.  Additionally, Buckeye is currently considering the mandatory use of flame resistant coveralls during off-loading activities.\n\n\n\nDue to remote nature of injection point relative to existing emergency shutoff devices (ESDs), Buckeye is considering additional ESD activation mechanisms.  Buckeye intends to update the local fire department relative to recent system changes."
