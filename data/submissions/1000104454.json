The Emergency Response Program is written, includes specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release, includes procedures for informing the public and local agencies responsible for responding to an accidental release, and includes information on emergency health care.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety\n\nThe BEN E KEITH - GULF COAST, TEXAS FACILITY is incorporating and addressing any recommendations resulting from the Process Hazard Analysis, Offsite Consequences, and program audits. The flexibility of the program allows the BEN E KEITH - GULF COAST, TEXAS FACILITY to respond effectively to prevent or minimize any potential exposure of BEN E KEITH - GULF COAST, TEXAS FACILITY employees, the surrounding public, and/or the environment to a release of anhydrous ammonia. Specific actions taken to improve safety are the implementation of the Program 3 Prevention Program described above, improved operator training, administrative controls, and computerized system controls. Updates since the last RM-Plan submission: Moved the PSM/RM program to an online program that allows access to the PSM/RM programs 24/7/365 from any internet connected device, added an additional ammonia technician to better maintain the system, sent operators to refrigeration school (GCAP), installed three new condensers, and updated PPE equipment. Upcoming improvements include: new refrigeration compressor, updating the condenser water treatment system, and upgrading operating panels on compressors."

The five-year accident history\n\nA five-year accident history has prepared and included in this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan). The accidents that have occurred in the past 5-years were identified during the 2022 Process Hazard Analysis study. The three accidents reported and recorded on the 2022 PHA were not reportable accidents, but were investigated as near misses, as they did not cause ammonia releases that exceeded the reportable quantity of 100 lbs. over a 24-hour period. To prevent and/or minimize any potential future release of anhydrous ammonia, the BEN E KEITH - GULF COAST, TEXAS FACILITY has implemented a detailed Process Safety Management program (Preventive Program 3).\nNear miss 1: 5/15/2021. O-ring failure on compressor's relief valve. The relief valve was replaced and the remainder of the similar-style relief valves were leak checked.\nNear miss 2: 6/05/2021. Excessive ice causes an evaporator fan blade to break. The route cause was identified as failed door seals on the penthouse door allowing excessive moisture to enter the penthouse and freeze on the coil and blades. The facility has since began to check penthouse evaporators daily and is sourcing new door seals.\nNear miss 3: 2/14/2023. A forklift traveling in an unauthorized forklift area struck an evaporator - resulted in damaged equipment, but no ammonia release. Site is installing a physical barrier to prevent forklifts from entering the area and is evaluating the remainder of the evaporators for proper guarding.\n\n6. The emergency response program\n\nEmergency response is discussed in the Risk Management Program (RMP) binder of the complete program.  The BEN E KEITH - GULF COAST, TEXAS FACILITY has a detailed Emergency Response Plan for their facility. The purpose of this plan is to provide the means for rapidly determining the appropriate response for any emergency that may develop at the faci"
