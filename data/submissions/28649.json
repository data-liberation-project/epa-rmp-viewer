The maximum intended inventory of ammonia is 15,000 pounds.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\nWorst Case Release Result Summary\n\nScenario Description : Release of the maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored in a vessel (the High Pressure Receiver has the capacity to hold 10,448 pounds) in 10 minutes.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used: 1.5 meters per second wind speed, and F stability.  Since the HPR vessel is located inside, the enclosure of the building was considered a passive mitigation measure, reducing the effective release rate to the outside atmosphere by 55%.  The Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration reference tables were used to determine the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm in urban conditions.  This release reaches 0.9 miles off site and may impact population receptors.  A city park is also in the 0.9 mile radius zone.\n\nAlternative Release Result Summary\n\nScenario Description : The alternative release scenario presented is similar to the worst case in that it is a liquid release.  The alternative release scenario chosen for this facility is that of a 0.25 inch diameter orifice leading to an airborne release, representative of a pump seal leak, a gasket rupture, pinhole leak due to corrosion, flange seal leak, valve bonnet seal leak, etc.  It is assumed that this release is from the high side of the system; therefore at a maximum pressure of 180 psig.  The release scenario is assumed to continue until the full charge is released, thereby incorporating mitigation measures such as the ammonia sensors and system shutdown.\n\nEPA allows a facility to use typical meteorological conditions at the facility. For this scenario, a wind speed of 3 meters/second and neutral conditions, D stability, were used to find the distance the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm in a urban area.\n\nEPA's"

This release reaches 0.1 miles off site.  No population or environmental receptors were affected by this potential release.\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe WestFarm Foods ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP). \n\nAmmonia detectors are strategically located in the engine room.  In case of ammonia detection, visible and audible alarms will activate at the facility and at the computer system.\n\nIn the event of a power failure, ammonia operations would automatically shut-down (solenoid valves close, compressors shut-down, condenser fans and water pumps shut-down, evaporator fans shut-down, etc.).\n\nThe system also incorporates a pressure relief line.  In the event of over-pressurization, vessels will vent to a common header which relieves to the atmosphere.  This mechanism prevents vessels from rupturing in case they become over pressurized.\n\nAmmonia refrigeration systems do not experience any chemical reactions or internal corrosion.  The only composition change that occurs within the systems are phase changes, as ammonia is cycled through various stages of liquid and vapor, similar to a household refrigerator.  The refrigeration system is a closed-loop system without any regular emissions or releases.  Any leaks are noted and repaired immediately.\n\nIn addition to the 1997 Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility will operate in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines.  In particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, Startup,"

To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nWestFarm Foods maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\n\nWestFarm Foods has coordinated emergency response efforts with the local fire department, the Portland Fire Department.  In the case of an ammonia-related emergency, it is the policy of WestFarm Foods to evacuate the employees and to allow the fire department to respond to the emergency (potentially with the assistance of trained facility personnel).\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nWestFarm Foods began operation at the facility in 1978.  The ammonia system at WestFarm Foods consists primarily of vessels, compressors, condensers, evaporators and associated piping.  The majority of the equipment is located inside the engine room.  The system is a closed loop refrigeration system similar to a residential refrigerator.
