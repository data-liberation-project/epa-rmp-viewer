These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nThe Valero Logistics Operations, L.P. - El Paso Terminal conducts audits to determine whether the provisions defined  within the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits identify corrective actions, which are then resolved in a prompt manner. \n\nIncident Investigation\nThe facility promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of five years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nThe El Paso Terminal believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility\u00bfs implementation of the RMP rule. \n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out. The Valero Logistics Operations, L.P. - El Paso Terminal has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor\u00bfs work and the processes.

In this scenario, 336,045 lb. of propane is released from one of the storage tanks without consideration for emergency shutdown valves or operator action.  The vessel is assumed to be full, and the entire quantity is released as a vapor.  The vapor then finds an ignition source, with ten percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the calculated distance to the 1 psi endpoint will have offsite impacts.\n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances involves a release of propane.  The release is assumed to result in a vapor cloud explosion.  The scenario involves the release of 5,125 pounds of propane in ten minutes from a leak in a pipe.  The release is controlled by active mitigation measures that include emergency shut off valves.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 psi overpressure would extend offsite.\n \nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThe Valero Logistics Operations, L.P. - El Paso Terminal has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements defined within 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.

This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\nStationary Source Description\nOur facility\u00bfs primary activities encompass the storage and sale of motor fuel.  We have three regulated substances present at our facility above the threshold quantity: propane, ethyl mercaptan and a flammable mixture.  Propane is transferred through sales at a truck rack, while ethyl mercaptan is used to odorize the propane prior to loading.  The flammable mixture is contained in a tank, which captures the interface product mix during pipeline transfers.\n\nHazard Assessment Results\nTo evaluate the worst case scenario, we have used the EPA's RMP*Comp(TM) software.  For the alternative release scenario, the EPA's RMP Guidance for Propane Storage Facilities Reference Tables were utilized. The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe Valero Logistics Operations, L.P. - El Paso Terminal has invested a great deal of time and effort to reduce the potential of any hazardous material release.  These efforts include the stringent design codes that the facility is built to, the routine inspections and monitoring that are performed daily, as well as the periodic inspections and repairs.\n\nThe combination of these systems ensures that small releases will be addressed quickly, and large releases can be effectively mitigated with no impact on the surrounding community.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances as a"
