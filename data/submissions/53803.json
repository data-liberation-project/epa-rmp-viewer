The reason for submitting this RMP is to comply with the mandatory five year resubmission.  This facility has refrigeration systems using anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia contained in these systems meets the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) threshold reporting quantity.\n\nPilgrim's Pride is committed to the safety of its employees and the surrounding community.  Our accidental release prevention policy is designed to comply with the Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations.  These regulations are designed to prevent the accidental release of ammonia and minimize negative consequences in the event that a release should occur.  Our emergency response policy is designed to comply with all government emergency response regulations.\n\nPilgrims Pride Corporation?s accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n? Hands-on and classroom training of the refrigeration partners\n? Preventative maintenance program\n? Operating procedures, written with the participation of the refrigeration partners\n? Performance of a process hazard analysis of the entire system including equipment and piping\n? Implementation of an auditing and inspection program\n? Procedure for handling all changes to the system\n? Pre-Startup review procedures for significant system modifications\n? Regular review and update of process safety information\n? Procedures for investigating release incidents or near-misses\n? On site HAZMAT team\n? Emergency Response and Action Plan\n? Hot-work permit program and procedures\n? Line Break procedures\n? Contractor Safety program\n\nThe Company follows the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines for safe operations and preventative maintenance of the refrigeration equipment.

Chemical-specific exposure prevention steps include availability of air purifying respirators for the refrigeration partners, and awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of anhydrous ammonia.  \n\nIn accordance with the PSM and RMP regulations, the Company performs periodical audits and hazard reviews to enhance continued safe performance.  Recommended actions to improve safety are identified during these audits and reviews and are tracked regularly for completion as required.  For this RMP submission, a new offsite consequence analysis was performed, including consideration of ammonia release scenarios as ?worst case release? and ?alternative release scenarios?."
