      "SummaryText": "Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nJohn F. Kennedy Space Center (KSC) is the major NASA installation for launch operations and related programs in support of manned and unmanned space missions.  The KSC core business is to provide space system processes, test, and launch techniques and to develop associated technologies. KSC spans approximately 220 square miles of the east central coast of Florida; a very small part of this acreage is designated for NASA operational and industrial use.  Because Merritt Island was found to include prime habitat for unique and endangered wildlife, NASA entered into an agreement with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) to establish a wildlife preserve, known as the Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge (MINWR) within the boundaries of KSC.  Additionally, an agreement with the Department of the Interior (USDI) resulted in most of the Canaveral National Seashore (CNS) to fall with in KSC boundaries. \n\n \n\nThe day-to-day operation of KSC is managed by NASA KSC personnel with support provided by contractors.  Contractor Amentum Incorporated, manages the Kennedy Propellants and Life Support Services (KPLSS) contract, and is responsible for managing the monomethyl hydrazine (MMH) process that is over the RMP threshold amount of 15,000 pounds.  MMH is a hypergol fuel used in various spacecraft propulsion systems.  Hypergolic fuels ignite when combined with their oxidizers.  MMH is delivered to KSC in tankers and stored at Fuel Storage Area (FSA) #1 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station (CCSFS).  Although located at CCSFS, FSA #1 is controlled by NASA.  As needed, MMH is transferred to smaller non-RMP containers, and distributed to spacecraft processing facilities on KSC and CCSFS.    \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nTwo of KSC's four guiding principles are Safety and Health, and Environmental Leadership.  Because the MMH process described here also exceeds the threshold quan"

For RMP compliance purposes, this places the FSA #1 MMH process in the OSHA Program 3 level.  KSC will use its PSM program as the required Program 3 Prevention Program.  The PSM Program at KSC has been developed to minimize the potential for fires, explosions, and accidental releases and receives full support of management, and requires involvement of employees at all levels.  The PSM program helps to prevent chemical accidents from occurring and ensures that facility operations remain safe for work team members and the public.  The program is based on the principle that facilities will remain safe provided they are designed and upgraded according to sound engineering practices; built, operated, and maintained properly; and periodically reviewed for conformance to the elements of the PSM program.  \n\n\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nNASA KSC has had no accidental releases of MMH in the past five years that resulted in injuries, deaths, or significant property damage on site or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  \n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nKSC has developed a Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan (CEMP) that is coordinated with all response elements, both on Center and with Brevard County Emergency Management.  This includes the State Emergency Response Commission and Local Emergency Planning Committees (LEPC).  This plan provides the guidelines for KSC's Emergency Preparedness Program and is designed to be supplemented by other emergency plans and procedures.  KSC employs full time law enforcement, medical, emergency management, and hazardous materials emergency response technicians.  \n\n\n\nTo validate the CEMP, tabletop, functional and full-scale exercises are conducted on a monthly, quarterly, and annual basis.

The KSC Emergency Operations Center and Brevard County Emergency Operations Center jointly monitor the same emergency frequencies.    \n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nIn addition to complying with the PSM Standard, NASA, as well as the contractor overseeing the operations at FSA-1, have implemented OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) at KSC. VPP is an OSHA-sponsored cooperative effort that goes beyond the requirements of general OSHA compliance.  To this end, KSC has a commitment in writing to maintain VPP participation and to continually improve KSC's overall safety and health programs."
