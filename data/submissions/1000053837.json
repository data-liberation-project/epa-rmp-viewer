This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance and employee training associated with our regulated process.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible accidental releases of regulated substances. However, if such an accidental release does occur, we are coordinated with off-site emergency response support.\n\n-    The stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nPresently Anhydrous Ammonia is the only RMP regulated substance present at this facility in a threshold quantity. It is utilized as the primary cooling media in out closed loop refrigeration system. The system's purpose is to provide refrigeration for the process, cold storage and distribution operations. Due to the characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration system, as well as the Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, Fresh Express is covered under Program 3 of the RMP Regulations.\n\nThe Worst Case Release scenario(s) and the Alternate Case Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario have been completed as covered in Section 2 and 3 of the RMPe*Submit text.\n\nTo evaluate both the Worst Case and Alternate Case Release Scenarios, EPA's RMP Comp (Revision 2.01) was utilized exclusively. The RMP Comp (Revision 2.01) is referenced in the RMP Offsite Consequences Analysis Guidance as an acceptable model for the mathematical approximation process.\n\nAs specified in the RMP guidance, the Worst Case and Alternate Case release Scenarios have been calculated and the results of the calculations are on file at the Fresh Express Facility in Harrisburg, PA.

Fresh Express is also subject to the OSHA PSM Standard under 29 CFR 1910.119, as well as the EPCRA Section 302 and 311/312 notification and reporting requirements.\n\n-    Emergency Action Plan\n\nFresh Express' current Emergency Action/Response Plan focuses on emergency response and evacuation of the facility in the event of an ammonia emergency. The facility maintains a written Emergency Action/Response Plan to document specific procedures to be implemented in the event of various emergencies, including ammonia releases. The plan includes procedures for response and facility evacuations as well as notification to the local emergency response agencies, which are responsible for notifying the public. The plan allows Fresh Express personnel trained in emergency response operations to respond to an upset or a release. The plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within the facility that would require the procedure be modified.\n\n-    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nFresh Express' aim is to provide a professional service as efficiently as possible while minimizing the use of toxic materials where ever and whenever possible. In this effort our highest priority will be the pursuit of cost-effective process changes that reduce or eliminate the use and/or generation of hazardous toxics at the endpoint of service. Where hazardous toxics cannot be eliminated, improving controls to handle these substances will be explored and implemented whenever and wherever possible.\n\n"
