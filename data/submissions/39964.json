The facility treats water received from the Ni River Reservoir and distributes it to the surrounding population.  Like many water treatment plants, the Ni River Facility uses chlorine to disinfect the water supply.\n\nChlorine is a toxic substance regulated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program Rule [40 CFR Part 68].  The Ni River Facility has prepared a Risk Management Plan (RMP) in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.  This RMP update is being submitted in accordance with the 5-yr update frequency as specified in 40 CFR 68.190.\n\nAccident Prevention\n\nThe Ni River Facility has used chlorine in its disinfection system for its entire operating history.  During that time, facility personnel have taken considerable care in the storage and handling of chlorine.  Before accepting any chlorine, facility operators check the condition of the chlorine equipment and containers and inspect them for leaks. The building is used solely for chlorine storage and connection to the disinfection system and, therefore, is not subject to daily traffic.\n\nA chlorine sensor, located within the chlorine storage area, sounds an alarm when the chlorine concentration exceeds one part per million (ppm).  The alarm notifies the operators of low concentrations (greater than or equal to 1 part per million) of chlorine in the storage area so they can respond immediately and correct the situation.  The alarm is tested monthly.\n\nAdditionally, the facility conducts routine reviews of the process safety management (PSM) information associated with the use of chlorine.  The facility is subject to 29 CFR 1910.119 (OSHA PSM) & 40 CFR 68 (EPA RMP) and, therefore, continually reviews, updates and maintains process safety information concerning the chlorine processes.  Examples of process sa"

The operators wearing the proper personal protective equipment are capable of entering the storage area and repairing or replacing faulty equipment.  In the event of a more significant release, the facility has a mutual aid agreement with the Virginia Department of Emergency Services (VDES), which would provide HAZMAT trained personnel to assist in mitigating the release.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Ni River Facility continually reviews the existing operating procedures, process safety information, and training program to protect the safety of its employees and the surrounding population."
