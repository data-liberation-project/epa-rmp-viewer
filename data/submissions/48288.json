The accidental release prevention program is applied to all production units in the process. Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accidents and releases.\n\nIn addition to the activities already described, the refinery has several process control and safety mitigation systems in place safety to help contain or control a release, quickly detect a release, and reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The following types of safety features are used in various production units:\n\nRelease Detection\n\n Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms.\n There are also detectors for some of the listed toxics present on site but below the RMP threshold quantity, such as hydrogen sulfide. These materials are managed and monitored to help ensure employee safety.\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to safely capture and incinerate releases\n Scrubbers to neutralize chemical releases\n Valves to permit isolation of all or part of the process (manually operated or automated)\n Automatic shutdown systems for specific process parameters (such as high level or high temperature)\n Vessels to permit partial removal of the inventory in the event of a release (a 'dump tank')\n Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\n Redundant equipment and instrumentation (This includes such things as uninterruptible power supply for process control systems and backup firewater pumping capability.)\n Atmospheric relief devices to allow vessels to vent rather than rupture.\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n Fire suppression and extinguishing systems throughout the"

The program address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. The program includes the refinery's plans for responding to the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. In addition, the refinery has procedures that address the use, maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, like the refinery's own fire trucks and the system to deliver water or foam for fire fighting. Changes to the refinery that might require changes to the emergency response program are identified through the management of change system.\n\nEmployees receive training in the emergency response procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. They are informed or trained in any changes that affect their duties. For example, all employees are trained in the emergency alarm and evacuation procedures, and many employees are trained in the use of portable fire extinguishers. There is also a team of highly trained employees who are volunteers to make up the refinery's emergency response team, which includes a fire brigade and rescue team. This group of employees is trained to fight fires and respond to other emergencies in the refinery.\n\nThe emergency response program"

There are checklists to assist the employees' verification of all aspects of readiness, including field verification of the construction and verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that supporting systems are operationally ready.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nMechanical integrity is the name given to the group of requirements to properly maintain and repair equipment in the refinery. SEUSA's Commerce City Refinery has a comprehensive system to identify equipment to include in the program, written and implemented maintenance procedures with training on the procedures, inspections and tests, correcting identified deficiencies, and quality assurance for new and replacement equipment and parts. In combination, these practices and procedures help ensure pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems are maintained in a safe operating condition.\n\nThe refinery's mechanical integrity program provides for training for maintenance personnel on an overview of the production units where they work, safety and health hazards, applicable maintenance procedures, the emergency response plan, and applicable safe work practices and procedures to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner.

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, and design codes and standards. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to help ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe process hazards analysis is a systematic approach to help ensure that hazards associated with the various production units in the process are identified, evaluated, and controlled. The SEUSA Commerce City Refinery uses recognized methodologies to conduct the analysis, including the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique and a what-if/checklist methodology. Process hazard analyses have been conducted on the production units as part of the PSM program and the process hazard analysis for the refinery is updated and revalidated at least once every five years. Each PHA session is performed by a team with expertise in engineering and process operations for the production unit being evaluated. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process for that production unit as well as previous incidents and accident prevention and mitigation measures. The team then makes suggestions for additional prevention or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\nThe PHA team's findings and recommendations are reviewed by refinery management and an appropriate response is determined, documented, and an action plan developed. Progress on the action plan is tracked until complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained. Affected refinery employees are advised of the analyses in advance for the opportunity to provide input, and employees who may be affect"

These procedures are used by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are routinely reviewed through usage or training, and there is a separate process to review and annually certify that the procedures are current and accurate. The written operating procedures are readily available to operators in the control rooms and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining for Operators\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, there is a training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in refinery operations, including classroom work and field observations, if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with an experienced operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate through testing or skills demonstration that they have adequate knowledge to perform assigned duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. Operators are also trained before operating a newly assigned process. \n\nAffected operators are informed of and trained on changes to the procedures as required. All operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained and to help ensure they understand and follow the current procedures. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All of this training is doc"

The inspections and tests are done at a certain frequency to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (such as adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or take the necessary actions to continue to operate safely until repairs can be made. \n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance for the purchase and use of new, spare or replacement parts or equipment. Along with the management of change and pre-startup safety review processes, this helps ensure that new or replacement equipment is installed correctly and safe for the conditions in the process.\n\nSafe Work Practices/Hot Work\n\nSEUSA's Commerce City Refinery has numerous safe work practice procedures to help ensure the safety of employees, contractors and visitors to the refinery. These include the safe work practices and hot work permit requirements listed in the PSM and RMP regulations. Examples of these include (1) control of the access of personnel to the facility and the process, (2) a procedure to ensure isolation/removal of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safely opening process piping or equipment, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (for example, hot work, welding, grinding), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), are written, implemented through training of affected personnel, and routinely reviewed and audited through Joint Health & Safety Committee programs involving both employees and contractors.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nAn incident investigation process is in place at SEUSA's Commerce Cit"

This includes reviewing incidents that may need to be investigated to comply with the requirements of PSM and RMP. This helps ensure that all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire, explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury are promptly investigated. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigations are done by a team which includes salaried employees and union represented employees and, if the incident involved the work of the contractor, a contractor representative. The team produces a written report with its findings and recommendations to prevent a recurrence and forwards these results to refinery management for resolution. A corrective action plan is developed, documented, and tracked until complete. The investigation team's report is also provided to all employees and the contractors regularly on site. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during the next process hazard analysis update/revalidation. \n \nCompliance Audits\n\nThe RMP regulations require an audit of the accidental release prevention program at least once every 3 years. To comply with this requirement and help ensure that the RMP accidental release prevention program is implemented, SEUSA's Commerce City Refinery periodically conducts audits of the required procedures, practices, and documentation.

The LEPC coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nOn an ongoing basis, the techniques most used to generate ideas to improve safety are the three-year compliance audits, process hazards analyses, and learning from incident investigations and real or staged emergency responses. For example, these techniques may identify needed improvements in equipment or procedures. The techniques used can identify needed changes before an accident or help identify needed changes to prevent the possibility of more serious accidents. \n\nThe types of changes from these ongoing activities include adding instruments and alarms, revising procedures, re-rating certain vessels and further evaluating existing information for possible changes.\n\nThe SEUSA Commerce City Refinery's emergency response capabilities are being improved through the implementation of an integrated contingency plan (ICP) approach to our emergency response plan. \n\nContinuing education on safety issues is an ongoing endeavor, either by on-site meetings or by professional training courses.\n\nThe accidental release prevention program is currently being integrated and upgraded as a response to the combination of the SEUSA Commerce City Refinery and the Colorado Refining Company (CRC) into one integrated refining facility."
