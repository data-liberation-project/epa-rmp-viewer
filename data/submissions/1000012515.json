Sweetwater Authority\u00c2\u00bfs safety and environmental policies are administered by the Safety Coordinator, who conducts periodic inspections of the facility to ensure compliance, and oversees the entire safety and environmental programs, including the CalARP Program. \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE \n\nThe Sweetwater Authority - Richard A. Reynolds Desalination Facility (Richard A. Reynolds Desalination Facility) is located at 3066 N. 2nd Avenue in Chula Vista, California, which is located approximately 50 feet north of Highway 54 and approximately 0.6 miles west of Interstate 805.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is urban.  The facility was constructed in 1999.  \n\nThe aqueous ammonia system at the Richard A. Reynolds Desalination Facility is used for the treatment of groundwater used for domestic purposes. In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains a storage tank of aqueous ammonia (up to 29% weight minimum anhydrous ammonia), a regulated substance.  The maximum intended charge of aqueous ammonia is 3,000 gallons (23,130 pounds).\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS \n\nIn order to operate the aqueous ammonia system, the facility complies with the California Emergency Management Agency (CalEMA) California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.\n\nThe Richard A. Reynolds Desalination Facility aqueous ammonia groundwater treatment system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and proce"

      "SummaryText": "dures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the Richard A. Reynolds Desalination Facility operates in accordance with the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  It is important to note that the water treatment system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of aqueous ammonia. Also, in the event that the primary engineering or administration controls at the facilities fail and result in a release of aqueous ammonia, there are several mechanisms at the facility to minimize the impact:  1) portable ammonia vapor detector, 2) a containment basin surrounding the aqueous ammonia tank sized to hold the entire contents of the tank, and 3) an ammonia scrubber that protects the storage tank against excess pressure conditions.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \n\nThe facility had a minor release on December 16, 2008.  During the daily inspection, the onsite operator discovered aqueous ammonia dripping from a broken ball valve.  The operator notified maintenance personnel.  The system was shut down and maintenance personnel replaced the broken valve.  Only a minimal amount of ammonia was released from the system.  There were no injuries that resulted from this incident.\n\nAside from this incident, there have been no releasea of aqueous ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 1,000 pounds or the state requirement mandating immediate reporting of any release or threatened release of a hazardous material over the past five years (February 2005 to February 2010).  In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an aqueous ammonia release.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \n\nThe facility has an Emergency Action Plan (plan) in effect.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \n\n1)\t save lives;\n2)\t minimize and avoid injuries;\n3)\t protect the environment; and\n4)\t minimize property damage.\n\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes,"

      "SummaryText": "aqueous ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the CalARP regulations.  \n\nSweetwater Authority personnel inspect the aqueous ammonia system daily, taking note of unusual conditions in any portion of the system.  In the event that an aqueous ammonia leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will alert any personnel in the immediate area who are unaware of the danger and the Safety Coordinator.  The Plant Emergency Coordinator will determine what procedures and personnel are necessary to remedy the problem. Emergency agencies will also be notified as necessary as outlined in the Emergency Action Plan.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY \n\nThe Hazard Review Study for the aqueous ammonia system was performed on November 10, 2009.  The study generated mitigation measures (recommendations) to improve safety at the facility located in Chula Vista, California.  The mitigation measures include additional training, key maintenance related tests/inspection, and enhanced emergency response policies and procedures.  The Sweetwater Authority Water Quality staff is planning to complete several items, including the recommendations, over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\n\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\n\n3. Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n\n4. Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."
