This executive summary is structured from the requirements specified in \u00a7 68.155.  The following paragraphs A through F intend to specifically address the requirements in paragraphs (a) through (f) in \u00a7 68.155.\r\n\r\nA)\tIt is the policy of RAE to implement the requirements of the Risk Management Program (RMP) in accordance with the USEPA regulations under 40 CFR Part 68.  The objective is to prevent an explosion, fire, and/or a release of natural gasoline denaturant while also minimizing the potential impacts to RAE employees, the public, and the environment in the unlikely event of a release.  RAE plans to accomplish these objectives by utilizing good operating procedures, maintaining an appropriate preventative maintenance program for the equipment, providing proper training to RAE employees, hiring reputable qualified contractors, and coordinating emergency response activities with local emergency management services.\r\n\r\nB)\tRAE is production facility that manufactures fuel-grade denatured ethanol.  Currently denaturant storage and use is the only RMP process at RAE.  The denaturant, natural gasoline, is used to render the product ethanol unfit for human consumption.  Natural gasoline is a flammable liquid mixture containing isopentane, pentane, and butane as well as other substances.  \r\n\r\nC)\tAn offsite consequence analysis for denaturant storage and use was conducted for RAE using RMP*Comp in accordance with the requirements in 40 CFR 68.  Both an unlikely Worst Case Scenario vapor cloud explosion and a more realistic Alternative Release Scenario pool fire at loadout were conducted for the denaturant process.  The key concepts of the accident prevention program at RAE include utilizing good operating procedures, maintaining an appropriate preventative maintenance program for the equipment, providing proper training to RA"
