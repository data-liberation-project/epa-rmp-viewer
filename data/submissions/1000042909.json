As part of this commitment, Domtar has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the hazardous chemical processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the facility and addresses compliance with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Regulation 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RM Plan) describing the Risk Management Program for the Nekoosa Mill.  This document is intended to satisfy the RM Plan requirements of the RMP Rule and to provide the public with a description of the Risk Management Program at the facility, with regards to the manufacture, storage, and use of chlorine dioxide at the company's pulp bleaching plant.  This plan has been updated, as of June 2014, to satisfy the five-year update requirement of the RMP rules.\n\n\n\nThe Risk Management Program at the facility consists of four elements:\n\n\n\n1.    A hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that may have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of the substances regulated by the RMP rule (Chlorine Dioxide) - see topic 1.2;\n\n    \n\n2.    A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than the threshold quantity of the regulated substances (covered processes) - see topic 1.4;\n\n    \n\n3.    An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of the regulated substances from the covered processes - see topic 1.6; and \n\n    \n\n4.    A management system that delineates responsibility for implementing and maintaining the Risk Management Program.\n\n\n\nInformation f"

In fact, the facility has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards that are designed to minimize the potential for the release of any hazardous substance and to minimize injuries and damage resulting from the release of a hazardous substance.\n\n\n\nDomtar/Nekoosa minimizes the potential for releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  When hazardous substances are used at the facility, the equipment is carefully designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are adhered to in design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\n\n\n\nDomtar/Nekoosa limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  The facility trains workers to respond to upset conditions, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  In addition, the facility will be working with the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) to help ensure that injuries and/or environmental damage will not occur in the event that a release does occur.\n\n\n\nThe safety programs at Domtar/Nekoosa consist of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP Rule.  This RM Plan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at the facility that are required by the RMP Rule.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nDomtar/Nekoosa is committed to the safety of workers and the public, as well as the preservation of the environment through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.

Domtar/Nekoosa provides response training for upset conditions to facility personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local emergency response organizations.\n\n\n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, the facility has established a management system directed by the General Manager, Wisconsin Operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2    Description of Regulated Process / Substance \n\n\n\nDomtar/Nekoosa is a pulp and paper facility primarily involved in the manufacture of bleached paper products.  As part of this manufacturing process, the facility produces and stores chlorine dioxide (ClO2) for the use of bleaching pulp. \n\n\n\nThe ClO2 solution is stored at a concentration of approximately 1.0-1.4% (weight percent ClO2 in water) in two identical storage tanks, each with a capacity of 90,000 gallons.  The unpressurized, aboveground storage tanks are interconnected and equalize with each other.  The storage tanks are located in the bleach plant area of the facility.  ClO2 gas in solution at this concentration will rapidly off-gas at ambient temperatures.  Therefore, the ClO2 solution in the two tanks is stored at a temperature of approximately 40 to 48 degrees Fahrenheit (A?XF).  A concrete wall, capable of providing containment in the event of a catastrophic spill of solution, surrounds the storage tanks.  Passive mitigation is also available in some circumstances when solution is released inside the ClO2 Plant building, in the form of curbing and an acid sewer drain, and the building itself.  The containment area and sewer could conta"

The quantity of ClO2 stored in each tank, based on a maximum concentration of 12 grams per liter (g/l) (1.2%), is 9,013.6 pounds.  Because each tank will contain ClO2 in an amount greater than the threshold quantity (1,000 lbs), the RMP Rule covers both tanks.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3    Off-Site Consequence Analysis\n\n\n\nDomtar/Nekoosa performed an off-site consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of regulated substances to affect the public or the environment.  The off-site consequence analysis consists of evaluating both the worst-case release scenario and an alternative release case scenario.  The facility does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) might occur at a facility like Domtar/Nekoosa and, (2) would result in an off-site consequence if the release occurred.  The alternative release scenario will help the Local Emergency Planning Committee improve the community emergency response plan.\n\n\n\nThe main objective of performing the off-site consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the   endpoint distance).  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less.\n\n\n\nWhen considering the release of a toxic substance such as chlorine dioxide, most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are likely.\n\n\n\nThe RMP Rule includes specific requirements for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by Domtar/Nekoosa.

One alternative release scenario for each toxic substance in a Program Level 3 processes (one scenario representing chlorine dioxide).\n\n    \n\n    The following information summarizes the off-site consequence analysis performed by Domtar/Nekoosa.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    1.3.1 Program Level 3 Process - Chlorine Dioxide Solution System\n\n    \n\n    The worst-case release scenario for the Chlorine Dioxide System is the loss of the entire contents of one of the storage tanks in ten minutes.  The two storage tanks at Nekoosa are located inside a concrete containment area, sufficient in  to hold the entire contents of both tanks, if released.  This scenario will consist of an evaporating pool, resulting from the failure of a single 90,000-gallon storage tank, limited in surface area to that of the containment area, 750 square feet.  The predicted impact distance, where concentrations are greater than the toxic endpoint, extends beyond Domtar/Nekoosa facility property.  Accounting for available passive mitigation, the RMP*Comp computer software predicts an impact to a distance of 2.9 miles.  The estimated population within a circle of this radius is 5,764.   Several public receptors are also located within this distance (e.g., several industrial facilities, several public and private elementary schools and high schools, several nursing homes, several churches, several recreational parks, and numerous subdivisions).  There are also several environmental receptors.\n\n    \n\n    The alternative release scenario for chlorine dioxide is the rupture of a transfer line at the discharge side of one of four suction pumps used for transferring solution from storage to the bleaching process area.  During normal operations, each of the four pumps is individually capable of transferring solution to bleaching operations.  Two of the pumps are assigned to the D-Stage supply, and run at a 190-gallon-per-minute cap"

      "SummaryText": "acity.  The other two pumps, supplying the C/D Stage bleaching, run at higher, 310-gallon-per-minute capacities.  These higher rated pumps, because of their increased capacities, are used in the analysis.  A review of pump curves and supporting documentation indicate that, at maximum efficiency, these pumps have the potential to run out to 600 gallons-per-minute pumping capacity.  The scenario assumes that the pump operates for a period of 5 minutes before workers detect the release and shut down the pumps and operate the remote shutoff valves on the storage tanks from their operating room.  Detectors and alarms in the pump area would immediately note the presence of ClO2 fumes.  The pumps are contained in a diked area with splash shields and all the spilled solution would be captured within the 80-square foot containment area.  Therefore, the alternative release scenario considered is the release of 3,000 gallons of solution (at 600 gallons-per-minute) containing 350 pounds of pure ClO2, based on a concentration of 1.2% by weight.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint for ClO2 for the alternative release scenario is 0.1 mile using the RMP*Comp computer software.

Written tests and oral reviews are used to verify that the employee understands the training materials before the employee can operate the process.\n\n    \n\n    The operators are consulted about the frequency of the training and the materials to be used for the training.  Recommendations from the operators are reviewed and changes to the training are implemented as appropriate.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    6. Contractors   Domtar/Nekoosa has established a program to help ensure that contractor activities at the facility are performed in a safe manner.  The program reviews the safety record of all contractors to help ensure that the facility only hires contractors who can safely perform the desired job tasks. Domtar/Nekoosa explains to the contract supervisors the hazards of the process on which they and their employees will work, the facility safe work practices, and the emergency response procedures for the facility.  The facility requires that the contractor's supervisors train each of their employees who will work on or near a covered process before that employee begins work at the site.  The facility periodically reviews contractors' training documents and work performance to ensure that safe practices are followed.\n\n    \n\n    7. Pre-startup Safety Reviews   Domtar/"

Personnel who are to perform hot work are required to fill out the Hot Work Permit form.  The supervisor reviews the completed form before work can be initiated.\n\n    \n\n    10. Management of Change   The Domtar/Nekoosa management of change program evaluates and approves all proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, and procedures for a covered process to help ensure that the change does not negatively affect safe operations.  Process changes that are determined to be a replacement in kind are allowed without completing a management of change form.  All other changes must be confirmed through the full management of change program to help ensure that inadvertent consequences of the process changes are prevented, safety consequences of the changes are addressed, affected process safety information and operating procedures are updated, and affected employees are notified of the changes.\n\n    \n\n    11. Incident Investigations   Domtar/Nekoosa investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so that similar accidents can be prevented.  The facility trains employees to identify and report any incident requiring investigation.  An incident investigation team is assembled, and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.\n\n    \n\n    12. Compliance Audits   Domtar/Nekoosa audits the covered processes to be certain that the facility's prevention program is effectively addressing the safety issues of the operations.
