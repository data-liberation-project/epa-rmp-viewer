Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive attention first.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the El Paso Refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to process area teams for consideration and priority resolution. \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe El Paso Refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and certified as current and accurate.  Moreover, procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the Management of Change (MOC) process.\n  \nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the El Paso Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process."

This update adds the Benzene Saturation Unit, which will be started up later in the month of January, 2011 (current projected startup date is around January 24, 2011). \n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe El Paso Refinery has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe El Paso Refinery, located in El Paso, Texas, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., fuel gas, propane, butane, gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel) from raw crude oil.  The Refinery has several regulated flammables, which include:\n\n- Hydrogen\n- Methane\n- Ethane\n- Propane\n- Propylene\n- Butane\n- Isobutane\n- Isobutene\n- 2-butene-cis\n- 2-butene-trans\n- Pentane\n- Isopentane\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe El Paso Refinery has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past 5 years. There have not been any accidents in a covered process involving a regulated substance over the past five years that meet the RMP criteria. \n\nAny reportable accident occurring on or after April 9, 2004, must be included in the five-year accident history section of the RMP and reported within six months of the accident. \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe followi"

      "SummaryText": "New employees receive basic training in refinery operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe El Paso Refinery uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform refinery personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the El Paso Refinery evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Refinery personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe El Paso Refinery conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process sa"

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the change into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure the change is in accordance with specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the change and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nA key aspect of the mechanical integrity program involves the sound design of process equipment based on safety-in-design standards that meet or exceed industry standards.  The El Paso Refinery also has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner.

For specific process areas, the refinery has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in operating procedures for each process unit.  The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).  The refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) \n\nThe El Paso Refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe El Paso Refinery primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measur"

The El Paso Refinery incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.  The refinery also has an established Positive Material Identification (PMI) Program in place to verify alloy materials prior to installation. \n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe El Paso Refinery has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe El Paso Refinery has a comprehensive system to manage change.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process-operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not b"

Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigations\n\nThe El Paso Refinery promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings and develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations. \n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the El Paso Refinery periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Both hourly and management personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings and sets priorities for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.  \n\n\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at the El Paso Refinery"
