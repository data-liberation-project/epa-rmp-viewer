      "SummaryText": "The Mennel Milling Company of Virginia operates a mill in Roanoke County, Virginia that processes wheat into many different grades of flour. Several of the grades involve a \"bleaching\" process in which chlorine is added to the milled flour. In addition, a small amount of chlorine is added to the wheat prior to storage and milling to prevent spoilage.\r\n\r\nChlorine is delivered to Mennel Milling Co. and used in one-ton containers.  The supplier delivers full chlorine containers to the site via truck. The containers are unloaded using a lift and trolley system, and stored in an indoor chlorine storage room where they are connected to the feed system. Mennel Milling staff connects the ton containers to the feed system. The total number of ton containers routinely stored on-site in the chlorine room (specifically designed and built for chlorine cylinder storage) is 12, equivalent to approximately 24,000 pounds (if all cylinders are full). There may be circumstances when an extra 1-ton chlorine container is stored in the chlorine room (total of 13 cylinders), for a maximum total of 26,000 pounds of chlorine.\r\n\r\nMennel Milling Co. uses a vacuum feed system for chlorine that is inherently safe.  The system involves the use of air flowing through an eductor that creates a vacuum.  This vacuum allows for the feed of chlorine from the containers into the piping system.  If a chlorine line downstream of the vacuum regulator is broken or develops a leak, the vacuum is interrupted and the vacuum regulator automatically closes, preventing the discharge of chlorine gas. The chlorine feed system is under vacuum throughout the milling area (from the chlorine room to the agitators where chlorination occurs). Only pressurized chlorine containers are located in the chlorine storage room, where access is restricted by a FOB system, an alarm is activated if door is breached without using FOB system, and camera surveillance is monitored. Automatic shut-off valves are activated and close tan"

Mennel requires that two (2) persons be present when entering the chlorine room, wearing full face shields (also, escape air packs are located in the chlorine room).\r\n\r\nMennel Milling Co. has contracted with Research Products Co. (REPCO) of Salina, Kansas to perform preventive and corrective maintenance on the chlorine feed system.\r\n\r\nMennel Milling Co. has developed a comprehensive Process Safety Management Program as part of the OSHA PSM program.  The elements of the PSM include:\r\n \r\n\u00bf Process Safety Information\r\n\u00bf Process Hazard Analysis\r\n\u00bf Operating Procedures\r\n\u00bf Training\r\n\u00bf Management of Change\r\n\u00bf Pre-Startup Safety Review\r\n\u00bf Compliance Audits\r\n\u00bf Incident Investigation\r\n\u00bf Contractor Management\r\n\u00bf Hot Work Permits\r\n\u00bf\tIncident Investigation\r\n \r\nThe Mennel Milling Company of Virginia constructed a new milling facility during the Summer of 2007, which is currently operational. As such, there have been no accidental releases of chlorine at the new mill that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\r\n\r\nAn Emergency Response Plan (ERP) will be developed by Mennel for the facility. The ERP will contain measures that Mennel staff will take to alert employees of a release, how to distinguish between an incidental release and a significant release, and many other elements. Mennel staff will receive training to allow for defensive action in response to an on-site release. \r\n\r\nThe facility has coordinated its emergency response activities with the City of Roanoke Fire Department, which is the local emergency responder. In the event of a chlorine release, Mennel will contact the City of Roanoke Fire Department for technical support.  The fire department is trained and equipped to respond to chlorine incidents.\r\n\r\nMennel performed a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) on November 28, 2007"
