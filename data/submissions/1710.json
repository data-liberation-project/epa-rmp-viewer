All findings from the audis have been addressed.\n\nIncident Investigation - The Pillsbury Company routinely investigates any ammonia related incident or accident that occurs at the Allentown Plant. An Incident Investigation procedure has been developed to help the investigation team determine the root cause of an incident and to help them develop measures to prevent recurrence. \n\nEmployee Participation - An employee participation program (for safety and risk management) is in place and training in PSM has  been conducted for all affected employees. Employee involvement in PHA studies and review of operating procedures is an important way in which employees take and retain ownership of the risk management programs. \n\nHot Work Permit Program - A hot work permit program is being used at the Allentown Plant whenever hot work is conducted in and around the ammonia systems. \n\nContractor Safety - Contractor safety procedures are in place and include reviews of contractor performance and the inclusion of safety performance and programs in selecting contractors for work on or adjacent to the ammonia process.\n\n\n6.  Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere has been one release of ammonia from the Allentown Plant in the last five years that meets the RMP reporting criteria. The release occurred in June 1994 before Pillsbury owned the facility. A pressure relief valve lifted and released approximately 165 pounds of ammonia. The fire department responded and the release was reported to local authorities. There were no injuries at the plant and there were no known offsite impacts. An unspecified number of residents of a nearby motel were reported to have been evacuated.\n\n7.  Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Allentown Plant has an emergency response program which is described in the site Emergency Response Plan (ERP). This plan includes procedures for evacuations, notifying response agencies and a"

The plan also includes first aid procedures for toxic exposures to ammonia. The ERP is coordinated with the Allentown Fire Department and the Lehigh County Emergency Management Agency.\n\nThe facility has conducted risk management plan communication meetings with employees and has notified immediate offsite receptors. A public communications meeting was held on May 17, 1999 in cooperation with the Allentown Fire Department and the Lehigh County Emergency Management Agency.\n\n8.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety \n\nAll recommendations from previous PHAs, MOCs, and PSRs are being addressed. However, it is Pillsbury's policy to review operating, maintenance and emergency response procedures on a routine basis to ensure they are always applicable. This continuous review process does generate further recommendations for improved safety during the course of operations, but these measures are typically addressed in a very short time frame. \n\n\n9.  Summary\n\nThe design, operation and maintenance of the ammonia system according to IIAR Standards and Guidelines and the implementation of the PSM and RMP programs provide a high level of assurance that the hazards and risks associated with the use of ammonia are being managed in an appropriate manner. The likelihood of a release is minimized through the implementation of these programs. Pillsbury has developed an Emergency Response Plan which is coordinated through the local response agencies and has communicated the information in this Risk Management Plan to the local community."

This Executive Summary includes a discussion of the various Risk Management Program elements as follows:\n\n1. Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n2. Stationary source activities\n3. Regulated substances handled\n4. Worst-case and alternative release scenarios\n5. General and chemical-specific accidental release prevention program\n6. Five-year accident history\n7. Emergency response program\n8. Planned changes to improve safety\n9. Summary\n\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIt is Pillsbury's policy to comply with all of the requirements of the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Program regulation as well as all other applicable Federal and State rules and regulations. The Allentown Plant has developed an OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Manual  that documents safety and risk management policies pertaining to the prevention of accidental releases and emergency response. In addition to the PSM Manual, the Allentown Plant has developed a Risk Management Program that includes the OSHA PSM elements, a description of the risk management system, the Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA), and the five-year accident history. \n\n\n2.  Stationary Source Activities\n\nThe Allentown Plant is located in Lehigh County, Pennsylvania. The facility produces frozen products, such as pancakes and waffles. The products are frozen, packaged and stored in a frozen goods warehouse prior to shipment. Ammonia is used to provide refrigeration for freezing and for frozen finished goods storage. \n\n\n3.  Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe ammonia for the refrigeration system at the Allentown Plant is a regulated substance under the EPA's Risk Management Program rule. The ammonia system is a closed loop which recirculates and reuses the same material. Infrequent makeup to the system is only to replace material lost due to maintenance acti"

The system consists of compressors, receivers, evaporators and condensers and has a maximum intended inventory of 29,000 pounds of ammonia.\n\n\n\n4.  Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n\nFor the worst case and alternative release scenarios, the EPA Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration (May 1996), the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) Risk Management Guidelines for Ammonia Refrigeration (1998) and the EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration (November 1998) were used for guidance. The Ammonia Guidance tables were used to derive the hazard distances for worst-case and alternative release scenarios. \n\nReleasing the contents of  the High Pressure Receiver (VE-12) which can contain up to 17,000 pounds (83.5% at 82F) of ammonia represents the worst-case scenario. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint. The alternative release scenario was chosen as a quarter-inch hole, which would be representative of a pump seal leak or a gasket rupture. The resulting distance to the endpoint also extends offsite, and public receptors immediately adjacent to the facility are within the distance to the endpoint.\n \n\nDiscussion\nThe results included in this analysis indicate that the worst-case release for the ammonia process can extend offsite and reach public receptors. However, it is important to emphasize that a worst-case release is extremely unlikely to occur because of the many safety features inherent in the design and operational systems for the plant. \n\nOn the other hand, the alternative release scenario is based on credible assumptions. The alternative scenario was selected from a number of possible scenarios, based on their potential to reach offsite. As mentioned in the Ammonia Model RMP, this scenario would be representative of a gasket leak or a pump seal leak.\n\n\n5.  Prevention Progra"

This is one of the most important ways for preventing ammonia releases and for minimizing the impacts of any release that does occur. Some of the key elements of the Prevention Program are summarized below. \n\nProcess Safety Information(PSI) - A comprehensive set of process safety information has been compiled for the ammonia system. The PSI includes data on the chemicals, the equipment and the technology of the process.\n\nProcess Hazards Analysis (PHA)- An initial PHA was conducted to satisfy the PSM requirements in 1995. In January 1999, the initial PHA was revalidated. Recommendations made by the PHA team to improve the safety of the systems are being addressed.\n\nOperating Procedures - An Operations and Maintenance Manual provides detailed written operating procedures for the ammonia system and for safe work practices. \n\nTraining - Training is provided to each operator and maintenance person before they are certified to operate the system. \n\nMaintenance - All of the covered ammonia equipment is included in the Allentown preventive maintenance program. Equipment inspections, testing and preventive maintenance activities are performed following a structured schedule according to IIAR Bulletin 109.\n\nManagement of Change (MOC) - An MOC procedure has been developed and is implemented for all changes made to the ammonia system, including the safety systems. \n\nPre-startup Review (PSR)- Pre-startup reviews are conducted whenever a change results in a change to the PSI. Checklists are used to direct the PSR process. The checklists are used to ensure that all essential elements of the prevention program (i.e., engineered systems and documentation) were in place prior to startup"
