      "SummaryText": "Enrique Ortega is a Water Treatment Plant. It is located at road PR #827, Km 5.6 Bo Pinas, Toa Alta Puerto Rico, 00953. Enrique Ortega Plant is owned by Puerto Rico Aqueduct & Sewer Authority (PRASA) which is a Government Agency. PRASA has developed the RMP following the Program #3 for the Management and Prevention of Risks associated with the storage and handling of a toxic substace: chlorine. The RMP was prepared in compliance with EPA 40 CFR Part 68. The prevention program was prepared in accordance with OSHA Process Safety management (PSM) regulation as established in 29 CFR Part 1910.119.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release:\n\n\n\nIt is PRASA's policy to comply with EPA and OSHA Federal and State applicable requirements.  The chlorination process at the La Plata-Toa Alta Water Filtration Plant uses chlorine as desifecting substance. Chlorine is a hazardous toxic substance regulated by EPA, OSHA, and PROSHO.  Due to the hazardous characteristics of chlorine, the La Plata-Toa Alta Water Filtration Plant observes various safety precautions in the storage, conveyance and use of chlorine.  The safety precautions are necessary to protect employees, contractors, and visitors at the La Plata-Toa Alta Water Filtration Plant and the immediately surrounding areas.  Safety precautions include procedures and equipment to minimize the potential for accidental release, as well as a written emergency response program for response to any chlorine release that may occur.\n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe La Plata-Toa Alta Water Filtration Plant supplies water to the surrounding community.  Chlorine is used to disinfect the water, destroying microorganisms that could cause illness in humans.\n\n\n\nChlorine is delivered from the PRASA San Juan Distribution Center in Puerto Nuevo to the facility via truck in  1 ton containers. The containers are connected to vacuum valves and through them the chlorine flows to the vacum chorinators.  The chlorinators regulate chlorine do"

From the chlorinators the dosified chlorine flows to the ejectors, then the chlorine solution is send to the injection points in the process of the plant.\n\n\n\nWorst-case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario was determined following EPA's Risk Management Program Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The worst-case release scenario is a vapor release of the entire contents of a ton container over a ten minutes period (200 pounds of chlorine per minute).  Other worst-case assumptions required by EPA include a low wind speed (1.5 meters per second), stable atmosphere (Class F), urban topography, and no active mitigation of the release.\n\n\n\nEPA requires the determination of the area (zone of vulnerability) which may be exposed to a chlorine concentration of 3 ppm or greater.  According to the American Industrial Hygiene Association, 3 ppm is the maximum concentration of chlorine in air below which nearly all people could be exposed for one hour without serious health effects.  Based on the worst-case assumptions, the zone of vulnerability was determined to extend 1.3 miles from the chlorine storage area.\n\n\n\nThe conditions and parameters for the worst-case scenario are specified by EPA.  A more realistic alternative release scenario was examined, also following EPA's Risk Management Program Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The alternative release scenario is a vapor release of the entire contents of a ton container through a broken 3/8 inch flexible connector tube.  If the container was not shut off, the contents would be released at a rate of 21 pounds of chlorine per minute over a 95 minutes period.  More typical weather conditions are also used (wind speed of 3.0 meters per second, atmospheric stability Class D).  Other conditions remain the same as in the worst-case scenario (urban topography and no mitigation of the release).\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nPRASA co"

Operators, maintenance staff and contractors are informed of chlorine hazards, and hazard signs are posted in the chlorine storage area.  Standard operating and maintenance  procedures have been developed, and employees who work with chlorine are provided training.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nPRASA has an emergency response program.  Chlorine gas detectors are located within the storage area for early detection and warning of any leak.  Leak repair kits are maintained on site, and operators are trained in how to quickly stop any leak that may occur.  The emergency response program is coordinated with State Emergency Management Agency for notification to the public.\n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\n\n\nWithin the past five years there have been no unplanned releases of chlorine in excess of 10 pounds resulting in injuries or significant property damage on site; or known offsite injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nPRASA has already implemented in the chlorine systen  valves and vaccum mechanism to control the process with automatic equipments improving the safety of chorine handling and storage. \n\n\n\nAudits\n\n\n\nThe last compliance audit was conducted on April 25, 2012. But during the past two years we have conducted internal metrics evaluation. With each internal metrics we request an action plan to correct the findings. PRASA has develop these metrics evaluation to establish the level of compliance of our facilities with the RMP/PSM Program regulations requirements."
