The Santa Fe Springs site follows the Corporate Crisis Management plan 5.1.2 and its own Emergency response plan SFS 3.10.03.\n\nStationary Source\nThe site produces sodium hypochlorite (bleach) from chlorine and sodium hydroxide (caustic).  \n\nRegulated Substances Handled\nThis Risk Management Plan has been prepared to address the handling of chlorine at the Olin Santa Fe Springs Bleach facility.  Liquefied chlorine is received in  94 ton rail cars and used in the manufacture of bleach. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nOlin has a comprehensive release prevention program, meeting the Federal RMP Prevention Program, California Chemical Accident Release Prevention Program and OSHA Process Safety Management (\"PSM\") requirements.  We follow best industry practices for the design and construction of equipment, piping and instrumentation.  Our process design includes expansion bottles and/or rupture disks and pressure switches to safeguard against hydrostatic overpressure of equipment and piping.  The site also maintains a caustic scrubber to prevent accidental releases. \n\nFive Year Accident History\nThe plant has not had any releases in its 5 year history meeting that definition.  All releases are tracked through AMT, which is the sites online incident tracking tool.  Investigations are managed online and any resulting corrective or preventive actions are tracked to closure using AMT. \n\nEmergency Response \nOlin has a comprehensive emergency response program that includes the installation of detection, alarm, shutdown, containment and scrubbing systems to halt and/or mitigate a release.  Santa Fe Springs has an Emergency Response Team trained and equipped to respond safely to a release in accordance with a written Emergency Response Plan."
