      "SummaryText": "Introduction\n\nThe Risk Management Program at J. Marchini & Son, Inc. complies with US EPA and Cal ARP requirements. The Merced County Department of Public Health (Division of Environmental Health) recently conducted a CalARP inspection of our facility on 6/14/2019.  It?s the only chemical onsite that is above thresholds and classified as Hazardous Chemicals. It?s a rural farming area several miles from small rural towns to the North (Le Grande) and South (Chowchilla).\n\n\n\nThe Ammonia refrigeration system has 3 screw compressors serving a flooded single temperature refrigeration system. Two evaporative condensers are elevated adjacent to the mechanical room.  Room evaporators are in bunkers on one wall. All room isolation valves are outside the rooms. Ammonia safety relief valves (SRV?s) discharge into a water filled diffusion tank with capacity to neutralize the entire NH3 charge. Refrigeration controls are PLC based with electric valve actuators. The mechanical room has Ammonia detection. The mechanical room ventilation has a continuous and emergency ventilation level that is activated by the control system or break glass switches at both doors. All critical isolation components are redundant, have fail-safe positions for power outages and can be operated manually if required. \n\n\n\nThe procedures for complying with the RM Program regulations are outlined by the following major steps:\n\n1.    Identify Covered Processes\n\n2.    Determine Program Level\n\n3.    Establish a Management System\n\n4.    Conduct a 5-year Accident History\n\n5.    Perform Hazard Assessments\n\n6.    Develop an Accident Prevention Program\n\n7.    Develop an Emergency Response Program and\n\n8.    Prepare a Risk Management Plan (RMP)\n\n\n\nPublication or sharing of OCA portions of RMP materials can be in violation of the Chemical Safety Information, Site Security and Fuels Regulatory Relief Act (PL106-40). \n\n\n\n1.

Our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training demonstrates this commitment.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities revolve around processing and storage of fresh Italian vegetable Radicchio.  This activity is consistent with SIC 0723/ NAICS 115114 post harvest crop activities. Anhydrous ammonia is the major regulated substance present at our facility.  The entire ammonia inventory is attributed to use as a refrigerant.  \n\n\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nThe worst-case release scenario mandated by the RMP Rule is a standardized hypothetical situation intended to promote \"dialogue\". According to the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration \"The worst-case situation represents an extremely improbable (and for many facilities impossible) set of circumstances rather than a credible accident scenario. Release quantities and hazard distances derived there from for the worst-case scenario should not be used as a basis for emergency response planning.\"\n\n\n\nTo evaluate the worst case and alternative release scenarios for ammonia we have used the methodology given in the Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration by SAIC.  Details are not provided in the Executive Summary as required in recent rule making.\n\n\n\nAlternate case scenario has also been evaluated and included. \n\n\n\n\n\n4.

Marchini & Son, Inc. maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all the processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What if /Checklist.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are re-validated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, J. Marchini & Son, Inc. maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nJ. Marchini & Son, Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  It includes initial training and refresher training. Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nJ.

Any equipment deficiencies identified during maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at J. Marchini & Son, Inc. to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel and all other employees whose job tasks are affected by a change in a process are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the changes.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at J. Marchini & Son, Inc..  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nJ.

Marchini & Son, Inc. truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information collected as part of the facility's compliance with the RMP Rule including information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\n\n\n \n\nHot Work Permit\n\nAt J. Marchini & Son, Inc. Hot Work Permit procedures are in place and enforced. Preventing accidents related to welding and cutting while alerting others at the facility that this type of work is occurring are important prevention steps.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  J. Marchini & Son, Inc. has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response to an accidental release of a regulated substance.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.    Five-year Accident History\n\nThis is a new facility so there is no accident history. All significant releases or potential evacuations will be reported to the CUPA.

Any changes in Emergency Contact information is reported within 30 days.\n\n\n\n7.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program. Permanent roof access to critical isolation valves, emergency shower and eye wash closer to the new mechanical room and barriers to protect the vacuum tube ammonia equipment skid are some of the major steps we want to take to improve safety at our facility. In addition, we have installed panic hardware in our mechanical room.  These changes have been completed be implemented on 7/29/2019. We are also in the process of switching from our (existing) teletroll system to a BNR automation. The BNR automation will give us the ability to check our Ammonia system via internet/text message on cell phones in case of a possible leak. In addition, to being able to check our Ammonia system via the internet, an alert will be sent out immediately to those who have access to this portal in case of leak or malfunction of our system.\n\n"
