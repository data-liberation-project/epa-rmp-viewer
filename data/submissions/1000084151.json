The Merced County Department of Public Health (Division of Environmental Health) recently conducted a CalARP inspection of our facility on 6/14/2019.  It\u00bfs the only chemical onsite that is above thresholds and classified as Hazardous Chemicals. It\u00bfs a rural farming area several miles from small rural towns to the North (Le Grande) and South (Chowchilla).\r\n\r\nThe Ammonia refrigeration system has 3 screw compressors serving a flooded single temperature refrigeration system. Two evaporative condensers are elevated adjacent to the mechanical room.  Room evaporators are in bunkers on one wall. All room isolation valves are outside the rooms. Ammonia safety relief valves (SRV\u00bfs) discharge into a water filled diffusion tank with capacity to neutralize the entire NH3 charge. Refrigeration controls are PLC based with electric valve actuators. The mechanical room has Ammonia detection. The mechanical room ventilation has a continuous and emergency ventilation level that is activated by the control system or break glass switches at both doors. All critical isolation components are redundant, have fail-safe positions for power outages and can be operated manually if required. \r\n\r\nThe procedures for complying with the RM Program regulations are outlined by the following major steps:\r\n1.\tIdentify Covered Processes\r\n2.\tDetermine Program Level\r\n3.\tEstablish a Management System\r\n4.\tConduct a 5-year Accident History\r\n5.\tPerform Hazard Assessments\r\n6.\tDevelop an Accident Prevention Program\r\n7.\tDevelop an Emergency Response Program and\r\n8.\tPrepare a Risk Management Plan (RMP)\r\n\r\nPublication or sharing of OCA portions of RMP materials can be in violation of the Chemical Safety Information, Site Security and Fuels Regulatory Relief Act (PL106-40). \r\n\r\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nWe at J.

It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOur facility's primary activities revolve around processing and storage of fresh Italian vegetable Radicchio.  This activity is consistent with SIC 0723/ NAICS 115114 post harvest crop activities. Anhydrous ammonia is the major regulated substance present at our facility.  The entire ammonia inventory is attributed to use as a refrigerant.  \r\n\r\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\r\nThe worst-case release scenario mandated by the RMP Rule is a standardized hypothetical situation intended to promote \"dialogue\". According to the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration \"The worst-case situation represents an extremely improbable (and for many facilities impossible) set of circumstances rather than a credible accident scenario. Release quantities and hazard distances derived there from for the worst-case scenario should not be used as a basis for emergency response planning.\"\r\n\r\nTo evaluate the worst case and alternative release scenarios for ammonia we have used the methodology given in the Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration by SAIC.  Details are not provided in the Executive Summary as required in recent rule making.\r\n\r\nAlternate case scenario has also been evaluated and included. \r\n\r\n\r\n4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requireme"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What if /Checklist.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are re-validated at a regular interval of 5 years.

Permanent roof access to critical isolation valves, emergency shower and eye wash closer to the new mechanical room and barriers to protect the vacuum tube ammonia equipment skid are some of the major steps we want to take to improve safety at our facility. In addition, we have installed panic hardware in our mechanical room.  These changes have been completed be implemented on 7/29/2019. We are also in the process of switching from our (existing) teletroll system to a BNR automation. The BNR automation will give us the ability to check our Ammonia system via internet/text message on cell phones in case of a possible leak. In addition, to being able to check our Ammonia system via the internet, an alert will be sent out immediately to those who have access to this portal in case of leak or malfunction of our system."
