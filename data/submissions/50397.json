      "SummaryText": "At the City of Gatesville water production faciltity our greatest concern is the realease of chlorine into the surrounding area.  The plant consumes 300lbs of chlorine a day and stores up to 8,000lbs of chlorine on site.  The area surrounding our plant is considered to be rural with few homes spread out over a large scale.  We have developed a risk management program that begins with the employee handling the chlorine and spans to the last individual on our emergency response team.  To reduce the risks envolved in day to day maintenace and general use of chlorine we first had to ensure that our employees on site were educated on the dangers of the chemical.   By implementing scheduled training we have given our employees the necessary knowledge to safely interact with the chemical on a day to day basis.  Knowing that accidents happen, we have developed an Emergency Response Plan, in the event of a failure in any part of the chlorine system.  Guidelines defining theproper course of action assembled in easy steps.  The response plan designates the order in which to notify each responder to ensure the situation is assesed quickly and efficiently as response time is vital in the event of a release.  The process, which our employees are to be drilled on, should result in a safe, organized, and controlled containment of an emergency.  At our plant we have been fortunate.   Over the last five years we have been accident free.  We credit this to the safety measures we have enforced throughout the years.  Through training and good \"safe work ethics\" we have operated efficiently and reduced risks throughout the facility."
