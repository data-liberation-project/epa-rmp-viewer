      "SummaryText": "The company believes that safety is of utmost importance in the operation of this facility.  It complies with all applicable State and Federal regulations and provides training and equipment required to operate in a safe and efficient manner.\n\n\n\nThe facility manufactures resins and other related products that are used primarily in building construction and commercial adhesives. The batch process is carried out in two (2) stainless steel reactor vessels.  Primary raw materials are formaldehyde and urea.  The raw materials are pumped into the reactor vessels under controlled conditions where they react to form the corresponding resinous products.  Formaldehyde is purchased as a 50% aqueous solution in tank truck quantities.  The solution is stored in a 12,500 gallon stainless steel, agitated, storage tank that is temperature controlled.  The tank is located in a concrete diked area along with other raw material tanks.  The formaldehyde solution is the chemical that triggers the regulation (40 CFR  68) requiring the Risk Management Plan (RMP) and OSHA's Process Safety Management Program (PSM).\n\n\n\nAn implementation manual incorporating the requirements of both RMP and PSM has been prepared and is used as the working document for compliance with both regulations.\n\n\n\nOne accidental release of formaldehyde occurred in January 2000, involving a pump seal failure.  Three (3) employees were injured and no offsite areas were affected.  The incident was investigated by both OSHA and EPA.  Both agencies provided assistance and suggestions for improvement and were satisfied once their suggestions for improvement were completed.\n\n\n\nThe facility has an emergency response plan and works closely with the local volunteer fire department (Fair Grove Fire Department) and the Davidson county sheriff's office to insure coordination of local emergency responders and public notification in the event of a chemical release.\n\n\n\nSouthern Resins, Inc. is in the process of installing a vinyl acet"

      "SummaryText": "ate monomer process at the Thomasville, NC facility. The process is isolated from other regulated processes via dikes and a distance of greater than 15 feet.  The vinyl acetate monomer process will consist of storage of approximately 313,600 pounds of vinyl acetate monomer inside two atmospheric tanks that are not connected to each other. Updates to the emergency response plans, employee training and coordination with the local fire department and LEPC will occur prior to the process startup.  Multiple passive and active mitigation systems are included in the process, as discussed herein.  The worst case scenario used to assess off-site consequences assumes the release of one of the atmospheric tanks, which would result in 157,000 pounds of vinyl acetate monomer being released. \n\n\n\nThe alternate scenario used to assess off-site consequences assumes the release of a tanker during unloading, which could result in 47,000 pounds of vinyl acetate monomer being released. \n\n\n\nVinyl acetate monomer is shipped to the facility by tanker truck or railcar and unloaded to one of two atmospheric storage tanks.  The two storage tanks are not interconnected, and are located in a diked storage area.  Vinyl acetate monomer is transferred as needed from the atmospheric tanks to one of two vessel trains.  The trains are also not interconnected.  The production processes are batch processes, and include mixing/blending tanks, reactors and cooling vessels in two separate trains.  Upon completion of the reactor and cooling stage, the vinyl acetate monomer is no longer present. "
