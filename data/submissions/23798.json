(Earthgrains), a wholly owned subsidiary of The Earthgrains Company, owns and operates a commercial bakery facility in Fort Payne, Alabama.  It is the policy of The Earthgrains Company to comply with all applicable federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations, and to conduct its business in an environmentally sound manner that avoids any unreasonable adverse impact on the environment or its neighboring community.\n\nIn keeping with this policy, The Earthgrains Company has developed and implemented a risk management program to ensure the safety of its employees and the neighboring community.  The risk management program includes procedures to (1) identify potentially hazardous chemicals at the facility, (2) for maintaining a safe working environment and, thereby, help prevent the release of hazardous chemicals, and (3) for minimizing the consequences of a release should one occur.\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nEarthgrains? Fort Payne facility makes various bread, bagel, and snack cake products.  The major processes at the Fort Payne facility include flour handling and storage, ingredient mixing, dough proofing, bread baking, product packaging and distribution.  Raw materials are delivered to this facility by trucks.\n\nThe only RMP regulated chemical handled by Earthgrains at the Fort Payne facility is anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is used at the facility in the refrigeration system for cooling the building, making ice, and freezing products.  The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system is a closed loop system.   Anhydrous ammonia is delivered to the facility by supplier tank trucks to initially charge the system and occasionally thereafter to top-off the system during hot weather conditions.  \n\nEarthgrains has in place policies that limit the amount of ammonia at the facility.  In addition, this fa"

Ammonia is also subject to OSHA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations; therefore this chemical is subject to the RMP Program Level 3 requirements.\n\n\nWorst-Case and Alternate-Case Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for toxic substances, by definition, is the maximum amount of that toxic substance that could be released over a 10-minute period from the storage vessel and ancillary piping.  The maximum amount of ammonia stored in the storage tank and ancillary piping, valves and other miscellaneous equipment is 17,500 pounds.   Based on US EPA?s RMP*Comp program, the specific distance to the toxic endpoint is calculated at 1.7 miles, which extends beyond the facility?s plant boundary.  Approximately 777 people live within 1.7 miles of the facility as determined using census data provided by the Landview III program.  Topographic maps and visual receptor surveys indicate that the area within 1.7 miles from the facility has other industrial properties, churches, public recreational areas and two schools.\n\nThe alternate-case release scenario for the ammonia system at Earthgrains Fort Payne facility has been defined as a truck ?pull-away? failure during system charging operations.   Assuming that the active mitigation devices work as designed, the most that would be released during this scenario is the contents of the filling hose (approximately 3? dia. x 25?).  The distance to the toxic endpoint for this scenario is estimated using a release duration of 1 minute.  Based on US EPA?s RMP*Comp Program, the conservative distance to the endpoint is calculated at 0.1 miles, which extends beyond the facility?s plant boundary.\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Earthgrains? Fort Payne facility is subject to both EPA?s Accidental Release Prevention program and OSHA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  Under both of these progra"

Specifically, the facility has performed a process hazard analysis (PHA) of the ammonia system and will repeat this process at least every 5 years.  The purpose of the PHA is to provide a systematic approach for identifying, evaluating, and controlling potential hazards associated with the ammonia system.  In addition, the facility performs regular training of its employees to ensure that the procedures developed for the safe use and handling of ammonia is adhered to all the time.  Finally, the facility has a regular inspection and maintenance program to ensure that the ammonia system is operating according to specific safety standards.  Earthgrains believes that safe operating practices and accident prevention are the way to do business everyday.\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nEarthgrains? Fort Payne facility has had one accidental release of ammonia in the last 5 years.  The release occurred on November 2, 1999 when the casing on a solenoid valve failed causing the release of anhydrous ammonia into the engine room of the bakery.  Due to the effective emergency response procedures in place at Earthgrains? Fort Payne facility, the amount of ammonia released to the atmosphere was significantly minimized. \n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nEarthgrains? Fort Payne facility has developed a written emergency response program for the ammonia system and has provided training to its employees on its implementation.  In the event of an emergency involving the ammonia system, it is Earthgrains policy to immediately notify the Fort Payne Fire Department and request that they respond to the situation.  Earthgrains has discussed this policy with the Fort Payne Fire Department and has a written letter of agreement that outlines how emergency responses will be handled.  Earthgrains has confirmed with the fire department that they have the necess"

Members of the local fire department have also performed inspections of the ammonia system at the facility. \n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nEarthgrains? Fort Payne facility recently made changes to the ammonia system as a result of the investigation following the ammonia release that occurred on November 2, 1999.  No other planned changes to the ammonia system are planned at this time.  Since the ammonia system is regulated under OSHA?s PSM program however, it will be subjected to regular process hazard analyses reviews for the purpose of identifying and implementing potential improvements."
