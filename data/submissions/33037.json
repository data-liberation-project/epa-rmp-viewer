Our goals are to promote and strengthen mutual understanding and deepen trust in what we do.  \n\nThe BASF Corporation Monaca Site implements these policies through site-specific programs \nand procedures.\n\nFacility Description\n\nThe BASF Corporation Monaca Site uses acrylonitrile, butadiene, and vinyl acetate.  These chemicals are used to manufacture polymer dispersions.  The polymer dispersion most commonly known by the general public is the \u00bflatex\u00bf in latex paint.  Polymer dispersions are also commonly used in products such as pressure-sensitive adhesives like those used in masking tape, building materials such as caulking and stucco, and paper coatings for such items as magazines and food cartons.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nTo prevent accidental releases, this facility operates in compliance with the EPA Risk\nManagement Program, the OSHA Process Safety Management standard, and the Chemical \nManufacturer Association\u00bfs Responsible Care Process Safety Code.  There are also separate\nOSHA standards for acrylonitrile and butadiene.  BASF Corporation\u00bfs Monaca Site complies fully \nwith these standards.  In addition, all raw material storage tanks and transfer activities are \ncontinuously monitored to ensure that safe conditions are maintained. \n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThis facility has had no accidental release over the past five years which meets the reporting\ncriteria.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThis facility has an emergency response plan that is coordinated with the community plan.  Haz-\nmat team members are trained and participate in drills regularly.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nFacility processes are routinely changed to improve safety as a result of employee suggestions,\nprocess hazard analyses, incident investigations, and other feedback opportunities.  Projects are\nunderway to further automate the manufacturing process to improve monitoring and control."
