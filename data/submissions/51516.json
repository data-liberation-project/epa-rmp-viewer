In doing so, Columbia Reach is complying with OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals Standard (called Process Safety Management or PSM) and EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Program regulations (called Risk Management Program or RM Program) to deal with the risks involved in the storage, handling, and processing of highly hazardous materials such as ammonia.  By our full commitment to these programs, we promote overall plant and worker safety.  Columbia Reach Pack operates as a farm product warehouse and storage facility.  As such, our facility has one (1) ammonia refrigeration system that contains over the threshold planning quantity for RMP.\n\nBy actively using all of the elements in our PSM/RM programs we strive to prevent the occurrence of any ammonia release, and minimize the consequences of releases of ammonia as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, Columbia Reach is committed to fulfill all of the requirements of the PSM/RM programs to prevent accidental injuries, illnesses, avoid property damage, and prevent harm to the environment.\n\nColumbia Reach Pack\u00bfs PSM/RM programs prevent accidents because we focus on good industry and engineering procedures, and practices for all processes, activities, and operation of all equipment.  Through continued review and update, all elements of our PSM/RM programs are improved as necessary.  Any updates or revisions to procedure or practices are communicated to affected employees at the facility.  Columbia Reach has developed a written employee participation plan. Columbia Reach consults with the employees about the development of the PSM program and provides them access to information relevant to the process.  New employees are made aware of ammonia refrigeration PSM as a part of the initial orientation process, in conjunction with hazards communication requ"

Facility management has developed the emergency action plan to ensure a fast and efficient response in the event of an accidental ammonia release.
