This is first exhibited by upper management\u0012s commitment to safety in all aspects of utility operations, with a special emphasis on chemical safety at our wastewater treatment facility. We fully recognize the hazards certain chemicals present and are committed to providing the needed funds for up to date equipment and ongoing training.  \n\nOverview of Facility\n\nThe City of Carmel\u0012s Wastewater Treatment Plant, located at 96th and Hazel Dell Road, provides wastewater treatment for the City of Carmel, Clay Waste Regional Sewer District, the City of Westfield, and Hamilton Western Utilities. The plant is rated to treat 12 million gallons per day with the current average being 7.5 million gallons per day. As part of the treatment process we are required by our wastewater permit to disinfect the wastewater with chlorine prior to it being discharged into the West Fork of the White River. We are required to use chlorine from April 1 through October 31. Prior to discharging into the White River we must remove the large majority of the chlorine to prevent hurting the aquatic life in the river. This is done by feeding Sulfur Dioxide which removes the chlorine. \n\nThe total amount of chlorine we store at the plant is 4000 pounds. The total amount of sulfur dioxide is also 4000 pounds. For our RMP submittal we are only required to submit a Risk Management Plan for chlorine given that the limit for sulfur dioxide is 5,000 pounds. However, our procedures for the safe handling and operations of sulfur dioxide are much the same as with chlorine.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario\n\nThis scenario represents a worst case release of chlorine from a 1-ton cylinder.

The potentially affected population within this circle is estimated to be 4,000 people. A release of this magnitude could require an evacuation of some residential areas dependent upon the wind direction.  Within this area are industrial areas, some small offices, parks, and some residential areas.\n\nThe major environmental receptor within the affected area is the West Fork of the White River.  This river flows from northeast to southwest between the City\u0012s of Carmel and the Town of Fishers, Indiana, and then south through the City of Indianapolis.\n\nAlternate Release Scenario  \n\nThis scenario represents an alternate case release of chlorine from a 1-ton cylinder.

The residential population would be zero (0). \n\nThe relatively low population within this endpoint circle is due to much of the area being industrial in nature, some undeveloped area, and local road ways.
