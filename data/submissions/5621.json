This is first exhibited by upper managements commitment to safety in all aspects of utility operations, with a special emphasis on chemical safety at our wastewater treatment facility. We fully recognize the hazards certain chemicals present and are committed to providing the needed funds for up to date equipment and ongoing training.  \n\nOverview of Facility\n\nThe City of Carmels Wastewater Treatment Plant, located at 96th and Hazel Dell Road, provides wastewater treatment for the City of Carmel, Clay Waste Regional Sewer District, the City of Westfield, and Hamilton Western Utilities. The plant is rated to treat 12 million gallons per day with the current average being 7.5 million gallons per day. As part of the treatment process we are required by our wastewater permit to disinfect the wastewater with chlorine prior to it being discharged into the West Fork of the White River. We are required to use chlorine from April 1 through October 31. Prior to discharging into the White River we must remove the large majority of the chlorine to prevent hurting the aquatic life in the river. This is done by feeding Sulfur Dioxide which removes the chlorine. \n\nThe total amount of chlorine we store at the plant is 4000 pounds. The total amount of sulfur dioxide is also 4000 pounds. For our RMP submittal we are only required to submit a Risk Management Plan for chlorine given that the limit for sulfur dioxide is 5,000 pounds. However, our procedures for the safe handling and operations of sulfur dioxide are much the same as with chlorine.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario\n\nThis scenario represents a worst case release of chlorine from a 1-ton cylinder.

The potentially affected population within this circle is estimated to be 4,000 people. A release of this magnitude could require an evacuation of some residential areas dependent upon the wind direction.  Within this area are industrial areas, some small offices, parks, and some residential areas.\n\nThe major environmental receptor within the affected area is the West Fork of the White River.  This river flows from northeast to southwest between the Citys of Carmel and the Town of Fishers, Indiana, and then south through the City of Indianapolis.\n\nAlternate Release Scenario  \n\nThis scenario represents an alternate case release of chlorine from a 1-ton cylinder.

The potentially affected population within this circle is estimated to be 100 people which is primarily employees of asphalt and stone companies. The residential population would be zero (0). \n\nThe relatively low population within this endpoint circle is due to much of the area being industrial in nature, some undeveloped area, and local road ways. In the event of a chlorine release, additional concern should be given to motor vehicle and pedestrian traffic near the wastewater plant.\n\nThe major environmental receptor within this affected area is the West Fork of the White River  located just east of the plant.\n\nAccident Release Prevention Program - Chlorine\n\nThe City of Carmel's  Wastewater Treatment Plant falls under the guidelines of the OSHA process safety regulations for chlorine, and have been in place since May of 1997.

Any work that is contracted out must ensure that the contract maintenance employee is trained to perform the maintenance procedures.  \n\nConsequences of Deviation\n\nPurpose\n\nThe purpose of consequences of deviation is to provide information on the consequences of improper operation or maintenance of the chlorine system.  Deviation from safe and proper operation of the equipment can lead to serious problems affecting the public and other environmental receptors.  \n\nChlorine gas is a respiratory irritant.  Exposure to chlorine gas can lead to irritation of the mucous membranes, the respiratory system, and the skin.  In extreme cases, suffocation and death can occur.  Therefore, the following should always be done:\nLeaks must be repaired immediately. \nAll chlorine gas must be removed from the equipment before any maintenance activity.\nAlways wear Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) when there is a possibility of chlorine released to the atmosphere.\n\nMoisture must be excluded from any part of the equipment, which is normally exposed to dry chlorine on"

Therefore, the following should always be done:\nNever apply water on a chlorine leak. \nWhen any connection is broken immediately plug the opening with a rubber stopper or equivalent to prevent entrance of moisture.\nAlways clean and dry piping before initial startup or after a prolonged shutdown to ensure that any moisture is removed.\n\nSafety Information and Hazard Review\n\nSafety Information \n\nPurpose\n\nThe purpose of this procedure is to provide safety information on the operation of the chlorine system and information on the safety equipment involved in the system.\n  \nResponsibility\n\nThe Plant Superintendent has overall responsibility for maintaining and implementing this procedure.  The Plant Superintendent assigns additional qualified individuals as listed in the procedure to assist in compiling and maintaining the necessary information.  \n\nThe owner or operator updates the safety information if a major change occurs that makes the existing information inaccurate. \n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThe Carmel Wastewater Treatment Plant has had no chlorine releases in the last five years, or in the total lifetime of the plant, that have resulted in any off-site consequence. During the last five years we have had one very small leak, (less than a pound) that resulted in one employee having some eye and throat irritation. The employee was able to return to work the next day.\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\n( NOTE:  The City of Carmel Wastewater Treatment Plant personnel do not respond to chlorine releases that result or are likely to result in an uncontrolled release.  This does not include any efforts for incidental releases (minor leaks) that can be controlled at the time of release by employees in the immediate area, or by maintenance personnel.\n\nPurpose\n\nThe purpose of this section is to formally outline procedures to be followed in an emergency situation inv"

This emergency action plan has been developed to ensure that in case of such an event, the personnel at the Carmel Wastewater Treatment Plant personnel respond safely and properly.\n\nResponsibility\n\nThe RMP Program Manager has the overall responsibility for the safety of the employees at the Carmel Wastewater Treatment Plant. The evacuation of all employees from the Wastewater Treatment Plant is the first priority.  The second priority is to inform the Carmel Fire Department of the situation.  The safety of the public and control of the chlorine leak are the duty of the fire department.  The City of Carmels Hazardous Materials Response Unit is responsible for control of the chlorine leak and evacuation of any affected residents.\n\nChlorine Emergency Procedure\n\nWhenever there is imminent or actual chlorine emergency, the RMP Program Manager (or his designee, when he is offsite) must immediately:\n\nNotify everyone at the facility of the situation.\n\nDetermine the area affected by the chlorine and the outdoor wind direction using wind direction signals on top of the control building.\n\nTelephone the fire department;  DIAL 911.  Give them all available information about the leak:\nWhat is leaking;  Chlorine\nWhether the chlorine leak is liquid or gas\nWhere the chlorine leak is located\nHow the chlorine is leaking out\nWhen the leak started\nOutdoor wind direction\n\nPlant Evacuation Procedure\n\nThis procedure is to be followed in the event of an emergency that would require the employees within the plant to evacuate.  Primarily this would be in case of an imminent or actual risk of a chlorine release.\n\nThe following procedure is followed if the RMP Program Manager (or his designee, when he is offsite) determines the need for a plant evacuation.\n\nThe RMP Program Manager must immediately:\n\nNotify everyone at the facility of the situation.\n\nBased on the wind direction, determine the proper exit door to use for the evacuation to avoid chlori"
