The team identified several actions that should be considered by Greenleaf Unit 2 to reduce the probability of an accidental release of ammonia.\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nSince the start-up of the facility in 1989, there have been no accidents or catastrophic releases involving anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nGreenleaf Unit 2 has an emergency action plan in place. This plan incorporates all CalARP requirements for an RMP emergency response program. Key elements of the program are procedures for informing the public and local emergency response agencies in the event of a release, steps to be taken for medical first-aid treatment, and mitigation measures following an accidental release of ammonia.\r\n\r\nAlso included in the Greenleaf Unit 2 emergency response program are procedures for the use, inspection, testing, and maintenance of emergency response equipment; training for Greenleaf Unit 2 employees, and procedures for reviewing, updating, and informing Greenleaf Unit 2 employees of changes in the emergency action plan.\r\n\r\nPlanned Safety Changes\r\n\r\nAll findings and recommendations from prior process hazard assessments have been implemented. No outstanding issues have been found during the most recent process hazard assessment completed on 08/02/2019. \r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nGreenleaf Unit 2 is committed to reviewing and enhancing the plant's CalARP programs and procedures and is in compliance with the applicable federal and state requirements.\r\n\r\nThe RMP program documents are complete and accessible to all interested persons at all times. The Greenleaf Unit 2 RMP program is proactive, meets the CalARP requirements, and confirms Greenleaf Unit 2's commitment to its environmental and safety policies, which are designed to protect the offsite public and environment, employees, and contractors.\r\n\r\nT"

      "SummaryText": "Operational Note: The Greenleaf Unit 2 facility is scheduled to be decommissioned in the December 2019 timeframe. In or around that time all anhydrous ammonia shall either be consumed or removed offsite.\r\n\r\nExecutive Summary\r\n\r\nTitle III of the U.S. Clean Air Act (CAA), Amendments of 1990, requires that certain facilities prepare and submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP). The Greenleaf Unit 2 Power Plant, located in Sutter County, California, is subject to that requirement. The State of California has responded to the federal requirements with development of its own regulations in CCR Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5.  The regulations set forth a program known as the California Accidental Release Prevention Program or CalARP.\r\n\r\nThe CalARP requirements closely parallels the federal requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68. This RMP has been developed according to the CalARP regulations. Many of the requirements under CalARP are the same as those mandated under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) program, which is already in effect at Greenleaf Unit 2.\r\n\r\nRelease and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe chemical process at Greenleaf Unit 2 covered under the CalARP program is the use of anhydrous ammonia for the reduction of nitrogen oxides in the exhaust from the power plant. Greenleaf Unit 2's policy is to prevent unplanned or accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in any quantity. Previously developed environmental and injury and illness prevention policies reinforce this release policy and, when implemented act to prevent releases. The environmental and injury and illness prevention policies are located in the Control Room in the Safety and Health binder.  \r\n\r\nGreenleaf Unit 2's policy prohibits employees responding to emergencies such as catastrophic releases of anhydrous ammonia. However, employees are allowed to respond to small or incidental releases such as minor leaks or spills.\r\n\r\nThe Facility and Regu"

      "SummaryText": "lated Substance\r\n\r\nGreenleaf Unit 2 is a nominal 49.2-megawatt cogeneration facility, which uses a Stewart and Stevenson package containing a General Electric LM5000 gas turbine and a Brush generator to produce electrical power. The adjacent Sunsweet fruit processing facility purchases steam created by the facility. Greenleaf Unit 2 employs 12 persons to run and maintain the power plant. \r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is used to control the nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from the power plant's exhaust stack to meet the facility's permitted air emissions limits. Ammonia vapor is injected into the stack's Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system, supplied by Johnson-Matthey Company. Anhydrous ammonia suppliers deliver ammonia in tank trucks to refill the Greenleaf Unit 2 storage tank. The ammonia is delivered as a liquid under pressure. The 12,417-gallon storage tank is filled to 80% of maximum capacity, approximately 10,000 gallons. Ammonia vapor is drawn from the vessel, diluted with ambient air, and injected into the SCR system via an injection grid. An automatic control and monitoring system regulates the vapor flow.\r\n\r\nThe entire ammonia storage, vaporization, and injection cycle is relatively simple and is designed and operated per standard industry practice. The plant has an emergency action plan for appropriately responding to any ammonia vapor release.\r\n\r\n\r\nRelease Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe Greenleaf Unit 2 release prevention program addresses a number of areas to prevent releases of ammonia. These areas include a process hazard analysis (PHA), operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-startup review, compliance audits, incident investigations, employee participation, hot work permits, and procedures for the procurement and use of contractors.\r\n\r\nA key item of the RMP prevention program is the PHA. This analysis was performed for the anhydrous ammonia system by a team of knowledgeable persons. The team used a \"what-if\" approach,"
