Since that time, the plant has been idle but increasing gas volumes and other conditions have required that we occasionally restart the plant. Estimated run time for this plant is less than 5 days per calendar year.  In order to accomplish this short amount of run time, a review of the Process Hazards Analysis was conducted and all items found during that review have been corrected.  All personnel operating the facility have been thoroughly trained and are skilled operators from our near by Chipeta Gas Plant.  Across the road from the complex is a field office owned and operated by Anadarko.  All personnel at that office are fully aware of the operations and hazards associated with this facility and complex.  There are no third party receptors within the predicted 1 psi overpressure scenario due to a possible vapor cloud explosion, making this complex a Program Level 1 facility.  Anadarko has a longstanding commitment to worker and public safety.  Our commitment is supported by the resources invested in accident prevention, personnel training and the consideration of safety issues in the design, construction, operation, minimization of hazardous chemicals stored or used on-site and maintenance of our facilities.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to provide a safe operation and prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained gas plant personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Natural Buttes Gas Plant is located approximately 45 miles South of Vernal Utah.

When operated, the plant produces a lean, dry residue gas stream and liquefied hydrocarbons that can be fractionated into propane and Y-grade (which is a mixture of butanes, and pentanes). The liquids that are recovered from the refrigeration process are stored at the plant in pressurized storage tanks until shipped from the plant via truck. The total storage of these pressurized hydrocarbons exceeds 10,000 lbs, making this facility fall under the regulations found in the Risk Management Plan.  Due to the fact there are no third party receptors within the predicted 1.00 psi overpressure radius; this facility is considered a Program Level 1 facility.  The plant handles regulated flammables such as ethane, propane, mixed butanes and mixed pentanes.  Since the plant does not handle threshold quantities of any materials classified as toxic, there are no toxic release scenarios to consider at the Natural Buttes facility.\n\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\n\n\nThis narrative section has been deleted as directed by the regulation.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant.   The processes at the plant are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  The following summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nThe Natural Buttes gas plant requires employees to participate in all facets of process management and accident prevention.

This program as well as the other documentation is maintained at the gas plant. In addition, the PSM program requires that we address process and employee safety issues as part of our normal operations.  Near Miss and Hazard Observation reports are completed by employees with mandatory follow up by management.  Employees also participate in the development of standardized operating procedures, incident investigation, management of change, safe work practices, our \"Safe Start\" program, and participation in flowsheet reviews. \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Natural Buttes gas plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The Operations group has been assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  The location of these documents is readily available to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment consideration, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.   For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety related limits for specific process parameters in operating manuals.

This information in combination with written procedures and trained personnel provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nThe Natural Buttes gas plant has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe Natural Buttes gas plant uses the What If/Checklist or HAZOPS method of performing a process hazards analysis (PHA) to evaluate the hazards associated with the process.  These PHAs are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures.  The team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. The latest PHA was a comprehensive PHA completed in June of 2010.    There are no outstanding issues from either the PHA or the audit left to mitigate.  \n\n\n\nIf necessary the PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.

The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe Natural Buttes gas plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as unit startup, normal operations, emergency shutdown and normal shutdown.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed to ensure they are current and accurate.  The procedures are also kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written process operating procedures, the Natural Buttes gas plant has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate the knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.

This is accomplished by providing contractors with 1) process overview, 2) information about safety and health hazards, 3) emergency response plan requirements, 4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work, 5) safe and hot work permits as required.  In addition the company has a program in place that evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  No contractor is allowed to perform work at the plant unless they have met the requirements of this evaluation process.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\n\n\nThe Natural Buttes gas plant conducts a PSSR for any new process or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents it findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence and forwards these results to gas plant management for resolution.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented and the investigation results reviewed with all employees who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits \n\n\n\nTo guarantee that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Natural Buttes gas plant audits to determine that the procedures and practices requ"

Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to gas plant management for resolution.  The last EHS audit was completed by our internal auditing team in Oct. of 2010.  There are no unscheduled outstanding issues left to mitigate as a result of that audit. There are two items left to be closed from that audit and they will be completed before the end of 2011.\n\n\n\nChemical -Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe processes at the Natural Buttes gas plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulates substances in the facility.\n\n\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities  \n\n\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP covered processes at the Natural Buttes gas plant.  Collectively these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failure and human errors.\n\n\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\n\n\nThe Natural Buttes gas plant has safety features to help 1) contain/control a release, 2) quickly detect a release, and 3) reduce the consequence of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\n\n\nRelease Detection - Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms\n\nRelease Containment/Control \n\n- Process relief valves that discharge to a flare which will capture and incinerate episodic releases\n\n - Emergency Shutdown Valves - To permit isolation of portions or the entire process\n\n-  Automated shutdown systems that respond to specific process parameters\n\n- Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\n\n- Redundant equipment and instrumentation\n\n- Atmospheric relief devices\n\n- Overall Plant and local area ESDs\n\n- Computer controlled and interlocked p"

The program consists of procedure for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup.  In addition the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection and testing of emergency equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the plant.  The emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program of the Natural Buttes gas plant is coordinate with the Uintah County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meeting of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives.

This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to emergency situations.  The personnel working at the Natural Buttes gas plant conduct periodic emergency drills to test their level of preparedness.   \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety-\n\n\n\nAll of the procedures in place at the plant undergo a complete review annually to assure that they are consistent with the safety design and operation of the process.  Any changes made to the procedures are documented using the MOC process and all employees are retrained before allowing them to operate that portion of the process.  All safety programs affecting the plant will be reviewed again in 2011 to assure they meet the requirements of the regulations as well as providing the training to plant personnel to assure the facility staff has the knowledge to follow them.  The plant also holds annual training on the emergency response plan.  These training sessions are audited by company safety personnel.\n\n"
