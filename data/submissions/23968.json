      "SummaryText": "PPG Industries Ohio, Inc, Circleville, Ohio EPA DAPC ID #016500000\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe PPG Circleville facility complies with applicable Ohio and US EPA regulations and applicable Department of Transportation requirements.  PPG also follows the responsible Care (registered service mark) codes of Management Practices, including the Responsible Care (registered service mark) Community Awareness Code of Management Practices, and PPG's own Community Awareness and Emergency Response (CAER) Policy to assure emergency preparedness and foster community right-to-know.  PPG's CAER Policy requires each manufacturing plant to have a pro-active community awareness and emergency response program to handle emergencies that might happen in that facility.  All of these activities form an integral part of PPG's overall Environment, Health and Safety Policy, whose goal is to manufacture, sell and distribute products worldwide in a manner that is safe and protective of our employees, neighbors, customers and other stakeholders and the environment.\n\nRegulated Substance Handled\nPPG Circleville is a part of the PPG Automotive Coatings Group of PPG Industries, Inc.  PPG Circleville produces resins used in the manufacture of automotive coatings.  The facility stores and uses Toluene 2, 4 Diisocyanate and Toluene 2,6 Diisocyanate both of which are referred to in this document asTDI.  The EPA-RMP list identifies TDI as a toxic material. \n\nWorst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios\nAn off-site consequence analysis was performed for the largest quantity of TDI (toxic material) stored in any given tank at the facility.  EPA's Risk Management Program Guidelines for Offsite Consequence Analysis and its lookup tables were used to complete the analysis.\n\nEPA rules require that a worst case scenario be analyzed which would involve the highly unlikely release of the entire contents of the largest storage container.  Based on EPA RMP criteria,"

      "SummaryText": "the worst case release scenario does not have offsite impact.\n\nBecause the worst case scenario has no offsite impact, no alternative case is required by the RMP regulation.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nThere have been no accidental releases of TDI from the Circleville facility in the past five years, which resulted in, on-site or off-site impacts as defined by EPA's RMP criteria.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\nThe RMP regulation specifies that covered processes at all plants must be classified as Program Level 1, 2 or 3 processes.  PPG Circleville's TDI process is classified as a Program Level 1 process because the Worst-Case Scenario has no offsite impact and because the TDI process had no accidental releases in the past five years that meet RMP criteria.  Submission of specific prevention program information for Program Level 1 processes is not required in the RMP.\n\nEmergency Response Procedures\nPPG coordinates emergency response activities (procedures, training, drills, etc.) with the local fire department. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nPPG is committed to the process of continuous improvement.  This commitment extends beyond production into the environmental and safety aspects of all operations.  Changes in the manufacturing equipment, operating practices and process controls are made, as necessary, to assure process reliability and effective minimization of accidental release.  For additional information, contact Mr. Art Henry at (740)474-3161."
