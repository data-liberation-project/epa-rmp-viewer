Dillons' operations include storing frozen foods, grocery products, dry goods and distribution.  Dillons has been in operation at this facility for over 40 years providing quality grocery products and over 600 jobs to the local community.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nDillons is committed to protecting the health of its employees, the surrounding community, and the environment; therefore it is Dillons's policy to maintain compliance with 40 CFR 68 as well as Occupational Safety and Health Organization (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations promulgated as Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations Chapter 1910, Section 119 (29 CFR 1910.119), and OSHA's Hazardous Operations and Emergency Response regulations (29 CFR 1910.120). \n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nDillons is subject to 112(r) because ammonia, a regulated substance, is present at the facility in amounts greater than 10,000 pounds.  Dillons is required to maintain low temperatures in the food processing areas of the plant that are within standards required by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).  Dillons uses anhydrous ammonia (the 112(r) regulated substance) as a refrigerant to maintain the over 750,000 ft2 facility within the required range of operating temperatures.  Anhydrous ammonia is an industry-standard refrigerant for grocery distribution facilities.  Dillons' refrigeration system consisting of receivers, compressors, evaporators, condensers, and piping in three systems containing a maximum amount of 29,500 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The largest of the three systems contains 19,800 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nWorst Case Relea"

      "SummaryText": "se Scenario\n\nAs required by 40 CFR 68 Subpart B, Dillons has evaluated a worst-case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia using the parameters specified by the EPA.  Dillons's worst case release scenario is: the rupture of the high pressure ammonia receiver when filled to 100% capacity over a 10-minute period.  Using the EPA's RMP*Comp program, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint is 1.5 miles.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario was developed following EPA regulations and is not considered to be a likely release scenario.  During normal operations, Dillons maintains the receiver at no more than 20% capacity.  Only during pump-down operations, which occur rarely, does the receiver have the potential to be filled to any level approaching 100% of capacity. \n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nA more realistic release scenario (alternative release) was developed by Dillons taking into consideration the 5-year history of operation's experience and the hazards identified in the process hazard analyses (PHAs) conducted under the Occupational Safety and Health Organization (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations promulgated as Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations Chapter 1910, Section 119 (29 CFR 1910.119).  The most likely release scenario identified by Dillons would be a fracture or leak in a high pressure vapor line due to contact with a pressure gauge resulting in breaking the gauge nipple. Using EPA's RMP*Comp program, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.1 miles which is on facility property.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is designed and constructed in accordance with ANSI/IIAR 2-1992 Standard for Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigerating Systems.  To prevent and mitigate accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia, Dillons has implemented several precautionary measures.  \n\nPSM Program\n\nDillons has implemented OSHA's PSM program and as such, has evaluated systems via Pro"

Some of the controls installed to prevent catastrophic releases of ammonia are process related equipment (vents, pressure relief valves, backup pumps, and manual shutoffs) and automated controls (automatic shut-offs, ammonia leak detection systems, and electrical distribution system grounding).  System descriptions, drawings, manuals and P&IDs are on hand for either system operations, evaluations or emergency response.  Other PSM related programs are described below.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nDillons has developed standard operating procedures for all employees and contractors that have contact with the ammonia refrigeration system that incorporate safety measures into the procedures.  These safety procedures were developed by Dillons and are reviewed on an annual basis.  Dillons encourages employee participation in development of the control measures used at the plant by means of company newsletters and training sessions.  Any changes to the operating procedures are communicated to affected employees following written management of change procedures established by Dillons.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nDillons understands that maintaining the refrigeration system in good working order is essential to preventing accidental releases; therefore Dillons has implemented a preventative maintenance program.  The preventative maintenance program is scheduled, documented and managed to ensure that regular maintenance occurs on the system\n\nHot Work, Equipment Entry and Line Breaking, Lockout/Tagout and Confined Space Entry Programs and Training are in place.\n\nAudits and Program Reviews\n\nIn accordance with the PSM program, Dillons conducts detailed PSM compliance audits every three years that incorporate review of process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training programs, system mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-start up review procedures, "

Included in the SOP are measures to be taken internally by Dillons as well as measures to be taken by off-site response agencies.\n \nAnnual evacuation and response training is conducted.
