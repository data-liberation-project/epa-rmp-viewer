Facility accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\n     In this process and distribution facility, the plant handles propane and butane which is considered hazardous by EPA.  The same properties that make propane and butane valuable as a fuel also makes them necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling propane and butane to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to employees personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is the policy of HILCORP ENERGY COMPANY to adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and local rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle propane and butane combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility combined with the safe handling and procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n     Our emergency response program is based upon \"Good Engineering for Developing Plant Emergency Procedures and Controlling LP-Gas Leaks and Fires\".  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local and state notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n\n2.  Facility description and regulated substances handled:\n\n     The primary purpose of this facility is to process and distribute propane, butane, and other products to wholesale customers.  Product (propane and butane) is stored on site in a V-100 surge drum; periodically, during upsets, product can be stored on site in sixteen (16) vertical storage containers.  Product is pumped into the Phillips Pipeline for distribution.\n     Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility personnel (employees/management) and authorized contractors.\n     The regulated substances handled at this process and distribution facility are propane and butane.
