The site was formerly owned by DuPont and operated as an explosives and chemical manufacturing facility from approximately 1890 to 1980.  Chemours became the owner of record of the site in April 2015 and DRP acquired the site in June 2016. The site is being redeveloped into a multi-modal deep-water seaport by DRP. The site features an existing underground cavern that was previously mined out of metamorphic rock in approximately 1965. The cavern was previously used by DuPont for the storage of anhydrous ammonia.\r\n \r\nCavern storage and loading and unloading areas are located near the Delaware River, at the north of the site and about one mile from the site entrance.  The cavern has been refurbished to receive, store, and distribute Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG).  The cavern is located between 340 and 370 feet below the ground surface and has a storage capacity of approximately 7.8 million gallons (1 million cubic feet). The cavern and loading/unloading facilities were approved by the NJDEP for operation under the TCPA Risk Management Program, signed and dated 6/22/2017.  A Major Modification to this approved RMP includes change of the covered chemical from Butane to Flammable Mixture, additional rail car rack, connection to the dock, truck transloading operations (landside) and the addition of a deep water port, constructed according to recommended industry specifications and operation under the jurisdiction of the USCG.  These changes were covered under an major MOC and all subsequent process safety information, including a process hazard analysis (PHA), Inherently safer technology (IST) and pre start up Safety Review (PSSR) were performed. These changes were reviewed by the department during the last site inspection in May of 2021. One additional MOC recently completed inc"
