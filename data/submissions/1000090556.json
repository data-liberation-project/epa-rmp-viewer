If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Fairmount fire Department, or other authorities, to minimize the impact of the release to people and environment4.  Farmers Union Oil of Southern Valley has sponsored several NH3 safety trainings in the past for fire departments in the area and customers.\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is to store anhydrous ammonia and loading nurse tanks for delivery to the farm for application.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop nutrient.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a transport truck vessel containing 53,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank over ten minutes.  The maximum quantity would be 131,325 pounds representing 85 percent of the largest tank capacity, as limited by design standards.\n\n\n\nThe alternate release scenario based on a two minute release is a release from a break in a three inch transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint in this case would be .81 miles.\n\n\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of A?Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61-1, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29CFR 1910.111, A?Storage and Handling of anhydrous ammoniaA?.\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of Anhydrous Ammonia in the past five years at this site.\n\n\n\nFarmers Union Oil of Southern Valley has a written action plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38, provided state and local authorities with emergency planning and community right-to"
