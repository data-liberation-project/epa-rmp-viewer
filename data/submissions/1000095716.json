The function and thermodynamics of each major component type in the system is summarized below:\n\n\n\nHigh Pressure Receivers\n\n\n\nThe purpose of each high pressure receiver is to provide a safe location to add and store high pressure liquid ammonia in the refrigeration systems. Each high pressure receiver receives high pressure liquid from the condensers or thermosyphon vessel and supplies high pressure liquid to each zone of refrigeration and reciruclator. The high pressure receivers are also used to provide storage for ammonia not being used in the process at any given moment. Each high pressure receiver is equipped with a main liquid feed shut-off valve (king valve) that is clearly labeled and can be used to stop the flow of ammonia throughout the system. Under normal conditions, the high pressure receivers contain high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nFlooded Accumulators\n\n\n\nThe purpose of each flooded accumulator is to provide a supply of low pressure liquid ammonia to the evaporators. Each accumulator is equipped with an expansion valve which expands the high pressure liquid into a low temperature and pressure liquid as it enters the vessel. The flooded accumulators supply, by gravity, low pressure liquid to the associated evaporators. Liquid and vapor returned from the evaporators is separated inside the flooded accumulators to allow only the vapor to be returned to the suction accumulators. Under normal conditions, the flooded accumulators contain low pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nRecirculator (Pump Drum)\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the recirculator (pump drum) is to provide a supply of low pressure liquid that can be used in evaporators throughout the facility.

The oil pot receives liquid ammonia and oil from the recirculator (pump drum) and vent ammonia vapor back to the recirculator. The oil pot is equipped with an oil drain valve which is used to drain oil from the system as needed. Under normal conditions, the oil pot contains low pressure liquid ammonia, low pressure vapor ammonia, and refrigerant oil.\n\n\n\nAir-Cooling Evaporators (Flooded)\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the air-cooling evaporators is to remove heat from the air in order to maintain a predetermined space temperature. The air-cooling evaporators receive liquid from the flooded accumulators. The evaporators contain a set of continuous coils through which the low pressure liquid flows. Due to the low pressures and temperatures maintained in the evaporator, the liquid refrigerant absorbs a great deal of heat from the surrounding area and evaporates. To increase the rate of heat removed, the evaporators use an electric fan to move warm air over the coils of cold liquid ammonia. Once the liquid has evaporated to form low temperature and pressure vapor, it returns to the supplying vessel.

The plate and frame heat exchanger receives liquid from a flooded accumulator  where it flows through the channels in the plates and absorbs the heat from the glycol solution on the opposite side of each plate. Low pressure liquid and vapor exits the plate and frame heat exchanger and is returned to the flooded accumulator. Under normal conditions, the plate and frame heat exchanger contains low pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nSuction Accumulators\n\n\n\nThe purpose of each suction accumulator is to prevent liquid from entering the compressors. Each suction accumulator receives vapor from the flooded accumulators and separates any residual liquid from the vapor to allow only the vapor to be piped to the suction of each compressor. Liquid in the suction accumulators drains by gravity into the dump traps. Each suction accumulator is equipped with a high level float switch that is wired to shut down the compressors in the event of a high level situation. This prevents liquid ammonia from entering the compressors.

The compressors receive low pressure vapor from the suction accumulators and discharge high pressure vapor to the evaporative condensers. Each compressor has an integral oil separator that receives the high pressure vapor and separates residual oil from the ammonia so that the oil can be returned to the compressor. The compressors are equipped with high discharge pressure cutouts to shut the equipment off if the pressure exceeds the setpoint. Under normal conditions, the compressors contain both high and low pressure vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nEvaporative Condensers\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the evaporative condensers is to reject the heat absorbed in the evaporators and compressors to the atmosphere. The evaporative condensers receive high pressure, superheated vapor from the compressors and supply high pressure liquid to the high pressure receivers or thermosyphon receiver. The condensers use air and water to cool the warm ammonia as it passes through a series of tubes within the condenser. Water is contained in the sump of the condenser, which is then pumped and sprayed over the ammonia coil.

Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \n\n\n\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\n\n\n\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nPrima Wawona has implemented many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, Prima Wawona continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\n\n\n"

      "SummaryText": "By utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Prima Wawona's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Prima Wawona's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\n\n\nPrima Wawona has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Prima Wawona has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\n\n\nFor the future, Prima Wawona now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Prima Wawona employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Prima Wawona will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety.\n\n"
