Under normal conditions the dump traps can contain either high or low pressure liquid and vapor.\n\nCompressors\n\nThe purpose of the compressors is to raise the temperature and pressure of the low pressure gas in order to reject the heat absorbed in the evaporator to the atmosphere. The compressors receive low pressure vapor from the suction accumulators and discharge high pressure vapor to the evaporative condensers. Each compressor has an integral oil separator that receives the high pressure vapor and separates residual oil from the ammonia so that the oil can be returned to the compressor. The compressors are equipped with high discharge pressure cutouts to shut the equipment off if the pressure exceeds the setpoint. Under normal conditions, the compressors contain both high and low pressure vapor ammonia.\n\nEvaporative Condensers\n\nThe purpose of the evaporative condensers is to reject the heat absorbed in the evaporators and compressors to the atmosphere. The evaporative condensers receive high pressure, superheated vapor from the compressors and supply high pressure liquid to the high pressure receivers or thermosyphon receiver. The condensers use air and water to cool the warm ammonia as it passes through a series of tubes within the condenser. Water is contained in the sump of the condenser, which is then pumped and sprayed over the ammonia coil. As the cooling medium of air and water draws the heat from the vapor, the refrigerant condenses into a liquid and flows to the high pressure receivers or thermosyphon receiver. Under normal conditions, the evaporative condensers contain high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\nThermosyphon Receiver\n\nThe purpose of the thermosyphon receiver is to provide a supply of liquid ammonia necessary to cool the oil in the compressors.

Each high pressure receiver receives high pressure liquid from the condensers or thermosyphon vessel and supplies high pressure liquid to each zone of refrigeration and reciruclator. The high pressure receivers are also used to provide storage for ammonia not being used in the process at any given moment. Each high pressure receiver is equipped with a main liquid feed shut-off valve (king valve) that is clearly labeled and can be used to stop the flow of ammonia throughout the system. Under normal conditions, the high pressure receivers contain high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\nFlooded Accumulators\n\nThe purpose of each flooded accumulator is to provide a supply of low pressure liquid ammonia to the evaporators. Each accumulator is equipped with an expansion valve which expands the high pressure liquid into a low temperature and pressure liquid as it enters the vessel. The flooded accumulators supply, by gravity, low pressure liquid to the associated evaporators. Liquid and vapor returned from the evaporators is separated inside the flooded accumulators to allow only the vapor to be returned to the suction accumulators.

The oil pot receives liquid ammonia and oil from the recirculator (pump drum) and vent ammonia vapor back to the recirculator. The oil pot is equipped with an oil drain valve which is used to drain oil from the system as needed. Under normal conditions, the oil pot contains low pressure liquid ammonia, low pressure vapor ammonia, and refrigerant oil.\n\nAir-Cooling Evaporators (Flooded)\n\nThe purpose of the air-cooling evaporators is to remove heat from the air in order to maintain a predetermined space temperature. The air-cooling evaporators receive liquid from the flooded accumulators. The evaporators contain a set of continuous coils through which the low pressure liquid flows. Due to the low pressures and temperatures maintained in the evaporator, the liquid refrigerant absorbs a great deal of heat from the surrounding area and evaporates. To increase the rate of heat removed, the evaporators use an electric fan to move warm air over the coils of cold liquid ammonia. Once the liquid has evaporated to form low temperature and pressure vapor, it returns to the supplying vessel.

The plate and frame heat exchanger receives liquid from a flooded accumulator\u00a0 where it flows through the channels in the plates and absorbs the heat from the glycol solution on the opposite side of each plate. Low pressure liquid and vapor exits the plate and frame heat exchanger and is returned to the flooded accumulator. Under normal conditions, the plate and frame heat exchanger contains low pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\nSuction Accumulators\n\nThe purpose of each suction accumulator is to prevent liquid from entering the compressors. Each suction accumulator receives vapor from the flooded accumulators and separates any residual liquid from the vapor to allow only the vapor to be piped to the suction of each compressor. Liquid in the suction accumulators drains by gravity into the dump traps. Each suction accumulator is equipped with a high level float switch that is wired to shut down the compressors in the event of a high level situation. This prevents liquid ammonia from entering the compressors.
