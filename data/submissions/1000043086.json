As part of this commitment, Hood Container has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at Hood Container and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at Hood Container.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the RMP at Hood Container New Johnsonville.\n\n\n\n1.1  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\n1.1.1  Accidental Release Prevention Policies\n\n\n\nHood Container is committed to the safety of workers and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Hood Container implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operations, and maintenance of processes, and programs to evaluate the hazards at Hood Container.  The basic elements of this program are included in the Hood Container Process Safety Management (PSM) plan. \n\n\n\n1.1.2  Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nIn the event of a significant accidental release of a hazardous substance, Hood Container controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will minimize the effect on the public and the environment.

Response activities involving the off-site migration of hazardous substances have been addressed with the Humphreys County LEPC and a detailed emergency notification plan has been developed and implemented.

As part of this manufacturing process, Hood Container uses anhydrous ammonia in the production of wood pulp from hardwood chips.

The offsite consequence analysis consists of evaluating both a worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario. The main objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which the public might be affected in a certain way because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).  The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance.  As distances from the source are increased, the potential effect from the hazard is reduced.\n\n\n\nWhen considering the release of a toxic substance, most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, "

Beginning in 1992, Hood Container formalized this prevention program for the anhydrous ammonia production processes and storage requirements in order to comply with the 12 elements of the OSHA process safety management (PSM) prevention program.  In 1996, the EPA RMP rule established additional prevention program requirements for potential offsite migration of hazardous chemicals included in the OSHA PSM program.

Hood Container maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operations of the Hood Container processes.  These documents address (1) physical properties of hazardous substances handled at Hood Container (SDS), (2) operating parameters of the equipment at Hood Container, and (3) design basis and configuration of the equipment at Hood Container.  Hood Container ensures that this process safety information is available to all Hood Container employees, the local emergency planning committee (LEPC), local fire departments, and other emergency responders.\n\n\n\nb.  Process Hazard Analysis.  Hood Container performs and periodically updates process hazard analyses (PHAs) of the covered processes to help identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.  A team composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a leader with process hazard analysis experience is assembled to analyze the hazards of the process.  Hood Container primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) technique, supplemented with checklists, to perform this analysis.  The PHA team prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations.  Responsibility to resolve the recommendations is assigned to unit personnel and, when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the process are implemented.\n\n\n\nc.  Operating Procedures.  Hood Container production operators and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safely performed.  The operating procedures (1) are used to train employees and (2) serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.

Hood Container trains workers to safely and effectively perform their assigned tasks. Hood Container training programs include both initial and refresher training that covers (1) a general overview of the process, (2) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process, and (3) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices.  Hood Container has trained a HAZMAT response team to respond to any hazardous release at the Hood Container site. \n\n\n\nTraining requirements are reviewed annually to evaluate the effectiveness and frequency of the training.
