However, should a release occur, plant personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\nDescription of Facility and Regulated Substances Handled:\r\nThe Keystone gas processing plant is located in the Allegheny National Forest two miles east of state highway 2003 on Zimmerman Hill road and then 0.5 miles east on gravel road.  The Plant processes about 6 MMSCFD of natural gas and provides both a service and a product.  The gas is dehydrated and hydrocarbons which might otherwise condense in the transmission pipeline and cause problems are removed, thus producing a saleable gas product.  The hydrocarbons that are recovered are fractionated into propane, butane and natural gasoline products.  Total liquid production is approximately 419 BPD with total propane and butane storage capacity of 2,667 Bbls.  The plant has inlet gas dehydration and utilizes a mixed refrigerant process for hydrocarbon recovery.  The plant contains several regulated flammables such as propane and butane.  No threshold quantity of a regulated toxic is present at the plant site.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention and Chemical-specific steps:\r\nThis facility was built in accordance with the appropriate mechanical and electrical codes for gas processing plants and is subject ot OSHA's PSM program.  Written programs and procedures cover all the key elements of the PSM program and the employees are well trained in the safe operation of the facility.\r\n\r\nChemical-Specific steps include:\r\nThe Keystone Plant includes the following safety features:\r\n1.  Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms;\r\n2.  Process safety relief valves;\r\n3.  Automated plant shutdown.  The plant will automatically shutdown shoul"

Appropriately placed portable fire extinguishers to combat incipient stage fires.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History:\r\nThe Keystone plant has had no accidental releases during the past five years that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site and no offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program:\r\nThe Keystone Plant Emergency Response Plan has been coordinated with the Warren County Control Office.  The plan has been posted at the plant and all employees have been trained in the actions to be taken in event of an emergency.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\r\nNo changes to the safety program or plant facilities are currently planned.  However, weekly safety meetings are held during which incidents are reviewed, safety procedures discussed and changes posted.  Our safety program is constantly improving."
