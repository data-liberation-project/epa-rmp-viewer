A few residences are located to the north.\r\n\r\nSargento Foods is committed to protecting the health and well being of their employees, the environment, and the community. Employee training programs are in place, including ammonia awareness training for all employees,  emergency response training for the response teams and ammonia system training for the maintenance personnel. The facility has a chemical labeling program and a spill prevention plan. Outside contractors must follow written contractor policies. Hot work permits are required. \r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system was designed and installed in accordance with Wisconsin Administrative Code SPS Chapter 343 and ASTM standards. The system is a basic two-stage mechanical refrigeration system utilizing ammonia as the refrigerant. The facility is equipped with alarm and ammonia detection systems, which continually monitor the refrigeration system. Also, Sargento maintenance employees make daily inspections.\r\n\r\nSargento Foods has never had an accident involving the ammonia system that caused deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage or sheltering in place.

The Manitowoc County Local Emergency Planning Committee has developed an offsite plan for the ammonia system and is aware of the procedures in case of a release or emergency situation. The local response teams are invited to visit the facility on a regular basis.  The facility has several Facility Emergency Coordinators on each shift, who have been trained in Emergency Action Plan procedures and in coordination with outside response personnel. Training and maintenance schedules are handled promptly and efficiently through the use of computer software.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia system at Sargento Foods Kiel facility is covered by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Plan (PSM) which requires the facility to manage system operations and develop emergency response and accident prevention programs. Sargento Foods has developed and implemented a PSM program for the Kiel facility. The PSM is audited every three years. The most recent audit was June 23 and 24, 2011. Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) is conducted every five years, or when a major change is made to the ammonia system. The last PHA was conducted on June 19, 2013."
