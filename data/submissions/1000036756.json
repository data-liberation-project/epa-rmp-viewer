The local response teams are invited to visit the facility on a regular basis.  The facility has several Facility Emergency Coordinators on each shift, who have been trained in Emergency Action Plan procedures and in coordination with outside response personnel. Training and maintenance schedules are handled promptly and efficiently through the use of computer software.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia system at Sargento Foods Kiel facility is covered by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Plan (PSM) which requires the facility to manage system operations and develop emergency response and accident prevention programs. Sargento Foods has developed and implemented a PSM program for the Kiel facility. The PSM is audited every three years. The most recent audit was June 23 and 24, 2011. Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) is conducted every five years, or when a major change is made to the ammonia system. The last PHA was conducted on June 19, 2013. "
