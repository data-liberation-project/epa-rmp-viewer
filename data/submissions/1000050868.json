The system provides cooling for production areas, raw materials storage, product storage and chilled water (brine solutions). A central computer system monitors and controls the refrigeration system. The desired temperatures are maintained by controlling the flow of ammonia with manually and electrically operated valves, float switches, circulating pumps, and compressor controls. \r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe RMP/PSM regulations require a review of the accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps used by the facility. Foster Farms has incorporated many safety features in the ammonia refrigeration system to prevent system failures and to mitigate potential releases. \r\n\r\nThe predominant safety concern with closed-loop ammonia systems is an inadvertent buildup of pressure exceeding pressure ratings or capacities of equipment due to ammonia expansion. The Foster Farms ammonia system is continuously monitored by automated control systems that will shutdown components if deviations from normal operating conditions occur. The major pressure vessels in the system are connected to a diffusion panel. Ammonia from the vessels can be mixed with water (neutralized) in diffusion tanks and discharged to the sewer system to prevent over-pressurization of the vessels. Further, all pressure vessels in the system are equipped with pressure relief valves (also connected to the diffusion tanks).\r\n\r\nOther safety features at the facility include the following: \r\n\u00bf\tEmergency shutdown systems\r\n\u00bf\tComponent specific safety shutdowns\r\n\u00bf\tSafeties are tested annually\r\n\u00bf\tPressure relief valves on all vessels, compressors, and several other areas in the system where trapped ammonia could build pressure.\r\n\u00bf\tPressure relief valves are vented to a common header connected to the water d"

Administrative controls include, but are not limited to formal training programs for system operators and mechanics, emergency response training, a hot work permit program, a lockout/tagout program, a contractor safety program, incident investigation program, mechanical integrity program, Management of Change (MOC) program, pre startup safety review program, and a RMP/PSM auditing and inspection program.

The state risk management regulations, also referred to as the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program, are codified in California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19, Section 2735.1, et.

Foster Farms knows of no reportable releases at the facility within the required reporting period.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\nFoster Farms has developed a written Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that identifies emergency personnel responsibilities, procedures, evacuation measures and reporting requirements. The Foster Farms ERP is based on an emergency operations organization in which the Incident Commander serves as the chief officer in emergency situations. The Incident Commander will take charge of the emergency response and response team and direct all operations when an emergency is declared and will remain in charge until the emergency is ended. The ERP addresses ammonia specific issues as required by the RMP/PSM standards, including a determination of incidents that constitute an emergency.\r\n\r\nFoster Farms has developed the ERP to assure compliance with RMP/PSM requirements. The Plant Manager will maintain the ERP. Additionally, a copy of the ERP will be kept with the RMP/PSM documentation and at other appropriate locations. Refer to the ERP, for further information regarding emergency planning and response.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nChanges to improve safety at the facility are ongoing and part of Foster Farms' commitment to continuous improvement.

As such, this document and related attachments and program elements will evolve as Foster Farms continues their ongoing focus and dedication of risk minimization and safety improvement for their employees and surrounding community. Foster Farms will submit revised information if a change occurs that is considered significant and requires resubmission under the regulations. However, minor improvements/modifications to the RMP/PSM, related attachments, and program elements will be incorporated consistent with Foster Farms' internal review practices, and Foster Farms will maintain the most current versions onsite. Thus, the most current version RMP/PSM, related documents, and elements maintained onsite may vary slightly from the information in submittals made to EPA and other regulatory agencies."

The surrounding area consists of residential development and industrial and commercial businesses. The site is bordered by Plano Street to the west, Henderson Avenue to the north, and other industrial businesses to the south and east. The facility is located on the eastern edge of Porterville, thus the area surrounding the facilities consists of a combination of industrial transitioning to rural and sparsely populated rural residential.\r\n\r\nThe facility was originally constructed as a manufacturing site for diapers and related products. Foster Farms purchased the facility in 1998 and converted the facility for processing poultry products. The poultry processing equipment that includes the ammonia refrigeration system was started up during the third quarter of 1999 and the system was expanded in 2005. Production equipment was installed after the storage and processing areas were cooled and prepared to handle the poultry meat/products. Operations at the facility consist of processing, packaging, storage, and shipment of poultry and deli meat products. \r\n\r\nThe facility is surrounded by chain-link fencing and has a secured entrance that is staffed by security personnel 24-hours-per-day, 365-days-per-year.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is used in a refrigeration system at the facility.
