The container storage room can hold up to 26 ton containers. Two containers are connected to the same feed piping manifold at a time. An alternate supply arrangement consists of two additional ton containers connected to a parallel, but normally isolated, feed piping manifold. Chlorine is stored as a liquefied gas under pressure, fed as a liquid to chlorine evaporators, and injected as a vapor at the outlet of the chlorinators into the water stream. The chlorine process is classified as a Program Level 3 process, and we implement a complete accident prevention program.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\n\nWe performed an off-site consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of chlorine from our facility as a regulated toxic substance that could affect the public or the environment. The off-site consequence analysis consisted of evaluating both a worst-case scenario (WCS) and an alternative release scenario (ARS) following identification of the appropriate ARS. We do not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur. An ARS represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility similar to our water treatment plant. ARS\u00bfs can be used to help the Kanawha/Putnam (local) Emergency Planning Committee (KPEPC) improve and prepare an effective community emergency response plan.\n\nWe have submitted release scenario analyses to EPA and have shared that information with KPEPC and other organizations involved in emergency response activities. It is also available to local residents, schools, hospitals, and businesses. For these events, we have emergency mitigation systems that should help reduce the consequences of the events if they occur.

The paragraphs below briefly describe the scenarios we have included in our risk management plan (RMPlan), including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures we have put in place to limit the exposure distances for each scenario.\n\n\t\tWorst-case Release Scenario for Chlorine\n\n\tThe worst case scenario at our water treatment facility involves a failure of a ton \t\tcontainer holding approximately 2000 lbs of liquefied chlorine gas under \t\t\tpressure, resulting in a release with vaporization of the entire contents of the \t\tcontainer. In this scenario, the chlorine is released as a vaporizing liquid inside a \t\tcompletely enclosed chlorine storage room in our water treatment building. The \t\tcontainment provided by the building mitigates the release. Such building \t\t\tconfinement reduces the release rate of chlorine vapor directly to the outdoors. \t\tSince this facility is located in a populated area, the toxic cloud formed by the \t\tevaporating chlorine would reach off-site end points and nearby public receptors.\n\n\tA sump tank is provided with floor drains under the storage room floor to collect \t\tand contain portions of a liquid release that do not immediately vaporize. In \t\treality, the sump could serve to reduce the vaporization rate of chlorine to the \t\tstorage room air, and likewise reduce the rate at which chlorine gas is released \t\tfrom the room directly to the outside air. However, because we based our analysis \ton a very conservative approach, we did not take credit for the sump tank as a \t\tform of mitigation in reducing the endpoint distance reached off-site.\n\n\tNumerous administrative controls are in place to prevent a release of this type and \tshould one occur, to provide for effective emergency response.

A break in a pigtail connecting one of \t\tthe containers to the piping manifold will permit both connected containers to \t\tvent their respective contents (about 2000 lbs each) through the open ends of the \t\tsevered pigtail.

Such building confinement reduces the release rate of \t\tchlorine vapor directly to the outdoors.

During the past 5 years we have not had any releases involving chlorine from the RMP-covered process that had any reportable on-site or off-site effects.  Our facility has instituted procedures that require formal investigation of incidents involving chemical releases, regardless of chemical identity or listing by the EPA RMP rule.

Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, contractors, the public, and the environment during emergency situations. The program consists of procedures for responding to a chlorine release. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including (1) proper first aid and emergency medical treatment for human exposures, (2) facility evacuation plans and accounting for facility personnel after an evacuation, (3) notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and (4) post-incident follow-up requirements.

This coordination includes periodic meetings of the KPEPC, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. We have around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate emergency response organizations (e.g.., contracted chlorine emergency response [HAZMAT] teams, local fire department, police department).

In addition to participating in periodic KPEPC meetings, we conduct periodic walk-around orientation tours of the plant facilities with key representatives of local emergency response organizations. During such tours we discuss and review the source of chlorine at our site, the hazards of a chlorine release, release mitigation features and emergency response actions involving the chlorine system.

Some findings of this type can result in modifications to the process. the prevention program, or administrative controls. The following is a list of improvements that we are planning to implement at the facility during the next 5 years to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\n\n\u00bf\tAn engineering review of the chlorine scrubber system to determine if \t\t\timprovements are feasible that would ensure the system's capability to completely \tremove (neutralize) the entire vapor load from a release of chlorine as we \t\t\tpostulated in our ARS\n\n\u00bf\tAn engineering review of the leak-tightness of each chlorine room to more \t\tprecisely determine the building (containment) mitigation factor, possibly \t\t\tresulting in reduced endpoint distances for WCS and ARS releases of chlorine\n\n\u00bf\tAn assessment of the effectiveness of each element of the Level 3 Prevention \t\tProgram to ensure that the program will achieve its objectives and to strive for \t\tcontinuous program improvement"
