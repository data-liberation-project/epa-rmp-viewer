From the accumulators, low pressure liquid is circulated through evaporator coils. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature and pressure gas which is returned to the accumulator vessels. The suction gas is returned from the accumulators through a suction return line to the main suction accumulator.  From the main suction accumulator, ammonia is piped to the suction inlet on the compressors. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water-cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquefied and returned to the high pressure receiver.\n\n\n\nThe pumped overfeed system operates as follows:  high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped through a series of liquid feed solenoid valves, an expansion valve, and into a liquid recirculator.  From there, low pressure liquid is pumped to each evaporator, where it passes through a solenoid valve, hand expansion valve and into evaporator.  Low temperature liquid circulates through the evapo"

As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature and pressure gas which passes through an isolation valve and is returned to the liquid recirculator.  The residual liquid is separated from the gas in the recirculator and the gas is piped to the suction inlet on the compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas.  The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to a water cooled evaporative condenser where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquefied and returned to the high pressure receiver.\n\nThe system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and pressure relief valves which vent to the atmosphere if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point. \n\n\n\nThere are two ammonia detectors installed inside the refrigeration machinery room. One sensor is set at the California OSHA permissible exposure limit of 25 ppm, which will activate the mechanical ventilation system at a normal rate of 20 air changes per hour and activate an audible alarm and strobe. In addition, the same sensor is set at 1,000 ppm, which will activate the mechanical ventilation system at an emergency rate of 30 air changes per hour and activate an audible alarm and strobe. The second sensor is set at 40,000 ppm, which will shut down all refrigeration machinery inside the refrigeration machinery room and activate an audible alarm and strobe. Also, a sampling system is installed in each refrigerated area that provides two-minute interval monitoring. The sampling system is set at the California OSHA permissible exposure limit of 25 ppm, which will activate an audible alarm and strobe.\n\n\n\nAn emergency control box is installed on each of the refrigeration machinery rooms, which contains three valves.

As such, each refrigeration system at Sun Pacific Maricopa is treated as a single process.\n\n\n\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\n1.3.1 General\n\n \n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nSun Pacific Maricopa has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders.\n\n \n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Sun Pacific Maricopa facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. The ammonia process contains a total charge of approximately 53,000 (LBS). It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep active records of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n\n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nSun Pacific Maricopa has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\n\n\n\nSun Pacific Maric"
