Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR ?5189\n\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR ?1910.119\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Sun Pacific Maricopa has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1 Sun Pacific Maricopa, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Sun Pacific Maricopa has updated their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\n\n\nProcess Name                | Process Chemical               | Process Quantity(lbs.)\n\nCold Storage                  Anhydrous Ammonia                18,000\n\nDegreening                    Anhydrous Ammonia                35,000\n\n\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. \n\n\n\nOverall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses, and physical property damage.\n\n\n\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety"

The facility has an ammonia refrigeration system that provides refrigeration capacity to the following:\n\n(4) Cold Rooms\n\n(5) Precool Rooms\n\n(1) Hallway\n\n(1) Loading Dock\n\n(4) Liquid Recirculators\n\n(45) Degreening Rooms\n\n\n\nThe refrigerated cold storage spaces, hallway, and dock are equipped with air-cooling evaporators and accumulators as required for flooded operation. The degreening rooms are equipped with air-cooling evaporators and  liquid recirculators for a pumped overfeed system.\n\n\n\nMost control valve groups are located on the roof to provide easy access. The refrigeration machinery is contained within or directly adjacent to each of the machinery rooms. A partial list of system components includes:\n\n\n\nDegreening Machinery Room\n\n(5) Screw compressors\n\n(5) Oil separators\n\n(2) High pressure receivers\n\n(1) Liquid recirculator\n\n(1) Oil pot\n\n(2) Ammonia pumps\n\n\n\nDegreening Condenser Area\n\n(3) Evaporative condensers\n\n(1) Diffusion tank\n\n(1) Auto-purger\n\n\n\nDegreening Chiller Area\n\n(1) Plate and frame chiller\n\n(1) Suction accumulator\n\n\n\nRecirculator 2 Room\n\n(1) Liquid recirculator\n\n(1) Oil pot\n\n(2) Ammonia pumps\n\n\n\nRecirculator 3 Room\n\n(1) Liquid recirculator\n\n(1) Oil pot\n\n(2) Ammonia pumps\n\n\n\nRecirculator 4 Room\n\n(1) Liquid recirculator\n\n(1) Oil pot\n\n(2) Ammonia pumps\n\n\n\nDegreening Rooms (45 rooms total)\n\n(45) Air-cooling evaporators \n\n\n\nCold Storage Machinery Room\n\n(3) S"

From the accumulators, low pressure liquid is circulated through evaporator coils. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature and pressure gas which is returned to the accumulator vessels. The suction gas is returned from the accumulators through a suction return line to the main suction accumulator.  From the main suction accumulator, ammonia is piped to the suction inlet on the compressors. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water-cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquefied and returned to the high pressure receiver.\n\n\n\nThe pumped overfeed system operates as follows:  high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped through a series of liquid feed solenoid valves, an expansion valve, and into a liquid recirculator.  From there, low pressure liquid is pumped to each evaporator, where it passes through a solenoid valve, hand expansion valve and into evaporator.  Low temperature liquid circulates through the evapo"

The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to a water cooled evaporative condenser where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquefied and returned to the high pressure receiver.\n\nThe system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and pressure relief valves which vent to the atmosphere if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point. \n\n\n\nThere are two ammonia detectors installed inside the refrigeration machinery room. One sensor is set at the California OSHA permissible exposure limit of 25 ppm, which will activate the mechanical ventilation system at a normal rate of 20 air changes per hour and activate an audible alarm and strobe. In addition, the same sensor is set at 1,000 ppm, which will activate the mechanical ventilation system at an emergency rate of 30 air changes per hour and activate an audible alarm and strobe. The second sensor is set at 40,000 ppm, which will shut down all refrigeration machinery inside the refrigeration machinery room and activate an audible alarm and strobe. Also, a sampling system is installed in each refrigerated area that provides two-minute interval monitoring.

During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nSun Pacific Maricopa has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders.\n\n \n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Sun Pacific Maricopa facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. The ammonia process contains a total charge of approximately 53,000 (LBS). It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep active records of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n\n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nSun Pacific Maricopa has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\n\n\n\nSun Pacific Maric"

A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Sun Pacific Maricopa has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\nFor the future, Sun Pacific Maricopa now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Sun Pacific Maricopa employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Sun Pacific Maricopa will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety."
