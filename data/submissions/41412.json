The Facility Policy:  The owners, management and employees of Farmers Ag Service Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance, and training of all persons that work with the material.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has oriented the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The maximum quantity stored is 84,000 lbs in the facility's one tank.  The capacity of this tank is 18,000 gallons.\n\n3.  The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 84,000 lbs, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards and company procedures.  The distance to endpoint of dispersion based on the model used is 1.0 miles.\n\nThe alternate case release scenario is assumed to be a release from the rupture of a 3 inch transfer hose, with 26,638 pounds released over 2 minutes.  The distance to endpoint of dispersion is .78 miles.\n\n4.  The Accidental Release Program:  Farmers Ag Service Inc. complies with the Rules and Regulations relating to the Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions, Equipment, Containers and Storage Facilities.  These regulations administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture are consistent with ANSI K61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.11 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n5.  The Five Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the pas"

A copy of the November 13, 2003 Incident Report is attached.\n\n6.  The Emergency Response Program:  Farmers Ag Service Inc. has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and provides state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III of EPCRA.  Our emergency response action plan has been reviewed with the local fire department and provided to the local emergency planning committee for coordination in the community response planning.\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety:  Safety improvements are an on-going process at Farmers Ag Service Inc.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementatin at this time."
