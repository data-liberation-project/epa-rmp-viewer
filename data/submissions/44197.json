      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nThe Ash Grove Cement Plant (Ash Grove), located in Foreman, Arkansas, manufactures portland cement in three rotary kilns using the wet process.  Liquid waste-derived fuel (LWDF) is used to supplement coal and natural gas.  LWDF is received from clients who ship the waste to Ash Grove as a method of disposal.  Prior to shipment of any LWDF, each client must submit a waste profile and prequalification sample to Ash Grove.  Clients are required to disclose any 112(r) listed chemicals present in the waste stream.  Ash Grove subsequently quantifies the waste stream to determine the concentration of hazardous chemicals, including the 112(r) listed chemicals, that are present.  Ash Grove accepts, accepts conditionally, or rejects the waste stream based on this information.  Once a waste stream profile is accepted, Ash Grove performs additional testing as the LWDF arrives to ensure that it matches the waste profile and that it can be managed in accordance with the Plant\u00bfs Waste Analysis Plan.\r\n\r\nAsh Grove may receive a shipment of waste that has in excess of one percent of a 112(r) listed chemical.  It is possible that a listed chemical could reach or exceed one percent of a storage tank volume.  In order to plan and prepare for such an occurrence, Ash Grove has developed this Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The Plan includes the 112(r) listed chemicals that have been identified in existing waste profiles in which the concentration equals or exceeds one percent and the total quantity potentially stored exceeds the threshold quantity for that chemical.  Waste profiles submitted or updated in the future will be reviewed for 112(r) listed chemicals.  If listed chemicals not previously included in the RMP are identified; the RMP will be updated to include them before accepting the waste on site.  \r\n\r\nPlant Description\r\nThe Plant is located at 4457 Highway 108, Foreman, Arkansas in a rural area and has been in operation since 1956.

      "SummaryText": "ng population includes commercial and residential properties as well as public access sites.  Highway 108 runs through the northern portion of the property.  A rail line also services the facility.  The plant manufactures over 900,000 tons per year of portland cement.  Limestone is mined on site, crushed, ground, and added to water with other raw materials to form a slurry.  The slurry is fed to kiln numbers 1, 2, and 3 and processed to form portland cement clinker.  The clinker is mixed with a small amount of gypsum and ground to produce portland cement.  Coal is the primary fuel source for heating the rotary kilns.  Natural gas can be used also.  Hazardous waste-derived fuel (HWDF), including LWDF and solid waste-derived fuel (SWDF), and tires are used as supplemental fuels.  The LWDF is pumped from the storage tanks to the kilns through a series of pipes and valves.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies Overview\r\nAsh Grove is committed, at both the corporate and plant level, to reducing the risks of accidental releases and minimizing the impacts if such a release occurs.  This commitment is demonstrated by the following programs and activities:\r\n\r\n* Plant security procedures and equipment, including surveillance and fences.\r\n\r\n* Documented safety inspection schedules and checklists.\r\n\r\n* Design and construction of equipment and structures to prevent releases. \r\n\r\n* A contingency plan to minimize hazards should a release occur.  \r\n\r\n* A well-documented and managed personnel training program to provide workers with tools to meet desired safety goals.\r\n\r\n* Well-documented Standard Operating Procedures to provide consistent, safe guidelines for executing work in a manner that minimizes potential for releases.\r\n\r\nLiquid Waste-derived Fuel (LWDF) System Description\r\nAsh Grove accepts only approved waste shipments based on an initial characterization of the LWDF.

      "SummaryText": ", and LWDF with inadequate heat content are not accepted.  Additional qualitative and quantitative testing is conducted on the waste fuel as shipments are delivered.  LWDF is delivered by both rail car and truck.  The maximum rail car and truck loads are approximately 180,000 pounds and 40,000 pounds, respectively.  The maximum LWDF storage capacity is approximately 350,000 gallons (2,919,000 pounds).  The largest storage vessels on site are two 100,000-gallon tanks (approximately 834,000 pounds each).  There are also six 25,000-gallon storage vessels.  New shipments of LWDF are transferred to the 25,000-gallon tanks and blended.  The contents of the 25,000-gallon tanks are then transferred to one of the 100,000-gallon tanks for further blending and storage prior to being fed to the kilns.  \r\n\r\nAsh Grove tests every shipment of LWDF prior to unloading to ensure it meets all specifications for acceptability in accordance with the Plant\u00bfs Waste Analysis Plan.  LWDF typically consists of a mixture of oil and grease (40-60%), water (10-15%), volatile organic liquids (10-15%), metal oxides (2-5%), and other chemicals.  The heat content is typically in the range of 10,000-14,000 Btu/lb.  The majority of LWDF shipments contain no 112(r) listed toxic chemicals.  Historical records of waste characterization tests show that a very small percentage of shipments contain small amounts of 112(r) listed toxic chemicals. \r\n\r\nToxic Chemicals\r\nAsh Grove conducts Gas Chromatograph/Mass Spectrometer (GCMS) analysis on LWDF prequalification waste stream samples sent by prospective suppliers and on annual requalification of the same waste streams.  If a supplier changes its waste stream during the year, it is required to submit another prequalification sample to Ash Grove for analysis.  The GCMS provides a Relative Area Percent (RAP) measurement for a toxic chemical present in the waste stream sample.  The RAP is the ratio of the toxic chemical to the sum of all organic compounds detecte"

The GCMS does not detect some constituents including water, metals, oxides, and some heavy organics; thus, the RAP overstates the actual percent of a given toxic chemical.  \r\n\r\nIf a 112(r) listed chemical is identified during the prequalification or the requalification, a management decision is made as to whether or not the waste stream will be accepted, accepted conditionally, or rejected.  If waste streams containing 112(r) listed chemicals not previously included in the RMP are accepted, the RMP will be updated to include the new chemicals prior to acceptance on site. \r\n\r\nDuring a review of waste profiles and analytical data from recent years, four different 112(r) regulated toxic substances that may have been received at the Foreman Plant were identified.  These are listed in Table 1.\r\n\r\nTable 1\r\nChemical\r\nCAS Number\r\nChloroform\r\n67-66-3\r\nCrotonaldehyde (E)\r\n123-73-9\r\nVinyl Acetate Monomer\r\n108-05-4\r\nAllyl Alcohol\r\n107-18-6\r\n\r\nEach of the chemicals identified would be delivered as a constituent of a mixture of wastes.  The concentration is typically very low.  No 112(r) listed chemical is received in pure form.  The RMP rule requires that a worst-case release scenario be developed for a release of pure chemical.  The maximum amount of each RMP chemical in the 100,000 gallon tank was calculated using the maximum concentration.  The off-site consequence analyses were conducted for this amount of the identified chemicals as if they were spilled in pure form and the entire amount of the listed chemical was readily available for release.   \r\n\r\nThe Worst-Case Release Scenario\r\nThe worst-case release scenario is based on the calculated loss of the largest, single storage tank at the Plant in accordance with the definition provided in the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidance for RMP development.  In order to present an extremely conservative scenario, it is assumed that the concentration of regulation material in the 100,000-gallon tank equa"

Only passive control systems, namely the secondary containment area and enclosure surrounding the LWDF tank, were taken into consideration as mitigating factors.  A small portion of the enclosure is open; however, the software does not supply an option for partial or mostly enclosed.  The modeling was therefore conducted for the release occurring inside a building.  The conditions of the scenario, including release time and weather conditions are those provided in the EPA Off-Site Consequence Analysis Guidance.  Modeling of the area of potential impact was performed using the EPA RMP*Comp software version 1.07.\r\n\r\nFor modeling purposes, it was assumed that one 100,000-gallon tank ruptures and releases 834,000 pounds of material (LWDF) at the maximum RAP determined for each chemical.  As required by EPA guidance, the release scenario assumes that the quantity of the vessel is spilled instantaneously to form a liquid pool.  In this case, the liquid will collect in a diked area.  The surface area of the actual pool created is used to determine the volatilization rate of the liquid.  The toxic chemical is considered to pose no further risk to the public when it has dissipated to a concentration less than the toxic endpoint specified in the RMP rule.\r\n\r\nThe results of the Off-Site Consequence Analysis are presented in the table below:\r\n\r\nChemical\r\nMaximum\r\n RAP\r\n(%)\r\nDistance to Endpoint\r\n(miles)\r\nNumber of\r\nPersons Affected\r\nCrotonaldehyde, (E)-\r\n3.14\r\n0.4\r\n0\r\nVinyl Acetate Monomer\r\n12.4\r\n0.3\r\n0\r\nChloroform\r\n4.88\r\n0.3\r\n0\r\nAllyl Alcohol\r\n2.45\r\n0.4\r\n0\r\n\r\nIt is emphasized that these results are conservative and unrealistic due to the fact that the chemical of concern is not readily available for release because it is part of a mixture.

Engineered controls, such as chemical detection systems and alarms, are considered in the analysis.  Modeling was again performed using RMP*Comp.  As with the worst-case release scenario, conditions of the alternative release scenario, including release time and weather conditions, are dictated in the EPA Off-Site Consequence Analysis Guidance. \r\n\r\nThe type of system failure selected for the alternative release was the loss of LWDF due to a release from a rail car.  Railroad tracks enter the property from the northwest.  They cross Highway 108 before reaching the LWDF unloading area.  This crossing is equipped with warning lights but has no crossing gates.  In the event of the railcar being hit by an oncoming vehicle, the entire contents of the railcar, up to 180,000 pounds, could be released.

The employee appeared to complete the changeover and began the pump operations.  The pump system is operated on an automatic step increase program to ramp up the pump speed over time until the proper pressure is achieved at the cement kiln burner floor.  After a few minutes, the control room operator radioed the waste fuel facility to let them know that no flow or pressure was observed on the burner floor.\r\n\r\nAfter the radio call, the Waste Fuels Supervisor went to the kiln delivery area to review the operation.  When he arrived both pumps were in operation.  He checked the Moyno reservoir by opening the drain valve and verified the existence of fluid.  He then noticed the hose used to bleed the air from the system was not at the south kiln delivery system.  The hose was located on a job box (tool box) located at the wall in the first truck unloading bay.  No other hose or bleed system was available.  The supervisor retrieved the hose to bleed air from the system.  The supervisor directed the waste fuel handler to check the system and make sure all valves were open while he bled the air from a port located between the two pumps.  The supervisor began bleeding air from the system until fluid began to flow.  He then closed the bleed air valves as a loud rumbling sound and heavy vibration began in the south kiln delivery system.  Just after the sound and vibration began, the Moyno base flange to the reservoir ruptured, throwing the top portion of the unit approximately fifteen feet into the air.  The rupture sprayed an aerosol of Chem-Fuel over the area.
