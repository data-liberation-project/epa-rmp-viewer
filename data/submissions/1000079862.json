Global understands the shared value of safety and environmental protection for our employees, the public and the communities we serve as a vital component of our energy infrastructure.\n\n\n\n(b) The Stationary Source and Substance Handled: \n\nThe Global Erie Blvd Terminal is owned by the Canadian Pacific Railway and operated by Global Companies LLC (Global), headquartered in Waltham, Massachusetts.  At this terminal, railcars and tank trucks of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) are off-loaded into storage tanks within an earthen  mounded tank farm.  LPG is then loaded into tank trucks for off-site delivery. Propane and butane are the Chemical Accident Prevention (CAP) regulated chemicals stored at the terminal which exceed a threshold quantity.\n\n\n\n(c) General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:  \n\nThe Global Erie Boulevard Terminal (terminal) is a secured facility and manned during normal business hours.  The terminal is regulated as a Program Level 3, CAP facility.  General accidental release prevention programs and LPG-specific release prevention steps incorporated for the covered process include the following:\n\n\n\n--The terminal is a fully fenced facility, with remote activated gates to limit entry to authorized personnel only\n\n--Operating procedures have been developed and implemented for operations performed by terminal operators\n\n--The Terminal Manager and Terminal Operators are provided with initial and refresher training in accordance with the National Propane Gas Association Certified Employee Training Program (CETP)\n\n-- The Terminal Manager and Terminal Operators are trained to the emergency response operation"

Terminal Operators are trained to the HAZWOPER Operations level, inclusive of required refresher training. They receive training on the ERAP and participate in an emergency response drill on an annual basis.\n\n\n\nGlobal has also contracted with a private hazardous material response contractor who is available 24-hours per day on an on-call basis.  Global is responsible for coordinating the notifications required to initiate an emergency response. The ERAP provides the essential planning for effectively protecting the public and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n\n\n(f) Planned Changes to Improve Safety: \n\nThe Global Erie Boulevard Terminal completed its most recent Compliance Audit and Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) in the second quarter of 2019. As a result of the audit and PHA, a number of improvements to the risk management program have either been completed or are planned.  The improvements are intended to improve the "
