The RMP includes the preparation of Emergency Response Plans (ERP) that are tailored to the facility and to the emergency response services available in the community.\n\nThe Pepper's Ferry Regional Wastewater Treatment Facility maintains an inventory of up to eight (8) one-ton cylinders of liquified chlorine gas that is stored in the chlorine cylinder room of the chlorination building. This two room building is dedicated to the storage and handling of liquified chlorine gas, and for the injection of gas into a water source so as to provide disinfection to treated effluent from the secondary wastewater treatment process. An off-site analysis of \"Worst Case Release\" evaluating the release of a full one-ton cylinder in ten (10) minutes using EPA's atmospheric dispersion model determines a release exposure radius of 0.9 miles. The area has an estimated population of less than 100 persons (based on house count). Areas effected by the \"Worst Case Release\" include the Radford Army Ammunition Plant staff village and a few houses in the area of the New River and Route 114. The analysis assumes the release of the largest cylinder, in an urban area with a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L in accordance with Emergency Response Guidelines as defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA). This is the exposure level that individuals could experience for one (1) hour without serious health effects or symptoms that could impair the ability to take protective action. Based on the nature of chlorine (3.2 mg/L density), the terrain and population distribution, it is believed that a release would contact less than the projected population, and that the population with potential exposure woul"

The \"Alternative\" analysis showed the area to be effected would be equal to a 581 foot (0.11 Mile) radius, which would extend past the treatment plant site but would not reach any populated area.\n\nThe \"Worst Case\" and \"Alternative\" analysis for the wastewater treatment plant were conducted using EPA models and default conditions appropriate for the area. Using the above noted toxic endpoint concentrations, the models were conducted using stability factor \"F\" and wind speed of 1.5 meters/second for the \"Worst Case\" analysis, and a stability factor of \"D\" and a wind speed of 3 meters/second for the \"Alternative\" analysis. The models used uniform population densities that have been modified where adjustment due to land use is believed to be appropriate.\n\nThe \"Alternative\" analysis considered a leak of 1/4 inch in diameter. Potential leaks with the current vacuum feed system are believed to be those of minor nature involving a cracked valve, leaking/stripped connections, or broken gauge stems. Failures resulting in leaks greater than 1/4 inch in diameter, but less than \"Worst Case\" may be leaks such as blown valves, temperature release plugs, and major cylinder deterioration. These types of leaks are not believed to be very probable. Overall, no reportable leaks (10 pounds or greater) have occurred since the Authority began providing service in 1987.\n\nChlorine gas release potential is mitigated by having full cylinders stored indoors. In addition, the gas handling system is vacuum regulated so that the probable leak (alternative analysis) sources are at the cylinder connection areas. The chlorine system is equipped with leak detection equipment that alarms at the chlorine building as well as the operator control room at the treatment plant.\n\nThe Authority's PSM Plan and RMP are based on several key elements:\n1) Ope"

The Authority depends on local emergency services to repair such leaks and evacuate areas it deems necessary for the protection of life. This course of action pertains to most situations in which the emission of gas cannot readily be stopped by valving and/or capping the gas source to stop the leak."
