We are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner, as demonstrated by the resources we invest to prevent accidents.  As a member of the American Chemistry Council, we adhere to the principles of Responsible Care?.  In addition to ensuring that our employees have the best possible training in the operation of our processes, we demand that safety be the first priority in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our process equipment is designed, constructed and maintained using sound engineering practices and conforms to applicable industry codes and standards including those of the Chlorine Institute for equipment used in manufacturing and handling of chlorine.  \n\nERCO is in compliance with the American Chemistry Council's Responsible Care? Security Code.  A security vulnerability analysis has been conducted and ERCO has implemented comprehensive security procedures and improvements such as perimeter digital video camera system, improved perimeter lighting, and an access control system.  A transportation security plan has also been implemented including necessary training of affected employees.\n\nOur policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  We have implemented maintenance and inspection programs to ensure site integrity.  Examples of some such controls include \n     1) installation of pressure safety valves to prevent rupture of vessels due to over-pressurization, \n     2) routine visual insp"

Mitigation measures that have been included in our design include installation of isolation valves, excess flow valves which limit the amount of chemical released, a fully implemented emergency response plan, appropriate personnel protective equipment, and an alarm system for early notification of a release.  Should a release occur, we use a dispersion model, Systematic Approach For Emergency Response (SAFER), and meteorological data from our weather tower to predict the plume direction and size, downwind ground-level concentrations, and the estimated time at which the plume will reach off-site areas.  This information is communicated to 911 in case any actions need to be taken by emergency response agencies.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nII.

Our hazard assessments focus on preventing injuries to the plant personnel, the community and preventing adverse impacts to the environment.\n\nA hazard and operability analysis (HAZOP) or a What If / Check List is typically used for our process hazard analyses.  A team comprised of personnel with engineering, operations, and maintenance experience systematically examines each hazard in each section of the process and identifies potential causes and a range of possible consequences.  The team then compares the hazard to the existing set of prevention and mitigation measures designed to contain that hazard, making further recommendations when deemed necessary.
