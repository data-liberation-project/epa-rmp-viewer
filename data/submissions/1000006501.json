The Facility Policy:\n\nThe Facility's owner, management, and employees of Gavilon Fertilizer LLC. are \ncommitted to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  Local \nresponders are encouraged to visit the Facility to gain firsthand knowledge of the site. Employees are required to hold monthly safety meetings. Additional training is conducted on various sections of the facilityA?s Process Safety Management plan. The Facility has prepared an internal written emergency action plan which includes ammonia releases.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with local fire departments, and authorities to mitigate any release, and to minimize the impact of a release on the population and environment.\n\nII.   Facility Information:\n\nThe primary activity of the Facility is to manufacture and distribute agricultural fertilizer for the farming industry.    Ammonia is received, stored, and used for production of  liquid fertilizer solutions and is an important source of nitrogen for local agricultural crops.\n \nThe maximum quantity that can be stored in the facilityA?s stationary storage tank is 170,000 pounds. From time to time, the Facility receives ammonia in rail cars to use in the 10-34-0 production process.  It is not a practice to hold the car(s) any longer than is necessary. The more typical method of receiving ammonia is by truck transport containing 40,000 pounds of ammonia. The process is considered a batch process and operates intermittently.\n\nIII.  Accidental Release Prevention:\n   \nThe Facility takes guidance from material published by the American National Standards Institute \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" \nK61.1, and Compressed Gas Association CGA G-2.  The Facility also has a Process \nSafety  Management Program that dovetails with the RMP. It is ManagementA?s practice to minimize the amount "

The Facility is also regulated by State ammonia regulations.\n\nIV. The Five Year Accident History:\n       \nThe facility has had one minor accidental release of ammonia, which included a minor injury, pertaining to the operation, in the past five years.  There have been no deaths or significant property damage at the Facility.  To the best of our knowledge, no off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage has occurred due to the operation of this facility.\n\n\n\n\n\nBibliography / References:\n\nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency  \"Chemical Emergency Preparedness and \nPrevention Advisory  Ammonia\", September 1991 Oswer 91-008.2, Series 8; No.2.\n\nOHSA 40 CFR Part 68 and Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions 29 CFR Part 1910.111\n\nAmerican National Standard Institute, Inc., \"American National Standard Safety \nRequirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\"  (K-61.1) March \n1989\n"
