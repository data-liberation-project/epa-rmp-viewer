Willow Lake WWTP is designed to effectively treat 35 million gallons of wastewater per day and is capable of handling a peak of 105 million gallons per day during the Northwest's wet weather season.  The wastewater is treated and disinfected prior to discharge to the Willamette River.  The disinfection of the wastewater involves the use of chlorine.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations 40 CFR Part 68, require facilities that have regulated substances above the listed threshold quantities to develop a formal Risk Management Program.  EPA also requires these facilities to register and submit a Risk Management Plan to EPA using RMP*Submit  by June 21, 1999.  Willow Lake WWTP maintains quantities of chlorine above the RMP threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds and as such is subject to the requirements of Program 3 in 40 CFR Part 68.\n\nThe elements of the RMP are listed below:\n\nX Hazard Assessment - Assess the potential impacts of worst-case and alternative release scenarios and compile a 5-year accident history.\n\nX Prevention Program - Implement a comprehensive management program that affects a wide variety of operation, training, and maintenance activities.  The requirements of the prevention program are identical to OSHA 1910.119 Process Safety Management Standard which the facility is also subject to.\n\nX Emergency Response - Implement an emergency action program for the covered processes.\n\nX Risk Management Plan - Register and submit an RMP plan that includes an executive summary, RMP data elements, results of the hazard assessment, and summarizes how all other requirements are met.  The RMP is to be submitted to EPA by June 21, 1999.\n\nThe information presented in the next section is intended to describe the elements of Willow Lake WWTP's Risk Management Program.  T"

EPA's RMP*Submit User's Manual was used as a guidance document for explanation of the regulation's intent of how the Executive Summary is to be structured.  \n \nExecutive Summary Data Elements\n\n\nAccording to EPA guidance the executive summary must include a brief descripton of the facilty's Risk Management Program.  The following sections list each of the required executive summary data elements by rule citation.  \n\n68.155(a) Accidental Release and Emergency Response Policies\nWillow Lake Wastewater Treatment Plant has operated their chlorination system without serious incident since its construction in 1963. This successful operating record is due to the City of Salem's commitment to training programs, operating procedures, and maintenance activities.  \n\nIn recognition of the potential hazards associated with chlorine, Willow Lake WWTP has invested its resources in implementing an alternative disinfection process.   The City of Salem is currently designing a liquid sodium hypochlorite disinfection process to replace the chlorine system at Willow Lake WWTP.  The City of Salem is expected to start construction on the sodium hypochlorite system in the year 2000.  Although more expensive to operate, hypochlorite was chosen because of safety concerns with chlorine.  Hypochlorite is not one of the hazardous chemicals listed by EPA.  Once the system is in place and operating satisfactory, the existing chlorine disinfection system will be removed from service.\n\n68.155(b) Stationary Source and the Substance Handled\nAs stated earlier Willow Lake WWTP serves the people of Salem, Keizer, and unincorporated areas of Marion County.

Usually two cylinders are in service delivering chlorine.  The chlorine building houses the chlorinator units.  The chlorine cylinder area is covered but not totally enclosed.  Leak detectors are used to alert facility personnel in the event that a leak occurs. \n\nThe chlorine monitoring system consists of seven strategically placed chlorine leak detectors.  There are four chlorine-detecting probes placed around the chlorine cylinder tanks. One probe is located on each side of the chlorine storage area.  Placement of the leak detectors around the storage area provides coverage not limited by wind direction.   In addition to the storage area, there is a leak detector in the evaporator-chlorinator room.  There are also two chlorine-detecting probes in the reclaimed water pump station.  These are placed on the upper floor and in the basement of the building to detect any possible chlorine leaks in the chlorine piping located in this building.\n\nEach of the chlorine detecting probes is connected to a local and remote alarm system.  The local system consists of a flashing red light and an audible horn.  The remote system is tied into the plant wide computerized DCS alarm system.  Any chlorine leak detection can be monitored for location and strength in parts per million (ppm) from four locations in the plant.  These locations are the administration building, the reclaimed-water pump station, the UNOX control room, or the flotation thickener building.  All of the chlorine leak detectors are operationally checked bi-weekly and calibrated monthly.\n\nThe safe operation of the Willow Lake WWTP is further illustrated by the awards the facility has received.

To ensure a common basis for comparisons the EPA defined the worst-case scenario as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single vessel or process line that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint.  The alternative release rate is a release that is considered more reasonable or more likely.  Active mitigation measures can be used in determining the alternative release scenario while the worst-case scenario is only allowed consideration of passive mitigation measures.\n \nThe toxic endpoint for chlorine has been defined by EPA to be 0.0087 mg/L (3 ppm).  This airborne concentration that is used as the toxic endpoint is the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals can be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects. \n\nThe distance to the toxic endpoint becomes a radius for a circle around the regulated substance.  Residential population within the circle is required to be determined based on available census information.  The population number is reported as part of the EPA submittal.  This method greatly over estimates the population potentially exposed to a single chlorine release, because the chlorine plume would seek lowest elevations in the direction of the wind during a release.  Since wind direction cannot be anticipated for an accidental release, EPA mandated the circle estimation method.\n\nRelease scenarios and distances to toxic endpoints are discussed in more detail in the subsequent paragraphs.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\nWorst-Case Rele"

      "SummaryText": "release scenario that results in an offsite impact.  To achieve this end a liquid release from a one ton cylinder was chosen for the alternative release scenario.  \n\nIn this scenario the flexible hosing on a one ton cylinder is dislodged while the valve is open.  The dislodgment could be caused by a heavy object ramming against the valve/flexible connection, however the impact would have to be at a specific angle to result in the damage theorized.  Due to the construction of the storage area and the cylinders, dislodging the connection is thought to be very unlikely.  The cylinder valve opening is 5/16 inches according to the Handbook of Chlorination and Alternative Disinfectants.    Once dislodged, liquid chlorine under pressure would be released through valve opening.  The liquid chlorine would pool and gaseous chlorine would flash off the liquid surface.\n\nAccording to EPA Guidance document a Flashing Liquid Chlorine Release will have a release rate of:\n\nQuantity Released (QR) = 3,140 x Ah\n\nWhere Ah = the area of the hole \n3,140 = factor applicable to chlorine liquefied under a pressure of 98.5 psig.\n\nAh = p r2 = 3.14 x 0.024 = 0.077 inches square\n\nAn opening of 5/16 equates to a release rate of approximately 241 pounds a minute (actually greater than the worst-case).  Based on Table exhibit 4-12 of The EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants the distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.68 miles in a rural area.  The development in the area of Willow Lake WWTP is predominately agriculture and low buildings.  Areas like this are considered rural setting per the EPA Guidance document.\n \nThe reason the distance is far lower than the worst-case even though the release rate is higher (241 vs. 200 pounds per minute) is due to the meteorological conditions used for the alternative case.\n\nThe residential population within the 0.68-mile radius of influence was determined to be approximately 287.  The population was determined by block group pror"
