This plant has the capability of storing one 55-ton or 90-ton tank car and 10 1-ton cylinders. This cylinders are manifold five 1-ton cylinders per section. Chlorine is used at this facility for disinfection and control of pathogens, and for odor control. Use will vary from 500 lbs.day during the winter to 2000 lbs/day during the summer. Residual Chlorine in the system is neutralized prior to entry into the receiving stream. The neutralizing chemical is Sodium Hydrogen BiSulfite (NaHSO(3)).\n\nSECTION 1 - REGISTRATION INFORMATION - The facility latitude and longitude Section 1.5) was extracted from Kentucky Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Cabinet Division of Water (KNREPC DOW) documents showing this faciliy's actual site discharge point into the receiving stream (Ohio River). Our last inspection recorded in section 1.14 and section 1.15 was a Compliance Sampling Inspection (CSI) conducted by KNREPC DOW on January 12, 1999.\n\nSECTION 2 - TOXICS: WORST CASE - The EPA RMP Model was used. And, information from the CAMEO program provided by Daviess County DES was used. The information presented in sections 2.4 through 2.12 were projections based on experience with this facility. Refer to Daviess County DES/LEPC tab Q-7-16, 031-12-99\n\nSECTION 3 - TOXICS:ALTERNATE RELEASEE - The EPA RMP Model was used. And, information from the CAMEO program provided by Daviess County DES was used. The information presented in sections 2.4 through 2.12 were projections based on experience with this facility.\n\nSECTION 6 - ACCIDENT HISTORY - No reportable accidents have occured within the previous five (5) years.\n\nSECTION 7 - PREVENTION PROGRAM 3 - Safety information concerning this facility is reviewed quarterly.
