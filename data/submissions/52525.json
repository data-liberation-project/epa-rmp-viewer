      "SummaryText": "The following provides a brief summary of the key components of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) Program for the aqueous ammonia storage and handling system at GIM Channelview Cogeneration.\n\nGeneral Description of the Facility and Regulated Substance\n\nGIM Channelview is located in Channelview, Texas in an industrial setting entirely within the property boundary of the Equistar Chemical Channelview Complex.  The facility is an electric cogenerating station consisting of four 170-MW, combines ?cycle, natural gas-fired turbines couple to a single steam turbine for electricity generation and steam production.  A duct burner/Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) and a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR_ system are associated with each of the gas turbines.  The SCRS employ aqueous ammonia injection technology to control emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx_.  Aqueous ammonia is classified as a toxic chemical subject to the requirements of the RMP Program.  The aqueous ammonia used in these SCR systems is a 29/7% solution of ammonia in water.\n\nThe ammonia storage and handling system at GIM Channelview is comprised of two storage tanks, transfer pumps, and piping which terminate at the evaporator for each unit where the aqueous ammonia is atomized and vaporized.  The tanks have a capacity of 30,000 gallons each.  The tanks are equipped with pressure relief valves, as well as temperature, pressure, and level indicators.  There are ammonia detectors located on each tanks and on the ammonia transfer pump skids.\n\nAll other regulated substances onsite are below applicable thresholds for RMP.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis (OCA_ prepared in support of the RMP utilized the methodologies recommended by EPA and employed in the RMP*Comp, Version 1.06 modeling system.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario (WCS) considered the catastrophic rupture of one of the aqueous ammonia storage tanks, in which the entire contents of one tank, is released within the secondary containment dike.

      "SummaryText": "condary containment dike is large enough to contain the entire volume and limits the exposed surface area of a pool, which reduces the release rate.  Under worst-case meteorological conditions of 1.5 m/s wind speed and atmospheric stability class F (stable atmosphere), the resulting ammonia cloud could travel 0.2. miles before dispersing sufficiently to no longer pose a health hazard to the public.  The worst-case impact distance extends offsite of the GIM Channelview facility but does not exceed beyond the property boundaries of the Equistar Chemical facility.  The WCS does not impact any offsite residences, institutions (e.g. schools, hospitals, parks, or recreational areas).\n\nSeveral alternative release scenarios (ARSs) were considered including releases due to a failed delivery hose, a failed pipe between the ammonia transfer pumps and an ammonia flow control unit (AFCU), a failed pipe between an AFCU and an evaporator, and a corrosion-caused hole in piping.  The release due to a failed delivery hose resulted in the farthest impact distance (0.1 miles) and is the ARS presented in this RMP.  The impact due to the ARS extends offsite of the GIM Channelview facility but does not exceed beyond the property of the Equistar Chemical facility.  The ARS does not impact any offsite residences, institutions (e.g. schools, hospitals, parks, or recreational areas).\n\nThere are two major water-monitors located near the aqueous ammonia storage tanks, which could serve as active mitigation to know down an ammonia plume in the event of a release.  The effect of this mitigation measure was not included in the ARS analyses as conservative approach, since the water monitors would be manually activated.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nIN November 2005, a very small amount of ammonia was spilled inside the containment area during a truck unloading operation.  The spill was caused by a weak area of the transfer hose that failed during unloading.  The ammonia vendor has since modified its"

There were no injuries or property damage as a result of the incident.\n\nSummary of Prevention Program 2\n\nGIM Channelview is covered by an accidental release prevention program, which includes the following:\n\n?    Periodic hazard review and updates\n?    Periodic audits of the system and its operation\n?    Emergency response plan coordinated with local responding agencies\n\nThe aqueous ammonia storage and handling system prevention program includes the following components:\n\n?    Comprehensive plan covering all components of the aqueous ammonia system with respect to operation, maintenance, inspection, and training\n?    Internal compliance audits\n?    Incident investigation\n\nSummary of the Emergency Response Program\n\nGIM Channelview has arranged for Equistar Chemical Channelview Complex to be the first responders in case of an emergency.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nA hazard review of the aqueous ammonia storage and handling system at GIM Channelview was conducts as part of this RMP.  There are no planned changes to the system at this time."
