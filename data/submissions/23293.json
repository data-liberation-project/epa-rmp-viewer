Aqua Ammonia Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios  \nThe worst-case release scenario is failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would release 547,200 pounds of solution ammonia (containing 109,990 pounds ammonia based on a 20% active ingredient) into the containment area.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 4.7 miles.  The alternative release scenario, based on the PHA scenarios (or the most likely potential incident) is a release of 10,000 pounds of solution ammonia (containing 2,000 pounds ammonia based on a 20% active ingredient) from a storage tank modeled with an increased wind speed and D Stability modeling parameters.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.3 miles.\n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia and Aqua Ammonia:  The Facility has implemented the provisions of the Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc.; California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Subchapter 1, Unfired Pressure Vessel Safety Orders; and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\n5.  Five-year Accident History\n\na. There have been no accidental releases or near misses of anhydrous ammonia or aqua ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n1.  Have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\n2.  Have resulted in off"

Facility Accidental Release Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Butte County Rice Growers Association, Richvale facility (herein referred to as the Facility) at 1121 Richvale Highway, Richvale, California, 95974 are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the Facility is the storage, blending, and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for use in the production of aqua ammonia which is used in mixed grade fertilizers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received by truck and stored in one 100-ton and one 30-ton storage tank (bullets) at the site.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled in this process is 221,000 pounds.\n\nAqua ammonia (20% of ammonia by weight) is produced at the site using an aqua ammonia convertor and stored in four 72,000 gallon, two 56,000 gallon and one 40,000 gallon above ground tanks at the site. The storage tanks are located within a secondary containment structure.  The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia handled is 3,344,000 pounds.  The total quantity of ammonia present in the aqua ammonia, based on 20% active ingredient by weight, is 668,800 pounds.  \n\n3.  The Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\na.  Anhydrous Ammonia Alternative Release Scenarios  \nThe first alternative release scenario is failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would release 170,000 pounds of anhydrou"
