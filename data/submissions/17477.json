RP-1 also houses Tertiary Plant 1\n(TP-1). RP-1 (and the adjacent TP-I) is located in Ontario, California near the intersection of\nCalifornia Route 60 and Archibald Avenue and occupies approximately 66.06 acres of land divided by the Cucamonga Creek Drainage Channel. RP-1 occupies the northwestern portion of the property while TP-I occupies the southeastern portion of the property. The Agency also operates two other stationary sources subject to the federal RMP/CalARP regulations. Separate RMPs have been submitted for those facilities.\n\nThe purpose of this document is to comply with the risk management planning requirements as set forth in Section 25535(d) of Article 2 of Chapter 6.95 of the California Health and Safety\nCode (also known as the California Accidental Release Prevention Program - CalARP) and Part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (40CFR Part 68), also known as the federal Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs or the federal RMP.\n\n\nThe scope of the RMP includes all operations conducted at the RP-1 facility which involve the storage, handling and/or use of chlorine and methane (which is contained in digester gas). Chlorine and methane (which is contained in digester gas) are the only regulated substances which are handled at the facility above the threshold quantity.\n\nES 1.0 DESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED \n\nSince its inception, the Inland Empire Utilities Agency has evolved with the growth and needs of the western portion of San Bernardino County.

The primary operation conducted at RP-I is wastewater treatment. As a part of this process, chlorine is utilized for water disinfection and digester gas (which contains methane) is generated in the anaerobic digesters (anaerobic digesters are operated in the absence of oxygen).\nCurrently, the plant treats approximately 44 million gallons of wastewater per day. Provided below, is a brief description of the primary operations conducted at the facility and a description of the storage, handling and use of chlorine and digester gas.\n\nPRIMARY OPERATIONS\n\nFigure ES-I provides a simplified process flow diagram for the wastewater treatment process at RP-I. As shown, raw sewage is passed through screening and grit removal units, primary clarifiers, aeration basins, secondary clarifiers, chemical addition, tertiary filters, chlorination and dechlorination units and then discharged. The plant effluent is utilized for irrigation of the Whispering Lakes Golf Course and Westwind Park in the City of Ontario and to supply water to the Prado Regional Park Lake in southwestern San Bernardino County. In addition, plant effluent is discharged to the Cucamonga Creek Flood Control Channel and onto the Santa Ana River.\n\nRP-I contains three aeration basins, seven anaerobic digesters, twelve primary clarifiers, one trickling filter, six secondary clarifiers, and a maximum of two one ton containers of chlorine.  The adjacent TP-I contains three flow equalization basins, the tertiary filters, a pump station, and two bulk chlorine storage tanks.\n\n\nSTORAGE, HANDLING AND USE OF CHLORINE\nTP-I Chlorination Process Description\n\nAt TP-I chlorine is utilized to disinfect cleaned/treated water prior to discharging (this is also known as final disinfection of the effluent).

Liquid chlorine is then withdrawn from the storage tanks and transferred to the evaporators under pressure exerted by the contents of the storage tanks. The evaporators provide the heat necessary to vaporize chlorine (the evaporators are heat exchangers which circulate hot water through a jacket around the chlorine evaporation chamber). The chlorine gas\ngenerated by the evaporators is transferred to the chlorinators under a vacuum and injected into water (now referred to as chlorine solution). The vacuum from the evaporators to the injection point is maintained by the ejectors. As a result of having chlorine injected into it, the water contains elevated levels of diluted chlorine. This chlorine solution is then transferred via underground piping to the two end use points where it is mixed with the water to be disinfected.\nThe entire process (i.e., the bulk storage tanks, the evaporators, the chlorinators and the ejectors) is located within a separate dedicated building designed specifically for the purpose of housing this system.\n\nEmergency Chlorine Scrubber at TP-I\n\nThe Agency has installed an emergency chlorine scrubber.

The unit has the capacity to scrub up to 2000 pounds of chlorine and is activated via either automatic leak detectors (i.e., chlorine sensors located within the building) or a manual remote start switch.\n\nRP-I Chlorination Process Description\n\nAt RP-I, the quality of water is monitored via sampling of the process. Chlorine is periodically utilized (on an as-needed basis depending upon the results of the water sampling) to control the growth of organisms in the activated sludge process and to control sludge settling in the gravity thickener, and to reduce/control odor in the plant influent flow. Chlorine is a regulated substance subject to the federal RMP requirements. The RP-I chlorination process consists of four main components:\n\n7 Two one-ton containers of chlorine;\n\n7 One evaporator for converting liquid chlorine to a gaseous state;\n\n7 One chlorinator and five ejectors to control the injection of chlorine and maintain a vacuum on the gaseous chlorine system; and\n\n7 System piping.\n\nOne ton containers containing liquid chlorine are delivered to the facility via truck and stored.\nLiquid chlorine is then withdrawn from the containers and transferred to the evaporators under pressure.

Anaerobic digestion is accomplished by retaining the sludge in the absence of oxygen within the large, airtight digestion tanks for a period of 20 to 25 days. Within these tanks, microorganisms digest the sludge and convert the solids into cells and continuously produces gaseous byproducts. These gaseous byproducts are known as digester gas and contain methane,\ncarbon dioxide and other gases. Methane is a regulated substance subject to the federal RMP requirements. The gas rises to the top of each digester and is collected for recirculation to the digester (to provide mixing). In addition, digester gas is utilized to power onsite cogenerators and provide an average of 675,000 kilowatt hours of electricity each month. This significantly reduces the cost of purchasing electrical power from Southern California Edison. . Excess gas is collected and burned in the waste gas burner (i.e., flare).\n\nES 2.0 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe RMP regulations require that at least two types of release scenarios be evaluated for their\npotential to impact off-site populations:\n\n7 the worst case release; and\n\n7 an alternative release (that is more credible).\n\nA number of hypothetical accidental release scenarios were postulated and evaluated for the\nRMP. These scenarios were categorized into worst-case release scenarios and alternative release\nscenarios. Each of these categories of hypothetical accidental release scenarios is discussed\nbelow.\n\nCHLORINE\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nIn this scenario, one of the two bulk chlorine storage tanks on site experiences a catastrophic failure due to an unknown external event.

It is highly improbable that this scenario would be initiated by a seismic event.\nThe chlorine building has been constructed to the required Uniform Building Code and Uniform Fire Code specifications. However, the possibility of this scenario being initiated by a seismic event can not be completely discarded. This scenario is considered to be extremely unlikely. In the highly unlikely case that this scenario occurs, approximately 50,000-pounds of chlorine would be released. The release of chlorine could occur outdoors or indoors.\n\nThe release of the chlorine within the chlorine building would result in the chlorine sensors detecting the chlorine and activating the emergency scrubber exhaust fan. This would result in the \"sucking up\" of chlorine vapors from the building and being routed to the emergency chlorine scrubber. The emergency chlorine scrubber was designed for the purpose of mitigating the effects\nof accidental releases of chlorine.\n\nAlthough the emergency chlorine scrubber was installed by the Agency for the specific purpose of mitigating the potential off-site consequences of accidental chlorine releases (such as those described above), the presence of the chlorine scrubber system was not taken into account in evaluating the off-site consequences. Rather, it was assumed that the chlorine released during the\ncatastrophic accident was released outdoors forming a cloud of chlorine vapor. The resulting vapor cloud was assumed to freely migrate off-site. Utilizing the methodology specified by USEPA, the estimated vulnerable zone for this accidental release scenario is approximately 7.0-miles.\n\nFigure ES-2A presents a graphical representation of the vulnerable zones for the worst-case release scenario for accidental releases involving chlorine.

These scenarios include situations such as delivery of a leaking one-ton container of chlorine to the facility, a pinhole leak in the chlorine transfer piping and a partial or complete failure of the\nliquid or vapor chlorine transfer lines at various points in the system (either in-doors or out-doors). In order to be conservative in the estimation of the vulnerable zone, it was assumed that 1000-pounds of chlorine was released during an accident involving the complete failure of a liquid transfer line from either the bulk storage tanks or the one ton containers. It was further assumed that the material was released directly outdoors. Since the release can occur out-doors i.e., outside of the chlorine storage building) the presence of the chlorine scrubber system was not taken into account in evaluating the off-site consequences. Utilizing this assumption is much more conservative in nature and resulted in the estimation of the largest vulnerable zone for these types of accident scenarios.

However, as a measure to improve safety, the Agency is currently developing a specific response\nprogram for emergencies involving chlorine and methane.\n\nThe Agency is planning to conduct a joint emergency response drill with the San Bernardino County Interagency Hazardous Materials Response Team. This will ensure that key agencies which could be involved in emergency response at the Agency are familiar with the facility operations and hazards and are also familiar with the capabilities of Agency personnel (from an emergency response view point).
