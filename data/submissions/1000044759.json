Purity Dairy is required to maintain low temperatures, which are within standards required by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), in the food processing areas of the plant. Purity Dairy uses anhydrous ammonia (the 112(r) regulated substance) as a refrigerant to maintain the process and facility within the required range of operating temperatures. Purity\u00bfs refrigeration system, consisting of receivers, compressors, evaporators, condensers, and piping in two systems contains a total inventory of 37,195 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The larger of the two systems contains 18,193 pounds of anhydrous ammonia as of June 29, 2012.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is designed and constructed in accordance with ANSI/IIAR 2-1992 Standard for Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigerating Systems.  To prevent and mitigate accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia, Purity has implemented several precautionary measures.  \r\n\r\nPurity has implemented OSHA\u00bfs PSM program and as such, has evaluated and engineered against anhydrous ammonia releases.  Some of the controls installed to prevent catastrophic releases of ammonia are: process equipment (vents, pressure relief valves, backup pumps, and manual shutoffs) and automated controls (automatic shut-offs, and electrical distribution system grounding).  In addition, Nashville Fire Department HazMat team responds to any ammonia release at the facility.  Seven (7) Purity personnel are trained to respond to potential ammonia releases (HazMat).\r\n\r\nPurity has developed standard operating procedures, which incorporate safety measures into the procedures, for all employees and contractors who have contact with the ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety procedures were developed by Piedmont Corporation and are reviewed on an annual basis.  Purity encourages employee participation in development of the control measures used at the plant by means of com"
