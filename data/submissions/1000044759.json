(Purity Dairy) submits this Risk Management Plan (RMP) for operations at its Nashville, TN facility.  \n\n\n\nPurity's operations include storing frozen foods, dairy products, and distribution.  Purity has been in operation at this facility for over 40 years, providing quality dairy products and over 500 jobs to the local community.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\n\n\nIn this facility, we use Anhydrous Ammonia, which is considered hazardous by the EPA.  This chemical must be used to provide cooling for the process and surrounding areas.  It is our policy to have programs in place dealing with safety precautions for handling these substances and to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own health, as well as to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ammonia, combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, as well as the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\n\n\nPurity Dairy is committed to protecting the health of its employees, the surrounding community, and the environment; therefore, it is Purity Dairy?s policy to maintain compliance with 40 CFR 68 as well as Occupational Safety and Health Organization (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations promulgated as Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations Chapter 1910, Section 119 (29 CFR 1910.119), and OSHA?s Hazardous Operations and Emergency Response regulations (29 CFR 1910.120). \n\n\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nPurity Dairy  is subject to 112(r) because ammonia, a regulated substance, is present at the facility in amounts greater than 10,000 pou"

      "SummaryText": "nds.  Purity Dairy is required to maintain low temperatures, which are within standards required by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), in the food processing areas of the plant. Purity Dairy uses anhydrous ammonia (the 112(r) regulated substance) as a refrigerant to maintain the process and facility within the required range of operating temperatures. Purity?s refrigeration system, consisting of receivers, compressors, evaporators, condensers, and piping in two systems contains a total inventory of 37,195 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The larger of the two systems contains 18,193 pounds of anhydrous ammonia as of June 29, 2012.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is designed and constructed in accordance with ANSI/IIAR 2-1992 Standard for Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigerating Systems.  To prevent and mitigate accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia, Purity has implemented several precautionary measures.  \n\n\n\nPurity has implemented OSHA?s PSM program and as such, has evaluated and engineered against anhydrous ammonia releases.  Some of the controls installed to prevent catastrophic releases of ammonia are: process equipment (vents, pressure relief valves, backup pumps, and manual shutoffs) and automated controls (automatic shut-offs, and electrical distribution system grounding).  In addition, Nashville Fire Department HazMat team responds to any ammonia release at the facility.  Seven (7) Purity personnel are trained to respond to potential ammonia releases (HazMat).\n\n\n\nPurity has developed standard operating procedures, which incorporate safety measures into the procedures, for all employees and contractors who have contact with the ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety procedures were developed by Piedmont Corporation and are reviewed on an annual basis.  Purity encourages employee participation in development of the control measures used at the plant by means of com"

Any changes to the operating procedures are communicated to affected employees by following written management of change procedures established by Purity.\n\n\n\nPurity understands that maintaining the refrigeration system in good working order is essential to preventing accidental releases; therefore, Purity has implemented a preventative maintenance program.  The preventative maintenance program is scheduled, documented and managed using computer maintenance management and manual checklists with the MP2 Manager (currently Richard Dutton) to ensure that regular maintenance occurs on the system\n\n\n\nTo ensure that Purity's control measures are effective in maintaining the safe operation of the plant, regularly scheduled audits are performed on the ammonia refrigeration system:\n\n\n\nIn accordance with the PSM program, Purity conducts detailed PSM compliance audits every three years that incorporate review of process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training programs, system mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-start up review procedures, compliance audit procedures, incident investigation procedures, employee participation programs, hot work permit procedures, and contractor safety procedures. \n\n\n\nIn addition, Purity is audited by the AIB on an annual basis.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nOver the last five years, Purity has experienced one incidental release of ammonia on November 27, 2013.  No injuries or evacuations resulted from this event.  \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program \n\n    \n\nPurity has a written emergenchy response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.
