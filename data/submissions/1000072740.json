      "SummaryText": "Sargento Foods, Inc., in Kiel, Wisconsin is a dairy processing plant with modern capabilities. The facility was constructed in 1993, with several building additions completed since then. The facility occupies about 373,000 square feet, and is situated on a 40-acre parcel of land. The property is located in a predominantly rural area, on the northern outskirts of the City of Kiel. Adjacent properties to the northwest, north, northeast, east, and southeast are farmland or undeveloped land. Commercial-type properties are located to the south, southwest, and west. Residential properties are located to the southwest beyond the commercial properties. A few residences are located to the north.\n\n\n\nSargento Foods is committed to protecting the health and well being of their employees, the environment, and the community. Employee training programs are in place, including ammonia awareness training for all employees. The emergency response teams participate in regularly scheduled response training and ammonia refrigeration maintenance personnel are trained for operation of the ammonia system. The facility has a chemical labeling program and a spill prevention plan. Outside contractors must follow written contractor policies. Hot work permits are required. \n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system was designed and installed in accordance with Wisconsin Administrative Code Chapter COMM 45 (replaced by Chapter SPS 345 - Mechanical Refrigeration Systems in December 2011) and with ASHRAE and IIAR standards.  The system is a basic two-stage mechanical refrigeration system utilizing ammonia as the refrigerant. The inventory of ammonia within the refrigeration system at any time is greater than 10,000 pounds. A current ammonia inventory is available in the PSM Plan - Process Safety Information Chapter. The facility is equipped with alarm and ammonia detection systems, which continually monitor the refrigeration system. Also, Sargento maintenance employees perform system \"walk-throughs\" and"

      "SummaryText": " check operating conditions on each working day. \n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario used for this stationary source is the release of the total quantity of ammonia contained within the largest vessel of the refrigeration system, as mandated in EPA's Appendix E: Supplemental Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Facilities. The release quantity, 10,000 pounds, is the amount the vessel can hold at the maximum allowable fill level of 80%, and is assumed to be completely released from the vessel over a period of 10 minutes. The wind speed is assumed to be 1.5 meters per second with an F stability class. The toxic endpoint for ammonia is 200 ppm. In the unlikely event of a release of 10,000 pounds of ammonia, considering the passive mitigation effects of the building, the distance to the toxic end point could be up to 0.72 miles. \n\n\n\nSeveral additional release scenarios were evaluated for this ammonia system. These alternate scenarios represent conditions which are more likely to occur that the worst case scenario. The scenario resulting in the greatest offsite impact is the damage to a high pressure liquid pipe on the roof, causing ammonia to release under pressure. The release could have a toxic endpoint distance up to 0.2 miles. \n\n\n\nIf an emergency were to occur, the local fire and hazardous response team would be notified and the emergency response procedures would be followed. Sargento Foods - Kiel also has retained Bassett Mechanical (Kaukauna, Wisconsin) to respond to a release or emergency situation. The facility has an Emergency Action Plan, and employees have been trained how to use the plan. Emergency drills covering various types of emergencies are carried out several times each year. Sargento strives to have at least one drill each year that involves an ammonia-related emergency. The local response teams are invited to visit the facility on a regular basis. The facility has an Emergency Response Team who have been trained in Emergency Action Pl"

Sargento Foods has developed and implemented a PSM program for the Kiel facility. The PSM is audited every three years. Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) is conducted every five years, or when a major change is made to the ammonia system. \n\n\n\nIn the past five years, Sargento Foods-Kiel has had no accidental releases that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site. In the past five years, there have been no accidental releases that resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. \n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety include implementation of a web-based PSM/RMP software management tool to facilitate comprehensive, centralized management of all PSM/RMP elements and tracking capabilities. Other projects to improve safety include the review and upgrade of the ammonia refrigeration detection system and modifications to the low-temperature recirulator package to provide greater surge capacity and reduce compressor cycling. \n\n\n\n"
