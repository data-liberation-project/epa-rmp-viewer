While some accidents may occur, we take great pride in our safety record and make every effort to ensure that they will be small and as infrequent as possible.\r\n\r\nFuture plans for the on-going Risk Management program include routine preventative maintenance of mechanical refrigeration systems. We also intend to continuously focus on employee development and training specific to safe operation of plant equipment, emergency response and employee evacuation.\r\n\r\nB.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThis facility operates two ammonia refrigeration systems to provide cooling and freezing capabilities.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in the refrigeration systems is documneted in the Gulf Coast PSM Program. Since ammonia releases from these systems could pose a risk of offsite public and environmental impact, and is regulated under the OSHA PSM Standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the system is subject to Program 3 requirements of the EPA's RMP program. \r\n\r\nThe closed loop ammonia refrigeration system at the facility provides (2) major suction pressures (temperatures) for use in the preservation of perishable food products. Through the use of multiple stages (2) of compression the refrigeration system provides room temperatures of 0-35F. with the use of low suction booster compressors and provides temperatures of -20F. And -35F. \r\n\r\nThe higher pressure portions of the system include the condenser, located on the roof, along with refrigerant vent lines where any leaks can dissipate to the air, joining ammonia produced by lightning where it can be consumed as it goes through a natural biodegrading process.  Normal safeties include: high pressure cut-outs, relief valves, and ventilating systems for machinery room areas.\r\n\r\n\r\nC.  Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe prevention program (OSHA Process Safety Management CFR 1910.119) consists of the following ele"

The facility is included in the community Emergency Response Program coordinated by the LEPC for Jackson County.\r\n\r\nF.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nGulf Coast Cold Storage currently has no changes planned for the facility ammonia refrigeration processes at this time.   However, the processes will be subjected to periodic process hazard analysis reviews for the purpose of identifying potential hazards and implementing the necessary improvement to provide a safer system. Gulf Coast personnel will also periodically review all potential opportunities to improve the safety of our personnel, the surrounding community, and the ammonia refrigeration process through required compliance audits and management of change procedures."

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\r\n\r\nA. Describe Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\r\n\r\nGulf Coast Cold Storage is a cold storage facility and logistics service organization located in Pascagoula, MS. The facilities primary business is the short and long term storage of food products and stevedoring operations.\r\n\r\nThe refrigeration process used to maintain freezer temperatures utilizes anhydrous ammonia (R717) as the refrigerant. Anhydrous ammonia is widely used as refrigerant in many industrial facilities, including, meat, poultry, and fish processing facilities; and cold storage warehouses. The refrigerant serving as the heat transfer fluid is circulated thru a closed loop system.\r\n\r\nGulf Coast Cold Storage is committed to operating cold storage facilities under conditions that are safe to employees, contractors, tenants, and the surrounding community. The senior management is committed to this cause. As a result, the Safety Policy will be considered on an equal basis with productivity, efficiency, quality improvement, environmental issues and other policies developed by the Group. \r\n\r\nThe core of the facilities overall approach to safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system focuses a hazard assessment program, employee and contractor training, an ongoing preventative maintenance program, and an emergency response program. We use a variety of safety equipment and strict procedures to prevent releases and to reduce the impact of releases should they ever occur. Some examples include:\r\n\r\n* Regular and Routine Process Hazard Analysis.\r\n* Regular checklist audits of safety programs and records.\r\n* Emergency release training with employees and the local fire department.\r\n* Plant security: locks, lights, alarms, and warning signs.\r\n* Investigation of all incidents to improve our procedures.\r\n* Annual review and certification of standard operating procedures.\r\n\r\nThe EPA requires all companies to report the release of hazardous materials.
