The Honeywell Kingman Facility's storage and use of ethylene oxide exceeds the specified threshold of 10,000 lbs., as defined by the EPA's RMP Rule. Ethylene Oxide is identified as a toxic chemical with a toxic endpoint of 0.09 mg/L as defined by the EPA.s RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.

The facility currently has 4 employees.  \n\n\n\nAt the Kingman facility chlorotetrafluoroethane (Refrigerant-124) is mixed with ethylene oxide to make Oxyfume 2000, and chlorotetrafluoroethane (Refrigerant 124) and chlorodifluoromethane (Refrigerant 22) are mixed with EO to make Oxyfume 2002.  Oxyfume 2000 is used primarily by medical device manufacturers to sterilize medical devices such as sutures and lens implants prior to shipment to hospitals and doctor?s offices.  Oxyfume 2002 is used primarily by hospitals to sterilize reusable heat sensitive devices such as various types of scopes used for arthoscopic surgery.\n\n\n\nThe only chemical in the Kingman facility that requires the facility to participate in EPA's Risk Management Program is EO.  At the Kingman facility, EO is stored in the same rail car in which it is shipped.  The car is surrounded by a water deluge system for fire protection and to suppress vapors in the unlikely event a leak should occur.  The EO car is only connected to the EO distribution piping when a transfer is being made to a blend tank.  At all other times the car is disconnected and sealed.  Transfers occur on an average of twice per month and take about 4 hours.\n\n\n\n3.    General accidental release prevention program and chemical specific accident prevention program\n\n\n\nThe Kingman facility has a comprehensive general accidental release prevention program.

Recommendations from these reviews have been studied and implemented as appropriate.  Safeguards include the following engineering controls:\n\n\n\n1)    EO is shipped to the facility in two specially designed and constructed railcars.  These cars exceed DOT standards for the transport of EO and are only used to transport EO to the Kingman facility.  In order to minimize the amount of EO in the facility, only one car is present at the site at a time, and the cars hold a maximum of 75,000 pounds.  \n\n\n\n2)    The only storage of pure EO that occurs at the Kingman facility is in the railcar in which the EO was shipped to the facility.  The EO car is only connected to the facility's EO distribution system while a transfer to a blend tank is occurring.  At all other times, the car is disconnected and sealed.  By following this procedure, the facility minimizes the risk of contamination of the railcar and reduces the potential for leaks in the transfer piping.\n\n\n\n3)    The EO car is positioned under a water deluge system at all times while on the facility.

The deluge is activated by fire on the car, high EO concentration above the car (see No. 4) or by manual activation.\n\n\n\nWater from the rail car deluge system falls into a collection pan.  The collection pan drains underground to a below ground lined collection basin.\n\n\n\n4)    When the EO car is positioned under the water deluge system, there is an EO detection point immediately above the dome of the car.  There is also a detection point next to the EO transfer pump.  These detectors are set to activate a local alarm at 15 ppm EO.  The facility's off site security company receives an alarm at 30 ppm EO so that it can notify plant personnel 24 hours a day.  The detector on top of the railcar is set to turn on the water deluge at .7% EO to suppress escaping vapor and prevent ignition.  Early awareness of small EO leaks helps the facility take the appropriate action to prevent a release that would impact off site population.\n\n\n\n5)    The hose used to transfer liquid EO from the EO railcar to the distribution system is a double walled hose.  If the inner hose fails, the EO is trapped inside the outer hose and does not escape.  The annular space between the hoses is checked for pressure each time the car is connected.  The annular space is checked for trace amounts of EO every 6 months.  If a leak in the inner hose is detected, the hose is replaced.  This procedure reduces the risk of a serious failure of the transfer hose resulting in a significant leak.\n\n\n\n6)    The liquid and vapor outlets of the EO railcar are connected through automatic valves during transfers to the blend tanks.  The automatic valves will close to isolate the contents of the railcar in the event of abnormal circumstances.  By closing the automatic valves on the EO car during abnormal conditions, the amount of EO that can potentially be released if a leak should occur is minimized.\n\n\n\n7)    All four-blend tanks are equipped with safety relief valves to release"

Shutting these valves minimizes the amount of material that may leak out.\n\n\n\n8)    In conjunction with the EO detection system described in Item 4 above, an additional EO monitoring system covers the Kingman facility.  This system alarms when an EO concentration in excess of 1 ppm is detected at any one of 20 monitoring points.  3 of these monitoring points are located at the property fence line and will provide warning should a release in the facility have a potential off site impact.  \n\n\n\n4) The Five Year Accident History:\n\n The Kingman facility has never had a release of ethylene oxide that had a significant on site or offsite impact.\n\n\n\n5) The Emergency Response Plan: \n\n\n\nThe Kingman facility has a written facility specific Plant Emergency Response and Spill Plan.
