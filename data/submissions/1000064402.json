The Apex Generating Station also uses chemicals as a necessary part of reducing the emissions of nitrogen oxides to the atmosphere.  Storing a large quantity of ammonia can be a hazard if it is not handled properly.  As the company responsible for operating Apex Generating Station, owned by Southern California Public Power Authority, EthosEnergy Group (Ethos) takes its safety obligations in storing and using ammonia as seriously as we take controlling emissions from the power plant.  The following document describes what could happen if there were to be an accident, the steps we take every day to ensure a safely operating plant, and what to do in the event of an emergency.\n\n\n\nThis document complies with the EPA Risk Management Program under Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990, 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68, and the Chemical Accident Prevention Program (CAPP) Program under Nevada Administrative Code 459.952.  This document summarizes our existing health and safety programs, our internal management response procedures, and ongoing actions that are designed to prevent or minimize impacts of accidental releases of ammonia to the environment.  Apex Generating Station has prepared an emergency action plan to handle any potential accidental releases.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nAs one of Las Vegas' leading competitive energy providers, Southern California Public Power Authority generates the energy that creates opportunity --- improving the quality of life and supporting economic development in the community we serve.

      "SummaryText": "iles northwest of the intersection of Highway 93 and Interstate 15. The site is located in Clark County about 20 miles northeast of Las Vegas.  Southern California Public Power Authority owns the 90-acre site which is within Section 5, Township 18 South, Range 63 East.  The site has two immediate neighbors: a power plant to the south and a transportation engineering test facility to the north.  The remaining neighbors to the south and east are part of the Apex Industrial Park, which is currently under development.  The RMP has a complete list of all current and future industrial facilities that are located within the worst-case release radius.  Federal lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management are present to the west of the property boundary.  Further west of the federal lands is the Desert National Wildlife Range. The facility currently stores anhydrous ammonia, a regulated toxic substance under RMP and CAPP regulations, in a steel bulk storage tank.  \n\n\n\nAmmonia is used at the Apex Generating Station to reduce nitrogen oxides (nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide) created during the combustion of natural gas and exhausted from the two Combustion Turbine Generators (CTG) and two HRSG duct burners.  Ammonia vapor is drawn from the top of the storage tank and diluted with air, and injected into the two SCR units to reduce the NOx emissions.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in a 15,228-gallon capacity storage tank.  Because the storage tank is restricted from being filled to more than 80 percent, the maximum inventory of the anhydrous ammonia at the Apex Generating Station is 12,182 gallons or approximately 58,200 pounds.  The safety systems for the ammonia process include the following:\n\n\n\n1.    Excess flow valves.  Excess flow check valves protect against tank failure by shutting off flow in the event of a downstream leak.  \n\n\n\n2.    Ammonia detectors.  Four permanently mounted ammonia detectors are located at the ammonia storage tank and both flow control skids have a pe"

Ammonia Release Alarm:  Ammonia leak detectors located at the storage tank and flow control skids sound a local alarm and an alarm in the Control Room when ammonia is detected in the air at a concentration of 25 PPM or above.  The local ammonia alarm consists of a steady siren sound.  An emergency siren is also installed that will alert the immediate neighbors of a local emergency.  The siren is activated from the control room.\n\nc.    Fire Alarm:  Smoke detectors and pull stations are located through the occupied buildings at the Apex Generating Station that activate the fire alarm.  The alarm consists of a high-pitched beep and strobe light.  The alarm sounds only in the building(s) where the smoke detector or pull station were activated.\n\n\n\nPublic Address System.

Details such as maximum intended inventory, safe upper and lower operating temperatures and pressures, and codes and standards used to design, build, and operate the processes are on file at the facility.\n\n\n\nWe also have scheduled reviews of our risk management program and process safety management plan to update safety information if there is a major change that would make existing information inaccurate.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis \n\n\n\nIn February 2003, a detailed process hazard analysis (PHA) was developed for the anhydrous ammonia system with plant operations and maintenance, engineering, and management staff.  The PHA technique used was What If Analysis/Checklist Method, one of EPA's recommended approaches.  Subsequent updates occurred in 2008, 2012, 2013, and 2016.

Apex Generating Station assembles an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the Risk Management Program rule and in the regulatory process.  This team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the RMP rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation.
