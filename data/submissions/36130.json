Specific processes include: 1) manufacture, formulation and packaging of s-triazine herbicides, 2) manufacture of hydrogen cyanide, a raw material, 3) manufacture, formulation, and packaging activities for various other pesticides, herbicides and specialty chemicals, and 4) supportive activities for the above, which include effluent treatment systems, maintenance, utilities, and analytical and quality control.\n\nSafety in Syngenta Crop Protection's St. Gabriel Plant site is incorporated into all aspects of plant operation and is foremost in the design, maintenance and operation of every process.  The facility is guided by an operational philosophy that \"safety shall not be compromised for economy\".  Syngenta is proud to be certified as an OSHA STAR facility.  We have verifiably achieved a level of safety performance far surpassing our industry counterparts.  \n\nThe following information fulfills the requirements of 40 CFR 68.155;\n\n(a) The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source;\n\nSyngenta is committed to safety.  This commitment is supported from the corporate senior management down to the plant workers.  Employees at Syngenta participate in several groups committed to safety at the plant.  These include a Unit Health and Safety Committees and the Total Safety Team.\n\nSyngenta also has a strong commitment to the environment.  Several programs are run on-site by employees to assist in this commitment.  These include a Spill Prevention Committee which has been successful in reducing the number of on-site spills and an Employee Environmental Committee which runs a comprehensive recycling program and has developed and maintains a nature trail.\n\nSome of our awards and recognitions which reflect our strong safety and environmental commitments include: Charter member of the National Environmental Performan"

These are evident in several plant policies and procedures, including Plant Procedure A-1, which is the Statement of Policy.  This procedure states that \"safety is a primary concern and a core value\" and that \"it is the policy of the St. Gabriel Plant management that safety is a definite job requirement at every level of the organization\".   \n \n More relevant to the Risk Management Program is Plant Procedure C-8 which is entitled Process Safety Management Standard Compliance Procedure.  The purpose of this procedure is \"To establish measures (per Process safety Management standard 29 CFR 1910.11 and Risk Management Program 40 CFR 68) to ensure that accidental releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals are minimized and procedures are in place to lessen the consequence should a large release occur.\u00bf\n \n (b) The stationary source and regulated substances handled;\n \nSyngenta has separated the facility into several processes.  Of these, the  processes subject to RMP and the regulated substances handled by these processes are as follows:  \n MPF Unit - hydrogen and methylamine\n HCN/ HPF and associated Tank Farms - anhydrous ammonia; sulfur dioxide; hydrocyanic acid; chlorine; isopropylamine; ethylamine\nMMU - Toluene diisocyanate\n\nMethylamine is being added to the RMP with this submission.

      "SummaryText": "leting Section 7.0 of the RMP, the description of the prevention programs for these units, Syngenta separated the HCN/ HPF and associated Tank Farms into two sub-processes.  This was done because the Process Hazard Analysis for each of these is done independently of the others.  Also note that the information provided for each of these represents  the entire unit and  associated chemicals as opposed to describing only the regulated compounds.\n \n (c) The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps;\n \n Syngenta is regulated by the Process Safety Management regulations and as such conducts various process hazard analyses to prevent accidental releases from the facility.  These analyses are conducted on unit equipment as well as processes and procedures.\n\n Syngenta also has comprehensive procedures for inspection and maintenance of equipment.  The Syngenta Maintenance Department maintains a Preventive/Predictive Maintenance (PM/PDM) Manual.  This comprehensive manual documents the system used to ensure that maintenance and inspections are conducted effectively and efficiently and that closure is attained on recommendations resulting from these activities.  The PM/PDM incorporates inspection plans designed to \"enhance safety, environmental integrity, operational reliability, and protection for plant personnel and the surrounding community\".\n \n Syngenta also conducts extensive employee training.  Some of this training is done via a Computer Aided Training System (CATS) allowing on demand training around the clock.  The Training Records Information Management System (TRIM) electronically records this training.\n \n (d) The five-year accident history;\n \n Syngenta has had one incident since the last submission and within the last five years that qualifies as an accident reportable under the RMP Five-year Accident History.\n\nOn February 22, 2002, a release of approximately 89 pounds of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) or hydrocyanic acid (CAS No. 7"

As a result of this incident, Syngenta has revised the appropriate operating procedures, emergency response plan and training.  The facility has also reduced the inventory of HCN.\n\nThe following incident was previously submitted in a revised RMP submission.\n\nOn July 18, 1999, a release of approximately 125 pounds of ammonia occurred due to a gasket leak.  Although no off-site or on-site injuries or environmental damage occurred, approximately 1,200 residents were requested to shelter-in-place as a precautionary measure.

The facility is part of the community emergency response plan and has a facility emergency response plan.  Both plans include specific actions to be taken in response to accidental releases of regulated substances.\n\nIn the event of an emergency, Syngenta, in conjunction with the LEPC, has several mechanisms in place to notify the surrounding community including an automated dial-up phone system, activation of a televised public announcement and a strategically placed community siren system.  Syngenta also has on-site first aid and emergency medical responders, a hazmat team as well as emergency response equipment including a fire truck and ambulance.\n\n(f) Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nAs a result of th"

The system provides dedicated safety functions as well as \"watch-dog\" functions for the process control system.  In addition, several of the older process control computers are being replaced with new, state of the art control systems.\n\nLong term commitment to safety is evidenced through the implantation of new safety initiatives which focus on 24 hour safety. One of the goals of management at this site is for \"safety first\" to be the mindset of all employees.\n\nThe site currently tracks all spills, even small spills contained completely within secondary containment.  The current electronic incident tracking system is being expanded to include electronic spill reporting to replace the current paper reporting system.\n\nThe following supplemental information is provided as supporting information to the preparation of this RMP submission.\n\nAs recommended by EPA, Syngenta obtained the information on  the potentially affected population from LandView VI.  This software is based on the 2000 census and provides two methods of determining the population within a given area.  Syngenta chose to use the  Block Group Uniform Density  as opposed to the Block Group Centroid Method as it is felt that this method gives better estimations.  However, due to the calculation technique used in this method, it was found populations were given in areas which clearly have no residents.  For instance when the impact area was only over industrial areas.  In these cases, Syngenta did not rely on the LandView VI population information."
