      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nRisk Management Plan Executive Summary\nEquistar Chemicals, LP\nChocolate Bayou Chemical Complex\n\n1. Purpose\n\nThis document describes the Equistar Chemicals Chocolate Bayou Chemical Complex's philosophy and procedures for managing risk to employee health, public safety and to the environment.  It is intended to be just a summary of the many policies, procedures and actions that are taken to prevent or mitigate the potential release of chemicals listed under EPA 40 CFR 68 Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (RMP) Under the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r)(7).\n\n2. Plant Overview\n\nThe Equistar Chocolate Bayou Chemical Complex is an Olefins and Aromatics production facility.  It manufactures a variety of petrochemical products, which are used by others to manufacture a wide range of products from plastics to gasoline additives.  The complex consists of two production units, the Olefins Unit and the Hydrocarbons Unit and a Distribution Tank Farm Area.  The two units and the tank farm are fully integrated and interconnected in the production of Olefins and Aromatics and are treated, for the purposes of RMP, as a single process.  The process all starts in what is called the Olefins Unit, where plant feedstock is \"cracked\" in a furnace.  The feedstock is a mixture of naturally occurring hydrocarbons that range from natural gasoline, through gas well condensates, to heavy diesels.    In \"cracking\", the hydrocarbon chains are broken into shorter chains and in some cases recombined into even longer chains of hydrocarbons.  The result is a mixture of many hydrocarbons, which must be separated (and in some cases reacted with hydrogen) in order to become usable products.  The Equistar Chocolate Bayou Chemical Complex manufactures the following products; Ethylene, Propylene, Ethane, Pyrolysis Gasoline, Heavy Aromatic Oil (HAO), Light Pyrolysis Oil, Pyrolysis Tar, Dicyclopentadiene (DCPD), Raffinate I, Raffinate II, Resin Oil, Benzene, "

In addition to these products, the following are used as feedstocks to the plant in making the products; Olefins Unit Feedstock as described above, Ethane, Butane, Drip Oils and Methanol.  The feedstocks are all transported to the facility by pipeline or barge and the products are transported from the facility by barge, pipeline or tank truck.\n\n3. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nEquistar is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at Equistar.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent and mitigate possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel (RTFC) are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We also coordinate with the Chocolate Bayou Mutual Aid Group which provides additional emergency response resources.\n\n4. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Equistar Chocolate Bayou Chemical Complex encompasses Olefins and Aromatics manufacturing.  In the process of manufacturing these chemicals, some of which are regulated substances, we handle several flammable mixtures, comprising of twenty-five (25) regulated flammable substances, and we utilize one (1) toxic regulated substance.  The twenty-five (25) regulated flammable substances are: 1-3 Butadiene, Butane, 1-Butene, 2-Butene (cis- and trans-),  Ethane, Ethylene, Hydrogen, Isobutane, Isopentane, Isoprene, Methane, 3-Methyl-1-Butene, 2-Methyl-1-Butene, 1-3 Pentadiene, Pentane, 1-Pentene, 2-Pentene (E), 2-Pentene (Z), Propadiene, Propane, Propylene, Vinyl Acetylene, Acetylene, 2,2-dimethylpropane and Me"

The Worst-Case Release Scenarios and the Alternative Release Scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each scenario\n\nThe worst-case release and alternative release scenarios for both Toxic and Flammable Materials have been modeled and are included in the RMP.\n\nThe Flammables Worst-Case Release Scenario involves the catastrophic release of flammable liquid from an Olefins Unit feedstock storage tank. The Flammables Second Worst-Case Release Scenario involves a catastrophic release of Mixed C4 hydrocarbons from a storage sphere in the Olefins and Aromatics manufacturing process. The Flammables Alternative Case Release Scenario involves the shaft seal failure of a barge loading pump for Butadiene product.\n\nThe Toxics Worst-Case Release Scenario involves the catastrophic release of chlorine from a 2,000 lb cylinder. The Toxics Second Worst-Case Release Scenario involves a catastrophic release of chlorine from a 1/4\" diameter hole in the liquid portion of the storage cylinder.\n\n6. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nEquistar has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68.  This facility was designed, constructed, and is maintained in accordance with many national Codes and Standards too numerous to mention in this short summary.  Codes or Standards from the following major organizations are used: ASME, ANSI, API, IEEE, NFPA, ASTM and ISA.  All of the processes at the Equistar Chocolate Bayou Chemical Complex are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\nAlso, Equistar at the Chocolate Bayou Chemical Complex has taken the additional leadership step of becoming a member of the OSHA Voluntary Protection Program (VPP).

These investigations are undertaken to identify the root cause leading to the incident as well as identify any corrective actions needed to prevent reoccurrence.\n\nEmployee Participation\nEquistar believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  All company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, many of the various elements of the release prevention program require employee participation as the normal procedure for implementation of that element.  All employees have access to all information created as a part of the facilities implementation to the RMP rule, particularly information resulting from the process hazards analysis.\n\nHot Work Permits\nAt Equistar all hot work on covered processes requires an approved Hot Work Permit.  Employees and contractors are trained to recognize when a Hot Work Permit is required and in how to initiate obtaining such a permit.  Operations technicians ensure that the required Hot Work Permit safety precautions are fully implemented prior to signing the permit and allowing work to begin.  Personnel affected by the Hot Work Permit Procedure receive specific procedural training on an annual basis.\n\nContractors\nWhen selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the safety performance of the contractor is carried out to determine if the contractor should even be allowed to submit a proposal.  Additionally, Equistar routinely monitors the safety performance of all our contractors to ensure adequate performance.  Equistar has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractors work and to the potential process hazards of the area the contractor will be working in.

Five Year Accident History\n\nEquistar Chocolate Bayou Chemical Complex has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases.  Due to our release prevention policies, there have been no accidental releases of substances regulated by the RMP rule in the last 5 years, that had an onsite or offsite impact as described under EPA 40 CFR Part 68.42(a).  As a matter of course, Equistar reports and investigates all incidents.  \nThe emphasis that all incidents are to be reported and investigated assists in improving all safety performance including accidental releases of regulated RMP substances.\n\n8. Emergency Response Plan\n\nEquistar has in place a written Emergency Response Plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes many aspects of emergency response including; fire fighting, adequate first aid and medical treatment, shelter in place, evacuations, notification of Brazoria County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified, and notification of the public through our \"First Call\" System.  This system is an automatic phone system that calls all neighbor phones with a recorded message that provides key actions to be taken in the event of an emergency.  The plant also has an online computer release modeling system called \"Safer\" which uses current meteorological data and chemical release information to predict the direction, distance and concentration of the release plume. Additionally, the site maintains a community alert siren that is activated during an emergency, and maintains a telephone hotline (dubbed the \"CAER\" line) that contains information regarding any unusual activity (including emergencies, abnormal conditions, as well as normal operations) related to the plant that concerned citizens may have questions about.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response pla"

And of course, the plan is reviewed and updated as needed to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n9. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of various elements of our accidental release prevention program.   The following are just some of the items that were identified during unit PHAs and are either being planned for installation or have been completed:\nA? Additional vapor detection points in the Olefins Unit\nA? Revisions to operating procedures to help alert operating personnel to help prevent a potential auto-refrigeration excursion\nA? Additional relief protection\nA? Installation of additional alarms and interlocks\nA? Installation of additional control systems\nA? Develop procedures to provide effective long-term isolation of equipment safely\n\nCompletion of these action items should reduce the probability of, the potential for and/or the consequence of, a release of RMP regulated chemicals.\n"
