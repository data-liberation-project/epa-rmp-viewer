The plant is designed to process natural gas and recover liquid product from natural gas by physical separation and cryogenic means. Petroleum condensates are recovered from the inlet pipeline gas in this process for off-site sales.\n\n\n\nFrio LaSalle has a long-standing commitment to workers and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel, quality assurance, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Lone Star Processing Plant is located near Pettus, Texas and operates a variety of processes to produce the following petroleum products:\n\n1.

Operating Procedures\n\n\n\nFrio LaSalle maintains written Operating Procedures of the covered process that address primary operations mandated by OSHA, EPA, Good Engineering Practice and manufacturers. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current accurate by management.
