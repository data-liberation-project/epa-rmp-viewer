Anhydrous ammonia is a \ngas at ambient conditions.  The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system \nis used to control the processing and storage temperature for ice cream \nand related products.  It is a closed system that contains approximately \n23,100 pounds (i.e., 4,300 gallons) of ammonia in various physical states \n(gas, liquid, and saturated vapor).  The largest vessel is the control \npressure receiver that operates at approximately 100 pounds per square \ninch gauge (psig) and can contain as much as 8,700 pounds of liquid \nammonia (at its maximum safe fill volume of 90 percent).  However, \nduring typical operation, the vessel holds only about 4,900 pounds.  Most \nof the ammonia equipment is located indoors.  The condensing towers, \nmake-up air units, and some piping runs are located outdoors.\n\n1.2    PROCESS DESCRIPTION\nIce Cream Specialties, Inc. operates two separate ammonia systems, \nreferred to as the North and South systems.  The North ammonia \nrefrigeration system is a two-stage system.  The high-pressure receiver \nsupplies high-pressure (130 to 170 psig) liquid ammonia to the production \nfreezer units and the freezer warehouse.\n\nLiquid/vapor ammonia from the North system units is returned to the \nlow-pressure receiver where the liquid and vapor separate.  Liquid \nammonia from the low-pressure receiver is recirculated to the freezer \nunits.  Ammonia vapor from the low-pressure receiver feeds three booster \ncompressors, which compress the vapor and discharge into the \nint"

The major discharge from the high-stage compressors (hot \ngas) is vented to two evaporative condensers.  The condensed liquid is \nreturned to the high-pressure receiver.\n\nThe South ammonia refrigeration system is also a two-stage system.  Two \nhigh-pressure receivers supply high-pressure liquid ammonia to the \ncontrol pressure receiver.  The control pressure receiver regulates system \npressure and supplies high-pressure liquid ammonia at 100 psig to several \nprocess units including: storage tanks #1-14, glycol chiller, freezers #1-5, \nprocess room air units, HVAC coil, and plate chiller.\n\nLiquid/vapor ammonia from the above referenced South system units is \nreturned to one of four low-pressure receivers where the liquid and vapor \nseparate.  In addition, the low-pressure receivers supply liquid ammonia \nto the blast cell air units (30 psig) and Gram freezers #1 and 2 (50 psig). \nLiquid ammonia from the low-pressure receivers is recirculated to the \nprocess units.  Ammonia vapor from the low-pressure receivers feeds six \nbooster compressors, which compress the vapor and discharge into the \nintercooler.  Vapor from the intercooler is supplied to nine high-stage \ncompressors.  The major discharge from the high-stage compressors (hot \ngas), at 130 to 170 psig, is vented to three evaporative condensers.  The \ncondensed liquid is returned to the high-pressure receivers.\n\nBoth ammonia refrigeration systems are protected by the existence of \nspecific safety systems/hardware, including safety relief valves, ammonia \ndetectors, engine room ventilation, and system safety interlocks.  Safety \nrelief valves protect the compressor discharge and condensers from the \nhazards associated with overpressure.  Safety interlocks include high-\npressure and high-temperature alarms and cutouts for the compressors, as \nwell as high level floats and sensors for vessels.

To help minimize the probability and severity of an ammonia release, a prevention program that satisfies the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals  standard (29 CFR 1910.119) has been implemented.  The key components of the prevention program are summarized below:\n\n* The development, documentation, and operator availability of critical process safety information regarding the hazards of ammonia, the design basis of the system, and the equipment.  This information is used to fully understand and safely operate the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n* The development of an extensive employee participation program, which includes employees from all levels of the organization and from all areas within the plant (i.e., production and maintenance).  This program also assures that employees that utilize the ammonia system and are most knowledgeable about it are best able to easily, effectively, and regularly recommend changes or improvements which enhance safety.\n\n* The performance of a formal process hazard analysis (PHA), using the \"What-if... \" technique.  A team with expertise in engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety evaluated the existing refrigeration system in depth and developed recommendations to improve the safety and operability of the system.  The PHA addressed:  (1) process hazards; (2) previous incidents; (3) engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards; (4) the consequence of control failure; (5) facility siting; (6) human factors; and (7) a qualitative evaluation of possible safety and health effects of control system failures.  The PHA will be updated and revalidated every five years.\n\n* Written operating procedu"

The OPs include procedures for normal operation, startup, shutdown, emergency operation, and emergency shutdown.  They also describe safe operating limits for temperature and pressure, the consequences of operating outside these safe operating limits, and a description of safety systems and how they operate.\n\n* Refrigeration system operators receive refresher training at least every three years.  The training content is based upon the process safety information and operating procedures.  The training program ensures that the operators understand the nature and causes of problems arising from system operations and serves to increase awareness with respect to the hazards particular to ammonia and the refrigeration process.\n\n* Formal authorization systems (i.e., management of change procedure, pre-startup safety review) are in place to ensure that system changes or expansions are as safe as the original design and that an independent recheck, prior to start-up, confirms that the changes are consistent with the engineering design and safety requirements.  \n\n3.0    ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no accidental releases of ammonia at the facility in the last five years (since June 2004) that have resulted in death, injury, or significant property damage on-site or off-site death, injury, evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  \n\n4.0    EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe facility has implemented a detailed written Emergency Action Plan (EAP).  The EAP is intended to address all emergencies at the facility, in addition to incidents related to a release of ammonia.\n\nThe EAP includes awareness and response training for employees, coordination with the local fire department, and evacuation of the facility.  The plan details what personal protective equipment and spill response equipment is available; identifies specific individuals, "
