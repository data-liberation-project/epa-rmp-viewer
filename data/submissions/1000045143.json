This process includes protecting the community, environment, and personnel by implementing technology and procedures designed to reduce the impact of any potential release of toxic chemicals. This commitment to safety is documented in the policy and compliance manuals for this facility, which are available to all\n\nemployees.\n\n\n\nAs part of Matheson Tri-Gas, Inc.'s commitment to safe and environmentally friendly operations, monthly meetings are conducted with all employees as well as other more specific operational meetings concerning safety. Input and comments from plant personnel are also key aspects of Matheson Tri-Gas, Inc.'s safety practices: By giving personnel the ability to make suggestions regarding safety and operational practices, the facility can operate efficiently and safely. Another key element in Matheson Tri-Gas, Inc.'s safety practices consists of the regular internal and third party environmental and safety audits.\n\n\n\nRegulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Matheson Tri-Gas, Inc. facility stores the following:\n\n?    maximum 2,400 pounds of Arsine\n\n?    maximum 25,000 pounds of Ammonia\n\n?    maximum 2,750 pounds of Chlorine\n\n\n\nThese chemicals are regulated at the Program 3 level.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Programs and Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nAs part of the implementation of the PSM/RMP, elements of the prevention programs have been developed to manage process safety issues associated with the facility.
