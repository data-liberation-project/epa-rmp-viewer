Our goal is to conduct our activities in a manner that protects the health of our employees, the community, and our customers.                        We work diligently to prevent injuries associated with our operations and those of our contractors.  Whenever possible we try to prevent or reduce the environmental impact of our activities by appropriate design, manufacturing, distribution, use and disposal practices.                                                                                                                                                                        The LeMoyne site manufacturer's basic and specialty chemicals which are commonly used to produce many of the items used by millions of people everyday.   Chlorine is one of the raw materials used to manufacture Sulfur Chlorides.  In turn other industries use Sulfur Chlorides to manufacture rubber, insecticides, chemicals, erasers, dyes, rubber substitutes, lubricant additives, and pharmaceuticals.   Carbon Disulfide, commonly referred to as CS2, is used in the manufacture of rayon which is commonly used to make suits, blouses, and clothing.  CS2 is also  used to make sponges, gauze, rubber, solvents, disposable washcloths, dialysis filters, surgical face masks, coffee filter, insecticides/pesticides, oil and air filters and cellophane.                                                       We prevent accidents by Designing for Safety, Maintaining our Plant, Operating Safely,  and Auditing our Operations.  In addition to the general philosophy we  use specific guidance and criteria for Chlorine handling which is provided by the Chlorine Institute.  For Carbon Disulfide handling and storage the maximum achieveable technology is used on design of  tanks, valves, and piping.   In addition all storage tanks are double walled."
