These prevention program provisions are specifically intended to minimize the probability and/or consequences of any accidental ammonia releases from the facility and include such measures as a system hazard review, operating and maintenance procedures, training, compliance auditing, management system and updates, etc.  The facility prevention program is an on-going system based on periodic training, incident investigations, audits, procedure revisions, and RMP updates as required to reflect facility changes and RMP requirements.\n\nEmergency Response Program:  The facility has developed an emergency response plan for potential ammonia release scenarios.  This plan includes coordination with the facility\u00bfs local fire department and hazmat responders and any emergency response activities required.\n\nSafety Management and Changes: The facility is committed to ensuring its operations are safe and in accordance with all RMP requirements, and has an established senior manager responsible for RMP development, implementation and compliance.  This manager is committed to maintaining the safety of the RMP covered ammonia system through active adherence to the appropriate procedures and codes, While this manager carries out the mechanics of the RMP requirements, the authority for such activities comes from the president of Nordic Cold Storage, LLC.  To ensure that the appropriate changes occur as necessary to maintain/improve safety, ongoing hazard reviews, training, audits, maintenance and investigations will be conducted as required by RMP.  Updates to the RMP will be completed as necessary in response to these activities.\n\nSummary:  As documented in this submittal, the RMP for the facility has been completed in accordance with all 40 CFR 68 requirements and the facility has certified compliance."

Additionally, the Empire facility has several clients who lease space within the facility and these clients control their own operations with regard to the in and out movement and storage of their frozen products.  The facility is regulated under Risk Management Program (RMP) due to onsite anhydrous ammonia storage in excess of the 10,000 pound RMP applicability threshold.  The facility\u00bfs only RMP covered process is the ammonia system used to refrigerate various areas of the facility.  The single largest vessel in the process can contain 11,100 pounds of ammonia.  Under normal operating conditions with Administrative Controls, the vessel operates at an average 40% of total capacity or with a vessel volume of 7,400 pounds.  \n\nChemical Safety Overview:  The facility\u00bfs overall approach and commitment to chemical safety is demonstrated by 1) the existing Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) program as specified by 29 CFR 1910.119 already in place at the facility, and 2) the hazard assessment, prevention program and emergency response provisions implemented specifically for ammonia in response to the RMP requirements.  The management structure and oversight to ensure safety is documented in the facility\u00bfs PSM and RMP programs and includes compliance with applicable regulations, codes and standards (i.e. International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidance for ammonia).\n\nFive-Year Accidental History:  The facility has had no RMP reportable accidents/releases of ammonia within the five years proceeding this RMP 2004 submittal.  Also, there have been no situations of near misses.\n\nPrevention Program:  The facility has implemented a Program 3 level Prevention Program, as required by the RMP rules, in acc"
