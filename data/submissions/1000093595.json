Accident Release Prevention Program and Emergency Response Policy\r\nIt is the policy of the Pottsville, PA Warehouse facility management to implement the requirements of this Risk Management Program (RMP) in accordance with the USEPA regulations under 40 CFR Part 68 and with the corresponding regulations under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program. The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material and if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to Tyson employees, the public and the environment. This objective will be accomplished by utilizing general good operating procedures, providing appropriate training to all employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary, with the local emergency response providers. This plan covers all Tyson owned activities at this facility. Tyson's management is committed to providing the resources necessary to implement this policy.\r\n\r\n2. Facility Description\r\nTyson operates a Freezer and Warehouse at this location. One chemical is utilized at the facility in sufficient quantities to be subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68. This chemical is ammonia and is used as a refrigerant throughout the facility.\r\n\r\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps.\r\nThe Pottsville, PA facility is governed by a set of OSHA and USEPA regulations that require planning and facility activities intended to prevent a release of hazardous material, or if a release inadvertently occurs, to minimize the consequences of a release to the employees of the facility, the public and to the environment. These regulations include:\r\n* 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention\r\n* 40 CFR Part 112, Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure\r\n* 40 CFR Part 264, Hazardous Waste Contingency Plan\r\n* 29 CFR Part 119, Process Safety Management\r\n* 40 CFR Part 302, Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA)\r\nThe key concepts in Tyso"
