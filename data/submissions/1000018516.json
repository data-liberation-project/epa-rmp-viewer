Anhydrous ammonia, a potentially hazardous chemical, is stored on site in the main plant refrigeration system.  Anhydrous ammonia is an environmentally safe chemical for maintaining safe storage temperatures for food products, but could pose a hazard to personnel and the environment if released.  However, anhydrous ammonia is a non-ozone depleting, environmentally safe refrigerant if used safely and responsibly.  Our refrigeration maintenance staff is also trained in operating, maintenance and emergency response procedures.  Our on-site maintenance staff is assisted by our external contractor, Kuhlman, Inc.  Kuhlman, Inc. was selected for its licensed professional staff, which includes professional engineers, certified welders, electricians, and trained ammonia refrigeration system technicians.\n        \nThe F. B. Purnell Sausage Co., Inc. is committed to operating in an environmentally responsible and safe manner.  We are dedicated to following OSHA and EPA guidelines to maintain employee and community safety. Our accident prevention program includes active employee participation, maintenance, monitoring, and employee training that focuses on accident prevention.  This facility maintains open communication with the local emergency response team to ensure preparedness of our and their emergency responders.  The Shelby County LEPC is aware of the materials at our site and includes our facility in their annual planning efforts."
