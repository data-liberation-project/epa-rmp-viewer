      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\n\nReliant Energy, Inc. operates a coal-fired, electric power generating station near Schelocta, Pennsylvania. This 1,459-acre facility, known as Keystone Station, is located 45 miles northwest of Johnstown, PA, and 14 miles west of Indiana, PA near state route 210 and US route 422.  \n\nKeystone station employs almost 200 full-time staff and a considerable number of contract employees.  The secondary economic impact of the facility on its many material and services suppliers is significant.  For example, the station provides employment for an estimated many coal miners and trucking firms.\n\nThe station is a major component of the billion-dollar power development in the Chestnut Ridge area.  The station was constructed by investor-owned utilities representing four eastern states.  Reliant Energy operates Keystone station as agent for the following utility owners (with percentage of ownership):\n\n - Duquesne Keystone LLC (2.47%)\n - Constellation Power Source Generation, Inc. (20.99%)\n - Keystone Power LLC (3.70%)\n - Reliant Energy Mid-Atlantic Power Holdings, LLC (16.67%)\n - PPL Mountour, LLC (12.34%)\n - Exelon Generation Company, LLC (20.99%)\n - PSEG Fossil LLC (22.84%).\n\nThe facility generates 1700 MW of power from two identical, 850 MW units.  Each unit has a state-of-the-art pollution control system for particulate and special burners to reduce nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions.\n\n\n1. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES AT THE STATIONARY SOURCE\n\nReliant Energy?s policy is to comply with all applicable regulatory requirements, including those for accidental release prevention and emergency response.\n\n\n2. THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\na. PRIMARY ACTIVITIES ? This facility is a coal-fired, electric-power generating station.\n\nb. USE OF REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n-- Anhydrous ammonia is used at Keystone station as a fluegas conditioner.  The ammonia improves the ability of the electrostatic precipitators (ESPs) to remo"

      "SummaryText": "ve particulate from the flue gas.  In this process, the ammonia is converted to ammonium sulfate and removed from the flue gas as particulate.  \n\n-- The aqueous ammonia injection system at Keystone Station is designed to remove NOx from boiler flue gas by SCR.  This is accomplished by injecting a 30-percent ammonia solution into the flue gas before it is passed over a catalyst.\n\nNo other toxic or flammable materials are stored at the facility in quantities above the regulatory threshold.\n\nc. QUANTITIES HANDLED OR STORED \n\n-- The anhydrous ammonia is transported, stored and conveyed as a liquid up to evaporators. A single 18,000-gallon tank located outdoors adjacent to the Unit No. 2 ESP is used to store the anhydrous ammonia liquid. The storage tank is kept under pressure to maintain the ammonia in liquid form. Administrative controls are used to ensure that the tank is not filled above the 85% level.\n\n-- The aqueous ammonia system is comprised of four 60,000-gallon storage tanks, pumps, and piping, instrumentation and controls.  The storage tanks are in a concrete diked area for secondary containment.  Tanker truck unloading is also provided with secondary containment.   \n\n\n3. THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\na. WORST CASTE RELEASE SCENARIOS ? The worst-case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia assumes that the ammonia storage tank catastrophically ruptures, and the entire contents are released as a vapor over 10 minutes.  The quantity released in the 10-minute event is calculated as:\n\n18,000 gallons * 85% *5.66 lb/gal = 86,598 lb\n\nFour 60,000-gallon tanks are used to store aqueous ammonia.  The WCS assumes that the entire contents of two ammonia tanks (manifolded together for feeding one boiler) are spilled into the common secondary containment area over time.  The WCS can include the effects of passive mitigation systems, and for Keystone Station this is the use of secondary containment to minimize ammonia liquid spills.  Th"

      "SummaryText": "e quantity released is calculated as:\n\n66,082 gallons * 2 * 5.66 lb/gal = 982,026 lb\n\nPer EPA guidance, because the horizontal surface area of the secondary containment system (3,885 ft2) is less than that of the worst-case liquid pool (no secondary containment, one-centimeter deep pool) the rate at which the material is released is calculated as:\n\n1.4 x LFA (0.026 lb/min/ft2) x 3,885 ft2  = 141 lb/minute\n\nb. The ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO (anhydrous ammonia) assumes that the entire contents of a 4,000-gallon ammonia tank truck are spilled into the paved unloading area and evaporate over a 10-minute period (due to, for example, an unloading hose rupture). The quantity released in the 10-minute event is calculated as:\n\n4,000 gallons * 5.66 lb/gal = 22,640 lb\n\nBecause both the ammonia tank truck and the ammonia storage tank have excess flow valves which would close upon the increase in flow from a hose rupture, this is a very unlikely scenario.\n\nc. DISTANCES TO ENDPOINT ? The offsite consequences of these accidental releases were evaluated with a screening computer dispersion model (RMP*Comp, version 1.07).  Offsite consequence analysis of the worst-case scenario must include the following weather conditions: a wind speed of 1.5 m/s (3.4 mph), \"F\" atmospheric stability class, a temperature of 77?F, and relative humidity of 50%.  The more typical meteorological parameters used in analyzing the alternative release scenario for anhydrous ammonia include a mean wind speed of 6.7 mph and \"D\" atmospheric stability.\n\nThe maximum calculated distances to the endpoint using the RMP*Comp model is 3.4 and 0.2 miles for the worst-case scenarios for anhydrous and aqueous ammonia, respectively.  This represents the maximum downwind distance that the catastrophic release (under worst-case weather conditions) could pose a hazard to the public.  For the alternative release scenario (anhydrous ammonia), the maximum calculated distance to the endpoint using the RMP*Comp model is a more"

GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThere are many safety programs in place at the station to minimize the potential for the accidental releases of ammonia considered by this plan.  For example:\n\n? A comprehensive process safety management (PSM) program has been implemented for all anhydrous ammonia process equipment.  This includes daily visual inspections, periodic mechanical integrity checks, and operator training.\n\n? The ammonia storage tanks are registered pressure vessels that are built to exacting standards.\n\n? Ammonia tank trucks are only unloaded during daylight hours on weekdays.\n\n? Administrative controls are used to ensure that the anhydrous ammonia tank is not filled above the 85% level.\n\n? Excess flow valves are mounted on all storage tank liquid lines.\n\n\n5. FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY ? No accidents as defined in 40 CFR Part 68 have occurred during the past five years at this site.\n\n\n6. THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM ? In the unlikely event that an accidental release of ammonia would occur, the station has prepared a detailed written emergency response plan.  This plan has been in place for many years, and yearly drills are held to test the plan under simulated conditions.\n\n\n7. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY ? All station safety programs, including the emergency response program, are reviewed periodically for improvement opportunities."
