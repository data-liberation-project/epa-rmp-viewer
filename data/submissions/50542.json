However, should a release occur, plant personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDescription of Facility and Regulated Substances Handled:\nThe Hurricane gas processing plant is located just east of Hurricane, WV approximately 1 mile south of highway 60 on highway 34.  The plant processes about 10 MMCFD of natural gas and provides both a service and a product.  The gas is dehydrated and propane and heavier hydrocarbons, which might otherwise condense in the transmission pipeline and cause problems, are removed to produce a saleable natural gas product. The hydrocarbons that are removed are fractionated into propane and a butane/gasoline mixed product.  Total liquid production is about 380 BPD with total propane and butane/gasoline product storage capacity of 1430 Bbls.   The plant has inlet compression, dehydration and a straight refrigeration process for product recovery.  The plant contains several regulated flammables such as propane, butane and natural gasoline.  No threshold quantity of a regulated substance is present at the plant site.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention and Chemical-specific steps:\nThis facility is constructed in accordance with appropriate mechanical and electrical codes for gas processing plants and is subject to OSHA's PSM program.  Written programs and procedures cover all of the key elements of the PSM  program and the employees are well trained in the safe operation of this facility.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\nThe Hurricane plant is scheduled to be placed in service in early July 2007.  This is a new facility and has not experienced any accidental releases that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site or known offsite deat"

The plan has been posted at the plant and all employees have been trained in the actions to be taken in the event of an emergency.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\nNo changes to the safety program or plant facilities are currently planned.  However, weekly safety meetings are held during which incidents are reviewed, safety procedures discussed and changes proposed.  Our safety program is constantly improving."
