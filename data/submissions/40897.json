      "SummaryText": "Facility Description\nDiversified Energy Company, LLC (DENCO) operates as an ethanol fuel production plant located in Morris, Minnesota in Stevens County, Minnesota. The facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn and a process by-product known as dry distillers' grain with soluables, which is used as a livestock feed.  As a requirement of the Clean Air Act Amendments 112r Accidental Release of Hazardous Air Substances program, DENCO completed a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for any chemical stored on-site that will be above the reporting threshold of 10,000 pounds.  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nDENCO is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process, specifically pentane as a constituent of the natural gasoline used as the ethanol denaturant as well as the aqueous ammonia. The denaturant is added to the ethanol to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption. The ammonia is added to the process as a pH control.  It is the policy of DENCO to comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws.  In the event of an emergency, it is the policy of DENCO to notify the City of Morris Fire Department and evacuate all employees from the facility.  \n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substance Handled\nThe facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn and a process by-product known as dry distillers' grain with soluables, which is used as a livestock feed. The fuel ethanol production process requires use of a denaturant (natural gasoline) which may contain approximately 40 percent pentane, an RMP regulated substance. The maximum amount of denaturant on-site is estimated to be 72,910 pounds (approximately 29,164 pounds of pentane). The denaturant is stored in a tank as a liquid and is introduced to the fuel ethanol in the final stage of production. The denaturant tank is located in the facility's tank farm area which is designe"

      "SummaryText": "d with a secondary containment dike to contain stored materials within the tank farm area.  Aqueous ammonia is also stored on-site and used in the ethanol production process for pH control.  This tank also has a secondary containment structure encompassing it.  The maximum aqueous ammonia stored on-site will be 62,433 pounds at a 29.9% concentration of ammonia (approximately 18,667 pounds of ammonia).  \n\nOff-Site Consequence Analysis\nIn addition to identifying and reporting regulated materials at the DENCO facility, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Plan (RMP) program guidance requires companies to share with their communities a look at the worst possible accident that could happen at a facility (as unlikely as that might be) and an alternative, more realistic accident scenario.  DENCO has evaluated both the worst-case and alternative case scenarios for the denaturant and aqueous ammonia on-site.  Emergency response programs for these scenarios have been prepared and implemented.  DENCO has coordinated emergency response training and drills with local authorities.  \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThrough completion of this RMP, DENCO has complied with the EPA requirements under 40 CFR Part 68 and OSHA Process Safety Management requirements. Process safety information and operations/maintenance procedures are documented on-site. Periodic functions such as process hazard analysis, training, change management and incident investigation are conducted on a regular basis. Audits of the overall RMP will be conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA and OSHA regulations.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nDENCO has not had a denaturant or aqueous ammonia accident causing death, injuries, environmental or property damage, evacuations or in-place sheltering in the last five years at the fuel production facility. The facility began operations October 30, 1999."
