              "Description": "Process Safety Information\nThe brewery has compiled information on the hazards of ammonia, the design basis for the refrigeration system and the specific equipment to help identify and understand the inherent hazards of ammonia and help in the safe operation of the system.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nAn initial process hazard analysis was conducted at the brewery in July, 1993, in the form of a Hazard and Operability study (HAZOP).  The brewery continues to conduct Process Hazard Analyses for changes in the system.  These Process Hazard Analyses are retained in databases.  Potential hazards associated with the ammonia system that are evaluated in detail as part of the analysis are listed below.\n\n* abnormal operation\n* accessibility\n* impaired body movement\n* clarity of instructions\n* loss of containment\n* contamination\n* corrosion\n* accuracy of drawings\n* high/low/no/reverse flow\n* high/low/no level\n* high/low/no pressure\n* high/low temperature\n* instrumentation issues\n* frequency/lack of information\n* leakage\n* equipment failure\n* maintenance\n* lack of/too much/wrong action\n* relief valve discharges\n* utilities failures\n* vacuum\n* visibility\n* wrong component\n* wrong sequence\n* natural disasters (tornado, hurricane, earthquake)\n\nA system is in place to address the findings and recommendations resulting from the hazard analyses.  The status of the findings and action items are tracked in the previously mentioned databases.\n\nProcess Controls\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has the following process controls:\n* monitoring by Utility operating personnel 24 hours a day, 7 days a week\n* relief valves that relieve vessel pressure at a specified setpoint and reseat at pressures below the setpoint.  Many of these valves relieve back into the system, thus preventing a release to atmosphere.\n* burst disc indicators on some pressure relief valves that vent to atmosphere.  These burst disc indicators, upon rupture, immediately signal the Utilities central control room.\n* check valves that prevent backflow in piping\n* a water scrubber that absorbs ammonia prior to venting to atmosphere during system pumpouts\n* manual shutoff valves\n* interlocks that prevent activation of equipment under certain conditions\n* warning alarms and procedures that activate in the event of process upsets\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nProper operation of the refrigeration system minimizes the likelihood of errors that could lead to an accidental release of ammonia.  Clearly written, detailed procedures, guidelines, rules, and practices ensure safe operation of the system during all phases of operation, including startup, normal operation, emergency shutdown and emergency operation, normal shutdown, and startup following a shutdown.  Operating procedures provide all employees involved with the operation and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system with the written information and precautions necessary to safely perform their tasks in a consistent manner.  These procedures were last reviewed in October of 2001.\n\n\nOperator Training\nAll employees who operate, maintain and supervise the ammonia refrigeration system are trained and qualified to ensure proper, safe operation.  Employees also receive on-the-job training.\n\nMechanical Integrity \nAssuring the mechanical integrity of a new system or new addition to an existing system are engineering and maintenance responsibilities.  The following items relate to documented procedures used by Anheuser-Busch engineering and maintenance to assure mechanical integrity:\n\nEquipment Identification\nAll major pieces of equipment are initially assigned an equipment number.  This number also identifies equipment on Anheuser-Busch engineering drawings and in design premise documents for the ammonia refrigeration system hereafter referred to in this document as \"the system\".\n\nEquipment Design Criteria\nA design premise document is prepared for each major piece of equipment that has been assigned an equipment number.  The design premise provides the original design details, governing codes and specifications for the equipment.  A copy of the design premise is normally kept on file with plant engineering.\n\nEquipment Shop Drawings\nOn file with Plant Engineering or Utilities are manufacturer's shop drawings, approved by Anheuser-Busch engineering and filed by equipment number.  These approved drawings offer certification that the equipment item was fabricated in accordance with design specifications.  Details pertinent to the mechanical integrity of the system such as equipment dimensions, mass/energy balance, materials of construction, code requirements, pressure/temperature limits, special construction and installation instructions, etc. are normally noted on these shop drawings.\n\nOther Related Equipment\nOther technical provisions, (TP-60) for piping specifications, (TP-67) for electrical specifications, (TP-68) for instrumentation specifications, and (TP-59) for mechanical equipment installation, are also provided by engineering.  The technical provision documents are for use in purchasing, installing and testing piping systems to assure the mechanical integrity of the system.  Plant Engineering applies the same technical provisions, where applicable, for any system modifications, maintenance and repairs implemented at the plant level.\n\nThe program for maintaining the mechanical integrity of the system includes the following procedures:\n* training of operators and maintenance personnel in awareness of system deviations that jeopardize the mechanical integrity of the system\n* daily inspections and testing of the system by shift operators\n* use of computerized programming to issue and document repetitive work orders for routine inspections, testing, and maintenance of major equipment and piping\n* use of joint, periodic, inspections by Plant Engineering and insurance underwriter\n* implementation of special guidelines for safety valve and control device inspection, testing, and replacement\n* a policy on system spare parts and material\n\nOperator and Maintenance Personnel Training\nOne of the most important elements involved in an on-going mechanical integrity program is a knowledgeable, well-trained work force of system operators and maintenance personnel.  Towards that end, extensive training on basic refrigeration procedures via a teacher/tape/text/test program was completed in 1995.  Training sessions on specific ammonia system standard operating procedures via a teacher/tape/text/test program were completed in 1995.  Refresher training is performed every three years.\n\nInspection and Testing of Pressure Relief Valves\nPressure relief valves are set up on a computer documented identification, inspection and testing program. This program requires quarterly, annual, and five-year inspections and testing.\n\nSensors, Alarms and Safety Interlocks\nThe following devices are identified by an equipment number or listed on the repetitive work order for the major piece of equipment on which they are mounted.  If not covered by a special maintenance program, the following category of equipment or device is to be inspected annually as a minimum, or more frequently as recommended by the manufacturer or as determined by good engineering practices:\n\n* cellar ammonia alarms\n* suction traps\n    - level switches\n    - alarms\n    - liquid pumps\n* compressor cutouts and alarms\n    - high discharge pressure\n    - high discharge temperature\n    - how suction. pressure\n    - low oil pressure\n    - high oil temperature\n    - cooling water flow/ temperature /level switch(s)\n* evaporator accumulators\n    - liquid level control\n    - high refrigerant level switch\n\nSpare Parts and Materials Policy\nSpare parts for system equipment and controls are to be original equipment manufacturer's parts. Any exception must meet industry standards and be approved by plant engineering.  Parts suppliers are to be documented on spare parts order forms.  The purchase and use of other materials such as valves and piping must meet the specifications in the latest corporate engineering technical provisions covering the material. (see previously explained, \"TP\" documentation).\n\n\nManagement of Change\nThe brewery has in place a formal system to identify, assess, authorize, and implement changes that may affect the ammonia refrigeration system.  In addition to this formal system, two management system components were developed, in part, in an effort to ensure that changes that may affect the ammonia refrigeration system are identified, assessed, and authorized.  The two management systems are called Capital Project and Process Change Review and Chemical Material Management Review.\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review\nThe St. Louis Brewery must address certain important considerations before it introduces ammonia into a process.  Like most elements of process safety management, the pre-startup safety review section touches on several other part of the standard, including process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity, and emergency planning.  All of these elements have a role to play in developing an effective pre-startup safety review program.",

We have completed this report under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) risk management program (RMP) to communicate our efforts to achieve a safe workplace.\n\nThe brewery uses ammonia as a key part of the cooling system that maintains beer at the proper temperature during certain stages of the brewing process.  Ammonia is one of the materials covered under the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management standard (PSM) and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations.  The brewery follows these regulations, as well as others, to ensure that it safely handles, uses, and stores ammonia and other potentially hazardous chemicals safely.  The brewery has had no releases of ammonia that resulted in injuries to people, harm to property, or damage to the environment within the last five years.\n\nOur corporate environmental, health, and safety (EHS) policy and requirements promote the overall safety of this brewery, employees, and the public.  This policy includes risk reduction programs that provide assurance for the safe management of process risks to prevent environmental, health and safety incidents and to protect the workplace, the community and the environment. These programs enable the brewery to prevent the occurrence, or minimize the consequences of, significant releases of ammonia.\n\nIt is Anheuser-Busch's policy to conduct our business in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations, and permits and to promote a safe workplace and a quality environment.  Each employee is trained and required to comply strictly with this policy.  We do not allow production goals or financial objectives to over-ride safety and environmental concerns.\n\nAlso, it is Anheuser-Busch's policy to lead by exa"

We are committed to the spirit as well as the letter of our EHS policy and promote, throughout the organization, responsibility and accountability for strict compliance with that policy.  Anheuser-Busch employees whose actions in the performance of their duties may affect the environment and/or public health are trained sufficiently to permit them to comply strictly with our EHS policy.\n\nIn conducting our businesses, we continue to seek and implement cost effective methods to reduce the EHS impact of our operations.  We integrate EHS considerations into our business planning and decision-making processes, including product research and development, packaging, and new manufacturing methods.  Our continuous EHS improvement goals include pollution prevention and resource conservation.  We ask our contractors to adopt EHS standards, ethics, and policies similar to our own and we give preference to suppliers that do so.\n \nWe encourage our employees, customers, and the public to share with us their EHS concerns.  We continually talk with local authorities in communities in which we operate to share ideas about preventing incidents with materials we use or store.\n\nAmmonia System\n\nAmmonia is used in the refrigeration system of the brewery.  As part of the brewing process, the beer is cooled to ensure its consistency, flavor and overall quality.  Beer packaged in kegs is stored in a refrigerated area in our facility until it's shipped.  Because of the characteristics of ammonia, our employees observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human and environmental exposure, both within the brewery and in the surrounding community.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nAs required by the EPA's Risk Management regulation, we have identified an extremely unlikely \"worst-case\" scenario in which liquid ammonia"

      "SummaryText": " distribution piping fails, releasing 38,885 pounds of ammonia. This constitutes all of the liquid ammonia in the distribution system between the subcoolers and process evaporators.  Under worst-case weather conditions and with no mitigating actions, ammonia could travel 2.3 miles before dispersing to the endpoint concentration of 200 ppm.\n\nThis scenario is unlikely to occur at the St. Louis brewery for a number of reasons: \n\n* We meet or exceed industry standards for the manufacture and quality control of pipes and vessels that contain ammonia used at our facility;\n* Ammonia is not corrosive to piping in the form in which it is used at the brewery;\n* Pressure relief safety valves limit operating pressure so chances for a large-scale release are minimal;\n* Ammonia sensors warn of leaks; \n* Automatic and manual safety valves provide the ability to isolate components within the ammonia system, as described below;\n* Equipment is inspected and kept in proper working order and replaced when necessary; \n* Worst-case weather conditions as assumed by the definition of \"worst case\" are uncommon in the St. Louis area; \n* The brewery has an emergency response plan, personnel and equipment in place to respond to emergency situations (see description below).\n \nAlternative Release Scenario\n \nAn alternative release scenario would be the opening of a pressure relief valve, which itself is a system safety device designed to relieve pressure to avoid a more serious release.  The largest release from a pressure relief valve at any of our 12 breweries in the past five years has been 400 pounds.  Under defined weather conditions, this amount of ammonia could travel 0.10 miles before dispersing to the endpoint concentration of 200 ppm.\n\nThis scenario is unlikely for the same reasons presented in the discussion above regarding the worst-case release.\n \nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n \nAnheuser-Busch has years of experience operating ammonia-based refrigeration systems at its brewer"

The following elements have produced this safe operating record:\n\n* Process hazard analysis and review, including identification of corrective actions which are tracked to closure;\n* Standard operating procedures that all operators of the refrigeration system must follow;\n* Formal operator training (80 hours minimum);\n* Preventative maintenance to ensure that the entire refrigeration system is mechanically sound;\n* Procedures to ensure that changes to the refrigeration system are managed so that system operation remains safe;\n* Safety review prior to the startup of new or modified equipment;\n* Audits of the PSM and RMP programs;\n* Incident investigations to ensure that lessons are learned to prevent future incidents;\n* Employee involvement in risk reduction programs;\n* Contractor safety procedures are reviewed to ensure outside workers exercise the same safety consciousness as brewery employees;\n* A hot work permit system that ensures all welding work is conducted safely.\n* Process safety information; and \n* Emergency planning and response.\n\nThe brewery additionally complies with the requirements of the OSHA PSM standard (40 CFR 1910.119), the EPA RMP rules (40 CFR 68), and the ANSI/IIAR 2-1992 standard for Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigerating Systems.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe brewery has had no covered releases that have caused on-site or offsite injuries, or damage to property or the environment within the last five years. \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe St. Louis brewery has established emergency response procedures in the event of an incident involving ammonia.  The emergency response program is based on OSHA's requirements for emergency action plans (29 CFR 1910.38) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120 (q)).  We"

      "SummaryText": " have trained employees for emergency response and maintain a plan entitled  \"Environmental, Health and Safety Incident Plan\" (EHSIP) which is provided to the City of St. Louis Fire Department.  We conduct periodic drills with local agencies as one of the methods we use to train on implementation of the EHSIP at the brewery. \n \nBrewery personnel notify local agencies when emergency response is needed.  Local agencies determine if the public needs to be notified.  If it is determined that the public needs to be notified, the local agencies perform the notification task.\n \nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n \nAnheuser-Busch's St. Louis brewery ammonia refrigeration system is periodically modified to improve safety.  In 1996 a new state-of-the-art refrigeration plant was placed into service.  Additional changes to improve safety are planned in the future.\n\nConclusion\n\nAnheuser-Busch is pleased to share its record of safe operations.  We believe the Risk Management Plan under which we are providing this information is an important tool for encouraging communications with our neighbors.  Although we are confident the \"worst case\" and \"alternative\" scenarios presented in this report are highly unlikely, we are prepared to respond quickly and effectively should one ever occur.  Anheuser-Busch has worked hard over the years to ensure the highest standard of safety.  Our goal is to continue the excellent and safe track record."
