Specifically we will:\n\n\n\nConduct our operations in compliance with any applicable health, safety and environmental laws and regulations.\n\n\n\nContinue to improve our safety, health, and environmental performance through the Augusta Does Accident Prevention Together (ADAPT) Process.\n\n\n\nConduct periodic assessments of our operations to ensure and reduce risks.\n\n\n\nImplement progressive health, safety, and environmental practices that apply risk management and loss control principles to our operations.\n\n\n\nEstablish safety, health, and environmental performance goals and assign responsibilities for developing and implementing related measurement systems.\n\n\n\nProvide educational and training regarding applicable laws, regulations, policies, and procedures to protect human health and the environment.\n\n\n\nCooperate with our neighbors, industry trade groups, government agencies, and others to develop effective, reasonable rules and regulations to protect human health and the environment.\n\n\n\nPCS Nitrogen's success depends on our positive health, safety, and environmental attitude and actions to achieve continuous improvement.\n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario are for a regulated toxic substance from PCS Nitrogen facility would be the failure of a pressurized ammonia storage tank, and the sudden release of it's contents.

We have administratively reduced the tank's design capacity by 314,000 lbs.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for ammonia would be the failure of a pipeline during the unloading of a railcar.  This release would last for 25 minutes.  The distance to the toxic endpoint (200 ppm) as determined by RMPComp version 1.06 would impact receptors.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for ammonia (conc. 20% or greater) involves the overflow of a product tank.  This release would last for a five minute period.  The distance to the toxic endpoint (200 ppm) as determined by RMPComp version 1.06 would impact public receptors.\n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario for a regulated flammable substance from the PCS Nitrogen facility would be the release of a flammable gas mixture from the CO2 absorber column and a subsequent vapor cloud explosion.  The distance to the endpoint (overpressure of 1PSI) as determined by equations found in EPA's OCA Guidance document would impact public receptors.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for a flammable substance would be the same scenario as for worst case using the equations found in the OCA guidance document. This scenario would also impact public receptors.\n\n\n\nThe PCS Nitrogen facility has experienced six accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years.  The largest release was 2,243 pounds.  This release occurred on June 18, 2009 and lasted a duration of eighty minutes.
