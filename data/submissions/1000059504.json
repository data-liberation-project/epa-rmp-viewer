We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\r\n\r\n* A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\r\n* An overview of our accidental release prevention programs \r\n* A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\r\n* An overview of our emergency response program\r\n* An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases \r\n  from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\r\n* The certification that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide\r\n* The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program\r\n\r\n2.0  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nOur facility produces two PSM/RMP covered processes Oleum and Sulfur Dioxide, using a variety of chemicals and processing operations.  In our process, we produce or consume the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\r\n\r\nToxics\r\nOleum - 968,400 lbs. storage, used as a finished product and in the manufacture of sulfur dioxide\r\nSulfur Dioxide - 1,614,000 lbs. storage, used as a finished product\r\n \r\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use"

Our management systems address each of the key features of sucessful prevention programs including:\r\n\r\n* Process safety information\r\n* Process hazard analysis\r\n* Operating procedures\r\n* Training\r\n* Mechanical integrity\r\n* Management of change\r\n* Pre-startup safety review\r\n* Compliance audits\r\n* Incident investigation\r\n* Employee participation\r\n* Hot work permits\r\n* Contractors \r\n\r\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\r\n\r\n* Operators trained and tested in operating procedures for all chemical processes\r\n* Process controls to monitor and maintain chemical processes within specific parameters\r\n* Mitigation systems to mimimize potential releases\r\n* Monitoring systems including television cameras to alert personnel to potential releases and gas detection sensors\r\n\r\nThese elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\r\n  \r\n4.0  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility. PVS Chemical Solutions had one chemical release of sulfur dioxide in July 2014, due to our Make Tank Pump not being assembled correctly. 1 Loss Work Time injury did occur. Employee entered an area when warning alarms were going off indicating a hazard and inhaled SO2 fumes.The employee did report the incident to his supervisor. He expressed he was exposed to SO2, but did not indicate any further concern to go to for medical attention. Employee did not report his"

Following the incident various corrective actions took place onsite including the replacement the ansi-mag pump that failed, cause of failure investigation with manufacturer, training held with maintenance employees on proper installation, training with employees how to properly respond to an emergency, and other preventative measures to assure the safety of the workforce and the community and prevent this from reoccurring. \r\n\r\n5.0  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nWe maintain a comprehensive contingency plan which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the community emergency response plan.\r\n\r\n6.0  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of improvements that we are planning to implement at the facility to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\r\n\r\n* Continuous improvement program to evaluate chemical safety and release prevention systems."
