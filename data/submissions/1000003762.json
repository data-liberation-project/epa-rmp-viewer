The South District WWTP in bounded to the North by SW 232 Street, to the South by Black Creek Canal, to the West by SW 97 Avenue, and to the East by SW 87 Avenue.  The South District WWTP is located within the 10-mile radius evacuation zone of the Turkey Point Nuclear Power Plant.  The facility stores chlorine which is a regulated toxic substance under RMP rule.\n\n\nChlorine is delivered in one-ton containers to the South District WWTP chlorine building.  The chlorine building is divided into a covered chlorine storage area and a chlorination room.  The one-ton containers contain liquid chlorine under pressure.  The chlorine building is equipped to store up to 20 (containers) tons of chlorine.  The maximum quantity of chlorine present at the South District WWTP at any given time exceeds the listed threshold quantity in the RMP rule. It also exceeds the listed threshold quantity in Process Safety Management Standard.\n\nThe pressure from the stored chlorine in the cylinder forces liquid chlorine through the tubing and into the manifold system. During normal operation liquid chlorine flows from the cylinder through the chlorine pipeline to the evaporators located in the chlorinator room.  At the evaporators, the liquid chlorine is heated and converted into chlorine gas.  The evaporators are equipped with high and low temperature alarms, to ensure that normal temperature is maintained. Chlorine gas then flows from the evaporators through the temperature-actuated control valve to the chlorinators.  The chlorinators are used to control the feed rate of the chlorine gas.  The chlorinators are equipped with a gas Rotometer and v-notched orifice for controlling the feed rate.  Injection of the chlorine into the process water produces the concentrated chlorine solution that flows through Iron piping to the various injection points in the treatmen"

Additional manually-operated isolation valves are located throughout the chlorine system.\n\nThe leak detection and alarm system in the chlorine storage area and chlorinator room is activated when chlorine gas is sensed.  The leak detection system is set to activate the alarms when a chlorine concentration of 0.5 ppm or higher is detected.

The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are evaluated, and appropriate recommendations are implemented.  Information found during the investigation is reviewed by affected staff and used as needed to revise operating and maintenance procedures.\n\nFive-Year Accident History Summary\nNo reportable releases/accidents have occurred at the South District plant during the last 5 years.\n\nEmergency Response Program Summary\nThe MDWASD emergency response policy involves the preparation and maintenance of emergency response plans for hazardous materials, which are tailored to each facility, and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program Requirements.  South District WWTP has an Emergency Response Plan and Emergency Action Plan, that staff are trained on and MDWASD coordinates emergency planning with offsite response officials. Training is on-going.\n\nAll South District WWTP employees are trained as first responders.

Employees working with the chlorine process are HAZWOPER technician level trained, and receive Process Safety Management training, including training on SOPs, chlorine process safety features, and preventative maintenance procedures.  Management has been trained in Process Safety Management and the regulatory requirements of the Risk Management Planning and Process Safety Management rules.  \n\nDepending on the severity of the accidental release, external resources such as the Miami-Dade County Hazardous Material Team may be solicited to aid in handling chorine.  As part of the emergency response program, the South District WWTP has developed and implemented an emergency action plan and emergency response plan for the purpose of protecting employee safety, the public\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bfs health, and the environment.\n\nThe emergency response plan has been coordinated with local response agencies (Fire Department, Miami-Dade Department of Emergency Management and Homeland Security).  The main elements of the emergency response plan are: (1) chlorine release response flow chart, responsibilities of various personnel at the facility, duties of on-scene incident commander, site response team, and site safety representative, (2) details of emergency recognition and prevention at the facility, (3) procedures for planning and coordination with off-site emergency response organizations, and (4) details of the training program for all employees involved with the chlorination processes.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety \nNumerous changes to improve safety were previously identified for the chlorine process in 1997 for chlorination and system equipment and procedures, when Process Safety Management (PSM) Plans were prepared.  All of these recommended actions were evaluated for implementation as required. MDWASD is currently in the process of evaluating and implementing recommendations from the March 16, 2009 PHA.  \n\nMDWASD is committed to providing a safe and healthful work environment to"
