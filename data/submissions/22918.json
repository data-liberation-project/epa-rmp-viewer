Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored and distibuted for direct application as a crop production nutrient.\n\nThe maximum quantity stored in the three tanks at any one time would be a combined total of 145,860 pounds, with each tank holding 48,620 pounds. The maximum quantity received at any one time is one semi-trailer load holding approximately 42,000 pounds.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the entire contents of all three storage tanks being released over a ten minute time period. The maximum quantity released would be 145,860 pounds, which represents the volume of the three storage tanks at 85% capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.5 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is based of the most likely incident and involves a release from a ruptured transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200ppm) is .47 miles and involves the release of 2901 pounds over a 2 minute time period.\n\nThis facility has implemented the provisions of \" Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\", as well as requirements of the Kansas State Department of Agriculture.\n\nThere have been no a"
