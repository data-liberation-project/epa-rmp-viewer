      "SummaryText": "Cherokee Nitrogen Executive Summary\r\n\r\n1.0\tAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies: Cherokee Nitrogen is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\n2.0\tCherokee Nitrogen Company and Regulated Substances: Our facility's primary activities encompass the manufacture of ammonia and related processes.  Ammonia is a natural part of the life process.  It is produced internally by all humans and mammals to process essential proteins.  Ammonia is one of the most widely used industrial chemicals in the world and commonly used to purify water and refrigerate foods. The company is a supplier to the fertilizer, explosives, and commercial industries by manufacturing ammonium nitrate, ammonium nitrate solutions, and other products.   Cherokee Nitrogen markets its fertilizers to distributors, dealers, national farm retail chains, regional farm cooperatives, and other fertilizer producers for ultimate sale and delivery to farmers. We have three regulated substances present at our facility at or above threshold quantities.  These substances include ammonia (anhydrous), ammonia (conc. 20% or greater), and sulfur dioxide.  Ammonia (anhydrous) is used to manufacture nitric acid (<80 percent), urea, and aqua ammonia.  Ammonia (conc. 20% or greater) is contained within the letdown, urea, and ammonium nitrate solutions processes.  Sulfur dioxide is used to treat the outgoing process water prior to discharge from the facility. The chlorine water treatment process was removed from service and upgraded to new technologies incorporating a chlorine dioxide reactor process. As such, chlorine is no longer present at"

      "SummaryText": "or above threshold quantities. Additionally, based on process system design the chlorine dioxide present at the facility is below the threshold quantity of 1,000 lbs. Typically, the facility manufactures two types of ammonium nitrate solutions:  industrial - grade (83 weight percent) ammonium nitrate solution and a high-pressure solution consisting of 24 to 25 percent ammonia and 69 to 70 percent ammonium nitrate.  The industrial grade ammonium nitrate solution is used in the fertilizer industry and as a primary building block for commercial explosives and blasting agents.  Without this product, the mining of precious metals and gems, coal for power and concrete for construction would be much less safe and much more expensive. As this RMP will illustrate, our accidental release prevention programs and our emergency response planning efforts help us effectively manage any potential hazards posed by these regulated substances.\r\n\r\n3.0\tAccidental Release Prevention Program: Our facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with ASME codes.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\r\n\r\n3.1\tProcess Safety Information: Cherokee Nitrogen maintains a detailed record of process safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\r\n\r\n3.2\tProcess Hazard Analysis: Our facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is HAZOP.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and revalidated at a regular interval of every five years.  Any findings related to the ha"

During the past five years, Cherokee Nitrogen has not had an accidental chlorine release resulting in on-site or off-site consequences.\r\n\r\n6.0\tEmergency Response Programs: Cherokee Nitrogen maintains a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, facility security, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  To ensure proper functioning, emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response. Colbert County LEPC is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\r\n\r\n7.0\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety: Cherokee Nitrogen continually strives to improve and upgrade operating procedures, replace or maintain equipment, and develop and implement safety improvement projects.  Several developments have resulted from the implementation of our accidental release prevention program.  Some of the major steps planned to improve personnel and process safety at our facility include:  installation of flare system, compressor upgrades, boiler system/controls upgrades, a continuation of CPR and AED training, annual third party safety inspections and audits with corrective action and follow up, quarterly internal safety inspections with corrective action and follow up, continuation of safety steering committee, continued establishment of safety goals, plant wide monthly safety awareness meetings which focus on safety needs and input from all em"

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\r\n\r\n3.4\tTraining: Cherokee Nitrogen has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure employees operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\r\n\r\n3.5\tMechanical Integrity: Cherokee Nitrogen carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\n3.6\tManagement of Change: Written procedures and systems are in place at Cherokee Nitrogen to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.

These audits are carried out at least every 3 years, and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\n3.9\tIncident Investigation: Cherokee Nitrogen investigates any incident that has resulted in or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the root cause leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  \r\n\r\n3.10\tEmployee Participation: Cherokee Nitrogen truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, particularly, information resulting from process hazard analyses.\r\n\r\n3.11\tContractors: On occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.
