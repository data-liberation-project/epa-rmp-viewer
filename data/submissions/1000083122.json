This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\n2.0    Cherokee Nitrogen Company and Regulated Substances: Our facility's primary activities encompass the manufacture of ammonia and related processes.  Ammonia is a natural part of the life process.  It is produced internally by all humans and mammals to process essential proteins.  Ammonia is one of the most widely used industrial chemicals in the world and commonly used to purify water and refrigerate foods. The company is a supplier to the fertilizer, explosives, and commercial industries by manufacturing ammonium nitrate, ammonium nitrate solutions, and other products.   Cherokee Nitrogen markets its fertilizers to distributors, dealers, national farm retail chains, regional farm cooperatives, and other fertilizer producers for ultimate sale and delivery to farmers. We have three regulated substances present at our facility at or above threshold quantities.  These substances include ammonia (anhydrous), ammonia (conc. 20% or greater), and sulfur dioxide.  Ammonia (anhydrous) is used to manufacture nitric acid (<80 percent), urea, and aqua ammonia.  Ammonia (conc. 20% or greater) is contained within the letdown, urea, and ammonium nitrate solutions processes.  Sulfur dioxide is used to treat the outgoing process water prior to discharge from the facility. The chlorine water treatment process was removed from service and upgraded to new technologies incorporating a chlorine dioxide reactor process. As such, chlorine is no longer present at"

      "SummaryText": " or above threshold quantities. Additionally, based on process system design the chlorine dioxide present at the facility is below the threshold quantity of 1,000 lbs. Typically, the facility manufactures two types of ammonium nitrate solutions:  industrial - grade (83 weight percent) ammonium nitrate solution and a high-pressure solution consisting of 24 to 25 percent ammonia and 69 to 70 percent ammonium nitrate.  The industrial grade ammonium nitrate solution is used in the fertilizer industry and as a primary building block for commercial explosives and blasting agents.  Without this product, the mining of precious metals and gems, coal for power and concrete for construction would be much less safe and much more expensive. As this RMP will illustrate, our accidental release prevention programs and our emergency response planning efforts help us effectively manage any potential hazards posed by these regulated substances.\n\n\n\n3.0    Accidental Release Prevention Program: Our facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.
