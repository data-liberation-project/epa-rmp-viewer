(C&S) to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia that could cause harm to the public and the environment from short-term exposures.  The Plan includes an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release, a five-year accident history, and a release prevention and emergency response program.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe Plan identifies current operating procedures and policies in effect at C&S to minimize the potential for accidental releases of hazardous materials.  Emergency preparedness procedures including emergency response, spill mitigation, evacuation procedures, alarms, and emergency phone numbers have been implemented by C&S and are summarized in this Plan and the facility's Process Safety Management program and Emergency Action Plan.  \n\n\n\nThis Plan, the Emergency Action Plan, and Process Safety Management program document the accidental release prevention, safety, and emergency policies in place at C&S.\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nC&S is located at 6433 SE Lake Road in Milwaukie, Oregon (the facility).  The facility is situated within a commercial and residential area and occupies approximately sixty two acres of land.  The facility utilizes an ammonia refrigeration system to provide refrigeration for frozen foods.  The frozen foods warehouse is equipped with evaporators to keep desired areas cold.  Liquid ammonia is transferred from a high pressure receiver to the evaporator units through direct expansion valves.  The low pressure liquid is directed to evaporating units, or coils, to provide refrigeration for cold production and storage areas.  The ammonia system contains a maximum of approximately 11,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\nAmmonia is a listed substance regulated under the federal Risk Management Plan Program (40 CFR Part 68).

The Plan's purpose is to enhance the facility's existing safety programs implemented at the site to reduce the possibility of accidental releases of regulated substances that could cause harm employees, the public, and the environment.  The emergency response program includes accidental release prevention and chemical specific prevention steps.\n\n\n\nThe facility has safely operated in the City of Milwaukie since 1980.  C&S just took over operation of the facility in 2021. Key elements of the facility's safety program include written environmental health and safety procedures, employee training, and emergency response procedures.\n\n\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no qualifying accidents involving reportable listed substances in the five-year period prior to the completion of this Plan.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe facility coordinates emergency response activities with the Clackamas County Fire District.  The facility has established emergency evacuation procedures to evacuate the site and notify the appropriate agencies regarding a release.  The facility's emergency response program is documented in the facility's emergency action plan.  The emergency procedures contain the following key elements:\n\n\n\n1.  Procedures for informing the public and local agencies responsible for responding to accidental releases.\n\n2.  Information on emergency health care.\n\n"
