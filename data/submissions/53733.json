      "SummaryText": "Sacramento Metropolitan Utility District Financing Authority (SMUDFA) constructed the Cosumnes Power Plant (CPP), a nominal 500 megawatt, natural gas-fired, combined cycle power plant approximately 25 miles south south-east of Sacramento, California.  The facility will is operated by Wood Group Power Plant Services under contract to SMUDFA.\n\n\n\nThe facility is subject to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program because the amount of ammonia stored onsite (18,000 total tank , administratively controlled to 15,000 gallons of 29 percent ammonia, or approximately 32,625 pounds, as ammonia) exceeds the CalARP threshold quantity (TQ) of 500 pounds.  CPP is also subject to the federal Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements because aqueous ammonia is stored in concentrations of greater than 20 percent, and the total quantity of 32,625  pounds exceeds the federal TQ of 10,000 pounds.  Wood Group Power Plant Services prepared this RMP to satisfy CalARP and federal RMP requirements for the aqueous ammonia process at the CPP facility.  \n\n\n\nAmmonia Hydroxide (700 gallons of 19 percent ammonia (30-40 percent ammonia hydroxide) is also used as a boiler water treatment chemical on-site.  The material is stored in 350 gallon totes with a total of no more than 700 gallons at any one time.  This brings the total volume of aqueous ammonia onsite to 15,700 gallons, 117,750 total pounds, and 33,625 pounds as ammonia.  Both of these were considered one process but due to the inherent  of the aqueous ammonia storage tanks the worst case scenario, off-site consequence analysis assumed a complete release from this vessel.\n\n\n\nThe major hazards represented by the CPP aqueous ammonia process are the accidental release of ammonia, a toxic substance, due to spill or rupture of the storage vessel, associated piping system, or during a tanker truck unloading accident.\n\n\n\nWood Group Power Plant Services is concerned with the safety of its workers and individuals living and worki"

Wood Group Power Plant Services has therefore implemented a number of measures to ensure that it maintains a safe working environment.\n\n\n\nWood Group Power Plant Services prepared an Integrated Contingency Plan for the facility.  The Integrated Contingency Plan establishes the facility safety systems, procedures, and administrative controls necessary to prevent an accidental release of ammonia, respond to a release, and minimize the consequences of a release should one occur.\n\n\n\nWood Group Power Plant Services has developed a comprehensive safety training program for all employees, has established detailed material handling procedures, and has adopted safe operating procedures for aqueous ammonia off-loading, storage, and use.  Initial emergency response training of facility staff is complete.  \n\n\n\nThe ammonia process is monitored by the plant operator.  Ammonia detectors (4) with audible alarms are located adjacent to the ammonia storage tank.  The containment area is inspected daily by plant operators for evidence of spills, leaks, or other conditions that may lead to a release.\n\n\n\nA seismic analysis was conducted for CPP as part of the licensing process.  The CPP facility is designed and constructed to conform to the 2001 California Building Standards Code for Seismic Zone 3.  As part of the licensing process, the California Energy Commission (CEC) concluded that the CPP facility (including the aqueous ammonia system) will be adequately constructed to provide seismic safety in the event of an earthquake.\n\n\n\nThe power plant consists of two General Electric 7FA natural gas-fired combustion turbine generators (CTGs).  There are twenty full-time employees, and the facility will be manned 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) number for the CPP is 221112, Fossil Fuel Electric Power Generation.  CPP is located at 14295 Clay East Road in Herald, California.

CPP is located on the southeastern quarter of APN 140-0050-010 and on the southwestern quarter of APN 140-0050-008.  The site is zoned AG-80, which is compatible with the land use designation for a power generation facility. \n\n\n\nCPP uses aqueous ammonia (29 percent concentration by weight) as the reducing agent in the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) pollution control system to minimize emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) from the CTGs.  Aqueous ammonia (31 percent concentration by weight) is also used for pH control of the condensate system.  Aqueous ammonia is a hazardous substance regulated under the CalARP and federal RMP programs."
