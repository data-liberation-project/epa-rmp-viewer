Facility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe Lyondell North Charleston Distribution Terminal is a storage and redistribution facility for chemicals manufactured at other locations, and is a tenant facility within the DOW North Charleston Distribution Terminal.  The propylene oxide distribution system at the Lyondell North Charleston Distribution Terminal is managed/operated/maintained by DOW under contractual agreement with Lyondell.  There are no Lyondell or Covestro employees located at the North Charleston Distribution Terminal.  Covestro management at the South Charleston Plant provide instruction and direction to the DOW employees/contractors who operate the Lyondell North Charleston Distribution Terminal because a majority of the PO is owned by Covestro and is ultimately transferred into the Covestro PO distribution system at the South Charleston manufacturing facility for use by Covestro and DOW Chemical in their manufacturing units.  The PO that is not owned by Covestro is owned by Lyondell. The North Charleston Distribution Terminal facility is treated as a separate stationary source because the Kanawha River separates it from the South Charleston Manufacturing Plant; therefore, it is considered noncontiguous with the South Charleston Plant.  Lyondell ships propylene oxide from the Texas Gulf Coast by barge to the North Charleston Distribution Terminal for storage and subsequent transfer to the South Charleston Plant where it is used in Polyol manufacture by Covestro and as a raw material by DOW in several of its manufacturing units. \n\n\n\nIn summary the Covestro South Charleston facility has one (1) RMP listed toxic chemical (propylene oxide) and no RMP flammable chemicals.

Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no releases in the past five years with off-site consequences\n\n\n\ne.  Facility Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe Lyondell North Charleston Distribution Terminal consists of volunteer emergency response teams from DOW that work rotating shifts and straight days.  The goal is to have 3 - 6 emergency squad members always available on shift and this group is supplemented by straight day people, call outs and the Charleston Fire Department.  The DOW emergency squad people receive approximately 16 to 24 hours of on-site training annually with some disciplines receiving off-site training as well in specialized subjects, such as fire fighting, rescue, incident command and Hazmat.  In the case of a significant fire the Charleston Fire department would be involved.  The plant also participates in local fire and industrial mutual aid systems through the Kanawha Putnam Emergency Planning Committee (KPEPC). Community warning sirens are placed in multiple places in the Kanawha Valley and there is one within 1 mile of the plant. \n\n\n\nThe Lyondell North Charleston Distribution Terminal maintains a written emergency response program to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment.
