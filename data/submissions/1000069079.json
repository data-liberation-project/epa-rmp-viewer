This routine inspection identifies any potential concerns that could arise within the system.  If needed, repairs are made before they become problematic.  All employees are trained upon initial hiring to recognize the hazards associated with storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia, and annually there after.

Facility Policy.\n\n\n\n        The owners, management and employees of F.J. Krob & Company are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Buchanan County LEPC, and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2.    Facility Information.\n\n\n\n        The primary activity at the facility is the distribution of products to farmers.  The fertilizer product, anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in nurse tanks designed for this purpose.  The anhydrous ammonia facility is in operation on a seasonal basis only (approximately three months our of the year). The facility is manned during this time period.\n\n\n\n3.    The Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternate Release Scenario \n\n\n\nAn analysis of the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical worst-case and alternative-case accidental releases have been addressed in our Hazard Assessment and information is in our Risk Management Program.\n\n\n\n4.    Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\n        The facility is in compliance with the provisions of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\" and state regulations covering anhydrous ammonia.  The OSHA standard is referenced in this RMP Registration Form; see Section 8.3 (b).  In the event of an accidental release or emergency it is the policy of F.J. Krob & Company employees to immediately dial 911 to notify local emergency services.  \n\n\n\n5.
