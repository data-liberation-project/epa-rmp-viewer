The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a delivery truck holding 42,000 pounds.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of our storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity release would be 140,200 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint is 1.63 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario would be the failure of the loading hose which would release 11,908 pounds over two minutes. The distance to endpoint would be .6 miles.\n\nCentral Montana Co-op has implemented the provivsions of \"Safety Requirements of the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledgr, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage or envitonmental damage.\n\nCentral Montana Co-op's emergency response is provided to the "
