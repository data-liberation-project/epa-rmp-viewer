We are located in the NW section of Barrow County in a rural area.  The containers of chlorine are 2,000 pounds each, and have relief valves and excess flow valves as auxiliary equipment.\n\n2. Five Year Accident History\nWe have not had any accidents with Chlorine in the past five years.\n\n3. Worst and Alternative Case Scenarios\nThe worst case distance to endpoint for our process is 1.90 miles.  This distance goes beyond our property boundary.  More information is included in the program regarding parameters and how these distances were obtained.\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention\nThis facility complies with generally accepted measures for this business type, and all applicable state and federal laws.  Excess flow valves and emergency manual shutoffs have been installed as a proactive measure to prevent future accidental releases.\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\nOur employees will not respond in the event of a hazardous materials release.  We have a written Emergency Information and Procedure Manual to inform the City of Winder Fire Department through the use of 911.  We have arranged for them to respond to our emergencies involving Chlorine release.  The City of Winder Fire Department is equipped to handle a release to the magnitude in which the Chlorine is stored.\n\n6. Planned Improvements\nThe City of Winder has retained consultants to design a new chemical storage building to meet future state requirements and to provide better mitigation in the event of a release."
