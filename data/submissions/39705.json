The Facility Policy:  The owners, management, and employees of Nixon\u00bfs Crop Service are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections, and maintenance and training of all persons that work with the material.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated and is prepared to work with the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee, or other authorities, so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information:  The primary activity at this facility is the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The maximum quantity stored would be 142800 pounds in the facility\u00bfs 1 tank.\n\n3. The Accidental Release Program:  The facility complies with the rules and regulations relating to the handling of anhydrous ammonia, equipment, containers and storage facilities.  These regulations administered by the Missouri Department of Agriculture are consistent with ANSI K61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n4. The Five-year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site; nor to our knowledge, have any accidental releases resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n5. The Emergency Response Program:  The facility has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and provide state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III of EPCRA.  Our emergency response action plan has been re"

Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
