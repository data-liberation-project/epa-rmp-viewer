      "SummaryText": "A. Introduction\nThe Americus Plant is an ammoniated fertilizer production facility that unloads anhydrous ammonia and 44.8% nitrogen solution (25% aqua ammonia) railcars into storage tanks.  The ammonia and ammonia solution are then used in the production of fertilizers.  This facility has been on operation since 1911.\n\nThe Americus Plant has an excellent safety record with no deaths or serious injuries to plant personnel or contractors due to the RMP covered process.\n\nThe facility safety record is a direct result of much emphasis on safety in the plant on the part of management and employees.\n\nB. Accidental Release Prevention Policies and Program:\n\nThe facility is in compliance with OSHA PSM standards.  Information for P&ID drawings, operations procedures, Management of Change (MOC) documents, and other pertinent documents are on file at the plant office.  The Agrium U.S., Inc. EHS staff furnishes technical assistance and performs safety and environmental audits and training on a regular basis.\n\nThe ammonia tanks and associated equipment is covered by a mechanical integrity inspection and testing schedule and is constantly monitored.\n\nSafety meetings for all employees are held at the facility.  In addition to safety training classes, each employee has taken numerous computer-based safety training courses.  All supervisory positions are certified in First Aid and CPR.\n\nManagement personnel are actively involved in promoting safety and environmental awareness in the community through participation with the LEPC and coordination with the fire department.\n\nC. Emergency Response Policies and Program:\n\nThe Americus granulation facility employees are trained to be familiar with the Emergency Response policies and procedures through safety reviews and other plant safety meetings.  All plant personnel have received eight hours of awareness level training as directed by 29 CFR 1910.120.  The Emergency Response Plan is reviewed on an annual basis as part of the employee safet"

These policies and procedures are also revised to stay in compliance with changing government regulations.\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan is followed in the event of an emergency.  Included in this plan is the testing of the emergency system each month.\n\nLocal LEPC and the Americus Fire and Emergency Services personnel are furnished a copy of the Emergency Response Plan and are invited to tour the facility on a regular basis.\n\nThe facility Emergency Response Plan covers such things as accidental releases of plant chemicals, natural disasters, and emergency response practices and procedures.  The plan is reviewed each year with all employees and reviewed with the local fire department on a regular basis.\n\nThe Americus facility maintains an agreement with the Americus Fire and Emergency Services whose duty is to respond to chemical emergencies at the plant.\n\nD. Five Year Accident History\n\nThe Americus facility has an excellent safety record with no deaths or serious injuries to any of its personnel or contractors as a result of the RMP covered process.  In addition, there have been no accidents resulting in releases of ammonia with off-site consequences.  Extensive programs and procedures are in place to maintain that record.\n\nE. Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nThe plant continously looks for ways to enhance the safety of the plant.  Monthly safety inspections are conducted which result in corrective actions; Process Safety Management audits are conducted every three years; along with annual Agrium reviews conducted by the environmental health and safety department.\n\nF. Summary\n\nThe employees are extremely proud of the safety record and the vast improvements in both safety and environmental efforts made over the last twenty years.  We believe that with the programs and policies in place, and the continued efforts of 100% of our pe"
