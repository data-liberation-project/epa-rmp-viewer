As the 2nd largest warehousing and logistics provider in the U.S., Lineage Logistics has the scope to serve highly varied customer needs across many different regions. With 60+ facilities and 290 million cubic feet, we already provide solutions for many of the largest food customers in the U.S. We have demonstrated the ability to grow our platform, expand our capabilities, and increase our markets served quickly to meet the needs of our customer base. Built upon a legacy of family values and integrity, our mission is to provide innovative, world-class customer service and a safe, enjoyable workplace. Our vision is to be the world's most dynamic temperature-controlled logistics company.\n\n\n\nLineage Logistics' senior management is not only committed to offering superior service, but also to maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities. Lineage Logistics' safety and environmental policies as they relate to the ammonia refrigeration system are administered by the Senior Vice President of Engineering, who conducts inspections of the facility to ensure compliance.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at 2323 Port Road A in Stockton, California was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the Uniform Fire and Mechanical Codes at the time of construction (the facility began operations in January 2009).  \n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is a closed system that cycles the refrigerant from liquid to gas and back again.  The system, consisting of vessels, piping, valves, and process equipment, cycles 20,000 pounds of ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then ba"

The majority of the system is located in the engine room including vessels and compressors.  The condensers are mounted on the roof, and the evaporators are located in their respective cold storage areas.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Lineage Logistics ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with Cal/OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.  The facility conducts maintenance and any necessary minor repairs in house, but an outside contractor is hired for major repairs.\n\n\n\nThe facility including the ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code, which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety features include ammonia sensors in the engine room as well as sensors near the evaporators, and automatic shut down systems.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine room and just outside of the engine room (condensers).  All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that are commonly piped to the water diffusion tank.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, Lineage Logistics has developed a preventive maintenance program to complete regularly scheduled inspections and tests of the ammonia refrigeration system as well as repairs as needed to process equipment.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\n\n\n\nThe Lineage Logistics facility has an emergency response plan in effect.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) has been developed by Lineage Logistics and is included in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP/CalARP document which is maintained at the facility.

To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe Lineage Logistics facility maintains a safety committee whose members include the designated incident commander for the facility and the maintenance department at a minimum.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan is reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\n\n\n\nLineage Logistics is non-responding and the facility plans to coordinate emergency response efforts with the fire department on a periodic and ongoing basis.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe EPA's RMP Program defines \"accident\" as the following:\n\n\n\n\"The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process.\n\n\n\nThe release must have caused at least one of the following:\n\n\n\n?    On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (?68.42(a)); or\n\n?    Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (?68.42(a)).\"\n\n\n\nBased on the above definition and an investigation into the facility's accident history conducted at the time of the Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation (December 12, 2013), there have been no significant releases of ammonia that met the criteria above or exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds in the last five years (December 2008 - December 2013). \n\n\n\nThe facility experienced a minor incident on January 17, 2012.

An investigation into the incident revealed that the leak resulted from a faulty weld.  No recommendations regarding the incident were made.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe initial Process Hazards Analysis (performed on December 18-19, 2008) and Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation (performed December 12, 2013), including a Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study and a Facility Inspection, provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the Lineage Logistics facility. The Lineage Logistics safety committee is planning to complete several items over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n\n\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility safety plan/programs.\n\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in safety plan development.\n\n3. Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n\n4. Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed.\n\n \n\nDATA ELEMENTS NOTES: \n\n\n\nItem number 7.11b has been intentionally left blank.
