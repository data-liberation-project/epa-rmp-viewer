Specifically, Rubicon LLC is located on Highway 75 about 1 mile south of the intersection of Highway 75 and Highway 73.  Rubicon employs over 600 people including contract workers and manufactures chemicals that produce three main products: 1. Polyurethanes, 2. Antioxidant Additives, and 3. Maleic Anhydride.  These products have a wide variety of commercial uses including automotive, marine, building materials, appliances, footwear, and sporting goods.\n\n\n\nRubicon handles six regulated chemicals above the Risk Management Program (RMP) threshold in its chemical manufacturing processes.  These chemicals are ammonia, chlorine, ethylene oxide, formaldehyde, phosgene, and propylene oxide .\n\n\n\nThe 24 hour emergency contact listed in Section 1.8 of the RMP Plan is the Polyols Unit Shift Foreman which is an on-site shift foreman position that is manned at all times.   Mitch Latuso, Bobby Martinez, Darren Jackson, and  Ty Gaines currently fill this position. \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nRubicon's philosophy is that it is the responsibility of management and all other employees to operate safe, clean and efficient facilities in an environmentally and socially responsible manner.  This is achieved by striving for continuous improvement through the implementation of programs such as Responsible Care and the OSHA Voluntary Protection Program (VPP).  Rubicon has achieved the Star among Stars Qualifier designation under VPP .  Other elements of this philosophy include ensuring that all employees have received adequate training on their Environmental Health & Safety (EHS) responsibilities and that all employees are held accountable for their EHS performance.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nRubicon is subject to several EPA and OSHA regulat"

Rubicon has management systems in place that provide for the assessment of risks associated with the manufacturing and handling of chemicals and for the continuous improvement of associated processes.  Rubicon's philosophy is prevention first, through the use of good engineering design and nationally accepted standards.  In addition, Rubicon conducts process hazard analyses, establishes EHS and unit operating policies and procedures, utilizes continuous process control and monitoring, and performs inspection and testing of equipment.  \n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nRubicon has had three incidents within the last five years:\n\nOn October 10, 2010, a leak developed in the MDI 1 unit on a flange on the degasser reflux line.  The line contained chlorobenzene which was released to secondary containment.  Phosgene (0.6 pounds) was released to the air when vapors backed up from the degasser to the flange.  No Federal or State reportable quantities were exceeded.  The phosgene did not leave the facility based on a review of phosgene building monitor alarm history at the buildings near the plant perimeter in the down wind direction. The incident was reported because of potential offsite impact based on release modeling indicating offsite phosgene movement toward Lion Copolymer (down wind plant).  Lion Copolymer was instructed to shelter-in-place by Rubicon as a precautionary measure during the event.\n\n\n\nOn September 24, 2013, a temporary power surge caused the Distributive Computer Control System in the Reductions unit to shut down. This caused the DPA 2 Aniline Stripper to overpressure and relieve through the pressure safety valve.  The pressure safety valve released 1,370 pounds of aniline and 28 pounds of ammonia over a 32 minute period.  The percentage of ammonia in the stream is 2% which is greater than the 1% Risk Management Program rule threshold.  The Ascension P"

Modeling indicated that the ammonia did not reach ground level off of the Rubicon facility.  The Ascension Parish 911 dispatcher followed an incorrect response protocol and called for industrial sites downwind of the release to shelter in place.\n\n\n\nOn May 12, 2014 a unexpected power outage caused the MDI 2 unit to lose power. This caused a mixture of phosgene/hydrochloric acid gas to enter the MDI test tank. The MDI test tank overpressured and relieved through the pressure safety valve. The pressure safety valve released 0.5 pounds of phosgene and 7 pounds of hydrochloric acid over a 24 minute period. The Ascension Parish Sherriff's Office was noticed of a site alert that is expected to impact offsite receptors. Public roads surrounding the facility were closed during the incident. The surrounding industrial facilities were instructed to shelter in place. Modeling indicated that the phosgene and hydrochloric acid did not travel off of the Rubicon facility. \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nRubicon's emergency response program is based on the philosophy of prevention, preparation and response.  Some practices at Rubicon for preventing situations that could possibly lead to an emergency incident are the use of good engineering design and nationally accepted standards, conducting process hazard analyses, safety procedures, the management of change system, unit operating policies and procedures, continuous process control and monitoring, inspection and testing of equipment and preventative maintenance of equipment.  The second and third elements of Rubicon's emergency response program are preparation and response.  Preparing for emergency situations at Rubicon includes exercises and drills for the training of the internal emergency response units.  The internal emergency response units are the Fire Brigade, HAZMAT personnel with equipped van, medical first responders "

Formal written fire and release preplans have been developed to assist training and drill scenarios.  A plant-wide evacuation drill for all employees is performed at least once per year.\n\n\n\nAnother important aspect of preparation for an emergency is communication.  Rubicon has the following internal communication systems: 888 emergency notification telephone system, two way radios, public announcement system in the units, fire alarms, gas alarms, telephones, cellular telephones and faxes.  External communication systems include the telephone tie lines with neighboring chemical plants, Geismar Area Mutual Aid (GAMA) radio, the telephone system with backup switch and power, cellular telephones, and the use of 911.  Upon dialing 911, Rubicon can activate all or part of the Community Awareness Emergency Response (CAER) emergency sirens that are designed to be heard within an approximate radius of 2.5 miles of each plant in the area where the CAER chemical facilities are located.  Rubicon can also activate the computerized Emergency Telephone Alerting System provided by the Community Alert Network (CAN) for Ascension Parish. In addition, the Emergency Broadcast System (television and/or radio) can be activated by dialing 911.  These external communication systems inform and coordinate efforts with neighboring chemical plant, the Ascension Parish Sheriff Department, Ascension Parish Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, the Louisiana State Police and/or the general public.\n\n\n\nRubicon works closely with outside authorities and other neighboring companies to coordinate emergency response.

GAMA also has reciprocal agreements for equipment exchange with the St. James Mutual Aid and Baton Rouge Area Mutual Aid Systems.  Rubicon performs annual training with most of these organizations or provides information necessary for coordinated emergency response.\n\n\n\nRubicon has also developed formal emergency action plans such as the SPC/SPCC Plan, RCRA Contingency Plan, and the One Plan for emergency situations.  Rubicon also has emergency internal procedures that address Emergency Action and Crisis Management, Emergency Brigade, 888 Emergency Notification Telephone System, Radiation Sources, Plant-wide Evacuation, Bomb Threats, and Hurricanes and Parking Area Emergency Notification System.  Preplanned emergency responses are practiced and are used during release drill scenarios.  Other response practices include utilizing wind socks to determine wind direction, the SAFER System for air dispersion modeling of a toxic gas release, sampling on-site and off-site by HAZMAT response personnel, the phosgene detection monitoring system in occupied buildings, water deluge systems for fire and toxic air release suppression, equipment and operating unit shutdown systems and waste handling procedures.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nRubicon's current philosophy on major safety improvements is to evaluate the use of pipelines in place of tank trucks or rail cars for transportation of chemicals.
