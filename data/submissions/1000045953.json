The facility uses chlorine to react with contaminants in molten metal baths so that the contaminants can be removed.  Chlorine is the only CalARP (19 CCR) and RMP (40 CFR) regulated material on site.  Chlorine is considered a toxic gas for the purposes of the regulations.\r\n\r\nChlorine is stored in the form of a gas liquified under pressure.  It is stored in two stationary storage tanks with a total maximum storage capacity of  74,000 pounds together.  Typically the tanks are not filled to capacity. From these tanks, chlorine is converted to a gas and fed at approximately 40 psi via piping to production areas on the property.\r\n\r\nThe site's accidental release prevention policy is accomplished by implementing measures as required by CalARP, 40 CFR, and California's Process Safety Management (PSM) rules.  Preventive maintenance, inspections and employee training are considered critical.  The site maintains a prevention program at the RMP program 3 level.  This includes the following elements:  process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating and mechanical integrity procedures, training, management of change, pre-startup review, compliance audits, incident investigation, employee participation,contractor safety, and hot work permits.  Each of these elements consists of written procedures, policies, and practices that are maintained in order to ensure the integrity and safety of the chlorine system.\r\n\r\nAccidental releases are mitigated, and emergency response is facilitated, primarily through the use of chlorine sensors throughout the facility.  The sensors trigger an alarm so that proper actions can be taken.   In some cases, the sensors also trigger a system shutdown.\r\n\r\nThe facility's policy on emergency response is that actions will be taken only to to correct small problems if it is within the job scope and capabilities of available trained staff.

However, the site maintains a written emergency response program to meet other OSHA-based requirements.  That document covers chlorine and other emergencies that might occur.
