ANGUS currently stores five RMP chemicals above threshold quantities: three toxics (sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, and ammonia) and two flammables (propane and trimethylamine). Additionally, future facility operations will include a new RMP chemical, acetaldehyde (CAS No. 75-07-0). \n\nAcetaldehyde will be used as part of a new production campaign and is expected to be present onsite above threshold quantities on November 11, 2024.  During this update, the offsite consequence analysis for each toxic and flammable chemical was reviewed and confirmed to still be accurate.  However, the Flammables Alternative Release Scenario has been updated to include acetaldehyde. \n\n1.0\tThe Stationary Source, Applicability and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe ANGUS facility is a chemical manufacturer located in the northeast corner of Ouachita Parish, Sterlington, Louisiana. The facility uses propane, nitric acid, and ammonia to produce nitroparaffins and its derivatives.  The facility operations consist of a Nitroparaffins Unit, a Nitric Acid Unit, a nitroparaffins derivatives unit, a Crystallization Unit, an Isopropyl Hydroxylamine (IHPA) Unit and a Hydrogen Generation unit.  The facility also includes support units including a shipping facility and a pilot plant.\n\nThe 40 CFR 68 standard applies to stationary sources as defined in Section 112(r)(2)(c) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) that store a regulated substance within a \u0093process\u0094 in an amount above the threshold quantity as it is defined in Table 1-4 of 40 CFR 68.130.  ANGUS is a stationary source as defined by the CAA at Section 112(r)(2)(c) that holds RMP"

These regulated substances include three toxics (sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, and ammonia) and three flammables (propane, trimethylamine and acetaldehyde). \n\nThe provisions of 40 CFR 68 contain three unique \u0093Program\u0094 levels that define the requirements to which each facility must comply.  Program 1 processes are those that would not impact public receptors in the event of a worst-case release and have had no accidents with specific off-site consequences within the past five years.  Program 2 processes are those that are not subject to either Program 1 or 3.  Program 3 processes are those facilities that are not eligible for Program 1 status and are subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program or listed in one of ten specified National American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes.  The NAICS code for the facility (325199) is one of the listed codes and the facility is covered under OSHA\u0092s PSM standard, thus the ANGUS facility is subject to RMP Program 3 requirements. ANGUS is subject to OSHA PSM regulations at 29 CFR 1910.119.  \n\n2.0\tAccidental Chemical Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe ANGUS Chemical Company is strongly committed to maintaining high standards of employee, public, and environmental safety and protection.  The prevention of accidental chemical releases is an integral and important part of the ANGUS policies, and it has established a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers such areas as process design, system installations, operating procedures, maintenance practices, and employee training, as they apply to each one of its operating units and support facilities at the Sterlington location.  \n\nANGUS ensures the safety of plant operations using PSM techniques, including but not limited to:\n\n* Periodic process hazard analyses (PHA's) of production, utilities, and shipping operations \n* Strict adherence to Management of Ch"
