Continuous Release -- chlorine can be\r\n               released from a point source over a period of\r\n               time.  An example of such a release is a leak\r\n               through a faulty flanged joint.  Such a leak\r\n               will get worse until the condition is\r\n               corrected.  Until that time the down-wind\r\n               hazards will continue.\r\n\r\n          B.   Slug Release -- a slug release will occur if\r\n               a vessel incurs a large puncture or ruptures.\r\n               Large quantities of chlorine will be\r\n               discharged in a short time.  In the case of a\r\n               puncture in the upper (vapor) portion of the\r\n               vessel about one-fourth of the liquid\r\n               (depending on the liquid temperature) will\r\n               rapidly evaporate or flash off.

This committee makes its\r\n     recommendations for health and safety issues that\r\n     include investigations of injuries/accidents.  Bowling\r\n     Green Municipal Utilities insures that each employee\r\n     upon being hired is issued an employee handbook, in\r\n     which this book explains many benefits, employment\r\n     rules, insurance plans, work hours and policies.\r\nTRAINING"
