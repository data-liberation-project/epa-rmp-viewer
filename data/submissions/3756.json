The\n\n     Safety Director is responsible for the overall\n\n     development, administration and supervision of\n\n     activities required by OSHA, EPA, DOT and other federal\n\n     and state agencies, to safeguard all BGMU employees.\n\n     There are Safety Officers at the Treatment Plants, with\n\n     their primary job consisting in Plant Operations and\n\n     then secondary as Safety, in which they coordinate all\n\n     inspections, safety equipment and employee assistance\n\n     in safety at the Treatment Plants.\n\nPROGRAM ADMINISTRATION\n\n     Bowling Green Municipal Utilities on April 27, 1989\n\n     hired a full-time Safety Director so that BGMU could\n\n     develop and implement a written Safety Program.  With\n\n     the hiring be completed, the major obstacle was\n\n     achieving compliance in the OSHA, EPA and DOT\n\n     regulations so that BGMU and all the employees would\n\n     have a safe and healthful work environment.  To this\n\n     date the Safety Department now handles all of the\n\n     compliance programs in the Electric, Water and Sewer\n\n     Divisions, with the only exception being environmental\n\n     issues that directly involve the Industrial Wastewater\n\n     Pretreatment Program, which the Industrial Pretreatment\n\n     Director handles.  Bowling Green Municipal Utilities\n\n     initialized a Safety Committee on October 26, 1994\n\n     starting with a member from each work area for a total\n\n     of 10 members.  This committee makes its\n\n     recommendations for health and safety issues that\n\n     include investigations of injuries/accidents.  Bowling\n\n     Green Municipal Utilities insures that each employee\n\n     upon being hired is issued an employee handbook, in\n\n     which this book explains many benefits, employment\n\n     rules, insurance plans, work hours and policies.\n\nTRAINING\n\n"

In the case\n\n               of a puncture in the liquid phase, liquid\n\n               will be expelled through the hole until the\n\n               liquid drops to the lip of the opening.  Most\n\n               of the liquid expelled will \"flash off\" as it\n\n               comes out of the tank, but some may spill on\n\n               the ground.  The evaporation rate of the\n\n               spilled liquid depends on heat input from the\n\n               ground and from the sun.  Reducing the\n\n               surface area of the spill will reduce the\n\n               evaporation rate.  The addition of water\n\n               streams will provide additional heat and will\n\n               increase the evaporation rate.\n\n\n\n     Area Affected\n\n\n\n          Mathematical modeling has been done to estimate\n\nthe dispersion characteristics               of chlorine gas\n\ncloud from a release.  The area and exposure duration depend\n\nupon the total quantity released, the rate of release, the\n\nheight of the release              point, and weather\n\nconditions.  These factors are difficult to evaluate in an\n\nemergency situation.  Chlorine downwind can vary from barely\n\ndetectable to            high concentrations.\n\n\n\n     Effect of Chlorine on the Environment\n\n\n\n          A.   Vegetation - chlorine causes bleached spots\n\n               on leafy plants due to attack on chlorophyll\n\n               in the leaf.  Mature leaves are most\n\n               susceptible to chlorine injury.  Usually the\n\n               plant itself is not destroyed although yield\n\n               or growth rate may be retarded.\n\n\n\n          B    Animals - The U.S. National Institute for\n\n               Occupational Safety and Health 1980 \"Registry\n\n               of Toxic Effects of Chemical Substances\"\n\n               lists the following inhalation LC50's\n\n               (concentration of chlorine in air lethal to\n\n               50% of the defined animal, exposed over the\n\n               specified time pe"

Chlorine may be passed into and absorbed by a\n\nsolution of caustic soda or soda ash.  Each 100 pounds of\n\nchlorine to be absorbed requires either at least 125 pounds\n\nof caustic soda dissolved in about 42 gallons of water or\n\n300 pounds of soda ash dissolved in about 100 gallons of\n\nwater.\n\n\n\nIf the chlorine cannot be consumed or absorbed, the capped\n\nor plugged container should be removed to a remote area.\n\nConsult with the chlorine supplier immediately & arrange for\n\nultimate disposal.\n\n\n\n                 CHLORINE KIT B LIMITATIONS\n\n                              \n\nSome ton containers in current use are of such design that\n\napplication of kit \"B\" devices might be difficult or\n\nimpossible.
