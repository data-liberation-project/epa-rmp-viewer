Executive Summary \n\nThe Blue Ridge Paper Products, Inc. (BLUE RIDGE) Canton Mill is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for Canton Mill workers, the public, and the environment. The Canton Mill has operated under environmental and workplace health and safety policies to serve as guiding principles for it's employees and operations. BLUE RIDGE strives to minimize the environmental impacts of all our operations, processes, and products in a manner responsive to the needs of our shareholders, customers, employees, the communities in which we operate, and the public.\"\n\nAs part of this commitment, BLUE RIDGE has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at BLUE RIDGE and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, \"Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs\" (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at BLUE RIDGE.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at BLUE RIDGE.\n\nThe risk management program at BLUE RIDGE consists of three elements:\n1. a hazard assessment to help understand the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and a history of accidents that have occurred during the "

In fact, BLUE RIDGE has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance and injuries and damage from a release of a hazardous substance.\n\nBLUE RIDGE limits the use of hazardous substances.  Before using a hazardous substance at BLUE RIDGE, less hazardous alternatives are considered. Part of BLUE RIDGE'S RMP compliance philosophy has been the reduction of the use of hazardous substances covered under this regulation. When a hazardous substance is used, BLUE RIDGE considers the potential for this substance to adversely affect BLUE RIDGE workers, the public, and the environment and takes steps to prevent any such effects.\n\nBLUE RIDGE works to prevents releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  When a hazardous substance is used at BLUE RIDGE, the equipment is designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\n\nBLUE RIDGE limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.

This RMPlan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at BLUE RIDGE that are required by the RMP rule.\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nBLUE RIDGE is committed to the safety of workers and the public, and the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  BLUE RIDGE implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes at BLUE RIDGE; and programs to evaluate the hazards at BLUE RIDGE.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, BLUE RIDGE controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help limit injury to the public or the environment.  BLUE RIDGE provides response training to BLUE RIDGE personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local fire department. The Canton Mill maintains a Emergency Response Team that is trained and equipped to respond to on-site chemical releases. Response activities have also been discussed with the local emergency response agencies.\n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, BLUE RIDGE established a management system headed by the mill's Operations Manager to oversee safety-related activities.\n\n1.2 BLUE RIDGE and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Canton Mill is an integrated pulp and paper mill primarily involved in the manufacture of bleached pulp and related finished paper products.

The RMP regulations require that such an analysis include an evaluation of both worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  BLUE RIDGE does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur. However in accordance with the RMP requirements, a worst case release analysis was conducted and the results are reported in this document.  The alternative release scenarios evaluated are intended to represent releases that might occur and were based on our experience at our mill. The alternative release scenarios were selected to help the local emergency response agencies improve community emergency response plans.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) might occur at a facility like BLUE RIDGE's and (2) would result in the greatest potential offsite consequences if the release occurred.  \n\nWhile BLUE RIDGE believes that such releases are unlikely to occur at our mill, nevertheless we have evaluated the offsite impact of the releases in accordance with the regulatory requirements.\n\nBLUE RIDGE has conducted the offsite consequence analysis for the worst-case release scenario using the EPA's guidance document which includes look-up tables that were developed to provide highest estimate of the possible offsite consequences of such releases.

The tables were developed to provide information on the estimated distance to the toxic endpoint for a chemical of concern. BLUE RIDGE has not conducted a more detailed analysis of these scenarios because we believe the potential for such releases is unlikely and because more refined analysis of such events will not provide additional information that would be useful.\n\nWhile the tables provide the required data to meet regulatory requirements, they do not provide detailed information on the travel time or concentration of the chemical in the plume.  BLUE RIDGE believes such data can be valuable to local emergency planning agencies for alternative release scenarios and therefore has elected to conduct air quality modeling to characterize offsite impacts due to alternative release scenarios. A model is a mathematical estimate of the way a chemical plume moves and reacts after it is released to the air. The air quality model provides more realistic and detailed information on estimated plume dimensions, concentration of pollutants by downwind distance, time of travel and the location of the plume at discreet time intervals. These data have been provided to the local emergency response agencies to assist them in planning for any actions that should be taken if, the unlikely event of an accident should occur at Canton Mill. \n\nBLUE RIDGE selected two models to evaluate off-site impacts:  an EPA approved screening model known as SCREEN3 and TRACE. TRACE is a comprehensive hazard assessment software package for analyzing the impact of toxic, flammable and explosive chemical releases in the atmosphere.  TRACE can simulate toxic chemical releases resulting from tank failures and pipe leaks for gases that are heavier than air or for neutrally buoyant gasses.

The same model was also used to evaluate the potential off-site impact of a release of chlorine due to a leak in a valve or line connected to a 2000 pound chlorine storage container.\n\nTypical information input to the model to characterize a chemical release is:\n\n* Physical State:  gas, liquid, aerosol, and multi-phased\n* Release Type:  continuous, instantaneous, point (stack releases), and area (releases from a pool)\n* Release Condition:  height, substrate type (concrete, soil), area and height of berm, exit velocity, release diameter, and exit temperature\n* Chemical Properties:  molecular weight, specific gravity, vapor pressure, density, latent heat, and other properties depending upon the model\n\nIn addition to the physical parameters that characterize a release, meteorological data is needed by the model to characterize the ambient release conditions.  Meteorological data is used in dispersion models to calculate the distance that the pollutant plume moves downwind and the concentration of the pollutant at any given time or distance.  The meteorological variables that affect the dispersion of a chemical release are as follows:\n\n* Wind Speed and Direction: The wind speed is used to determine the plume dilution, plume transport, plume rise, evaporation rate, and magnitude of the concentration.  Wind direction defines the direction in which the plume travels.\n* Temperature:  Temperature is used to calculate plume rise and evaporation rates.\n* Atmospheric Pressure: is used to calculate gas and liquid release rates.\n* Atmospheric Stability: Stability is an indication of atmospheric turbulence.  The turbulence is depended upon thermal (heating of the ground) and mechanical (surface roughness and wind speed) effects.

The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less.\n\nWhen considering the release of a toxic substance, most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are likely.  Some people who are particularly susceptible to the substance released could be incapacitated.\n\nWhen considering explosion of a flammable substance, people at the endpoint distance are likely to be knocked down by the blast.  Windows at the distance could shatter, and the potential for structural damage to buildings exists, although a building collapse is unlikely.  People could be seriously injured by being knocked down by the force of the blast, by flying glass, or by falling objects.\n\nWhen considering the fire hazard of a flammable substance, people at the endpoint distance are likely to receive second-degree burns over the exposed parts of their bodies if they cannot quickly find cover or otherwise escape the heat of the flame.  These burns are likely to require hospitalization.\n\nThe RMP rule includes specific requirements for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by BLUE RIDGE.

Many of the operating parameters are included in the operating procedures to help with the safe operation of the process.  These documents are used (1) to train employees, (2) to perform process hazards analyses, and (3) to help maintain the equipment.\n\n2.     Process Hazard Analysis. The Canton Mill performs and periodically updates process hazard analyses (PHAs) of the covered processes to help identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.  A team composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a leader with process hazard analyses experience is assembled to analyze the hazards of the process.  BLUE RIDGE primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) technique, supplemented with checklists, to perform this analysis.

The solution is assumed to flow beyond containment curbing and sewers and form a pool of chlorine dioxide solution, which evaporates and forms a vapor cloud. The actual quantity of chlorine dioxide in the solution (10,700 lbs.) would be released to atmosphere over a 10 minute period. The scenario results in off-site impacts to both public and environmental receptors. \n\nThe alternative release scenario for the Chlorine Dioxide System process is a valve or flange leak from the piping system.  Operators would be notified of a release by chlorine dioxide monitors located throughout the process area.  Local drains and sewers would limit the extent of spread of the water solution, limiting the vaporization of chlorine dioxide. Approximately 300 lbs. of chlorine dioxide would be released from the time the incident began, until emergency responders would stop the leak 30 minutes later. The off-site impact would affect public receptors, but does not affect any environmental receptors\n\nThe alternative release scenario for the Chlorine Water Treatment process is shearing off a valve on a 1-ton chlorine container."

Beginning in 1992, the Canton Mill formally implemented the 14 elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) prevention program. In 1996, the EPA RMP rule established two levels of prevention program requirements.  BLUE RIDGE has implemented the prevention program requirements, which are as follows:\n\nProgram 3 level processes - essentially the same as OSHA PSM, except that the program also focuses on protecting the public and the environment.  Program 3 requires 12 of the 14 elements of the OSHA PSM regulation.  This prevention program has been established for the Chlorine Dioxide System and Chlorine Water Treatment System\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of BLUE RIDGE'S prevention program that address the EPA RMP rule prevention program requirements. \n\n1.4.1 Program 3 Prevention Program\n\nThe Canton Mill Program 3 prevention program, which applies to the  Chlorine Dioxide System and the Chlorine Water Treatment System processes, consists of the following 12 elements:\n\n1.    Process Safety Information.  BLUE RIDGE maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of the covered processes.  These documents address (1) physical properties of hazardous substances handled in these processes, (2) operating parameters of the equipment/process and (3) design basis and configuration of the equipment in a part.

The operating procedures are used both to help in operating the covered processes and as a training guide for both new and experienced operators.  Operating procedures are updated at least annually to ensure they reflect current operating conditions.\n\n4.    Training. The mill trains workers to perform their assigned tasks safely and effectively. The BLUE RIDGE training program includes both initial and refresher training that covers (1) a general overview of the process, (2) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process, and (3) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices.  Oral reviews and written tests are used to verify that an employee understands the process operation prior to job assignment.\n\nThe operators are consulted annually during operating procedure reviews to evaluate the effectiveness and need for additional training.  Recommendations from the operators are reviewed, and changes to the training program are implemented, as appropriate.\n\n5.    Mechanical Integrity.  BLUE RIDGE maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment.  This is accomplished by: (1) an inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before the equipment fails, (2) a quality assurance program to help ensure that new and replacement equipment meet the design standards required for service in the covered processes and (3) utilizing personnel who are specially trained to maintain process equipment.  \n\n6.

All other changes must be reviewed through the full management of change program, to help ensure that inadvertent consequences of process changes are prevented, safety consequences of changes are addressed, affected process safety information and procedures are updated, and affected employees are notified of the changes.\n\n7.    Pre-startup Review.  BLUE RIDGE performs a safety review of a new or modified process before the process is placed into service to help ensure that the process is safe to operate.  This review confirms that an employee has completed the requisite training.  The review also confirms that adequate safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and that construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications.  A pre-startup review checklist is completed to document the review and to ensure that appropriate issues have been addressed.\n\n8.    Compliance Audit.   BLUE RIDGE audits covered processes to be certain that the BLUE RIDGE prevention program is effectively addressing the safety issues for the covered processes.  BLUE RIDGE assembles an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the RMP rule and in the process. This team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the RMP rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process.

Employees are consulted on and informed about various aspects of the RMP rule prevention program, including PHAs and operating procedures. \n\n11.    Hot Work Permits.  BLUE RIDGE uses a hot work permit program to control spark- or flame-producing activities that could result in fires or explosions in covered processes at the Canton Mill. BLUE RIDGE reviewed OSHA's fire prevention and protection requirements in 29 CFR 1910.252(a) and created a Hot Work Permit Form to comply with these requirements.

The following paragraphs describe some of these safety features. \n\nExample-Chlorine.   Chlorine is supplied to the (insert the name of the mill) Mill in DOT-approved 1-ton containers. Chlorine detectors and alarms are provided in areas where chlorine could be present if a release occurs.   These alarms sound at the chlorine area, and also on operator control displays, which are constantly monitored to help ensure quick response. \n\nExample-Chlorine Dioxide.  Chlorine dioxide gas is produced in the chlorine dioxide generator and piped to an water absorber column, where a 1.2 wt % chlorine dioxide solution is generated. Chlorine dioxide is produced at the BLUE RIDGE-Canton Mill and stored as a dilute water solution to avoid transporting large quantities of the solution.  Storing the chemical in a water solution greatly reduces the potential for off-site impact.  Containment sewers are provided in all areas where chlorine dioxide is used. Detectors and alarms provide continuous monitoring in all areas where the potential for chlorine dioxide exists, providing early detection and helping to ensure a quick response in the event of a leak.\n\n1.5 Five-Year Accident History\n\nBLUE RIDGE has completed a five-year accident history that indicates continued improvement in safe operations at BLUE RIDGE.
