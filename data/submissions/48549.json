In addition to other state and local codes applicable to our facility and process. We have undertaken this process to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and use of Anhydrous Ammonia in our facility.\n\nSUPERVALU, Fort Wayne Distribution Center, is a wholesale food distribution facility serving over 160 retail stores.  The Fort Wayne Distribution Center has two ammonia refrigeration plants in two separate buildings; one system consisting of 25,000 lbs. controls temperatures in the freezer.  The second system is a 14,000 lb. capacity controlling the temperatures in the perishable building. The refrigeration systems contain  approximately 39,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. This surpasses the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds outlined in Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program regulations.\n\nThe freezer has frozen product, i.e., meat, ice cream, vegetables, breads, cakes, pre-packaged meals and anything else that can typically be found in the frozen department of any grocery store.  The perishable building products are those items that need temperature control but should not be frozen.  These items might be fresh packaged meats, dairy products and poultry.\n\nThe SUPERVALU, Fort Wayne Distribution Center has implemented numerous policies and procedures to enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of Anhydrous Ammonia as well as other hazardous substances, fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid property damage.  Our safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules,"

Also, included as a part of each Standard Operating Procedure is the Technical Operating Specifications for the associate system component. This information includes consequences of deviation from standard operating procedures.\n\nVolume 5 contains Operation and Maintenance Information including manufactures information, spare parts list, maintenance procedures, and preventive maintenance procedures.\n\nA 5 year revalidation Process Hazard Analysis was performed in February 2007, which highlighted some deficiencies in the system. These items were addressed as part of the continuous improvement of the facility. These items were addressed on the basis of priority (Injuries to personnel). Items of a low priority (Process improvements) were budgeted for completion in a timely manner.\n\nSUPERVALU, Fort Wayne Distribution Center also incorporates additional safety items such as tagging of all ammonia system valves and components, a PC / PLC based control system with a graphical operator interface. The ammonia refrigeration system at SUPERVALU, Fort Wayne Distribution Center is a standard compression and evaporation style system.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration systems consists of compressors, vessels, condensers, evaporators, pumps etc.  This applies to both buildings.
