      "SummaryText": "A.        The Borough of Carlisle Municipal Authority owns a  potable water treatment system and distribution system for the Borough of Carlisle, county seat for Cumberland County, Pennsylvania, and for some surrounding communities.  This system is operated by the Borough of Carlisle.  The water treatment plant located at 165 Long's Gap Road processes up to 7.0 million gallons per day of water drawn from the Conodoguinet Creek to yield potable water.  Treatment processes include pretreatment, coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration, fluoridation, and chlorine disinfection.  Chemicals are also added to control taste, odor, and corrosion.  The plant is operated 24 hours per day, every day of the year.\n\nB.          The water treatment plant includes a chlorination room, which contains two (2) one-ton cylinders of chlorine liquified under pressure, a chlorinator, various safety equipment, and instrumentation consisting of flow recorders, electrical panels, and a gas detector/alarm unit.  The chlorinator system uses remote-vacuum-actuated feed lines and has high pressure regulators attached directly to the chlorine vessel gas valves, mitigating against high-pressure gas releases through the chlorinator system.  Water treatment operators regularly check the room and its equipment, inventorying the rate of chlorine use and adjusting the rate as necessary.  The maximum intended inventory is 4,000 pounds.  The average operating inventory is 2,750 pounds.\n\nC.         The Borough of Carlisle Municipal Authority's water treatment plant accidental release prevention program is based upon the following elements:\n            1)  High level of training for the operators.\n            2)  Preventative maintenance program for equipment.\n            3)  Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment.\n            4)  Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the  participation of the \n                 operators.\n            5)  Performance of a"
