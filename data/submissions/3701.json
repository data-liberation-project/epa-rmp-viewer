Facility Accidental Release Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of John Taylor Fertilizers Company, Dixon facility (herein referred to as the Facility) at 1805 North First Street, Dixon, California, 95620 are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia, and aqua ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the Facility is the storage, and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received by truck and stored in one 21,400-gallon storage tank (bullet) at the site.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled in this process is 92,140 pounds.\n\nAqua ammonia (25% of ammonia by weight) is stored in one 25,000-gallon above ground tank at the site. The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia handled is 187,500 pounds.  The total quantity of ammonia present in the aqua ammonia, based on 25% active ingredient by weight, is  46,875 pounds.  \n\n3.  The Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\na.  Anhydrous Ammonia Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios  \nThe worst-case release scenario is failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would release 92,140 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by regulations.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.12 miles.   The alternative release scenario, based on the PHA sce"

The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.20 miles.\n\nb.  Aqua Ammonia Alternative Release Scenarios  \nThe first alternative release scenario is failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would release 187,500 pounds of solution ammonia (containing 46,875 pounds ammonia based on a 25% active ingredient).  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.68 miles.  The second alternative release scenario, based on the PHA scenarios (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a storage tank modeled with an increased wind speed and \"D\" Stability modeling parameters.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.19 miles.\n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia and Aqua Ammonia:  The Facility has implemented the provisions of the \"Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc.; California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Subchapter 1, \"Unfired Pressure Vessel Safety Orders\"; and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\"\n\n5.  Five-year Accident History\n\na. There have been no accidental releases or near misses of anhydrous ammonia or aqua ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n1.  Have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\n2.  Have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property  damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility's emergency response program was written in accordance with the following regulations:\n\nOSHA 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nOSHA 29 CFR 1910.120; and\n\nSection 25503, Division 6.95 of the California Health and Safety Code\n\n7.
