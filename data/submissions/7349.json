This facility manufactures five products -- bleach, fabric softener, household ammonia, RV antifreeze, and windshield washer solution.  Of these processes, chlorine is reacted with caustic soda solutions under strictly controlled conditions to create bleach.\n\nOnLine Packaging, Inc., recently under new ownership, is taking steps to provide a safe working environment for employees, and act a good corporate neighbor.  We are doing this through compliance with all applicable state and federal regulations, including: OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program, and this EPA Rule which govern the storage and processing of chlorine.\n\nOnLine Packaging, Inc., has performed worst and alternative release analyses, and addressed the residential population, public receptors, and environmental receptors that could be impacted by these releases.\n\nAs a requirement of both the PSM rule, and the Risk Management Plan (RMP) rule, OnLine Packaging has prepared an extensive prevention program which includes employee participation, operations training, operations procedures, and maintenance procedures.\n\nOnLine Packaging, Inc. relies on the local emergency response units such as the Plover Fire Department to respond to fires, and accidents at the facility, with the realization that the fire department will call in other emergency response units when appropriate.  OnLine Packaging Inc., is included in the Portage County LEPC Emergency Response Plan.\n\nAt present, we have no plans for upgrades that will effect the accuracy of this document."
