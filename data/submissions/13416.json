      "SummaryText": "The Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority has operated the Wastewater Treatment Facility for the City of Lockhart since 1994 without any reportable accidents.  Only one hazardous chemical is used in sufficient quantity to require compliance with the R.M.P.  Chlorine is stored and used as a disinfectant.\n\nG.B.R.A. recognizes the importance of care in the handling of chlorine.  Chlorine handling has been addressed in the G.B.R.A. Safety Manual, Job Safety Analysis, Emergency Operations Plan, the Preventive Maintanace Program, and the Annual Safety Audit.  Chlorine training occurs once a year with a more advanced training every two years.  Training is conducted on a practice container.  Team members review procedures for various senarios.  Leak detection systems are located at the plant with audible and visible alarms.  Personnel have access to S.B.B.A.'s, a Chlorine Ton Cylinder Repair Kit, and proper training if ever a situation were to present itself.  \n\nG.B.R.A. sees the need for improvement and constant training with the completion of the Risk Management Plan.  Along with the Lockhart Fire Department, G.B.R.A. will set up mock drills to coordinate certain job duties and perform maximum recovery in a worst case senario.  The distance covered in a worst case senario is 1.9 miles, which involves the city to a great extent.  The situation poses danger, yet response is the key.  Everyone involved in the Response Program will be minutes from the scene.  Proper Training, Hazardous Checklist Reviews, Mock Drills, and constant communication will be our focus to provide a safe enviroment for the citizens of Lockhart as well as its employees."
