The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia (NH3) as a refrigerant for their ice manufacturing and storage.\n\n\n\nThe refrigeration system design is a direct ammonia process.  The system has numerous protective controls including motor overload, high discharge temperature, high discharge pressure, low suction pressure, low oil differential on all compressors, level control switches on all applicable vessels and approved pressure safety relief valves on all applicable equipment that discharge into a common header, which vents into a deluge tank located outside the facility.\n\n\n\nThe system consists of four rotary screw compressor packages, three induced draft evaporative condensers, one thermosyphon receiver vessel, one controlled-pressure receiver vessel, seven 50-ton tube ice machines, two liquid ammonia pump recirculator packages, and seven air-cooling axial fan evaporators.  A Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) monitors the system and controls system operations.  \n\n\n\nAn outside supplier delivers anhydrous ammonia to replenish the ammonia in the system as required.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia, when properly used, has proven to be a safe and reliable refrigerant.  The sharp odor of ammonia provides its own warning agent.  Practically all accidents involving anhydrous ammonia can be avoided through employee training, an increased knowledge base of the equipment, and the development, maintenance and implementation of effective operating and maintenance procedures for all ammonia equipment.\n\n\n\nThe Reddy Ice-Athens facility is committed to operating a safe and compliant ammonia refrigeration system for the protection of its employees, the general public and the environment.  The facility has multiple safeguards pertinent to the ammonia process.  These include an ammonia detection and alarm system, continuous an"

Administrative controls are in place that limits the storage vessels to their intended capacities and operating levels.\n\n\n\nThe company has developed an emergency action plan that includes notification of emergency authorities/agencies and the public, evacuation of personnel, and first responder duties by trained facility refrigeration personnel.\n\n\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PREVENTION PROGRAM 3\n\nBased on the Reddy Ice-Athens facility's ammonia inventory, location, and requirement to meet OSHA PSM standards, it has been determined the facility is subject to the Prevention Program 3 requirements. This accident prevention program is a way to make safe operations and accident prevention systematic throughout the facility. Reddy Ice corporate management and Reddy Ice-Athens management are committed to operating a safe and compliant facility for the protection of its employees, the public, and the environment. A Combined Process Safety Management/Risk Management (PSM/RMP) Program has been developed to meet the accidental release prevention requirements of both EPA's Risk Management Program (40 CFR Part 68) and OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard (29 CFR 1910.119) under the Clean Air Act. The Combined PSM/RMP Program contains thirteen elements, establishing requirements for employee participation, process safety information, process hazard analysis, pre-startup safety review, operating procedures, training, management of change, mechanical integrity, hot work permits, contractors, incident investigation, compliance audits, and trade secrets. These elements are tied together by a management system to ensure plant-wide development, implementation and integration of all program requirements.\n\n\n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\nA management system has been developed to oversee the implementation of the PSM/RMP Pro"

The general manager has been identified as PSM/RMP Program Coordinator, with overall responsibility for developing, implementing and integrating the program requirements. Under the PSM/RMP Program, various responsibilities may be assigned to other individuals. The plant engineer is generally responsible for portions of the program closely tied to the refrigeration equipment and operation. Monthly safety meetings are conducted to present various safety topics and discussions and to address any safety issues brought up by employees during the month. \n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nAs required by the Risk Management Program regulations, the Reddy Ice-Athens facility has conducted a hazard assessment including offsite consequence analyses (OCAs) for potential accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. The OCAs describe the potential offsite exposure to surrounding areas from an accidental release. A worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenarios were developed and calculated using the EPA RMP*Comp modeling program, and the potentially affected offsite population and facilities were identified. Due to National Security concerns, the U.S. Government has advised the regulated community not to disclose the actual numerical data in this Executive Summary.  For offsite impacts detail, please see the site specific Risk Management Plan, available from the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Reddy Ice-Athens facility has not had any releases that would require reporting as part of a five-year accident history.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY PLANNING AND RESPONSE\n\nThe Reddy Ice-Athens facility operates under an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that includes procedures for: notifying plant personnel, the public, and local emergency responders; emergency evacuation/response procedures; use of emergency alarms and equipment; employee training in evacuation and response procedures; first aid for ammonia exposure; and periodic review and updating of the em"

The ammonia inventory is verified and reported annually to the state and local authorities, and the plant is incorporated into the community emergency response plan developed under 42 USC.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES\n\nThe Reddy Ice-Athens facility was designed and constructed to operate as a modern refrigeration system and ice manufacturing location. No significant changes are planned to the facility or operations. Reddy Ice facilities operate an continous improvement program, which ensures preventive and predictive maintenance to identify and implement changes that may result in improved safety and operations."
