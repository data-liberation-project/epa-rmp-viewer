Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Water Treatment Plant #1 are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental\nsafety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention\nprogram that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and\nemployee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement\nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.   The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activity is potable water treatment.  We have 1 regulated substance present\nat our facility.  This substance is chlorine.  Chlorine is used as a disinfectant.\n\n\n3.   The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, including\nadministrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's\nOffsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance Reference Tables and Equations.  The following\nparagraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 (chlorine toxic substance) involves a\ncatastrophic release from our chlorine storage process.  In this scenario 2000 lb. of chlorine is\nreleased.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1-cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance of 5.4 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine involves a release from our chlorine injection\nprocess.  The scenario involves the release of 2000 lb. of chlorine.  Toxic gas is assumed to be\nreleased from a"
