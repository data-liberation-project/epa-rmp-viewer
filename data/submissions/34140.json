      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\nGenencor International Wisconsin, Inc.\nRisk Management Plan\n\n\nIntroduction to Facility & Regulated Substance\n\nGenencor International Wisconsin, Inc. (?GCOR?) is an industrial biotechnology facility located in Beloit?s Industrial Park.  This ISO-9000:2000-certified-facility employs approximately 96 people and operates under a team-based organizational structure.  Genencor International, Inc. assumed ownership of the facility in February 2002 from Enzyme Bio-Systems, Ltd.  In 2002, efforts were initiated to implement an Environmental Health & Safety Management System for the site, guided by sustainable development principles.  This effort continues.\n\nThe facility manufactures enzymes through a fermentation-based process. Enzymes are chemicals comprised of large proteins, and have been used in the food and detergent manufacturing industries for many years.  The site?s manufactured enzymes are primarily intended for use in the grain processing industry.   The facility operates a continuous 24-hour-per-day process and has on-site Maintenance and Laboratory support.  Staff support includes site Management, Environmental Health & Safety, Engineering, Purchasing, Finance, and Systems personnel.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is the regulated substance under EPA Risk Management criteria and is used in the enzyme manufacturing process.  The covered process for the site?s Risk Management efforts includes the anhydrous ammonia storage/delivery system and on-site chillers.  The process is divided into the following sections or ?nodes? for the purpose of this program:\n?    Ammonia truck unloading\n?    Ammonia storage tank\n?    Ammonia tank discharge piping\n?    Process piping\n?    Chillers:  compressor\n?    Chillers:  condenser\n?    Chillers:  expansion valve\n?    Chillers:  evaporator\n\n\nChemical Safety\n\nGCOR?s overall approach to chemical safety is comprehensive.  Systems are engineered with safety and environmental aspects in mind, with input from affected areas of the plant prior to constructio"

Job-duty training is ongoing for each employee and occurs with co-worker trainers utilizing training manuals and SOP?s.  Genencor believes in being proactive in its training endeavors and strives to encourage employees to attend specific training associated with their job duties that go above and beyond the basic job requirements.  \n\nCapital projects deemed necessary for environmental, health & safety reasons are implemented and supported through the capital expenditure process.\n\n\nEmergency Response \n\nThe site Emergency Action Plan addresses how employees shall respond to emergencies, including hazardous weather; fire; building evacuation; hazardous device threat; and hazardous material spills.  All employees are trained in the site Emergency Action Plan as part of the established initial safety training for new employees.\n\nAn Emergency Response Team (?ERT?) has also been established at the site.  ERT training includes Industrial Incipient Level Fire Brigade; Technical Level Industrial Chemical Spill Response; First Aid/Adult CPR; Automatic External Defibrillator; and Bloodborne Pathogens.  \n\nERT activities include yearly training as well as drills to prepare for incident handling.  On-site ERT equipment is maintained to support the ERT efforts and includes SCBA?s, Level B chemical resistant suits, and chemical absorbent materials.  \n\nThe site Emergency Response Plan for a Hazardous Substance Release is in place to provide ERT guidance "

The plan outlines the responsibility of involved personnel during an incident; discusses the Incident Command System; gives instruction for securing outside emergency assistance; addresses internal and external notifications including the media/public; outlines emergency procedures for general emergency response; addresses spill control, personal protective equipment & first aid; and covers disposal & decontamination.  All ERT members are trained in the site Emergency Response Plan for a Hazardous Substance Release.  \n\n\nGeneral Prevention Measures\n\nGenencor has a number of measures in place for spill prevention.  These include, but are not limited to, preventative maintenance work; standard operating procedures which are updated at least bi-annually; employee training; back-up equipment where possible; and computer-monitored level indicators with interlocking systems when process limits are reached.  The facility has 24-hour team-based process coverage in the facility, including a full-service maintenance department.  The facility also operates under ISO 9000:2000 certification which ensures among other things, that procedures are updated and used for plant operations in addition to proper handling of all documents.\n\nThe presence of an Emergency Response Team (as outlined earlier) is intended to ensure that all incidents are addressed as soon as possible to prevent an escalation of the incident if possible.\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidents at GCOR?s Beloit facility involving the anhydrous ammonia system that resulted in any on-site or off-site effects.\n\n\nChanges to Improve Safety\n\nA Process Hazard Analysis was conducted for the site?s anhydrous ammonia system in April 2004.
