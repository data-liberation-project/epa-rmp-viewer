Describe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\nMeadow Gold Dairies recognizes management's responsibility in protecting its employees, equipment, property, and the environment.  The safety and health of all personnel and the protection of the environment are very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the facility.\n\nThe Company has a Plant Safety Program.  The primary objective of the Plant Safety Program is to achieve maximum efficiency and saftey performance.\n\nTo accomplish the Company's goal in preventing the accidental releases of ammonia and minimizing the impact of any release, the facility has developed and implemented a Process Safety Management and Risk Management program to comply with OSHAs Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119) and EPAs Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).  Emergency Action programs have been reviewed as well.  The objectives of the PSM/RMP programs are to prevent accidental releases through use of good operating procedures and mechanical intregrity of the ammonia refrigeration system.  The Plant Manager is responsible for the management of the accidental release prevention and emergency action programs.\n\nB.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nMeadow Gold Dairies operates a production facility where ice cream products are processed, packaged, sold and distributed from this facility.  An important part of the processing and handling involves an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing during processing and storage at the facility.  The maximum intended inventory of anhydrous ammonia (CAS # 7662-41-7) contained in the system is 16,600 pounds.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is a closed loop system whereby liquid ammonia from the high "

      "SummaryText": "pressure receiver located outside the building is piped in special piping to refrigeration equipment used for cooling and freezing.  During cooling and freezing, the pressure of the ammonia is reduced so that the ammonia can take away heat from the milk being cooled and the cold storage rooms being cooled as well as ice cream being frozen and stored in freezer rooms .  The ammonia returns in vapor form at a low pressure to the ammonia compressors where the vapors are compressed and piped to the condensers located outside.  Forced air and recirculated water cool and condense the vapors in the lines.  From the condensers, the ammonia flows by gravity back to the high pressure receiver, thus completing the loop.  Ammonia is a non-corrosive chemical; therefore, does not deteriorate the inside of vessels, lines or valves.  It also carries a small amount of oil from the compresssors.  All vessels containing ammonia are ASME pressure rated above the maximum operating pressure.\n\nC.  Summary of Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe Worst-case release scenario at the facility involves the release of 5,169 pounds of ammonia over a 10 minute period which would result due to a failure of the high pressure receiver.  This quantity includes all the ammonia in the high pressure receiver V-1 coupled with the quantity in both ammonia condensers EC-1 & EC-2, the thermal siphon cooler V-3 and the lines returning liquid ammonia to the high pressure receiver.  The maximum level in the high pressure receiver is limited to 80% of the vessel capacity which would normally only occur in the event of a pump-down by facility procedures.  Under worst-case weather conditions, ammonia could travel 0.9 mile before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is highly unlikely for the following reasons:\n\na.  The worst-case weather conditions which were used for this scenario are uncommon;\nb.  Industry and ASME standards were followed for t"

The high pressure ammonia receiver is located outside and is protected with bollards and pipe railing to prevent potential impact by vehicles or forklifts.  It is kept painted and routinely inspected to prevent external corrosion;\nd.  Ammonia is not corrosive in this service and our high pressure ammonia receiver was purchased new in 1996 and is maintained in good condition;\ne.  Dual safety relief valves limit operating pressure in the high pressure ammonia receiver;\nf.  The facility has a training program designed to ensure that the system is operated by experienced and qualified personnel.\n\n\nThe alternative (more likely) release scenario at the facility involves the release of 360 pounds of ammonia over a 60 minute period due to a leak of a 1/4 inch hole in a liquid ammonia hose on the Amerio ice cream hardening system at a pressure of approximately 7 psig.  Under alternative release weather conditions, the ammonia would be dispersed enough in less than 0.1 mile to no longer pose a hazard to the public.\n\nThe likelihood of an alternative release scenario is minimized for the following reasons:\n\na.  Positive effects of the PSM/RMP programs on the overall condition of the refrigeration equipment and operating procedures.\nb.  The equipment, lines and hoses are maintained in good condition.\nc.  The ammonia being pumped to the Amerio is -40 deg. F. which would delay the release to the environment and the impact zone.\n\nD.  Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe program consists of the following elements:\n\na.  Employee Participation:  All maintenance employees participated in developing the Process Hazard Analysis (PHAs), Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), and other elememts of the program.\nb.
