Water is treated with chlorine when necessary and then distributed to agricultural users via an irrigations system.  The facility is located along the distribution pipeline to the irrigation canal system.  The facility maintains a maximum inventory of 12,000 pounds of chlorine in one-ton cylinders.  This quantity is above the threshold quantity established by the Environmental Protection Agency and the facility is therefore subject to the requirements of the Risk Management Program.  No accidental releases of chlorine meeting the requirements of the five year accident history defined by the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nNo personnel are stationed at the Reclaimed Water Chlorination Facility.  It is operated on an intermittant / seasonal basis as irrigation demand requires.  The facility is monitored daily by Water Reclamation Facility personnel and the facility has chlorine gas detection and alarming equipment which alarms the Water Reclamation Facility.  The Water Reclamation Facility is manned continuously and is located within 1 mile of the Reclaimed Water Chlorination Facility.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\n\nThe off-site consequences of a potential accidental release of chlorine at the Facility were assessed in accordance with requirements established in 40 Code of Federal Regulation, Part 68.  The Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants, which provvides guidance for chlorine systems such as those at the Chlorination Facility, was used to model a worst case release scenario and an alternative release scenario for chlorine.\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Facility is subject to Prevention Program 2 of the Risk Management Program.  In accordance with the requirements of Program 2, the Facility maintains specifications for the equipment assoc"

The safe operating ranges for the chlorine system are documented, and the system is operated within these safe ranges.\n\nA hazard review has been conducted for the chlorine feed system and identified action items are expected to be completed by December 31, 2004.  When a major process change is made to the system, there are procedures to conduct a hazard review.  Otherwise, a hazard review is conducted every five years.\n\nWritten procedures for the operation and maintenance of the chlorine sysem are also in place at the Facility.  Procedures are reviewed periodically and updated whenever a major process change occurs.\n\nChlorine system operators receive training in the operation of the chlorine system through classes and on-the-job instruction.  Competency is determined through supervisor observation and operator demonstration of activities.  Operators receive update training at least every three years, or more often as necessary.  Only qualified operators operate the chlorine system.\n\nA team of facility personnel conducts a compliance audit of the prevention program once every three years and whenever a major process modification is made.  A system to correct any deficiency discovered during the compliance audit is in place.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, or a situation that could lead to an accidental release, procedures are in place to investigate such incidents, develop findings and recommendations for corrective action, and implement the recommendations.\n\nFacility personnel are trained to notify emergency personnel in the event of a significant chlorine leak.  In the unlikely event a chlorine release requiring the assistance of off-site emergency response personnel does occur, the City of San Angelo Fire Department is responsible for responding to the accident, coordinating the emergency response effort,"
