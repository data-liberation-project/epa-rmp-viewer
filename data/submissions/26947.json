Standards codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration at 29 CFR 1910.119 are not applicable to the operations at this facility because the facility is operated as a retail operation and is exempt from the OSHA standards. This electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the Robstown Facility located 4089 Co. Rd. 34, Robstown, TX 78380. The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Robstown Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident. The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Robstown Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release (even though a release is unlikely) will be implemented ina proper and timely manner.\n\nFACILITY\n\nHelena Chemical Company engages in the formulation, distribution, and sale of chemicals to customers, most of whom use Helena?s products to support agricultural operations. The Robstown Facility is retail agricultural chemical company that operates anhydrous ammonia processing. Anhydrous ammonia processes at this location include loading, unloading and blending. Loading operations occur from rail cars and trucks to end use processes. End use processes may include fertilizer formulation and operation. A contractor conducts the formulation processes at this facility. The contractor is responsible to OSHA for Process Safety Management compliance. Helena Chemical Company does not own or operate the formulation processes at the facility.\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nWorst case and alternative consequence analysis were completed for the ammonia storage process. The worst case scenario release for the Robstown Facility assumed that all the contents in the largest single"

      "SummaryText": " storage tank were released. The release was modeled as if the ammonia tank was punctured on the side at the ground level. The resulting release of ammonia was modeled as a ground level horizontal jet.\n\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario assumes a rupture of a 3-inch line caused by an impact from a vehicle or some other source on the liquid ammonia transfer line during a major loading or unloading operation. Although this event is classified as an alternative scenario, even an accident of this type is unlikely to occur due to the safety equipment (rail guards, check valves) and operating procedures that Helena uses to safeguard ammonia transfer operations.\n\nBoth the worst case and alternative scenario are overly conservative because even a 2-minute release is unlikely to occur since check valves on the system should close immediately upon increased flow resulting from the severed transfer line.\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Robstown Facility complies with U.S. EPA?s accidental release prevention rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. The Robstown Facility RMP provides safety information relevant to the on-site ammonia processes including MSDS documentation, storage and process limits, equipment specifications, and relevant codes and standards. The Robstown Facility has conducted a hazard review to ensure that potential safety problems are identified and addressed. The Robstown Facility has developed standard and consistent operating procedures that all employees follow when working with ammonia. The Robstown Facility ensures that all of its employees working with or around ammonia participate in a training program. The training program teaches employees how to avoid and respond to accidents. Helena Chemical Company has also established integrated operation and maintenance procedures, inspection requirements and schedules, compliance audits, and incident investigation procedures.

However, in actuality the equipment inspection or test date is different from the one listed in section 8.7.b of RMP*Submit TM because the contractor is responsible for performing all maintenance inspection.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nHelena Chemical Company?s Robstown Facility is a non-responding facility. Helena has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency response agency.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place, in the past five (5) years because of the ammonia operations at the Robstown Facility.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe Risk Management Plan implemented by Helena Chemical Company at the Robstown Facility complies with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r). The RMP will be updated as the Robstown Facility adds, deletes, or changes processes. The Emergency Response Program has been coordinated with the Nueces County LEPC.\n\nNOTE: Sections 4, 5, and 7 of the standard RMP produced by EPA?s RMP Submit Program are not applicable to the Robstown Facility."
