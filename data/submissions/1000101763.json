Products are loaded from wells into trucks and rail cars for deliveries to customers.\n\nThe Almeda Terminal has the capability of loading and offloading eight rail cars at a time.\n\nThe LPG Loading and Unloading process and the LPG Cavern Storage are regulated by Federal OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.  We have entered the facility as an RMP Program Level 1 facility.\n\nThe LPG Cavern Storage is considered storage incident to transportation and not subject to RMP regulations\n\nToxics\n\nThere are no toxic materials contained on site above the threshold limits.\n\nFlammables\n\nThe Almeda Terminal was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.

Release prevention is provided through the use of written operating procedures, employee training in written procedures, including normal operation and emergency release procedures, and in the design of safety and release prevention equipment installed at the terminal site.  In addition, a written safety program designed to comply with all applicable OSHA safety performance regulations is strictly enforced at all Enterprise facilities, including the Almeda Terminal facility.  As part of the Enterprise safety program, the facility utilizes procedures that are included in the Enterprise program, but may not specifically be required at non-PSM and/or RMP Program 1 facilities (e.g. Safe work practice training; safe work permitting and hot work permitting).\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP covered processes at Almeda Terminal.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe Almeda Terminal has safety features on many units to help contain/control a release, to quickly detect a release and reduce the consequence of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\nRelease Detection\n\n* Hydrocarbon (hazardous gas) detectors and alarms\n* Flame detection equipment in the storage and loading areas\n* Terminal video surveillance system\n\nRelease Containment and Control\n\n* Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\n* Automatic shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high pressure).\n* Redundant equipment and instrumentation where advisable\n* Storage tank internal emergency shut down and excess flow valves\n* Well and equipment emergency shutdown (ESD) systems.\n* Atmospheric relief devices\n* Process relief valves that d"

The procedures are for the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs. Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the plant facilities.\n\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Enterprise Almeda Terminal is coordinated with the Harris County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives.

Other recommendations for possible changes to improve safety come from periodic accident prevention program audits, incident investigations, or employee suggestions and recommendations.  The following changes are planned for implementation at the Almeda Terminal.\n\n* Improved flare system header has been installed."
