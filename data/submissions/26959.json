If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, the Nuckolls/Thayer/Webster County LEPC, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to persons and the environment.\n\n2.Facility Information. \n\n     The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop porduction. The maximum quantity stored would be 250,000 pounds in a storage tank and nurse tanks.\n \n3.The worst-case release and alternative release scenarios.\n\n     a.The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank over a 10 minute period. The distance to the endpoint would be  4.4 miles. The maximum quantity released would be 130,000 volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards and administrative controls.\n\n     b. The alternative release scenario: a 1-inch transfer hose is used as an alternate release scenario followed by the release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shut-down valve/valves intervenes or remote manual shut-off  is closed and stops the flow of ammonia. The maximum quantity released would be 2,900 pounds. The distance to the endpoint  (point of dispersion to 200ppm) is .3 miles.\n\n4.Accidental Release Prevention Program. \n\n     The facility is in compliance with the provisions of \"Safety Requirments for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", puvlished by The American National Standards Institute, In,. (ANSI), and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Heal"

A written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n     b. Provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and communtiy right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7.Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\n     Safety improvements are an ongoing process at this facility. Periodic evaluations are preformed to assess the maintenance and safe conditions of our equipment. There are no addtional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations at this time.\n\n8.For futher information contact: Jim Weldon at 402-756-4700."
