      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \u0096 BIG LAKE PROCESSING PLANT\n\nCanes Midstream G&P, LLC (Canes) owns and operates a natural gas processing facility, the Big Lake Plant is located in Reagan County Texas. The plant is designed to process natural gas and recover liquid products from physical separation and cryogenic processing. Petroleum condensates are recovered and stabilized for off-site sales.  It is Cane\u0092s policy and safety culture to adhere to applicable federal, state, and local laws subject to the facility.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Big Lake Plant is located near the town of Big Lake, TX which is located within Reagan County.  The Plant is designed to process the following petroleum products: \n\n1. Residue Gas\n2. Natural Gas Liquids\n3. Natural Gas Condensate\n\nThese substances can contain the following components:\n\na. Methane\nb. Ethane\nc. Propane\nd. Butane\ne. Isobutane\nf. Pentane\ng. Isopentane\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nCanes is committed to maintaining a healthy safety program through the integration of process safety controls, quality assurance and safety and environmental training programs.  Canes policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. If a release should occur, plant personnel are trained to evaluate each situation, take the appropriate actions based on their capabilities and the company\u0092s Emergency Action Plan.\n\nChemical specific prevention and mitigation steps implemented for which personnel are trained include the following:\n\n1. Contain/control a release\n2. Quickly detect a release, and\n3. Reduce the consequences of an RMP-regulated substance release\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \n\nA. WORST CASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe worst-case scenario associated with the release of flammable substance in Program Level 1 processes at the Big Lake Plant is a Vapor Cloud Explosion involving the maximum inventory of the largest Condensate Surge Tank (V-90"

The maximum distance to the 1-psi overpressure endpoint for this worst-case scenario is 0.60 mile and 0.5 mile for V-9050 and V-2404, respectively. No receptors have been identified within the endpoint radius.  An alternative release scenario is not required for this facility since it is classified as a Program Level 1 site.\n\nB. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nBig Lake Plant has had no RMP-regulated substance release during the past five years. \n\nC. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe plant maintains a written emergency action plan, which is in place to help protect employees and public safety as well as the environment. The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of accidental release including: first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of support resources and the local emergency response agencies if a release should occur.  \n\nEmployees receive training in the procedures to be followed who remain on-site to operate critical plant operations before they evacuate. Canes has 24-hour communication capabilities with appropriate emergency response organizations (Fire Department, Police, Sheriff's Office, or similar). This interface provides a means for notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating timely response to an incident. In addition, Canes conducts periodic emergency drills and annual refresher training for plant personnel."
