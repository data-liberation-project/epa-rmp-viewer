Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, contractors, the public, and the environment during emergency situations. The program consists of procedures for responding to a chlorine release. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including (1) proper first aid and emergency medical treatment for human exposures, (2) facility evacuation plans and accounting for facility personnel after an evacuation, (3) notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and (4) post-incident follow-up requirements. Procedures are in place governing the establishment of the plant's Emergency Operation Center where management personnel can direct and control emergency operations on an as-needed basis.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we have procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to plant facilities or to the chlorine storage and feed process, or when improvement benefits are recognized. Affected personnel are informed about, and trained on, the changes.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response program for the plant is coordinated with the C/WEPC - the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) having jurisdiction in Cabell and Wayne Counties - and with Cabell County and City of Huntington, West Virginia, emergency management officials.

We have around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate emergency response organizations (e.g.., contracted chlorine emergency response [HAZMAT] teams, local fire department, police department). This provides a means for notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition to participating in periodic C/WEPC meetings, we conduct periodic walk-around orientation tours of the plant facilities with key representatives of local emergency response organizations. During such tours we discuss and review the source of chlorine at our site, the hazards of a chlorine release, release mitigation features and emergency response actions involving the chlorine system.  Thus, our emergency response plan is fully coordinated with the community emergency response plan.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nAt the West Virginia-American Water Company Huntington Water Treatment Plant we constantly strive to improve the safety of our operations through periodic safety reviews, our incident investigation program, and a program for soliciting safety suggestions from our facility workers. We resolve all findings from our reviews of proposed changes to facilities, equipment, and operations and from analyses of process hazards. Some findings of this type can result in modifications to the process. the prevention program, or administrative controls.

The container storage room area can hold up to 4 one-ton containers. Two containers are connected to the same feed piping manifold at a time. An alternate supply arrangement consists of two additional ton containers connected to a parallel, but normally isolated, feed piping manifold. Chlorine is stored as a liquefied gas under pressure, fed as a liquid to chlorine evaporators, and injected as a vapor at the outlet of the chlorinators into the water stream. Currently we store the reserve containers of chlorine outside. The chlorine process is classified as a Program Level 3 process, and we implement a complete accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\r\n\r\nWe performed an off-site consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of chlorine from our facility as a regulated toxic substance that could affect the public or the environment. The off-site consequence analysis consisted of evaluating both a worst-case scenario (WCS) and an alternative release scenario (ARS) following identification of the appropriate ARS. We do not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur. An ARS represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility similar to our water treatment plant. ARS\u00bfs can be used to help the Cabell/Wayne (local) Emergency Planning Committee (C/WEPC) improve and prepare an effective community emergency response plan.\r\n\r\nWe have submitted release scenario analyses to EPA and have shared that information with C/WEPC and other organizations involved in emergency response activities. It is also available to local residents, schools, hospitals, and businesses.

A break in a pigtail connecting one of \t\tthe containers to the piping manifold will permit both connected containers to \t\tvent their respective contents (about 2000 lbs each) through the open ends of the \t\tsevered pigtail. Credit is taken in accordance with EPA's simplified approach for \t\tthe partial containment of chlorine vapor by the room/building enclosure, which \t\tmitigates the release. Such building confinement reduces the release rate of \t\tchlorine vapor directly to the outdoors. Since this facility is located in a populated \tarea, the toxic cloud formed by the evaporating chlorine would reach off-site end \t\tpoints and nearby public receptors.\r\n\r\n\tAs in the WCS, we have taken a very conservative approach to determining the \t\tARS endpoint distance off-site. Therefore, in determining the ARS endpoint \t\tdistance we have not taken credit for active mitigation provided by engineered \t\tsafeguards that include chlorine monitors/detectors. The chlorine leak detection \t\tsystem is calibrated to\tinitiate alarms at very low concentrations of chlorine (i.e., \t\tlower than industry recommended settings). Some of our additional engineering \t\tsafeguards are \toutlined in the following section of this summary and include \t\tisolation valves. Isolation valves are provided in the downstream chlorine feed \t\tsystem to isolate downstream chlorine sources from the pigtail leak.

We have extended the PSM program at this facility, where necessary, to satisfy EPA's Program Level 3 accident prevention program requirements. Our PSM Program and RMP Level 3 Prevention Program are designed to comply with OSHA and EPA requirements.  Additionally, we adhere to chlorine industry\t(i.e.., Chlorine Institute) and American Water Works Association guidance and recommended practices for PSM and RMP programs, including facility and chlorine system design and safety practices.\r\n\r\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, contractors, the public, and the environment by our use of chlorine in treating drinking-quality water. We are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases. Our systematic, proactive management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tProcess safety information\r\n\u00bf\tProcess hazard analysis\r\n\u00bf\tOperating procedures\r\n\u00bf\tTraining\r\n\u00bf\tMechanical integrity\r\n\u00bf\tManagement of change\r\n\u00bf\tPre-startup review\r\n\u00bf\tCompliance audits\r\n\u00bf\tIncident investigation\r\n\u00bf\tEmployee participation\r\n\u00bf\tHot work permit\r\n\u00bf\tContractors\r\n\r\nAs part of our prevention efforts, the following is a list of key safeguards and chlorine-specific accidental release prevention steps that we have implemented at our site:"

Our company, our employees, and contractors are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific, internal management accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\r\nFive-year Accident History\r\n\r\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  During the past 5 years we have not had any releases involving chlorine from the RMP-covered process that had any reportable on-site or off-site effects.  Our facility has instituted procedures that require formal investigation of incidents involving chemical releases, regardless of chemical identity or listing by the EPA RMP rule. For each incident, we conduct formal incident i"
