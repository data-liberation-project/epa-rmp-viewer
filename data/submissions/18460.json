We also plan to reduce the amount of these chemicals held in storage.  We continue to have a perfect safety record with these chemicals and with the safety procedures in place, our record should remain perfect.\n\nIn regard to Aqua Ammonia safety, this material is stored in drums, outside, away from strong acids, strong alkalies, alkali metals, brass, copper, hypochlorites, and other incompatible materials.  We have available self-contained breathing apparatus in case of an emergency spill or other release of liquid and vapor.\n\nIn a Worst Case Scenario (such as the bursting of a drum or cylinder, releasing its contents), emergency services (such as the fire department and Eagle Environmental Services) and governmental agencies would be contacted immediately.  Unnecessary persons would be told to leave the area to a distance of 0.50 miles.  Other facilities would be informed within this distance.
