We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n* A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n\n* A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences that could be associated with accidental chemical releases\n\n* An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n\n* A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n\n* An overview of our emergency response program\n\n* An overview of planned enhancements at the facility to further prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n\n* The certifications that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide\n\n* The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program\n\n2 STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nOur facility produces pentaerythritoltetranitrate (PETN) and penotolite cast boosters using various chemicals and processing operations. Concentrated nitric acid as used in the manufacture of PETN. TNT is melted and PETN is dissolved in the TNT to form pentolite which is poured into molds to make cast boosters.\n\nIn our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\n       Toxics\n\n                 Nitric Acid (concentration >= 80%)\n\n       F"

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administration controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nWe have reviewed our process and have determined our potential worst-case release scenario to be represented by a catostrophic failure of a full railcar storing concentrated nitric acid. The maximum quantity delivered by railcar to our facility is 240,000 pounds. The worst-case scenario assumes, for purposes of this RMP study, that the entire contents of the vessel is instantly released to the ground followed by volitization into the air. The worst-case relase dispersion is required to be evaluated at wind speeds of 1.5 meters per second (3.3 miles/hour) and atmospheric stability class F. Only passive mitigation measures (i.e. those measures that function without human, mechanical, or other energy input) may be considered to operate to minimize the effects of the release. Given the constraints of thw worst-case scenario model, the estimated exposure distance, as determined using the EPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance, is 17 miles.\n\nThe Ensign-Bickford Company utilizes both active and passive mitigation systems to limit the potential for a catostrophic event such as this to occur. Our active mitigation systems, which were not used in determining the outcome of the worst-case scenario, include routine inspections of storage vessels containing concentrated nitric acid"

These scenarios involve a study of an event which would be more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario, and must produce an endpoint off-site. These scenarios may include: transfer hose releases due to splits or sudden hose uncoupling; failures at flanges joints, or welds; vessel over flow and spill or overpressurization; and shipping container mishandling or breakage.\n\nWe have evaluated our processes and determined that a transfer hose release from a faulty gasket flange at the rail car is a reasonable alternative scenario for evaluation. For purposes of this study, a total of 95 gallons of concentrated nitric acid (`1,200 lbs) is released before the source of the release is stopped. The estimated exposure distance associated with this alternative release scenario, as determined using the EPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance, is 0.18 miles. \n\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases. \n\n     Worst-Case Release Scenario - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\n     Not Applicable\n\n     Alternative Release Scenario - Regulated Flamma"

The accident prevention programs in place include:\n\n    * Process Safety Management\n\n      - Written Process Specifications \n\n      - Process Hazard Analysis\n\n      - Training\n\n      - Employee Participation\n\n      - Compliance Audits\n\n     * LEPC Coordinated Emergency Response Drills\n\n     * Active and Passive Mitigation Systems\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases. Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention. \n\n5 FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility. The Ensign-Bickford Company has had four accidental releases of nitric acid in the past five years; the largest release was 95 gallons, the other three were 10 gallons or less. None of the accidents have resulted in either:\n\n     * Deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or\n\n     * Deaths,  injuries, evacuations,  shelterings-in-place,  property  damage,  or environmental damage offsite.\n\nFor each of these incidents, we have conducted formal incident investigations to identify and correct the root causes of the events and taken appropriate actions to minimize the potential for repeat incidents. \n\n6 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nWe maintain a site-specific Emergency Action Plan, which consolidates the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency repsonse planning. Our program provides the essenti"
