Numerous measures have been taken to prevent accidental release, including training and implementation of mitigation devices. b) Cekal Specialties manufactures textile processing and industrial processing products. One raw material, liquid formaldehyde (37%), is processed in sufficient quantities to be covered by the by the EPA Risk Management Program. The regulated process, Formaldehyde Storage and Handling occurs in a stainless storage tank and two interconnected stainless vessels. c) Detailed Standard Operating Procedures have been developed for all aspects of the regulated process. A comprehensive enclosed containment system is in place with interconnected dikes routing any potential spills into an ample enclosed containment pit with locked shut-off valve and contingency recovery valve. d) There are no reportable accidental releases in the previous 5 years. Furthermore, there have been no reportable accidental releases ever (since the incorporation of Cekal Specialties in 1992). e). An emergency response plan has been developed and coordinated with the LEPC. The emergency response plan includes medical emergencies, spills, fire, evacuation, etc. f) Cekal Specialties is committed to ongoing training and continuous review to improve safety."
