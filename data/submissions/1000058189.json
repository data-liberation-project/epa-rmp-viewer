Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR ?5189\n\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR ?1910.119\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Bravante Produce has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1 Bravante Produce, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Bravante Produce has updated their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following process which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\n\n\nProcess Name          | Process Chemical          | Process Quantity(lbs.)\n\nAmmonia Refrigeration   Anhydrous Ammonia           13,000\n\n\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses and physical property damage.\n\n\n\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have: \n\n1. Prepared a unified program based on the PSM plan to meet CalARP and RMP obligations as well\n\n2. "

Utilized PSMWriter software to ensure that all necessary employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\n\n\n\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees and neighbors protect themselves.\n\n\n\n1.2 Process Description\n\n\n\nBravante Produce operates a commercial cold storage for citrus and table grapes in Reedley, CA. The facility has an ammonia refrigeration system that provides refrigeration capacity to the following:\n\n(3) Storage Rooms (1) Precool Rooms (1) Hallway (1) Loading Dock (3) Degreening Rooms.\n\n\n\nThe refrigerated spaces are equipped with air-cooling evaporators and accumulators as required for flooded operation. The degreening rooms are equipped with DX air-cooling evaporators.\n\nMost control valve groups are located on the south exterior wall of the cold storage building. The refrigeration machinery is contained within or directly adjacent to the machinery room. \n\n\n\nThe flooded system operates as follows: high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped to each cold room, where it passes through an expansion valve into low temperature and pressure accumulator mounted behind the bunker wall. From the accumulators, low pressure liquid is circulated through evaporator coils. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature and pressure gas which is returned to the accumulator vessels. The suction gas is returned from the accumulators through a suction return line to the main suction accumulator.  From the main suction accumulator, ammonia is piped to the suction inlet on the compressors. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water-cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquefied and returned to the thermosyphon vessel and then to the high pressure receiver.\n\n\n\nThe system contains numerous safety devices including "

The sensor is set at the California OSHA permissible exposure limit of 25 ppm, which will activate an audible alarm. Also, a sampling system is installed in each refrigerated area that provides two-minute interval monitoring. The sampling system is set at the California OSHA permissible exposure limit of 25 ppm, which will activate an audible alarm and initiate an auto-dialer.\n\n\n\nAn emergency control box is installed on the south exterior wall of the refrigeration machinery room, which contains three valves. The high and low side of the system each have a valve that would discharge to the diffusion tank. The connecting pipe between the high and low side has one equalizer valve that would equalize the system.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at Bravante Produce consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping.  As such, the refrigeration system at Bravante Produce is treated as a single process.\n\n\n\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\n1.3.1 General \n\n\n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nBravante Produce has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release.

It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n\n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nBravante Produce has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\n\n\n\nBravante Produce's emergency response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n\n- California \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 8 CCR ?3220\n\n- Federal \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 29 CFR ?1910.38 \n\n\n\nStrategically, we will respond \"minimally\" to a release. Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \n\n\n\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\n\n\n\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nBravante Produce has implemented many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.

In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Bravante Produce's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\n\n\nBravante Produce has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Bravante Produce has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\n\n\nFor the future, Bravante Produce now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Bravante Produce employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Bravante Produce will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety."
