In\naddition, it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.\n\nOne of our company Goals states, \"To provide for the Safety and Security of our employees, our customers, the general public and to be good stewards of the environment for which we serve.\"  To fulfill these goals, we enroll in regulatory management service that assists in maintaining and administering comprehensive safety and environmental programs, procedures and training\ncourses.  We perform a thorough annual audit program and monitor facility compliance with the safety standards and overseen\nassistance with this specialty firm.  The program consists of internal audit utilizing checklist survey forms that are reviewed\nregularly and updated as necessary to ensure all applicable federal, state, and local regulations are covered.  These checklists\nare used to measure regulatory compliance including those governing the safe handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia.  \nProcedures require a timely response and correction of all recommendations resulting from these audit checklists.\n\nA \"Site Safety Coordinator\" is identified and used as an extension of the general manager and management service personnel\nfor a \"hands on\" manager of the day to day safe working activities, maintains the required regulatory recordkeeping, conducts\nemployee training, and acts as the location's contact during emergency incidents that are rehearsed biannually.\n\nA DESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe facility is a wholesale farm supply and distribution center and as such we store and distribute a wide variety of pesticides and\nfertilizers including anhydrou"

      "SummaryText": "s ammonia.  Anhydrous Ammonia is received by truck, is handled and stored on-site and is a \nregulated substance by the EPA requiring us to comply with this Risk Management Program.  We sell anhydrous ammonia to\ngrowers in nurse tanks manufactured to the requirements to do such.  The customer applies the ammonia into the soil as a needed source of nitrogen fertilizer for growing agricultural crops.  Ammonia is also used for blending into mixed grade liquid\nfertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n\nOur facility maintains 38 -1,000-gallon nurse Tanks, and 10- 1,500-gallon nurse Tanks for customer delivery.  Our combined\nstorage capacity in nurse tanks is 231,550 pounds.  Anhydrous Ammonia is stored in 2 stationary storage tanks; \n1 @ 30,000 gallons, 1 @ 18,000 gallons on site.  131,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia is the maximum storage capacity of\nstationary storage tanks.  Therefore, the total facility anhydrous ammonia storage capacity for this location is 441,000 pounds.\nThe largest storage vessel at our facility contains 131,000 pounds.\n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO\n\nOur worst case scenario is the loss of the total contents of the 30,000 gallon storage tank, when filled to the greatest amount\nallowed (85% of capacity), released as a liquid over 10 minutes, resulting in total vaporization.  The maximum quantity released\nwould be 131,000 pounds.  According to DEGRADIS modeling, the distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 PPM)\nwould have off-site impact.  It should be noted that our company has never had a total release of an entire storage tank.\n\nALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe most common alternate release scenario(s) from an anhydrous ammonia storage facility would not reach an endpoint\noff-site.  The alternate release scenario modeled for the purpose of this plan is a three-minute release from a stationary storage tank representing a valve and hose failure requiring a manual shutdown.  The total amount of anhydrous ammonia released in this scenario would be "

The distance to the endpoint would not have an impact.                   \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS    \n\nThe ammonia storage system is designed, installed and is maintained in accordance with ASTM standards and the  ASME codes.  This facility complies with the ANSI K61.1 standards (1989 edition), OSHA - 29 CFR 1910.111, EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule as well as applicable federal, state, and local codes and regulations.          \n\nOur ammonia system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shutoffs and emergency shutoff valves.  The load-out risers used for the purpose of filling the nurse tanks are protected by excess flow valves and fill line breakaways to immediately stop the flow of ammonia if a line or a hose would fail.  All of the main storage tank valves and the riser load valves are locked when not in use.  Lighting for the facility has increased to discourage the increase of meth theft.\n\nOur anhydrous ammonia system is inspected on a regular basis with maintenance and preventive maintenance scheduled and documented.  Liquid and vapor valves, hoses, excess flow valves, gauges, and relief valves are replaced when necessary and/or according to the guidelines within the ANSI standards.\n\nTraining is provided to all employees at least annually, whenever there is a change in the process or whenever competency with the regulations are questioned.  In accordance with the 1989 ANSI standards, training is also offered for all ammonia customers to attend on a regular basis and offered to the local fire department personnel during their annual tour of our facility and operations.  These training courses consist of classroom lecture, current and approved videos or compact disc, testing both verbally and written, demonstration and observation for each person working with the process that are certified while on-"

In preparation for this, we have coordinated with all of the local response agencies by providing information and facility tours annually to ensure that they are familiar with and properly prepared for an incident at our facility.  This will help to ensure that our community has the strategy for responding to and mitigating the threat posed by an ammonia release.  This complies with the requirement of our facility to be included in the community emergency response plan prepared under EPCRA and coordinated with our LEPC.\n\n\nCERTIFICATION LETTER\n\nCERTIFICATION STATEMENT FOR PROGRAM LEVEL 2 PROCESS\n\nTo the best of the undersigned's knowledge, information and belief formed after reasonable inquiry, the information submitted is true, accurate, and complete.\n\n\n\n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________\nSignature                                                                                               Print Name\n\n\n\n\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\nTitle                                                                                                       Date\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEPA FACILITY ID#  1000 0003 5491"
