Land use in the immediate vicinity of the site is primarily\nagricultural, with silviculture predominating.  The plant is located astride a low hill or\nridge east of Horsehead Creek. \n     The location of the plant is due to the presence of natural brine deposits located\nabout 1.5 miles beneath the plant.  These brines are withdrawn through a system of\nwells and processed to produce bromine and hydrogen sulfide, and then replaced into\nthe same geologic formation by a second system of wells.  \n     The South Plant produces bromine, sulfur, fire retardants, pesticides and\npesticide intermediates, clear completion fluids and other speciality chemicals.  \nAbout our accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n     The South Plant Facility has very active accidental release prevention and\nemergency response programs.  It is the policy of the South Plant Facility to reduce the\nrisk of chemical release to the extent feasible.  The main vehicle for chemical risk\nreduction is the Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  When the OSHA PSM\nstandard was promulgated, existing programs were subsumed into the PSM program\nfollowing the OSHA standard.  \n     The Policy of the South Plant is to first prevent the occurrence of emergency\nsituations, but if prevention measures are unsuccessful, to respond to those situations\nin a professional and appropriate manner.  The site has an integrated Emergency Plan\nwhich follows EPA's \"One Plan\" concept.  South Plant personnel respond to\nemergencies on site with a trained fire brigade, HazMat responders, and a corps of\ntrained EMTs.  The emergency plan provides for coordination with local care givers, first\nresponders, law enforcement, and the county emergency response infrastructure\nthrough the county-wide emergency plan.  \n     Briefly, if a chemical incident appears to have the potential for"

If a situation has impact beyond the\nborders of Columbia County, the county-wide emergency plan provides for coordination\nwith adjoining counties and parishes.\n     All of our south Arkansas facilities use the same basic accidental release\nprevention and emergency response programs.  Using the same plan makes training\neasier and coordination with local off site responders better.  Details of the emergency\nplans (such as maps; locations of response equipment) are different due to the physical\ndifferences in the facilities.\nRegulated substances handled at the South Plant:\n     The South Plant is known to handle as many as fifteen listed chemicals in up to\n21 processes.  Information on the handling and storage was gathered.  Eleven\nregulated chemicals in eight processes were found to be subject to the RMP rule.  The\naccidental release prevention and emergency response programs are exactly the same\nfor covered and non-covered processes; covered and non-covered chemicals are both\nsubject to both programs.\n     The Risk Management Program has been incorporated into the PSM program to\nprovide continuity.  A description of our risk management program is found below.  \nOur accidental release prevention program:\n     We have included chemical specific steps for release prevention under each\nalternate-case scenario below.\n     The South Plant Facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard.  We have internal\nprocedures which drive compliance with both the OSHA PSM standard and the new\nEPA RMP standard.\n     We have compiled detailed information on all process (both covered and non-covered) which includes hazard information on each substance, technical process\ninformation, and process equipment information.  This information is used in the\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA).\n     PHA's have been conducted on all processes, and are repeated"

The PHA identifies any and all possible mishaps, the likelihood and\nconsequences of mishaps, and predicts how safety and mitigation systems will perform\nin the event of a mishap.  For each PHA, a team is formed which possesses the\nrequisite expertise in engineering, process operations, hazard analysis, industrial\nhygiene, safety systems, and emergency response.  Several standard methods may be\nused to analyze the available information, and more than one method may be applied\nto a process hazard analysis.  The PHA documentation is retained for the life of the\nprocess.  This information is used to eliminate hazards when possible, and mitigate\nthose hazards when elimination is not possible or impractical.\n     Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) exist when each process is first started\nup, and undergo continual review and improvement.  Some of the items included in\nSOP's are procedures for start-ups, shut-downs, routine or hazardous procedures,\noperation of safety and environmental control systems, and mitigation of process\nhazards.  SOPs are updated to reflect current operating conditions.  Each SOP is\nreviewed no less often than annually.\n     Training is the key aspect of accident prevention.  Each employee in an\noperating process receives job specific and general training on safety and health\nhazards, emergency operations, and safe work practices.  This training is administered\naccording to the needs of the employee and the specific requirements of the program.  \n     Preventative Maintenance (PM) is an integral part of our accidental release\nprevention program.

In addition to this regular\ninspection, if the flange union is disassembled for any reason, the gasket is replaced\nwith a new gasket.  The new gasket is then pressure tested to check for leaks before it\nis returned to service.  \n     An ACS considered, based on an actual incident, postulated a premature failure\nof a reactor rupture disk.  The actual release was reported to the state, EPA, and the\nNational Response Center, but had no offsite impact or onsite injuries or property\ndamage.  Safety relief devices are regularly inspected and rebuilt as a part of the\n\"mechanical integrity\" portion of the PSM program.\nFlammable chemicals worst-case release scenario:\n     The worst-case release scenario for a release of a flammable material is for the\nsudden release and subsequent ignition of the contents of a storage tank containing\ndimethyl amine.  \n     \"RMP Comp\" estimates the distance to 1 psi over pressure as 0.4 miles.  \n\"RMP*Comp Ver. 1.06, Results of Consequence Analysis:\nChemical: Dimethylamine [Methanamine, N-methyl-]   CAS #: 124-40-3\nCategory: Flammable Gas;  Scenario: Worst-case;  Liquefied under pressure.\nQuantity Released: 213,115 pounds;  Release Type:"

No mitigation was considered for this WCS.\nFlammable chemicals alternate-case release scenario:\n     The alternate-case release scenario for flammables is also for the release of\ndimethyl amine.  This ACS is based on an incident which occurred in 1992, except no\nignition occurred in the actual incident.  In this scenario, liquid DMA back flows from the\nprocess and enters the process wastewater system, where it vaporizes.  This results in\na vapor cloud, which ignites.  The rate assumed is 500 pounds per minute for 30\nminutes.\n     \"RMP Comp\" estimates a distance to 1 psi over pressure to be 0.1 miles.\n\"RMP*Comp Ver. 1.06,  Results of Consequence Analysis:\nChemical: Dimethylamine [Methanamine, N-methyl-]   CAS #: 124-40-3\nCategory: Flammable Gas;  Scenario: Alternative;  Release Duration: 30 minutes\nRelease Type: Vapor Cloud Explosion.\nRelease Rate: 500 pounds per min; Mitigation Measures: NONE.\nEstimated Distance to 1 psi over pressure: 0.1 miles (0.2 kilometers)\nAssumptions About This Scenario:  Wind Speed: 3 meters/second (6.7 miles/hour);\nStability Class: D; Air Temperature: 77 degrees F (25 degrees C).\"\n     To prevent reoccurrence, we changed the relevant SOP to prevent connection of\nthe water system to a pressurized reactor.  We also installed a back flow prevention\nsystem on the dimethyl amine feed pumps, and all employees were trained in the new\nprocedures and the process changes."
