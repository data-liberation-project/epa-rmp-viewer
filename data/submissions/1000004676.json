Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Contract manufacturer of personal care aerosol products.  We have 6 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Difluoroethane  [Ethane, 1,1-difluoro-], Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl], Isopentane  [Butane, 2-methyl-], Methyl ether  [Methane, oxybis-], Pentane and Propane.  Difluoroethane  [Ethane, 1,1-difluoro-] is used for as an aerosol propellant.  Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl] is used for as an serosol propellant.  Isopentane  [Butane, 2-methyl-] is used for as an aerosol propellant.  Methyl ether  [Methane, oxybis-] is used for as an aerosol propellant.  Pentane is used for as an aerosol propellant.  Propane is used for as an aerosol propellant and fork lift fuel.\n\n\n3.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nThis facility maintains a record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all process"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If/Checklist.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  \n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, our facility maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nWe have a training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nThe facility carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.
