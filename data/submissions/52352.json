      "SummaryText": "The City of Stamford, Texas (City), operates the Stamford Water Treatment Plant (WTP) which is located in Jones County, Texas on the east side of the City.  The WTP provides potable water to the City of Stamford, City of Lueders, Ericksdahl Water Supply Corporation (WSC), and the Sagerton WSC. Chlorine gas is used in the disinfection process at the water treatment plant.  In order to meet the demand and accommodate supply shipments, up to four (4) 2,000-pound chlorine cylinders will be stored on-site at any one time.  Because the stored quantity of chlorine onsite exceeds the threshold quantity for chlorine, the City developed this Risk Management Plan. In order to oversee implementation of the plan, a Management System overseen by the City?s Director of Public Works (Director) will be implemented to ensure that the Plan and associated Prevention Program are implemented correctly and maintained up-to-date.\n\nAs part of the requirements for the Risk Management Prevention Program, a Hazard Assessment was conducted that evaluated worst case and alternative chlorine release scenarios.  The worst-case release scenario is based on the American Water Works Association?s (AWWA?s) Compliance Guidance and Model Risk Management Program Scenario I.D. CLW-2 and involves the release of the entire contents of a 2,000-pound cylinder over a 10-minute period as a result of a catastrophic failure of a single 1-ton chlorine cylinder. The distance to the toxic endpoint as determined using a temperature correction factor of 1.0239 is 3.072 miles. LandView6 was utilized to determine the potential number of off-site residents affected by this scenario to be 3,782 persons.  Public receptors in the release area consist of residences, schools, office buildings, recreation areas and a hospital. The distance to the toxic endpoint in the alternative release scenario as determined using AWWA?s CLA-5 scenario, and a temperature correction factor of 1.0239 is 0.870 miles .

      "SummaryText": "termined that the potential number of off-site residents affected by this scenario would be 1,226 persons.  Public receptors in the release area consist of residences, schools, office buildings and recreation areas. \n\nA Prevention Program was also established, and expands upon the current practices already in-place at the WTP.  Written operating procedures are used in conjunction with on-the-job training to ensure that operators are proficient in performing their duties before being allowed to work alone.  Operators conduct daily inspections and any problems with the chlorine system are documented and addressed.  In addition, the operators insure that the equipment used in the disinfection process is maintained according to the manufacturers? recommendations.  Because of these efforts, the WTP has not had a chlorine release that resulted in an injury, either on-site or off-site, within the previous five (5) years.  As part of the Program, the City will periodically perform compliance audits, hazard reviews and incident investigations, when necessary.  \n\nThe City?s WTP complies with the emergency response regulations per OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38 as well as with applicable fire codes and the standards set forth by the Chlorine Institute.  Pursuant to risk management planning requirements, the WTP has developed an emergency action plan and has coordinated with the City of Stamford Fire Department and the Jones County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) to provide emergency response should a chlorine release occur.  Certified plant operators are trained to evacuate the facility and to notify the City Fire Department and Jones County LEPC as soon as possible.  The City of Stamford Fire Department will oversee chlorine release response procedures, including the evacuation of surrounding residents."
