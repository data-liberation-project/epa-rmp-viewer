In the event of an emergency or accidental release, an Emergency Response Program has been implemented and is available on site.

Management of Change \r\n5N Plus has developed a procedure for management of change (PRO-1111-007 Change Control), this procedure is to evaluate and document temporary or permanent changes that may affect the use of a regulated substance in the current system. These changes include updates to equipment, system configuration, and operations of regulated processes and chemicals. \r\n\r\nPrior to the initiation of a change, it will be reviewed to determine the following [29 CFR 1910 \u00a7119(l)(2)(i)-(v)]: \r\n- The technical basis for the change; \r\n- The impact of the change on health and safety concerns; \r\n- Modifications that may be required to operating procedures; \r\n- The necessary time required to make the change; and \r\n- Authorization requirements for the proposed change. \r\n\r\nOnce changes have been approved, relevant documents such as process safety information, facility diagrams, and operating, training, and maintenance procedures related to the covered process are reviewed and updated as necessary as part of the Management of Change process. These updates are logged and maintained in the form FOR-1111-007 Changes Control Follow-up.  \r\nAll employees and contractors involved in the regulated process will be notified of the change, and relevant training will be given if required. \r\n\r\nIf the change is determined to be a significant change to the process, the PHA and Off-site Consequence Analysis (OCA) will be updated to reflect the change, as required by PSM/RMP regulations. \r\n\r\n8.

      "SummaryText": "5N Plus Wisconsin Inc. has created and implemented a combined Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program (PSM/RMP) for their facility located at 6474, Blanchar's Crossing, DeForest, Wisconsin. This PSM/RMP Program was designed in accordance with the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration PSM Program (29 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] 1910.119) and the USEPA Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs under Clean Air Act Section 112(r) (40 CFR 68). \r\n\r\nA list of regulated chemicals and program applicability is provided below:\r\n\r\nProcess:                    Gallium Trichloride (GaCl3) Production\r\nSubstance:                  Chlorine\t\r\nCAS:                        7782-50-5\t\r\nMaximum Intended Inventory: 4000 lbs\t\r\nApplicability:              OSHA PSM and USEPA RMP\r\nProgram Level:              3\r\nCovered System Components:\r\n- Chlorine container management (Reception, handling, storage, shipment of used container)\r\n- GaCl3 Process System Equipment and all utilities related to this process (Chlorine piping, Nitrogen piping, Cooling/heating unit, Wet gas scrubber, reactors and related instrumentation, Packaging and storage of final products)\r\n\r\n1. Process Description\r\n\r\nThe gallium trichloride (GaCl3) process in place at the facility produces GaCl3 by reacting liquid gallium metal with chlorine within several reactors. The liquid gallium metal is placed in a reactor and heated.  Chlorine gas is introduced to the reactor and reacts with the gallium to form GaCl3. Nitrogen is used to purge the chlorine from the equipment. Once the reaction is complete the GaCl3 is then transferred to the container and cooled to form a solid.\r\n \r\nThe process consists of six reactors, one chlorine cabinet, a scrubber / ventilation system, and liquid nitrogen supply. The chlorine is stored within a dedicated room and the design complies with the NFPA400.  The main construction and safety point for the Chlorine room are:\r\n\r\n- Gas room ho"

Operating Procedures Implementation Policy \r\n5N Plus maintains operating procedures which describe all employee tasks, data to be recorded, operating conditions to be maintained, and safety and health precautions to be utilized in operation of the GaCl3 Production process. The procedures are designed to be technically accurate and result in safe operation of the process. In addition, they are designed to be understandable to the employees and/or contractors. 5N Plus updates the operating procedures as changes are made to the process or to the operating limits of the process. 5N Plus annually reviews the operating procedures and certifies that they are current and accurate, as required by the PSM/RMP regulations. If the operating procedures are found to be out of date or inaccurate, necessary updates and revisions are made. \r\nThe procedure Documents and records control (PRO-1111-001) includes the information about localisation and access to the SOP's. \r\n\r\nAll phases of system operation are covered by the written procedures. Specifically, procedures are available for [29 CFR 1910 \u00a7119(f)(1)(i)(A)-(G)]: \r\n- Initial startup; \r\n- Normal operation; \r\n- Temporary operations as the need arises; \r\n- Emergency shutdown; \r\n- Normal shutdown; and, \r\n- Startup following a turnaround, or after an emergency shutdown. \r\n\r\nThe procedures contain process operation limits, and provide information regarding the consequences of deviation from these limits and the steps required to correct any deviations. Safety and health measures are included in the procedures to warn employees of potential risks and protective action(s) that should be taken [29 CFR 1910 \u00a7119(f)(1)(ii)-(iv)]. \r\n\r\n5. Training\r\n5N Plus ensures that all employees involved with the GaCl3 Production processes at the facility, including maintenance and contractor employees, fully understand the health and safety hazards associated with chlorine and the product GaCl3."
