The covered processes at this facility are the storage and delivery systems up to injection points. This substance is listed as a Regulated Toxic Substance under 40 CFR Part 68 and is present in quantities that exceed the threshold for Accidental Release Prevention. \n\nEnviroTech\u0092s commitment to providing a safe, healthy work environment for employees as well as providing a safe, healthy environment for the surrounding community is the primary goal of EnviroTech\u0092s management. The properties of bromine and chlorine make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.\n\nEnviroTech has developed an emergency response plan in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.38 and 29 CFR 1910.120. EnviroTech has coordinated with the local emergency planning committee on its emergency response plan. EnviroTech adheres to all applicable Federal, State and local safety and environmental regulations for the prevention of releases of this chemical.\n\nACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\n\nThe Helena facility complies with the Program 3 requirements of EPA\u0092s Risk Management Plan (RMP) rule through the implementation of the Process Safety Management rule of OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.119 for the prevention of hazardous chemical releases.  The Process Safety Management Plan is a comprehensive program with fourteen elements, including process hazard analysis, employee training, operating procedures, mechanical integrity, pre-safety startup, contractor safety, emergency planning and response, compliance auditing, and employee participation. \n\nThe Process Safety Management Program ensu"

The mechanical integrity element of the program includes scheduled inspections and tests of equipment and of monitoring devices in the process to detect any deficiencies or defects in equipment. Preventative maintenance and replacement policies for parts and equipment ensure that deficiencies are addressed and corrected before they could potentially contribute to a release incident. All elements of the Process Safety Management Program help to ensure an uncontrolled release of bromine or chlorine is prevented.\n\n?\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nThere have been no reportable releases from the facility.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nEnviroTech has developed an emergency response plan (in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.38 and 29 CFR 1910.120) that includes provisions to respond to chemical emergencies on-site with trained EnviroTech personnel and provisions to evacuate non-responding employees from the facility in the event of an uncontrolled accidental release of a hazardous chemical. The emergency response program focuses on the following key elements: Emergency Telephone Call Log, Coordination with Local Authorities, Structure of Authority, Emergency Team Role Descriptions, Media Interaction Procedures, Emergency Notification Procedures, Emergency Evacuation Instructions, Personnel Accounting Procedures, Notification Procedures, Severe Weather, Bomb Threat, and Fire and/or Explosion.\n\nIt is EnviroTech\u0092s policy to contact the local emergency planning committee, and the local fire department in the event of a hazardous chemical release.

The bromine and chlorine processes process is designed in accordance with good engineering practices. Periodic auditing of the Process Safety Management Prevention Program ensures that any system changes or modifications are evaluated and necessary safety precautions and or safety improvements are made before the process is placed into operation."
