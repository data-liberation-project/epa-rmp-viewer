Fuller has established a Risk Management Program that helps the company to identify and communicate risks associated with our operations.  As part of this commitment, we have established reasonable controls to prevent accidental releases from occurring. Should an accidental release of a hazardous material occur, despite these measures, we have also developed specific plans for each facility to reduce the effects of potential releases upon our employees and the general public. We have also developed site-specific plans for emergency response that involve both our employees and local emergency service providers.\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription of Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nH.B. Fuller Seneca Site\n\nH.B. Fuller operates approximately 18 facilities in North America.  These facilities produce a wide variety of polymers and adhesives found in many household items.  The Seneca Site produces various materials found in latex paints, adhesives for cardboard and carpets, low VOC coatings for wood & vinyl, joint compound, and other common items.  A variety of chemicals are used to manufacture these products.  Two of these chemicals are subject to the RMP regulation: vinyl acetate monomer and ethylene.  \n\n\n\nThe first regulated substance is a  toxic chemical - vinyl acetate monomer (VA). The maximum quantity of vinyl acetate monomer stored on site is 466,000 pounds (59,000 gallons).  Typically only 250,000 pounds (25,000 gallons) or less of vinyl acetate monomer is stored in the tank at any given time.  \n\n\n\nThe second regulated substance is a flammable chemical - ethylene. H.B Fuller stores ethylene on site in a storage tank and rail cars. A railcar contains 205,000 pounds of ethylene.  There can be up to three rail cars on site at any given time along with one at the unloading area.  H.B. Fuller also has one ethylene storage tank on site that will hold a maximum of 205,000 pounds (43,617 gallons) of ethylene. The unlo"

Fuller Seneca utilized RMP*Comp to calculate the following offsite consequence analyzes and Landview to estimate population densities: \n\n\n\nVinyl Acetate:\n\n\n\nVinyl acetate monomer is stored in a single storage tank. The storage tank contains 59,000 gallons (446,000 pounds).  The working storage volume for the tank is approximately 25,000 gallons (200,000 pounds).  The tank is located within a concrete secondary containment area, which is capable of containing 110% of the volume of the VA tanks. There can be up to 6 full railcars on site waiting to be unloaded.  The railcar has a capacity of 190,000 pounds but only the car being unloaded is connected to the facility's vinyl acetate system.  Unless the tank has the ability to contain the car, it is not connected.  \n\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\nThe worst case scenario would be the catastrophic failure of the VA storage tank releasing 466,000 pounds of VA into the secondary containment.  The offsite impact area associated with this scenario would be 1.4 miles downwind.\n\n\n\nAlternative Case Scenarios\n\nThere were many alternative case scenarios discussed. Most of the creditable scenarios centered on the transfer and storage of the VA.  The facility receives VA by railcar and tank truck.  A VA railcar contains 19,200 gallons (190,000 pounds).  The VA is transferred from the railcar to the storage tank with a centrifugal pump through a 3\" pipeline. \n\n\n\nThe railcar and tank truck unloading area drains to a concrete spill containment basin.  The basin can retain the volume equal to two (2) railcars.  The transfer piping crosses both the unloading drainage area and lies within the storage tank secondary containment area.\n\n\n\nThe VA is transferred from the storage tanks to the process building by a gear pump.  A digital control system (DCS) controls the pump that transfers the amount of VA pumped from the stor"

If the pre-set conditions are not constantly met, then an alarm activates and interlocks will close supply valves and shut down the transfer pump.\n\n\n\nAlternative Case #1 - Failure of the unloading line during the transfer of VA from a railcar to the storage tank, on the discharge side of the unloading pump. The unloading pump transfers VA at a rate of approximately 1,300 lbs./minute.  An operator is in the immediate area during the unloading process.  It was estimated that it would take the operator 5 minutes to notice the release and shut down the unloading pump and associated valves.  Therefore, approximately 7,500 lbs. Of VA would be released into the secondary containment or the spill basin.  The off-site impact area would be 0.4 miles downwind.\n\n\n\nEthylene\n\n\n\nEthylene is typically contained on-site in a 137,000 pound railcar and a 205,000 pound capacity storage tank. The railcar and tank truck unloading area contains a deluge system, and continuous temperature and combustible monitors.  Railcars and tanks trucks are off-loaded into an ethylene storage tank.   A railcar contains 137,000 pounds of ethylene and a truck contains 40,000 pounds.  Ethylene is vaporized from the storage tank into a high-pressure storage tank then into the process area.\n\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\nIf the storage tank fails, ip to 205,000 pounds of ethylene would be released into the atmosphere.  The impact area would be 0.5 miles downwind.\n\n\n\nAlternative Case Scenarios\n\nThere were many alternative case scenarios discussed. Most of the creditable scenarios centered on the transfer and storage of the ethylene.  The facility receives ethylene by railcar and tank truck. The ethylene is transferred from the railcar or tank truck to the storage tank with a centrifugal pump.\n\n \n\nThe ethylene is vaporized from the ethylene low-pressure storage tanks to the high-pressure storage tank.

The ethylene is transfer at a rate of approximately 800 lbs./minute.  An operator in the immediate area during the unloading process.  It was estimated that it would take the operator 5 minutes to notice the release and shut down the unloading pump and associated valves.  Therefore, approximately 4,000 lbs.

Fuller achieve its Environmental Health & Safety (EH&S) goals, the Seneca Site is dedicated to continuous improvement of its comprehensive Environmental, Health, and Safety program, which includes compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management regulation (29 CFR 1910.119).\n\n\n\nEmployees at the Seneca facility are highly trained, knowledgeable, and skilled, which results in a workforce that is very capable in their job performance.  These employees are then supported with numerous sources of information about:\n\n\n\n1. Job Duties - with standard operating procedures, emergency procedures, and safe work practices\n\n2. Chemicals used in the process - with annual review of Material Safety Data Sheets, exposure limits and exposure prevention, and the chemistry behind the manufacturing process\n\n3. Operation of the process - with equipment design and construction information, safe operating limits, and the consequences and correction of process upsets"

Fuller employees, the supporting information available, and the active involvement of the employees at all levels of the organization, combined to provide a strong foundation for the EH&S programs for this facility.  Traditional Process Safety Management (PSM) programs such as Hot Work, Confined Space, Lockout/Tagout, Management of Change, Process Hazardous Analysis, Incident Investigation, Emergency Response, Mechanical Integrity, and Line Break Permitting also benefit from the high level of employee involvement.  It is through these programs that the potential hazards of the process are identified, corrected, reviewed, and/or mitigated.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the PSM programs, H.B. Fuller's Contractor Safety & Management programs also the Seneca facility achieve its EH&S goals.  The contractor program is simple and direct.  Contractors and their employees are treated as though they are H.B. Fuller  employees while performing work at the Seneca site.  They are trained on our processes and procedures, expected to follow our programs and procedures, participate as necessary, and be held to the same standards of performance as we hold our own employees.  The mechanical integrity program for this facility involves the regular testing and inspection of equipment used within our hazardous processes.  Equipment is expected to be purchased, installed, and maintained in accordance with applicable codes and standards, manufacturer's recommendations, and generally accepted good engineering practices.  Equipment found that does not meet these requirements will be repaired, replaced, or removed from service.  These same principles will be applied to spare parts and maintenance activities.\n\n\n\nLastly, in an effort to continuously improve upon these programs, regular audits are done to determine the facility's implementation and operation under these programs.  These audits are then used to determine where additional efforts, program changes, or training need "
