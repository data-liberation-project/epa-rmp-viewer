All employees are held accountable for their own safety performance.\n\nAdditionally, employees understand that work is never so urgent or important that we cannot take time to do it safely and correctly. Two guiding principles at this Refinery are; \"Do it safely or not at all\" and \"There is always time to do it right.\"\n\nDESCRIPTION OF SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe Chevron Pascagoula Refinery is located in Pascagoula, MS.  The Refinery receives crude oil by tanker for processing into various products.  The process by which crude oil is manufactured into various saleable products such as gasoline and propane is known as refining.  Petroleum refining involves the separation of crude oil into several components using distillation methods.  Heavier hydrocarbon compounds are further processed by cracking and sub"

Regulated flammable substances are present at the Refinery as flammable mixtures. Primary components of the mixtures are propane, butane, pentane and propylene. Secondary components of the mixtures can include: hydrogen, methane, ethane, ethylene, butene, isobutane, isobutene, 2-butene-cis, 2-butene-trans, 1,3-butadiene, 2-pentene E), 2-pentene(Z)and isopentane. \n\nThe only RMP regulated toxic substance that the refinery has above threshold quantities is anhydrous ammonia. Ammonia is an impurity in the crude and as the crude is distilled the ammonia is removed and sold as a product. \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThis section is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Chevron Pascagoula Refinery.  Because processes at the Refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP (Risk Management Process) regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM (Process Safety Management) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program. The objective of the PSM system is to reduce the consequences of and potential for accidents in the Refinery.  Accidents could include fires, explosions, toxic gas releases, spills, product quality problems, etc.\n\nEmployee Participation \nThe Refinery encourages participation in Process Safety Management through training and the development of cross-functional teams to perform process hazards analyses. Every organizational meeting is started with a short safety/health discussion.  Safety topic presentations are included as part of meeting agendas and responsibility for these presentations is rotated among employees to give everyone a chance to participate.

Consistent usage of LPS tools and techniques strengthens our culture of injury and incident free operations. LPS offers a new approach to reducing and eliminating costly losses and incidents by focusing on behavior-based tools and management techniques. By using LPS, employees and contractors are able to identify the risks or potential causes of an injury or incident before it occurs and then implement the proper changes or improvements so that the task can be performed safely and efficiently. The reporting process is done through a database. \n\nSafety Audits\nPeriodically the Refinery is subject to company internal audits.  These audits include Fire Loss Prevention surveys, Corporate OE Safety, Fire, Health, and Reliability Reviews and Process Safety Management Audit.  These audits/surveys insure that the facility is in compliance with recommended practices, policies, and government laws and regulations. Internal audits are performed on a regular frequency involving management and first line supervision with specific emphasis on high risk safe work practices such as confined space, hot work, work at heights, electrical and isolation of hazardous energy. \n\nWe were also audited by OSHA under the Federal PSM National Enforcement Program in January 2009. There were no Serious, Willful or Repeat PSM citations resulting from the comprehensive audit.  The team consisted of 10 OSHA employees on site for eight weeks. They requested over a hundred and fifty documents and conducted many employee interviews.
