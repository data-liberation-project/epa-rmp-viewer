We \nroutinely train all of the staff on process safety as well as lockout tagout, hazcom, \nand food safety. We have located ammonia detectors in all areas where there is a risk \nfor an ammonia leak, we have engineered in controls and a water absorbtion system in \nthe event of a multiple system failure, will contain any ammonia that would be \ndischarged through the relief valve vent lines. The training that we utilize for the \noperators of our ammonia refrigeration system consists of hands on, books and computer \nassisted training. We continuously monitor and audit our PSM system in order to prevent \nmechanical or operational failures of our system."
