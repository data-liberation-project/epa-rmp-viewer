Currently, the facility's system contains 9,498 lbs of anhydrous ammonia.  A new system under construction will add an additional 2,583 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia, thus requiring Latex Foam International LLC to comply with the RMP requirements.\n\nThe anhydous ammonia is contained within an enclosed system.  This existing system consists of the following: HP/TS Reciever (2,387.5 lb.); Intercooler (1,863.2 lb.); three (3) Surge Drums (1566.4 lb. Total); three (3) Heat Exchangers Plate and Frames (1,417 lb. Total); two (2) Condensors (746 lb. Total); Liquid Piping/TS Oil Coolers (1,000 lb.); three (3) Booster Compressors with discharge pressure at approximately 30 psi; and three (3) High Stage Compressors with discharge pressures at 139 psi. \n\nThe proposed anhydrous ammonia system will include the following equipment and approximate amounts of ammonia contained in the equipment:  HP Receiver (605.2 lb.); Surge Drum (522.1 lb.); Heat Exchanger Plate and Frame (209.8 lb.); Condenser (746 lb.); and Liquid Piping (500 lb.).  This system also has its own booster and high stage compressor.\n \nIn general, the existing system and the new system operate in a similar manner.  Ammonia is pumped from the HP/TS Reciever through piping into one of three Surge Drums that provide space for liquified and gaseous ammonia.  The drum level for liquified ammonia is maintained at an eight inch (8\") level.  The liquid ammonia passes through one side of the heat exchanger while ethylene glycol flows through the other side of the heat exchanger.  Each of the surge drums and heat exchangers provides a specific amount of cooling to the ethylene glycol.  As the temperature of the liquid ammonia increases it is returned to the surge drum in vapor form and pumped to a compressor.  From the compressor the gaseous ammonia is pressurized t"
