The plan includes a regular preventative maintenance program(mechanical integrity) for the ammonia system components, and a program for both pre-startup safety reviews and management of change(MOC)to the ammonia refrigeration system. The program also includes operating procedures for the safe operation of the refrigeration system, specific requirements for safe work practices (such as safe approaches to welding and other hot work), safety requirements for contractors who may be hired to work on the refrigeration system. WinCo has a procedure in place for investigating incidents to ensure root causes are identified and corrective actions to minimize the potential for recurrence of incidents. The program also has a component for conducting compliance audits audits to ensure the facility's RMP/PSM program is being implemented at WinCo's Denton facility. Lastly the RMP?PSM program incorporates the facilities emergency Action plan and places special emphasis on handling accidental releases of ammonia and coordination of emergency response activities with the local fire authority and other response agencies as well as the applicable ocal, state and federal regulatory agencies.
