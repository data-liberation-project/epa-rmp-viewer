In the case of a major leak, the scrubber is capable of removing 2,000 pounds of chlorine gas from the air prior to being vented to the atmosphere.  This is the primary line of defense in protecting the surrounding community from the hazards associated with a major chlorine release.  All release scenarios used in the plan assume the scrubber is not operational during the release.  In reality, a major chlorine release would not have any noticeable effect on the surrounding community because the scrubber would remove the chlorine prior to release.  The assumption of an inactive scrubber during a major release is considered a worst case scenario.  The facility is also equipped with an emergency generator capable of running the entire plant during a power outage.\r\n\r\nIII. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Eden Prairie Facility is included in the community emergency response plan.  Emergency response would only be used in the rare occurrence that there is a major release and that the chlorine scrubber is not used.  In the event of a major release, an employee of the Fire Department would then assess if a HAZMAT team is needed.  These organizations are trained in handling emergency situations and hazardous materials.  These agencies would be responsible for mitigating the effects of chlorine release and coordinating evacuation procedures if necessary.\r\n\r\nA training program has been established to ensure that all employees of the treatment facility can identify an emergency situation and understand the procedure for notifying the proper personnel.  As part of this program, facility employees will annually meet with representatives of the fire department to discuss potential hazards.  This will also allow the fire department to gain familiarity with the layout of the treatment plant and grounds.\r\n\r\nIV. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RMP/PSM PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Facility has implemented written procedures in compliance with the RMP/PSM"

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe City of Eden Prairie Minnesota has prepared this Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the Water Treatment Plant (Facility) located at 14100 Technology Drive, Eden Prairie, Minnesota 55344-4485. The purpose of the RMP is to help prevent or minimize risk of exposure to chlorine gas for Facility employees and the surrounding community.\r\n\r\nI. FACILITY DESCRIPTION\r\n\r\nThe City of Eden Prairie Water Treatment Plant is capable of treating a maximum daily water flow of 28 million gallons per day. The Facility uses approximately 1,500 pounds per day of chlorine for disinfection. During normal operations, the Facility may have up to 24,000 pounds of chlorine stored at the site. The chlorine is stored in 2,000 pound containers.\r\n\r\nThe Facility is required by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to create a Risk Management Plan for chlorine in compliance with Regulation 40 CFR 68. This RMP also provides compliance with the Process Safety Management (PSM) requirement in OSHA Regulation 29 CFR 1910.119. A facility operates under this regulation when it houses more than a threshold quantity of a regulated material for use in a water treatment process. The Facility maintains more than the threshold quantity (2,500 pounds) of chlorine on-site at any given time. An original RMP was created and submitted to the EPA in June of 1999. A revised RMP was prepared and submitted in October of 2004, and again in August of 2011. This edition represents the required five-year update of these earlier Plans.\r\n\r\nII. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS\r\n\r\nThe Eden Prairie Water Treatment Plant has a state of the art facility for safely handling and feeding chlorine into the City's water system.  The system was put online in March of 1998 and incorporates the most modern technology.\r\n\r\nThe chlorine feed system operates on a vacuum principal with automatic shut-off valves if the vacuum is interrupted.  This minimizes the risk of a major release due to damage of the chlorine piping system.  T"
