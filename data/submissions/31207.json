The Augusta Water Treatment Plant has been treating and supplying potable water to our customers for over\n       60 years providing quality water in a safe manner to our community and environment.\n\n       Our Water Treatment Plant treats an  average of 28 MGD utilizing the conventional filtration process. This process\n       involves the addition of Aluminum Sulfate to destabilize the small particles in the raw water supply.\n       Once destabilized, the particles then slowly mix to form larger particles that are removed through \n       settling. Following the settling process, the water is filtered through a coal and sand media that final\n       polishes the water.  Post treatment includes disinfectining with CHLORINE, addition of Fluorosilcic\n       Acid for Fluoride, and the addition of a Orthophosphate to reduce the corrosion of piping.\n\nIII.   The worst case release scenario for Chlorine would be the failure of a presurized chlorine cylinder\n      valve, and the sudden release of its contents (20"
