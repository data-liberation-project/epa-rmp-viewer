(\"Unified\") to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia that could cause harm to the public and the environment from short-term exposures. This summary includes an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release, a five-year accident history, and a release prevention and emergency response program. \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \n\nThe Plan identifies current operating procedures and policies in effect at Unified  to minimize the potential for accidental releases of hazardous materials. Emergency preparedness procedures including emergency response, spill mitigation, evacuation procedures, alarms and emergency phone numbers have been implemented by Unified  and are summarized in this Plan. Also included in this plan is a summary of operating procedures and preventative maintenance activities that have been implemented to insure the likelihood of accidental releases. \n\n\n\nThis Plan, the Emergency Evacuation Plan, and Standard Operating Procedures document the accidental release prevention safety, and emergency policies in place at Unified. \n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \n\nUnified is located at 1990 Piccoli Road in Stockton, California (\"the facility\"). The facility is situated within an industrial area and occupies approximately sixty acres of land. The facility performs operations common to the storage of refrigerated foods by utilizing an ammonia refrigeration system to provide refrigeration for storage areas. Freezer areas and cooler areas are equipped with evaporators to keep desired areas cold. Liquid ammonia is transferred from a high-pressure receiver to a low-pressure accumulator by direct expansion. The low-pressure liquid is circulated to the evaporators and back by a circulating pump. Previously the refrigerated area was served by 2- separate 4000 lbs refrigeration sy"

Mechanical Room 1 has 9000 lbs, Mechanical Room 2 has 4000 lbs and Mechanical Room 3 has 5453 lbs. Mechanical Room 2 and 3 are adjacent to each other with interconnecting doorways. The refrigeration systems are not physically interconnected. Mechanical Room 3 has room for additional expansion capacity. \n\n\n\nAmmonia is a listed substance regulated under the California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP) regulations contained in Division 2 of Title 19 of the California Code of Regulations. Processes containing a listed substance in quantities greater than the California threshold of (500 pounds) and less than the federal threshold (10,000 pounds) are subject CalARP applicability and compliance only. Whereas, processes containing a listed substance in quantities greater than 10,000 pounds are subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management standard.  The facility contains approximately 18,500 pounds of ammonia and is now considered a PSM facility as well as a RMP level 3 facility.  \n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps \n\nUnified  has developed and implemented this Plan with the objective of complying with the requirements and guidelines set forth by the Cal ARP program. The Plans purpose is to enhance the facilities existing safety programs implemented at the site to reduce the possibility of accidental releases of regulated substances that could cause harm to the public and the environment. The emergency response program includes accidental release prevention and chemical specific prevention steps.
