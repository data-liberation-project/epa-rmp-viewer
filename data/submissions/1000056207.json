The facility design incorporates several safety devices and J&D personnel follow safe work practices to minimize the risk of an accidental release.\r\nJ&D has implemented a process safety management (PSM) program that complies with the regulations stipulated by Oregon Administrative Rules (OAR) \u00a71910.119. A crucial component of this plan is the emergency action plan, developed in compliance with the emergency planning provisions of OAR Chapter 437 Division 002. The emergency action plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordination with outside parties to enable coordinated action to effectively deal with unplanned events.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia at J&D is used to operate a refrigerated distribution warehouse to preserve product integrity. Access to the system is limited to authorized employees, management personnel, and contractors.\r\n\r\nJ&D's written PSM plan incorporates policies and procedures to ensure safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration equipment. Plan elements essential to safe operation of the refrigeration system include employee participation, process safety information, process hazard analysis (PHA), operating procedures, training, contractor safety, pre-startup safety review, mechanical integrity, management of change, hot-work permits, incident investigation, emergency response and planning, and compliance audits. This plan will be reviewed annually, audited every three years, and updated as necessary by J&D.\r\nTraining is provided to ensure that each employee involved in operating the refrigeration system understands the refrigeration process, the operating procedures, and safety considerations. Only qualified maintenance personnel operate the refrigeration system. \r\n\r\nThere have been no reportable accidents at the J&D facility in the past five years.\r\n\r\nJ&D has a written emergency action plan to ensure that precautions and procedures are in place to protect emplo"

It complies with the provisions of Oregon Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OR-OSHA) emergency planning requirements in OAR Chapter 437 Division 002. The emergency action plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties. This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively respond to unplanned events. This plan has been provided to and reviewed with the Clackamas County Fire Department and Hazmat Team.\r\nThe approach in the development of this plan has been to identify the ammonia emergencies most likely to occur at the J&D facilities and to establish precautions and procedures to protect life, safety, and health during an emergency. The refrigeration process has backup prevention systems to keep processing malfunctions from becoming ammonia release emergencies. If an emergency does occur, J&D personnel will immediately notify the Clackamas County Fire Department and Hazmat Team and may initiate the system shut down function through the electronic Logix control system to help mitigate the release. Automatic alarms, shutdown systems, and controls have been designed to minimize the potential for an uncontrolled release.\r\nAll J&D personnel are trained to fulfill their designated responsibilities in an emergency. Mock emergency drills are held periodically to maintain familiarity with response actions and identify plan elements requiring improvement.\r\nThis plan shall be reviewed annually and updated as necessary.\r\n\r\nAny upgrades or extensive maintenance work performed in the future will be in compliance with codes and standards applicable at that time. \r\nJ&D completed the original PHA for the system in December 2012. An update to the PHA was completed in 2016 as a result of the facility expansion. Higher-priority items are scheduled for completion by the end of 2016. Lower-priority items are scheduled for completion by the next PHA in 202"
