      "SummaryText": "SID RICHARDSON GASOLINE CO.\nJal #3 Gas Plant\nExecutive Summary RMP \n \nSid Richardson Gasoline Co. is a privately held company that has been in the gas processing business for more than 50 years.  We operate two natural gas processing plants in Southeast New Mexico and West Texas.    The Jal # 3 gas plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, gas plant trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.  \n\nThis facility gathers field natural gas for processing.  The facility and system of pipelines is jurisdictional to the Environmental Protection Agency, New Mexico Oil Conservation Division, New Mexico Environmental Department, New Mexico Water Quality Board, Texas Natural Resources and Conservation Commission, Texas Railroad Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and the United States Department of Transportation.  These agencies conduct periodic facility inspections and report any findings to Sid Richardson Gasoline Co. management.\n\nThe Jal #3 gas plant has an excellent record of accident prevention.  Over the past 5 years there have been no incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury at this facility.\nFive-year History                                         1994  1995      1996         1997     1998\nNumber of RMP releases                                0        0            0              0            0\n\nThe Jal #3 gas plant, located northeast of Jal, New Mexico, at coordinates Latitude 32(10' 27 Longitude 103(10' 25, operates a variety of p"

      "SummaryText": "rocesses to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane, and condensate) from natural gas.  The Jal #3 gas plant has three regulated processes:\n\n1. Propane storage tank (Propane)\n2. Product surge tank (Propane, Ethane, and Butane) \n3. Natural gas condensate storage tank (Pentane)\n\nAdditionally, the plant uses chlorine gas at its cooling tower (< threshold planning quantity) and has hydrogen sulfide gas in the process (< threshold planning quantity).  These two toxics are addressed in our facility emergency action plan. In addition, the hydrogen sulfide gas is covered under the New Mexico Rule 118, of which we comply, that deals with the protection of the general public.  This facility does not have a threshold planning quantity of any toxic; therefore, a worst-case scenario (WCS) for a toxic release was not evaluated.  \n\nThe WCS associated with a release of flammable substances at the gas plant is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the product storage tank containing a mixture of ethane, propane and butane.\n  \nThe maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.62 mile(s).   The WCS for the other two regulated processes would result in a 1psi endpoint of 0.41 miles.  There are no public or environmental receptors within either of these radii. Note: see the calculations used to determine the 1 psi overpressure (Exhibit A ) and the attached 7.5 Minute Quadrangle map of Jal NW, New, Mexico (Exhibit B) that shows the area of impact and the closest residence.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS. There is only Program Level 1 processes, containing regulated flammable substances, identified at our gas plant. \n\nThe Jal #3 gas plant maintains a written emergency action program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.
