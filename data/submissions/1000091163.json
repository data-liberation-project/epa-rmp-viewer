      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\n- Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nMichigan Milk Producers Association (MMPA) is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated processes. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible accidental releases of regulated substances. However, if such an accidental release does occur, MMPA coordinates with off-site emergency response support.\r\n\r\n\r\n- The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nPresently ammonia  (Anhydrous) is the only RMP regulated substance present at this facility in a threshold quantity.  The ammonia system at the Michigan Milk Producers Association consists primarily of vessels, compressors, condensers, evaporators and associated piping. The majority of the equipment is located inside the engine room. The system is a closed loop refrigeration system similar to a residential refrigerator. There are no emissions or planned releases of ammonia.\r\n\r\nThe maximum intended inventory of ammonia at the MMPA facility is approximately 14,842 pounds within one refrigeration system.  \r\n\r\nRefrigeration process equipment at the facility operates continuously.  Compressors and condensers cycle on and off to comply with system demand during operation.  The ammonia refrigeration system provides cooling for cold storage and chilling of milk products.\r\n\r\nThe refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of high pressure liquid ammonia from the High Pressure Receiver to the Glycol Chiller Accumulators, Surge Drums (SD1-SD5), Surge Vessels (SV1-SV7, SV11, SV12-SV14, SV16 - SV20), Liquid Recirculator, and the Buttermilk Heat Exchanger. Prior to entering each vessel, the high pressure liquid ammonia experiences a pressure drop through hand expan"

A small supply of high pressure liquid is also reserved for the FES Compressor for oil cooling. \r\n\r\nThe Glycol Chiller Accumulators, Surge Drums, Liquid Recirculator, and Surge Vessels maintain a reservoir of liquid ammonia, which is used to provide low pressure liquid to their respective heat exchangers.  The Glycol Chiller Accumulators provide low pressure liquid to the Glycol Chiller Evaporators. \r\n\r\nSurge drums SD1 and SD2 provide low pressure liquid to Plate Chillers PC1 and PC2.  Surge drums SD3 and SD4 provide low pressure liquid to the two Ice Builders.  Surge Drum SD5 provides low pressure liquid to Plate Chiller PC3.  The Surge Vessels provide low pressure liquid to the heating jacket surrounding each of the Cream Tanks.  The Liquid Recirculator provides low pressure liquid to the two Penthouse Evaporators. Suction is then returned from these heat exchangers back to their associated vessels. \r\n\r\nSuction from the Glycol Chiller Accumulators, Surge Drums, Surge Vessels, Buttermilk Heat Exchanger, and the Liquid Recirculator is routed to a common suction header and sent to the Suction Accumulator. Liquid, which accumulates in the Suction Accumulator, is transferred back to the High Pressure Receiver via a dump trap.  Once the level in the dump trap reaches the float switch, the transfer cycle begins and liquid ammonia is sent back to the high pressure receiver.  \r\n\r\nThe ammonia/oil mixture from the oil pots associated with the Surge Vessels, Liquid Recirculator, and the Suction Accumulator is collected in the Oil Accumulator. The Oil Accumulator is a vessel containing a heating element, which supplies heat to boil the liquid ammonia away from the oil. The ammonia suction from the top of the vessel is drawn by the Pump Out Compressor and the discharge is sent to the condenser via the high stage discharge line.  \r\n\r\nSuction from the"

      "SummaryText": "Suction Accumulator is drawn off by the compressors, which discharge through a common header to the condenser where the high pressure ammonia vapor is condensed to a high pressure liquid and then drained back to the High Pressure Receiver. The high pressure vapor is condensed by discharging latent heat in the ammonia to the atmosphere using sprayed water and fans. \r\n\r\nThe relief valves are set at 250 psig on all vessels except the Suction Accumulator, Ice Builder Surge Drums, Butter-Milk and Cream Tank surge Vessels, and Plate Chiller Surge Drums, which are set at 150 psig (see Appendix C).  The relief valves vent to the atmosphere via a relief header.  \r\n\r\n- The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nMichigan Milk Producers Association has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68.  Michigan Milk Producers Association is also subject to the OSHA PSM Standard under 29 CFR 1910.119, as well as the EPCRA Section 302 and 311/312 notification/reporting requirements. The facility also maintains a contract with a professional refrigeration service firm to conduct preventative maintenance and any necessary repairs.\r\n\r\nAmmonia detectors are strategically located in the Engine Room and the facility. In case of ammonia detection, visible and audible alarms will activate at the facility and at the computer system.\r\n\r\nIn the event of a power failure, ammonia operations would automatically shut-down (solenoid valves close, compressors shut-down, condenser fans and water pumps shut-down, evaporator fans shut-down, etc.), thereby limiting the possibility of any ammonia releases. \r\n\r\nThe system also incorporates a pressure relief system. In the event of over-pressurization, vessels will vent to atmosphere until the system pressure decreases sufficiently to reseat the valves. This mechanism prevents vessels from rupturing in case they become over pressurized"

The facility maintains a written Emergency Action Plan to document specific procedures to be implemented in the event of various emergencies, including ammonia release.
