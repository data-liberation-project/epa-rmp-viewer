Carrera Gas Company, LLC is committed to the safety and health of it's employees, contractors and visitors.  This commitment is demonstrated in the design, installation, operation and maintenance programs developed and implemented specifically for this facility.  Operation and maintenance personnel are trained in the appropriate emergency response procedures to follow in the event of an accidental release.  However, accident prevention is the ultimate goal and as such a site specific mechanical integrity program is being implemented and maintained.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe Carrera Camrick Gas Plant is located approximately 8 miles Southwest of Gray, Oklahoma; Beaver County.  It is a cryogenic expander plant that is designed to extract liquid petroleum products (ethane, propane, butane, pentane, and heavier hydrocarbons) from raw natural gas and at the same time produce pipeline quality gas (primarily methane).  The only process in the plant that contains an above threshold quantity of a regulated substance is the Y-Grade Storage Tank (liquid petroleum products).  There are no above threshold quantitiy toxic substances present at the Carrera Camrick Gas Plant.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe Carrera Camrick Gas Plant has developed and implemented a site-specific accidental release prevention program that consists of a detailed facility mechanical integrity program and employee training program.  The mechanical integrity program was developed under the guidelines of manufacturer written recommendations, recognized/generally accepted good engineering practices, industry/regulatory standards and past operation history.  Employee training was designed to ensure/document "

The ERP includes the names and phone numbers not only of company personnel but also the names and phone numbers of support services (contractors, police departments, fire departments, medical services/hospitals, regulatory agencies, LEPC, etc.) that may be called upon for assistance.  Liaison with these agencies is maintained to ensure timely and proper responses.  Employee understanding of their responsibilities during an emergency situation is high priority.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nCamrick Gas Processing Company, LLC, believes safety is an issue that can always be improved upon.  Carrera continues to look for, develop and implement programs that will improve an employee's ability to identify and correct potential workplace hazards.  Carrera also endeavors to ensure policies, programs and procedures are developed and implemented to meet applicable laws, rules and regulations.  Employee understanding of these policies, programs and procedures is high priority."
