Hydrofluoric acid (HF) is used as a catalyst in the HF Alkylation unit to make high quality gasoline blending components, and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is present as a byproduct of the desulfurization (sulfur removal) process in the refinery Heavy Distillate Hydrotreating (HDH) unit.\r\n\r\n1.3 Offsite Consequence Analysis\r\n\r\nSPPRC performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance that could affect the public or the environment. The offsite consequence analysis consists of evaluating both worst case scenarios and alternative release scenarios for flammables and toxics as defined by the USEPA. A worst case release scenario event is unlikely to ever occur. An alternative release scenario represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility like SPPRC. Alternative release scenarios can be used to help local emergency responders, such as fire and police departments and the county and state emergency managers, to improve local emergency response planning. Release scenario analyses have been submitted to USEPA and have shared that information with the organizations involved in emergency response activities. It should be noted that no events in the magnitude of these worst-case or alternative incident scenarios have ever occurred at the facility. In the case of some of these incident scenarios, emergency mitigation systems would reduce the consequences of the events should they occur. In all cases, should such events occur, the emergency response plan would be implemented, local authorities would be notified, and appropriate actions would be taken to protect both employees and the public.\r\n\r\nAs stated previously, details regarding the"

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nSt. Paul Park Refining Co., LLC (SPPRC), is committed to operating in a manner that protects its employees and contractors, the public, and the environment. As part of this commitment, SPPRC has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility. One part of these systems is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at SPPRC and that complies with the requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA) rule 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) describing the risk management program at SPPRC. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP executive summary requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at SPPRC.\r\n\r\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nSPPRC is committed to the safety of its workers and the public and to the protection of the environment through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. SPPRC employs highly skilled and trained operating personnel and has implemented administrative and operational controls to reduce the likelihood of hazardous substance releases. In addition, a trained Emergency Response Team (ERT) equipped with dedicated equipment resources is available to respond to a significant accidental release. The overall emergency response program for SPPRC is coordinated with the facility Emergency Response Team (ERT), an internal Emergency Operations Center team, WAKOTA CAER (a local emergency response cooperative), state and local government agencies, and off-site emergency response resources that could be called"

Because the processes regulated by the USEPA RMP regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) standard and because the OSHA PSM requirements are very similar to the USEPA RMP requirements, this summary also addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements. The PSM program at this facility has been extended by SPPRC, where necessary, to satisfy USEPA's Program Level 3 accident prevention program requirements.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nSPPRC encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents to participating as a member on the process hazard analysis (PHA), incident investigation, and compliance audit teams. Employees have access to all information created as part of the SPPRC accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at SPPRC and addresses each accident prevention program element. In addition, SPPRC has a number of initiatives that address process safety and employee safety issues, such as a Behavior-Based Safety Program and monthly employee safety communication meetings.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nSPPRC maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known compatibility issues associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, SPPRC has documented safety-related upper and lower operating limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in Critical Process Variable Documents. SPPRC operates equipment within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). SPPRC also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, relief system design, applicable codes and standards, safety systems, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nSPPRC also maintains Troubleshooting Guides for all process units which identify the consequences from operating outside the normal operating range and provides steps for reestablishing operation within the normal operating range.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\nSPPRC has a comprehensive Process Hazard Analysi"

The written operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, SPPRC has implemented a company training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees must receive basic training in SPPRC operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operating employees periodically receive refresher training to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training. Additional training for operators and other refinery personnel includes fire training and computer based training related to safety and environmental programs.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nSPPRC uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.
