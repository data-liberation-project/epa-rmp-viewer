Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Producer's Co-op, Olathe Division in Olathe, Colorado  are strongly committed to employee,\n\npublic, and environmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive\n\naccidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating\n\nprocedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is\n\nour policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. \n\nWe coordinate our response efforts with the Montrose County Sheriff's Department, which provides\n\nadditional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\n\nammonia stored in one 18,000-gallon tank, two interconnected 11,000-gallon tanks, twenty-five\n\n1,000-gallon nurse tanks and nine 500-gallon nurse tanks at our facility in Olathe, Colorado (Figure\n\n1).  The maximum amount stored is 51,425 gallons ( 264,633.05 pounds) including the capacity of\n\nthe maximum number of on-site nurse tanks.   The largest single storage vessel at our facility\n\ncontains 78,733.8 pounds at  85% standard maximum storage capacity.\n\n\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nWe utilized RMP Comp for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite\n\nconsequence analysis for our facility.  The following details these scenarios.\n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of one of the \n\nlargest single anhydrous ammonia storage tanks (78,733.8 pounds) in gaseous form"

Radius2 x 3.14 = area of circle. 4.2\n\nmiles2 x 3.14 x 75 people = approximately 4,155 people within 4.2 mile radius of the site. \n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a release from vehicular collision with the tank resulting\n\nin a pipe break and the release of anhydrous ammonia through a 1\" dia. hole in the anhydrous\n\nammonia product line.  Vehicular collision (RMP Hazard Review, Section 8.4) was selected as the\n\nmost probable causal agent for an alternative release scenario.  The scenario involves the release of \n\n5,000 pounds of ammonia in a gaseous form over a period of two minutes.  Active mitigation\n\n(emergency shutoff) limited the release to two minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the\n\nmaximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of ammonia is 1.2 miles (Figure 3).
