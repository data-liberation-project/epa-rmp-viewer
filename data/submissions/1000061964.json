We use\n\nvacuum chlorinators, therefore, if a hole develops in a process line, air will be drawn in instead of chlorine\n\nleaking out. We provide chlorine training and require that two people be present when handling chlorine. We\n\nhave chlorine leak repair kits and personal Self-contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) provided to trained employees so we can repair leaks. Leak detectors, which give both local and remote alarms, are used at the plant. If a leak occurs, an alarm sounds at our\n\ndispatch center,which is staffed 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, and members of our chlorine response team\n\nrespond. There are two members of the chlorine response team on call at all times. The detectors also\n\nactivate a scrubber which is designed to vacuum up the chlorine-contaminated air, neutralize the chlorine\n\nand discharge relatively clean air to the environment. Finally, we have our Risk Management Program\n\ndocumentation, which includes our written standard operating procedures for our chlorine process, chlorine\n\nhandling, and safety procedures.",

The resources invested in the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances demonstrate this commitment.  The CWL East Side Wastewater Treatment Plant implements reasonable controls, such as training of personnel and the safe design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to make every effort to prevent the release of hazardous substances but in the event of a release, our trained personnel and local emergency response agencies will respond to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injuries to the public or the environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.0    Description of the CWL East Side Wastewater Treatment Plant and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe CWL East Side Wastewater Treatment Plant handles one substance regulated by the Risk Management Plan Rule (RMP Rule) in quantities above the Threshold Quantity.  This substance is:\n\n\n\n* Chlorine - stored in 1 ton cylinders and used for disinfection of the water prior to release to the receiving stream.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.0    Hazard Assessment\n\n \n\nThe RMP Rule requires the CWL East Side Wastewater Treatment Plant to perform a Hazard Assessment of the regulated substances stored and used in the covered processes at the facility.  This Hazard Assessment includes an offsite consequence analysis for the following scenarios:\n\n \n\n* One worst-case and one alternative release scenario for the toxic substance chlorine for the chlorination process unit at the facility.\n\n\n\nThe CWL East Side Wastewater Treatment Plant completed a Hazard Assessment for the covered processes and the results have been appropriately communicated to the loc"

The following details the prevention program elements at The CWL East Side Wastewater Treatment Plant that apply to these processes.\n\n\n\n4.1    Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe CWL East Side Wastewater Treatment Plant maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of the CWL East Side Wastewater Treatment Plant processes.  Safety data sheets (SDSs) document the physical and chemical properties of hazardous substances handled at the CWL East Side Wastewater Treatment Plant, including the chlorine in the covered process.  The engineering design documents include the operating parameters, the design basis and configuration of the equipment in each covered process, and references to applicable codes and standards.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2    Hazard Review\n\n\n\nThe CWL East Side Wastewater Treatment Plant performs and periodically updates hazard reviews of the covered processes to help identify and control process hazards.  Checklists are used to guide the hazard review.  These checklists include items to help ensure the CWL East Side Wastewater Treatment Plant operates and maintains the equipment in a manner consistent with the applicable design specifications, codes, standards, and regulations.\n\n\n\n4.3    Operating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe CWL East Side Wastewater Treatment Plant develops and maintains operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be performed.  The operating procedures are used to:\n\n\n\n1. train employees, and\n\n2. serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal and abnormal process conditions.\n\n\n\n4.4    Training\n\n\n\nThe CWL East Side Wastewater Treatment Plant trains"
