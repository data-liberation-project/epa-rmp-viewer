ARE COMMITTED TO THE PREVENTION OF ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF AQUA AMMONIA. iF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE COMPANY, OR OTHER AUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACK OF THE RELEASE TO PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT. THE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THE FACILITY IS THE BLENDING OF FERTILIZERS FOR SALE TO FARMERS.AQUA AMMONIA IS RECEIVED AND STORED FOR THE BLENDING INTO MIXED GRADE FERTILIZERS FOR CROP PRODUCTION NUTRIENTS. THE MAXIMUM QUANITY STORED WOULD BE 104600 POUNDS IN OUR 20000 GALLON STORAGE TANK. THE MAXIMUM QUANITY HANDLED WOULD BE THE UNLOADING OF A TANKER TRUCK HOLDING 44400 POUNDS. THE WORST CASE SENARIO WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF A STORAGE TANK RELEASED AS A LIQUID OVER 10 MINUTES. THE MAXIMUM QUANITY RELEASED WOULD BE 42600 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE LARGEST STORAGE TANK AT 85% CAPACITYAS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS. THE DISTANCE TO THE END POINT IS 1.66 MILES. THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO BASED ON THE 5 YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY ( OR THE MOST LIKELY POTENTIAL INCIDENT) IS A RELEASE FROM A RUPTURE DISK/RELIEF VALVE. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT IS 0.06 MILES. THE FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF AQUA AMMONIA. THERE HAS BEEN NO ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF AQUA AMMONIA IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS. THE FACILITY HAS PROVIDED STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES THE EMERGENCY PLANNING AND COMMUNITY RIGH TO KNOW INFORMATION AS REQUIRED UNDER SARA TITLE II. SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS IS AN ON GOING PROCESS AT THE FACILITY. EVALUATIONS ARE PERFORMED TO ASSESS THE MAINTENANCE OF SAFE CONDITIONS."
