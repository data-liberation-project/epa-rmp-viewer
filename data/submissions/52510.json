      "SummaryText": "\n\nThe Avon Products ? Suwanee (Atlanta) Branch facility is a warehousing operation where various consumer products are stored. The inventory stored includes different aerosol products, such as hair care products, shaving creams, air fresheners, and insect repellants.\n\nThe aerosol products include propellants such as methyl ether, isobulane, propane, butane, and Difluoroethane. The aerosol propellants are a regulated flammable mixture under the ?Chemical Accident Prevention Rule? (Risk Management Program, 40 CFR Part 68). This flammable mixture is the only regulated substance present at the facility in a process above a threshold quantity.\n\nThe facility is classified as a Program 1 facility under the RMP rules. As such, it presents a minimal risk to the community. There have been no reportable accidental releases of the regulated flammable mixture in the last five years.\n\nAccidental releases of all materials, including the regulated flammable mixture, are prevented through the proper design, operation and maintenance of the facilities, and through the proper training of the employees. Release prevention measures include operational procedures and employee training programs specific to the handling of flammable aerosols.\n\nAvon maintains a written emergency management plan to respond to an accidental release or other emergency. The plan includes procedures for employee training, employee response responsibilities, plant evacuation, and the notification of the Suwanee Fire Department and other local agencies. The plan is review regularly and is updated as necessary to reflect any changes at the plant.\n\nAvon maintains an excellent working relationship with the Suwanee Fire Department. The plant fire detection is connected directly to the fire department to ensure a rapid response to an emergency. The fire department is very familiar with the operations and chemical inventory at the facility."
