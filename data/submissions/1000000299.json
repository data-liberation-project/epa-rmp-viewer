Corporate Prevention and Emergency Response Approach\n\nAt this facility, ethylene is stored and transferred into portable cylinders.  Ethylene, in the amounts handled by our facility, is considered hazardous by the EPA.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Airgas manages the safety of the regulated process by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g., alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon OSHAA?s HAZWOPER regulation.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authority and Hazardous Materials unit so that the appropriate measures can be taken by local emergency responders to control accidental releases.\n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPAs Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68). The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\n\n2.  Description of Stationary Source \n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is the storage of ethylene and the transfer of same into portable cylinders. The ethylene is used by Airgas customers for a variety of applications such as a fuel for heating and metal processing.     The ethylene is delivered into the ethylene storage area by the ethylene supplier.  Portable cylinders are filled individually by weight on a scale.  There is no chemical reaction involved.  The process is strictly the transfer of ethylene from a large storage container into smaller individual portable cylinders.  T"

      "SummaryText": "he capacities of the cylinders range from approx. 4 pounds up to 38 pound cylinders.  During this process, no products or wastes are either created nor consumed.\n\nThe regulated substance handled at this facility is the pure, single product, Ethylene, which is a flammable gas.  The maximum amount of this substance at this facility is 14,000 pounds.\n\n3.  Prevention Program \n\nThe facility developed prevention program elements based on the Federal EPAs Accidental Release Prevention Plan, and OSHAs Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.  This facility was designed and constructed to comply with applicable state and industry codes.\n\n4.  Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidents involving or accidental releases of flammable gas that resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n5.  Emergency Response Program\n\nAt this site, employees are trained to recognize emergencies and initiate emergency response from outside agencies.  Employees will not be involved in the emergency response activities. Emergency response actions have been coordinated with the Jacksonville City Fire Department on 6/10/2002. Periodic contact with this agency is maintained to review the effectiveness of the facility's emergency procedures."
