      "SummaryText": "PROCESS SUMMARY\n\nReddy Ice-Landover (427), located at 7100-B Old Landover Road in Landover, Maryland, is a manufacturer of ice for wholesale and retail distribution. The facility has a production capacity of approximately 240 tons of ice per day and utilizes anhydrous ammonia (NH3) as a refrigerant for ice manufacturing and storage.\n\n\n\nThe refrigeration operation is a closed-circuit ammonia mechanical refrigerating system. The system has numerous protective controls including: motor overload, high discharge temperature, high discharge pressure, low suction pressure, and low oil differential on all compressors; high level float switches on all accumulators; and approved pressure relief valves on all applicable equipment, which discharge through common headers to a deluge tank.\n\n\n\nThe facility has two closed-loop refrigeration systems, the high-stage (icemaker) system and the low-stage (freezer) system. The two systems share a common discharge header, relief valve header, glycol supply and return lines, air purger, evaporative condensers, and high-pressure receiver vessel. Liquid ammonia is provided to the equipment directly from the receiver. In addition, the high-stage system operates six tube icemakers powered by three single-stage reciprocating compressor packages. The low side equipment consists of seven air-cooling evaporators to provide refrigeration to the blast freezer, rake room, and ice storage vault, one single-stage reciprocating compressor package, and one single-stage rotary screw compressor. Each system utilizes an accumulator vessel to separate liquid ammonia from ammonia gas to be drawn back to the compressors.\n\n\n\nAn outside supplier delivers anhydrous ammonia to the facility to replenish the ammonia in the system, as required.\n\n\n\nReddy Ice is committed to operating safe and compliant facilities for the protection of its employees, the public, and the environment. The facility has multiple safeguards pertinent to the anhydrous ammonia process. These "

Ammonia detection units are installed throughout the facility to notify employees in the event of an ammonia release.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia, when properly used, has proven to be a safe and reliable refrigerant. The sharp odor of ammonia provides its own warning agent. Practically all accidents involving anhydrous ammonia can be avoided through the facility's program of intensive training; an increased knowledge base of the equipment; and developing, maintaining, and following effective maintenance procedures for all ammonia equipment.\n\n\n\nThe company has developed an Emergency Action Plan (\"EAP\") that includes procedures for notification of emergency authorities/agencies and the public, evacuation of personnel, and first responder duties by trained refrigeration personnel.\n\n\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PREVENTION PROGRAM 3\n\nBased on the Reddy Ice-Landover facility's ammonia inventory, location, and requirement to meet OSHA's PSM standards, it has been determined the facility is subject to the Prevention Program 3 requirements. This accident prevention program is a way to make safe operations and accident prevention systematic throughout the facility. Reddy Ice is committed to operating a safe and compliant facility for the protection of its employees, the public, and the environment. A Combined Process Safety Management/Risk Management (\"PSM/RMP\") Program has been developed to meet the accidental release prevention requirements of both, the EPA's Risk Management Program (40 CFR Part 68) and the OSHA's Process Safety Management (29 CFR 1910.119) regulations. The PSM/RMP Program contains fourteen elements, establishing requirements for employee participation, process safety information, process hazard analysis, pre-startup safety review, operating procedures, training, management of change, mechanical integrity, hot work permits, contractor qualifications, in"

These elements are tied together by a management system to ensure facility-wide development, implementation and integration of all the program requirements.\n\n\n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\nA management system has been developed to oversee the implementation of the PSM/RMP Program elements. The Operations Manager has been identified as PSM/RMP Program Coordinator, with overall responsibility for developing, implementing and integrating the program requirements. Under the PSM/RMP Program, various responsibilities have been assigned to other individuals. The Maintenance Supervisor is responsible for portions of the program closely tied to the refrigeration equipment and operation. \n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nAs required by the RMP regulations, Reddy Ice-Landover has conducted a hazard assessment including offsite consequence analyses (\"OCAs\") for potential accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. The OCAs describe the potential offsite exposure to surrounding areas from an accidental release. A worst-case release scenario and alternative-case release scenarios were developed and calculated using the EPA RMP*Comp modeling program, and the potentially affected offsite population and facilities were identified.  \n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nReddy Ice-Landover has not had any releases that would require reporting as part of a five-year accident history.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY PLANNING AND RESPONSE\n\nReddy Ice-Landover operates under an Emergency Action Plan (\"EAP\") that includes procedures for: notifying plant personnel, the public, and local emergency responders; emergency evacuation/response procedures; use of emergency alarms and equipment; employee training in evacuation and response procedures; first aid for ammonia exposure; and periodic review and updating of the emergency action plan. The plan is reviewed regularly for verification of data, and revised and updated as necessary to reflect changes"
