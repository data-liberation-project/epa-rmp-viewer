This plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \n\n- save lives;\n- minimize and avoid injuries;\n- protect the environment; and\n- minimize property damage.\n\nEmergency response activities are coordinated with the Chester Fire Department and the local fire houses.  In case of a major ammonia emergency, the facility will first call 9-1-1 to alert the local Police and Fire Departments.  Other responders such as the Orange County HAZMAT team will be called as needed.  If a release exceeds the federal reporting quantity of 100 pounds for ammonia, the National Response Center will be called.\n\nFacility personnel receive annual training regarding the emergency procedures and the Emergency Response Team holds regular drills.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nIn 2002, the refrigeration system was thoroughly examined for safety hazards by way of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  In addition, multiple revalidations of the Process Hazard Analysis have been conducted as follows:\n\nPrevious studies have been conducted at the facility as follows [40 CFR 68.67(a)].\n\n\u00bf\tPHA Revalidation  -2002 \n\u00bf\tPHA Revalidation 1 - 2007\n\u00bf\tPHA Revalidation 2 - 2010\n\u00bf\tPHA Revalidation 3 - 2014\n\u00bf\tPHA Revalidation 4 - 2019\n\nThe studies consisted of:\n\n- Hazard and Operability Studies (HAZOP) or What-If Studies\n- series of safety checklists; and\n- facility inspection.\n\nThe mitigation measures (recommendations) include additional training, key maintenance-related tests/inspection, and enhanced emergency response policies and procedures.  The recommendations resultant from the most recent revalidation study are being tracked by the facility."

      "SummaryText": "r.  \n\nThe Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the ammonia system is in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards.  \n\nThe Management of Change program ensures that process modifications are implemented in a safe manner.  \n\nThe Pre-Startup Safety Review program ensures that adequate safety measures are in place before ammonia is introduced into a process.  The Hot Work Permit program ensures that ADUSA - Chester's employees and contractors perform hot work (e.g. welding) in a safe manner.  \n\nThe Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors understand the hazards of ammonia and must take specified precautions to safely complete job requirements.\n\nIt is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia. \n\n For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  There are two ammonia sensors placed in strategic locations in the Compressor Room. In the event of ammonia detection, an alarm is triggered on the control system, and at the facility (audible on high level), and the ammonia refrigeration technicians are notified via an autodial system. \nThe Warehouse addition is equipped with ammonia detectors throughout the cold storage areas.  These detectors are also programmed to autodial.  In addition, ADUSA personnel circulate throughout the plant, taking note of unusual conditions in any portion of the system.  \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no significant releases during the past five years of operation of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds"

These programs include forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, manufacturer's documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe ADUSA DistributionLLC - DC59 Chester facility serves as a refrigerated warehouse and storage facility. The facility is located at 1 Elizabeth Lane in Chester, New York about 0.75 miles west of Highway 6 and 0.5 miles south of Highway 94. The immediate area is primarily undeveloped with some light commercial areas.  The ammonia system was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations and ammonia refrigeration codes and standards.\n\nAmmonia sensors are located in the Engine Room and within each refrigerated space throughout the warehouse.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nIn order to operate the ammonia refrigeration system, the facility complies with the following risk management regulations:\n\n1)  OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM); and\n2)  EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP).\n\nThese regulations impose numerous requirements on the facility to ensure the safety of the public and on-site workers.  \n\nThe following summarizes the key compliance programs that have been implemented by ADUSA- Chester to prevent the accidental release of ammonia from the facility.  \n\nThe Operating Procedures program ensures that the ammonia system is operated in a safe manner.  \n\nThe Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their jobs in a safe manne"
