The changes associated with this RMP update include:\n\n- Updating the RMP pursuant to the requirements of Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 (40 CFR 68), Section ? 68.190(b)(4), due to Stolthaven Houston Inc. commencing the storage and associated marine parcel shipments of Vinyl Acetate Monomer (VAM) above the threshold quantity of 15,000-pounds.  \n- Updating the name and contact information for Stolthaven Houston's General Manager, who is currently responsible for 40 CFR Part 68 RMP implementation.\n- Updating the name of Stolthaven Houston's parent company, which changed on December 1, 2007.\n\n?68.155(a):  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nAt Stolthaven Houston Inc. we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes involved in chemical storage and distribution in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning programs to protect the environment and to help ensure the safety of our employees as well at the citizens of the surrounding communities.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that Stolthaven Houston Inc. has designed and implemented, including:\n\n- A description of our facility and the substances regulated by 40 CFR Part 68 that are handled on-site\n- An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n- A five-year accident history for accidental releases of processes covered by EPA's RMP rule\n- An overview of our emergency response program\n- An overview of improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, the environment, and"

These products are received into the Stolthaven Houston Terminal by various modes of transportation cargo containers that can include tank trucks, ISO tank containers, rail cars, barges, and/or marine parcel tankers (ships), are stored on-site according to customer requirements, and then are subsequently transferred off-site through one of more of the above-referenced transportation modes.  Direct transfer of TDI from marine vessels to rail tank cars is also performed at Stolthaven Houston Inc. with no intermdeiate storage of the product.  Isopentane, n-Pentane, and pentane blends are also transloaded at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal with no intermediate product storge.  \n\nBeginning in April of 2009, Stolthaven Houston Inc. will commence the storage and associated marine transfers of Vinyl Acetate Monomer (VAM), a RMP regulated toxic substance, in quantities greater than 15,000-pounds.  After initial system commissioning via tank truck delivery, VAM will subsequently be received into the Stolthaven Houston Terminal via barges that will discharge at Barge Dock-C into two existing 15,000-barrel capacity internal floating roof (IFR) Storage Tanks:  Tanks A15-9 and A15-10.  The stored VAM will subsequently be shipped outbound according to customer requirements via marine parcel tankers that will load at Stolthaven Houston's existing Ship Dock 2/3.\n\nEmployee training related to the specifics of VAM storage and transfer at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal was conducted in December of 2008 and again in early April of 2009 in preparation of receiving this product into the facility.  As a result of the upcoming VAM storage and transfer a new piping manifold was also constructed in A Tank Farm to allow pr"
