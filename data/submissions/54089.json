These products are received into the Stolthaven Houston Terminal by various modes of transportation cargo containers that can include tank trucks, ISO tank containers, rail cars, barges, and/or marine parcel tankers (ships), are stored on-site according to customer requirements, and then are subsequently transferred off-site through one of more of the above-referenced transportation modes.  Direct transfer of TDI from marine vessels to rail tank cars is also performed at Stolthaven Houston Inc. with no intermdeiate storage of the product.  Isopentane, n-Pentane, and pentane blends are also transloaded at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal with no intermediate product storge.  \n\nBeginning in April of 2009, Stolthaven Houston Inc. will commence the storage and associated marine transfers of Vinyl Acetate Monomer (VAM), a RMP regulated toxic substance, in quantities greater than 15,000-pounds.  After initial system commissioning via tank truck delivery, VAM will subsequently be received into the Stolthaven Houston Terminal via barges that will discharge at Barge Dock-C into two existing 15,000-barrel capacity internal floating roof (IFR) Storage Tanks:  Tanks A15-9 and A15-10.  The stored VAM will subsequently be shipped outbound according to customer requirements via marine parcel tankers that will load at Stolthaven Houston's existing Ship Dock 2/3.\n\nEmployee training related to the specifics of VAM storage and transfer at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal was conducted in December of 2008 and again in early April of 2009 in preparation of receiving this product into the facility.  As a result of the upcoming VAM storage and transfer a new piping manifold was also constructed in A Tank Farm to allow pr"
