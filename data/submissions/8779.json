It is also our policy to work with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies, and promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork to provide an effective contingency plan in the unlikely event that a process incident occurs at the facility.\n\nRegulated Substances\n\nThe primary activity at the Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) is municipal wastewater treatment.  Chlorine is the only 40 CFR 68 regulated substance at the facility. Chlorine is used primarily as a disinfectant.  The maximum amount of chlorine at the facility is 18 tons.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario (WCS)\n\nThe Worst-Case release scenario according to EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance document is \"the greatest amount held in a single vessel.\"  The worst-case scenario is the complete release of chlorine from a one-ton container.  The worst-case scenario may not consider the use of active mitigation such as emergency scrubbers.\n\nThe chlorine toxic endpoint defined by 40 CFR Part 68 is 0.0087 mg/l which is equivalent to 3 parts million by volume (ppm).  According to the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) Emergency Response Planning Guideline (ERPG)-2, this toxic endpoint is specified as \"the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\"\n\nThe SLAB computer model was used to simulate the worst-case scenario.  The maximum distance to toxic endpoint is 2.08 miles.  This distance considered the mitigation provided by the building but did not include the use of active mitigation m"

In addition, a comprehensive risk management program has been developed to prevent accidental releases.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nThe alternative release scenario modeled is the worst-case scenario with the emergency scrubber in operation It is assumed that a one-ton container reputes and releases all of its contents within the Process/Chemical building.  When the release is detected, the emergency scrubber is activated. There is no off-site impact for the alternative release scenario.  This alternative release scenario is not likely to occur; however, it demonstates that off-site impacts do not occur even for the worst-case scenario when the active mitigation system is used.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nCity of Naples is in compliance with 40 CFR 68.  The City has conducted a comprehensive review of the chlorine system as well as administrative, technical, operating and maintenance procedures, in addition to the other required program elements of the regulations.\n\nThe City has both passive mitigation, an enclosed building, and active mitigation, an emergency scrubber, to minimize the consequences of an accidental release.  The Risk Management Program addresses actions to minimize the likelihood of an accidental release and to minimize the impact if one occurs.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe WWTP has not had a significant release of a hazardous substance as defined by 40 CFR 68.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThis facility has an emergency response program that is coordinated with the Collier County Comprehensive Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that has been prepared in accordance with all local, state and federal regulations.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe hazard review resulted in the development of a list of improvements and an implementation schedule.

Some of the more significant improvements are listed below:\n\nTo Be Completed by August 1999\n\nDue to the chemical nature of chlorine, any work performed in the chlorine area that involves heat or sparks should be closely monitored.   Hot work permitting should be implemented.\n\nRequest Standard Operating Procedures and certification that chlorine meets AWWA specifications from the chlorine supplier.  Engineering personnel should review this, as well as the safety requirements in the procurement documents.\n\nPrepare and implement inspection procedures for the lifting beam that is utilized during chlorine container off-loading.\n\nPurchase the proper Chlorine Institute approved wrenches to connect/disconnect chlorine containers.  Implement a replacement plan for damaged wrenches and provide operator training regarding proper wrench use.\n\nThe flexible tubing from the chlorine container to the header can potentially become twisted or kinked, resulting in a leak.  Any kinked lines should immediately be replaced.  A preventive maintenance program should be implemented to include annual replacement, or per manufacturer's recommendation.\n\nScales used to weigh chlorine containers should be calibrated annually, or per manufacturer's recommendation.\n\nThe vent line from the pressure relief valve should be inspected, tested, and/or replaced annually.  Replacement should occur annually or per the manufacturer's recommendation. \n\nExpand on the emergency response plan in this area.  Efforts should be coordinated with Haz Mat.\n\nDefine notification and evacuation requirements for plant personnel.  Additional  emergency planning and training are scheduled to occur in January 2000. \n\nProvide for a cleaning and maintenance program for the emergency dampers per the manufacturer's specifications.

An evaluation of the piping should be made and a replacement schedule implemented accordingly. \n\nIn case the rate controller valve fails, manual control of flow through the rotameter is implemented.  A spare rotameter should be kept on site at all times.\n\nA spare screen for the Y strainer should be kept on site for replacement when necessary.\n\nSpare valves for the solution line should be kept on site.  The critical valves should be identified and exercised on a regular basis.\n\nHigh quality pressure gauges should be purchased for the water and solution lines.\n\nThere is a danger that visitors or other untrained individuals may enter the chlorine areas, which is a potential risk.  Proper signage at the entrance point and the chlorine area should be posted indicating a  \"Restricted Area\".  The chlorine facility should be locked at all times, beginning in August 1999. \n\n To Be Completed by November 1999\nA preventive maintenance (PM) and replacement program for the chlorine system should be prepared and implemented.

This will help prevent the truck from potentially rolling into the building.  Also provide markings for proper wheel alignment. \n\nThere is a potential danger that the door to the building could shut while off-loading chlorine containers.  This could lead to dropping a container, causing possible injury to the employee, or otherwise compromising the integrity of the container.  A door securing system should be installed.  Prior to its installation, the operator should be required to secure the door while off-loading.\n\nThe vendor should be required to verify during procurement that their containers meet all applicable codes and hydrostatic testing requirements.\n\nThe current configuration of flexible tubing from the chlorine container to the header should be modified to eliminate potential kinks or dislodging.  A safety guard around the tubing at the header should be installed.\n        \nThe pressure relief valve will currently release chlorine gas to the atmosphere.
