We specialize in fertilizer and pesticides.  We carry dry fertilizer and NH3.  We do have at our facilities bulk NH3 and nurse tanks.  We realize the importance of handling these products for our customers.  NH3 is the best source of nitrogen at the most economical price.  \n\nAny accidental or unintentional release of ammonia to the atmosphere is an emergency.  The seriousness depends on the amount of the release and whether it is containable or not.  We have intact an emergency procedure in case of an accidental release. Our local emergency response facilitators are familiar with our plan.  Most ammonia emergencies can be avoided. They are primarily caused by carelessness, error or just plain negligence in maintaining or using equipment.  We have a plan intact that we routine twice a year thoroughly inspect our nurse tanks,  storage equipment, pumps and applicators.  We feel by doing this we can avoid a tragedy from occuring.  All employees have been trained to handle an emergency situation if need be. \nWe have never experienced an accidental release that has not been containable or over 100# of NH3.  The worst case scenerio is if one of the tanks would accidentally rupture and be released into the atmosphere.  This is a very unlikely scenerio.  A more likely occurrence would be a accidentally release due to criminal intent.  Our facility works with the local fire department, local emergency planning committee and sheriff's department to minimize the danger should this happen.  Safety for ourselves, our employees, the farmer and the community is always been a priority.\n\nWe have participated in the Emergency Response Program, Community Right-to-Know, and LEPC.  Safety inspections and improvements are on-going at our facility.  Due to our past history and experience with handling NH3 and pesticides, I feel "
