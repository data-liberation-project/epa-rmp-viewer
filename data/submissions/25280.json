The anhydrous ammonia that is stored at this facility is distributed to agricultural crop producers in the surrounding area who utilize the anhydrous ammonia for crop nutrient purposes.\n\nThe system consists of one (1) 18,000 gallon storage tank with associated piping, valves, liquid pump and other miscellaneous equipment. In accordance with design standards, the maximum filling capacity is 85% which equates to 15,300 gallons. This tank is located at A&K Feed & Grain Company's Site 3 located at 14530 50th Street, Lime Springs, IA.\n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO: The worst-case scenario is the failure of the 18,000 gallon storage tank, when filled to the maximum capacity of 15,300 gallon, which is 85%, resulting in the release of the total volume in a gaseous (hazardous ammonia vapor cloud) form. The resulting release, according to EPA's RMP*Comp Program has a distance to endpoint of 5.1 miles. There are private homes, a school and recreation facilities within the distance to endpoint with a total population of 400.\n\nALTERNATIVE CASE SCENARIO: The alternative case scenario is the failure of equipment, such as a broken hose, resulting in the release of a hazardous ammonia vapor cloud. The resulting release, according to EPA's RMP*Comp Program has a distance to endpoint of .6 miles. There are private homes and recreation facilities within the distance to endpoint with a total population of 50.\n\nGENRAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM & CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS: This facility complies w"
