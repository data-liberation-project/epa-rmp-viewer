Describe Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\n\nGulf Coast Cold Storage is a cold storage facility and logistics service organization located in Pascagoula, MS. The facilities primary business is the short and long term storage of food products and stevedoring operations.\n\nThe refrigeration process used to maintain freezer temperatures utilizes anhydrous ammonia (R717) as the refrigerant. Anhydrous ammonia is widely used as refrigerant in many industrial facilities, including, meat, poultry, and fish processing facilities; and cold storage warehouses. The refrigerant serving as the heat transfer fluid is circulated thru a closed loop system.\n\nGulf Coast Cold Storage is committed to operating cold storage facilities under conditions that are safe to employees, contractors, tenants, and the surrounding community. The senior management is committed to this cause. As a result, the Safety Policy will be considered on an equal basis with productivity, efficiency, quality improvement, environmental issues and other policies developed by the Group. \n\nThe core of the facilities overall approach to safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system focuses a hazard assessment program, employee and contractor training, an ongoing preventative maintenance program, and an emergency response program. We use a variety of safety equipment and strict procedures to prevent releases and to reduce the impact of releases should they ever occur. Some examples include:\n\n* Regular and Routine Process Hazard Analysis.\n* Regular checklist audits of safety programs and records.\n* Emergency release training with employees and the local fire department.\n* Plant security: locks, lights, alarms, and warning signs.\n* Investigation of all incidents to improve our procedures.\n* Annual review and certification of standard operating procedures.\n\nThe EPA requires all companies to report the release of hazardous materials. Gulf Coast Cold Storage has had no releases"

While some accidents may occur, we take great pride in our safety record and make every effort to ensure that they will be small and as infrequent as possible.\n\nFuture plans for the on-going Risk Management program include routine preventative maintenance of mechanical refrigeration systems. We also intend to continuously focus on employee development and training specific to safe operation of plant equipment, emergency response and employee evacuation.\n\nB.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThis facility operates two ammonia refrigeration systems to provide cooling and freezing capabilities.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in the South system is in excess of 10,000 pounds.  The North system contains 5,000 lbs. which is less than the threshold quantity for PSM or RMP.\n\nThe ammonia inventory of the South system is approximately 16,000 lbs.  Since ammonia releases from this system could pose a risk of offsite public impact and is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPAs RMP program. \n\nThe closed loop ammonia refrigeration system at the facility provides (2) major suction pressures (temperatures) for use in the preservation of perishable food products. Through the use of multiple stages (2) of compression the refrigeration system provides room temperatures of 35F. with the use of low suction booster compressors and provides temperatures of -20F. And -35F. \n\nThe higher pressure portions of the system include the condenser, located on the roof, along with refrigerant vent lines where any leaks can dissipate to the air, joining ammonia produced by lightning where it can be consumed as it goes through a natural biodegrading process.  Normal safeties include: high pressure cut-outs, relief valves, and ventilating systems for machinery room areas.\n\n\n\nC.  Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe p"
