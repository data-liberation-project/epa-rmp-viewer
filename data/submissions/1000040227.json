Five Year Accident History: There have been no reportable incidents during the past five years. However, the facility maintains records of all incident investigation reports regardless of anhydrous ammonia quantity released into the atmosphere.\n\n\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety: Based on the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for anhydrous ammonia, lists of action items were developed. The status of these action items will be monitored to ensure that implementation of the safety improvements is accomplished. Monthly Safety training is conducted for all team members at this facility, in addition PSM meetings are held to review safety and PSM program elements. Refer to Process Safety Management Program for specific information."
