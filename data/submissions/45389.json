Operations Management International, Inc. (OMI), a private contractor, operates the plant. A wastewater treatment plant operated by a private contractor is subject to Prevention Program 3, which encompasses the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) PSM standards. The contents of this RMP and PSM document the Donna Wastewater Treatment Plant?s compliance with the Clean Air Act Section 112 (r)(7), 40 CFR 68, and 29 CFR 1910.119 for the protection of employees, the public and the environment.\n\nThe City of Donna Wastewater Treatment Plant accidental release prevention policy integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices. The Donna emergency response policy involves the preparation of a response plan tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community. The policy adheres to EPA Prevention Program procedures where applicable, OSHA PSM standards, and complies with EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nThe City of Donna Wastewater Treatment Plant is located at 1 ? Mile South Old River Road, Donna, Hidalgo County, Texas, at north 26.149167 Latitude and west -98.053889 Longitude. It serves approximately 14,800 people.\n\nThe chemical storage building is located on the southwest side of the plant.  The building is three sided and houses two one-ton cylinders of chlorine.  One cylinder is connected to the system and the other is for backup. The cylinders are equipped with manual shutoff valves in the event of an emergency, and an alarm activates at the occurrence of a release. Personnel oversee the facility eight hours a day, including daily inspections of the chemical storage building.\n\nSelf-Contained-Breathing-Apparatus (SCBA) are available approximately 25 feet from the chem"

The facility houses emergency air. \n\nThe City of Donna Wastewater Plant handles chlorine in amounts exceeding the regulatory threshold set by the EPA and by OSHA for regulated substances and the facility is managed by OMI, Inc., a private contractor, so the chlorination process is therefore subject to OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements (29 CFR 1910.119). The EPA threshold quantity is 2,500 pounds; the OSHA threshold quantity is 1,500 pounds.  The facility is subject to Prevention Program 3 of the Clean Air Act.\nThe offsite consequence analysis for the Wastewater Treatment Plant includes consideration of two release scenarios for chlorine.  \n1. A Worst-Case Release\n2. An Alternative Scenario\n\nThe following key elements outline the accidental release prevention program for the Donna Water Filtration Plant:\n\n$    High level of training of the operators;\n$    Preventive maintenance program;\n$    Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment;\n$    Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation   of the operators;\n$    Performance of a Process Hazard Analysis of equipment and procedures;\n$    Implementation of an audit and inspection program.\n\nAs part of its Prevention Program 3, the Donna Wastewater Plant maintains an employee participation plan, Pre-startup Procedures, Hot Work Permit Procedures, Management of Change, and a procedure for contractors working at the facility, as well as an emergency plan and documents relating to operating procedures and employee training. \n\nPrevention steps include operator use of the available SCBA during connection/disconnection of the chemical supply, awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine, and the presence of a chemical detector. Donna Water Treatment Plant management has an agreement with Chemical Response & Remediation Contractors, Inc. (CRRC) for assistance with emergency response.\n\nNo accidental releases of chlorine have occurred at the site in th"
