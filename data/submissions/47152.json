In the spirit of this policy Day Street Pumping Station and the MWWSSB operate the water treatment processes safely, reducing to the greatest extent practicable any hazards associated with the treatment processes and reducing any subsequent risk to the surrounding community, personnel, and the environment. The policy includes working with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies including the City of Montgomery Fire Department to implement the emergency response program, in the unlikely event of a process incident occurring at the Day Street Pumping Station. \nThe Day Street Pumping Station is subject to the Program Level 2 of the RMP regulations. The Day Street Pumping Station's accidental release prevention and emergency response policies comply with the RMP rule requirements. Specific handling, operation and maintenance, and emergency response procedures have been developed for the storage of chlorine and for the chlorination process.  The Day Street Pumping Station\u00bfs personnel that work with chlorine storage and the chlorination process are thoroughly trained in the aspects of safe handling, operation, maintenance, and emergency response actions as required by the Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation. \nTo minimize the effect of an accidental release of chlorine on the surrounding community Day Street Pumping Station has a chlorine scrubber that can neutralize the chlorine with an effectiveness of 99.5 percent. The Day Street Pumping Station has established and maintained procedures for emergency notification and response and has coordinated the emergency response steps with the City of Montgomery Fire Department.

The Day Street Pumping Station disinfects drinking water prior to storage and distribution.  Chlorine is used primarily as a disinfectant.  \nThe Day Street Pumping Station stores chlorine, liquefied under pressure, in an enclosed building.  The maximum chlorine storage capacity exceeds the RMP applicability threshold. Chlorine gas is withdrawn, mixed with water and distributed to application points. As required by the RMP regulation, the Day Street Pumping Station has evaluated the following offsite consequence analysis and reported it in this Risk Management Plan to EPA using RMP*Submit 2004.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario (WRS)\nAs required by the RMP Rule, the WRS used for the Day Street Pumping Station is the release of entire contents of a single largest container over a period of 10 minutes. The chlorine cylinder storage area is in an enclosed building, which results in a 45 percent passive mitigation of any chlorine release. The distance to the toxic endpoint of 3 ppm is estimated using the EPA-approved model RMP Comp\u00ae. \n\nAlternative Release Scenario (ARS)\nThe ARS is one that is more likely to occur than a WRS. Based on the process hazard analysis performed for the chlorine system, it was determined that the most likely scenario would be a chlorine gas leak from the gas side of the chlorine container or from the gas feed lines leading to the chlorinator. According to the Risk Management Program regulations, mitigation from both active (chlorine scrubber) and passive (building enclosure) controls are factored in to determine the ARS chlorine release rate using the EPA-approved model RMP Comp\u00ae. \n\nFive-year Accident History\nThe Day Street Pumping Station has had no accidents related to chlorine storage and chlori"

The facility has conducted a comprehensive review of all systems such as administrative, technical, and O&M procedures, in addition to the other required program elements of the RMP rule.  A hazard review was conducted at this facility using a what-if scenario and a checklist during March 2006.\nThe safety measures include a chlorine scrubber, a vacuum feeding system that automatically stops chlorine withdrawal in the event of a leak downstream from the vacuum system, and process area chlorine leak detectors connected to audio alarms. For added safety and protection, access to the Day Street Pumping Station is through a gate that is locked at all times except during entry and exit.  \nIn addition, the Day Street Pumping Station has implemented a prevention program that meets the requirements of the RMP rule. Preventive maintenance is performed on the chlorination process, including the appurtenances such as hoist and cables used to move the chlorine containers. The chlorination equipment is designed according to industry standards, is regularly inspected, and maintained in good working order by qualified maintenance personnel. The maintenance personnel are well trained in the handling and use of chlorine. The plant operators are also trained in the actions to be taken during an emergency and receive safety training every 18 months, more frequently than once every 3 years as required by the RMP regulation. The prevention program consists of the following elements:\n1) Safety information, which includes information pertaining to the hazards of chlorine, chlorination process, and the chlorination equipment. The safety information was reviewed in March 2006. \n2) Hazard Review, which includes a systematic evaluation (by an employee team) of the hazards of the chlorine"

Most recently refresher training was provided to employees in March 2005.\n5) Maintenance procedures to maintain the on-going integrity of the chlorine process equipment.
