      "SummaryText": "Algona'  has a release prevention and emergency response policy at our facility.  This facility complies with requirements for anhydrous ammonia storage and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If any emergency were to occur, signs are posted that refer to Gerald Zwiefel who is employed by West Bend Elevator.  Gerald will then decide what steps need to be taken in the event of an emergency.  Our worst case scenario is failure of one of our anhydrous ammonia storage tanks when filled to the greatest amount allowed.  This would result in a vapor cloud explosion.  According to EPA look-up tables, the distance to the endpoint is 4.4 miles.  There are an estimated 7,000 people within this radius.  Schools, residences, hospitals, prison/correction facilities, recreation areas, and major commercial, office or industrial areas.  This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The anhydrous ammonia plant is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with regulations and state law.  We have never had an accident involving NH3 that caused death, injuries, property or envirnmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in the past 5 years.  In the event of an emergency involving our NH3 system, it is our policy to notify the Algona Fire Dept and request they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the Kossuth County Disaster Coordinator, Algona Fire Dept Chief and members.  The Algona fire department has inspected our NH3 facility.  We have no plans at this time to improve or change our plans.  We review the plans annually or sooner if necessary."
