This Complex processes broilers and other value-add fresh and frozen poultry products and employs approximately 2,400 associates in two plants. The facility normally operates 24 hours a day, five days per week.\n\n\n\nThe regulated substance at the Perry facility covered by 40 CFR Part 68 is anhydrous ammonia (R-717). The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as an integral part of its refrigeration system. The refrigeration system consists of several storage vessels, compressors, condensers, piping, and air handling units located throughout the facility, in order to maintain proper food safety temperatures. The total quantity of anhydrous ammonia on-site is approximately 224,000 pounds distributed throughout the refrigeration components.\n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\n\n\nAs a concerned member of the community, the company takes its role as a responsible corporate citizen very seriously. All Perdue facilities are operated to protect employees, contractors, and the public from injury and illness, and to minimize environmental impact. A company-wide safety and wellness program stresses safe conditions and safe practices. Perdue's policy is to inspect, maintain, and operate equipment and facilities to prevent accidents, including release of hazardous materials; and to train employees in prevention, as well as prepare them to respond rapidly and effectively should an accident occur.\n\n\n\nPerdue Farms has developed and implemented Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures (SPCC) and Process Safety Management (PSM) plans as part of an overall chemical management program. The program involves a wide-range of senior management personnel, including the Corporate Environmental and Safety & Security divisions. Additionally, Perdue conducts regular safety meetin"

The maintenance personnel at the facility utilize a preventative maintenance program for all the system components. As part of the program, trained refrigeration personnel routinely inspect the refrigeration system operating parameters and conduct routine maintenance as needed.\n\n\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\n\n\nThere are no incidents meeting reporting criteria for the Five-Year Accident History. All releases are documented and investigated, even if they do not meet the reporting criteria of 40 CFR 68.42(a).\n\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the ammonia refrigeration system, Perdue's Perry facility has a well-defined incident command system. The written Emergency Response program includes procedures to safely evacuate the facility, minimize and/or contain the release, and notify the appropriate local fire department and LEPC officials. Perdue continues to train our associates on hazardous responses and awareness, and conduct mock drills at least annually. The Emergency Response Plan was designed to confirm with 29 CFR 1910.119. Perdue's officials have discussed the company's response program with our local fire department representatives. \n\n\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\n\n\nAs part of Perdue Farms' continual improvement philosophy, the Perdue Perry facility continues to identify and update system components and techniques to ensure safety and quality. Currently, there are no specific planned changes.\n\n"
