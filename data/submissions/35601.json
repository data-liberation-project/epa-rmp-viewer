The Pacific Diazo Products PSM/RMP program assigns and documents the specific responsibilities for developing, implementing and integrating the OSHA PSM and the EPA RMP standards into its safety program. This PSM/RMP program focuses attention on Pacific Diazo Products believes that Employee Participation is the key to a successful PSM/RMP program. Operating level employees, particularly the Distribution Supervisor and the Storage System Operator have been deeply involved, in the development of the Program and they assume the major responsibility for operating the Pacific Diazo Products Storage facility safely.\nThe Pacific Diazo Products Emergency Response Program has been developed in cooperation, and with the support of the San Bernadino Co. Fire Department Hazardous Material Division. All Pacific Diazo Products employees will receive documented emergency response training.\n\nII.
