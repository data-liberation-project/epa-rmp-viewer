Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Piggly Wiggly Alabama Distributing are committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained refrigeration contract personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with Bessemer Fire Department, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities revolve around the storage and distribution of products for our many retail outlets.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance present at our facility.  All of the ammonia inventory is attributed to its use as a refrigerant.\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), \n\nTo evaluate the worst case and alternative release scenarios for ammonia we have used the methodology given in the Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration by SAIC.  A description of the scenarios is located within the Risk Management Program located on site.\n\n 4.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  In addition, our facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the rele"

The analyses are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered process, Piggly Wiggly Alabama Distributing maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the process.\n\nTraining\nPiggly Wiggly Alabama Distributing has a training program in place to train employees who are operating the process or are associated with the process.  Refresher training is provided at least every three (3) years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nPiggly Wiggly Alabama Distributing carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and compressors.  Maintenance procedures are carried out by qualified personnel with a background in maintenance practices.  Training is provided to the personnel as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified during maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritt"

Process operators, maintenance personnel and all other employees whose job tasks are affected by a change in a process are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the changes.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in the established process are conducted as a regular practice at Piggly Wiggly Alabama Distributing.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nPiggly Wiggly Alabama Distributing conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP Rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nPiggly Wiggly Alabama Distributing promptly investigates any incident that could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nPiggly Wiggly Alabama Distributing truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information collected as part of the facility's compliance with the RMP Rule including information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construct"

Contractors are also informed of all applicable procedures for emergency response to an accidental release of a regulated substance.\n\n\n5.  Five-year Accident History\nPiggly Wiggly Alabama Distributing has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  This facility is expected to continue this exemplary record.  \n\n6.  Emergency Response Plan\nPiggly Wiggly Alabama Distributing has a written emergency action plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes employee evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as a post-incident investigation.\n\nThe Jefferson County LEPC is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.  We have also coordinated our requirements with the Bessemer Fire Department.\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  Continued training, and program reviews are some of the major steps we want to take to improve safety at our facility.  These changes are expected to be implemented in a timely manor."
