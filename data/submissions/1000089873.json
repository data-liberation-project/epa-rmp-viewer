In our manufacturing facilities we take special\n\nmeasures to ensure the safety of all involved.\n\n\n\nThe policy on chemical safety at the Palestine Plant is to prevent the release of chemicals through\n\nhigh standards of design and operation, and to provide measures to mitigate releases should they\n\noccur.  Baze Chemical is committed to operating and maintaining the facility in a safe and\n\nresponsible manner and has the goal of no accidents or injuries.\n\n\n\nFACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Palestine Plant is an ethoxylation facility that produces a range of specialty surfactants for use\n\npredominantly in the oil and gas industry. The process of ethoxylation involves reacting ethylene\n\noxide with various common chemicals, such as fatty alcohols and phenols, to produce a variety of\n\nproducts.\n\n\n\nThe plant can also use propylene oxide instead of (or as well as) ethylene oxide in a similar process\n\nknown as \"propoxylation\". \n\n\n\nRegulated materials at the facility are ethylene oxide (up to 375,500 lb, or 49,000 gallons) and\n\npropylene oxide (up to 45,650 lb, or 6,600 gallons). The other raw materials used in the process as\n\nwell as the products are not regulated. Both ethylene oxide (EO) and propylene oxide (PO) are\n\nstored in pressurized horizontal storage vessels equipped with external cooling facilities.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe facility complies with the OSHA PSM rules as defined in 29 CFR 1910.119 and Program 3\n\nrequirements under EPA CAPP rules as defined in 40 CFR 68.\n\n\n\nSpecific design features and operating practices at the facility relevant to the control of ethylene\n\noxide and propylene oxide are:\n\n\n\n- Purging with nitrogen after each transfer operation to prevent stagnant EO or PO liquid being\n\n  present in piping.\n\n- Facilities and procedure to regularly circulate the contents of the EO storage tanks, in accordance\n\n  with r"

The program addresses all the\n\nrequirement of OSHA regulations for emergency action plans (per 29 CFR 1910.38).\n\n\n\nCoordination with local emergency responders is ongoing. Baze Chemical has met hosted meetings at the plant with Alan Fox, Fire Chief of the county Volunteer Fire Department on April 14, 2020.  He visited the facility with crewmembers and was given a copy of the facility PSM Program, Emergency Response Plan, and facility Safety Manual. On July 29, 2020 Baze Chemical also met with Shannon Davis, Fire Chief for the city of Palestine and Melinda Chambers, Emergency Coordinator for the City of Palestine.  They both received a copy of the Palestine facility PSM Plan, Emergency Response Plan and facility Safety Manual.  Information on RMP worst credible scenario and alternative scenarios has been provided.  The Palestine emergency services will act as \"first responders\" in the event of an emergency at the site. Discussions with response agencies and familiarization of first responders with the facility are ongoing.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nWhile there are no specific planned changes, any such opportunity will be properly evaluated and\n\nmanaged through the site's management of change procedure (PAL-PSM-010) prior to implementation.\n\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nAn offsite consequence analysis has been prepared in accordance with the rules specified in 40\n\nCFR 68, which require that ethylene oxide be treated as a gas liquefied by pressure. As such, the\n\nrules require that the worst-case release be the entire inventory of the largest container released\n\nover a 10 minute period. As detailed elsewhere in this RMP submission, the "

This analysis is not credible, as it is thermodynamically impossible for the entire inventory of the largest tank of ethylene oxide to vaporize over 10 minutes. Features in place that would further limit this scenario include:\n\n- ethylene oxide tanks are kept cool such that liquid temperature range is between 50 deg.F (the\n\n   boiling point of EO at atmospheric pressure) and 70 deg.F\n\n- the tanks are contained within a dike that is adequate to contain the entire inventory of the largest\n\n  tank\n\n- tanks do not have any nozzles or connections below the liquid level\n\n\n\nA release into the diked area will result in a liquid pool at 50 deg.F, which would vaporize over time.\n\nThis release would be similar to the propylene oxide worst-case scenario, with a distance to the end\n\npoint significantly lower than the 12 miles determined in accordance with the RMP rules.\n\n\n\nAdditional offsite consequence analyses addressed in this RMP are:\n\n- Alternative release of EO, based on a release during transfer of EO from rail tanker. Release was\n\n   assumed to be stopped after 1 minute by activation of emergency shutdown devices. Distance to\n\n   end point for this scenario was calculated at 1.1 miles.\n\n- Worst case release of PO (treated as a toxic liquid per RMP rules). The entire contents of the PO\n\n   storage tank is assumed to be released into the dike and vaporize over time. Distance to end point\n\n   for this scenario was calculated at 1.8 miles.\n\n\n\n- Alternative release of PO, based on a release during transfer of PO from tank truck. Release was\n\n   assumed to be stopped after 1 minute by activation of emergency shutdown devices. Distance to\n\n   end point for this scenario was calculated at 0.2 miles.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
