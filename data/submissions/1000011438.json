Two people are required present anytime chlorine is chedked or changed, and must have an excape pack with them. The operators check this facility a minimum of twice a shift and more as change to treatment is made. Chlorine alarm leak detectors are also installed in building. Exhaust fans with outside switches are also in use. A minimum of two SCBA's are stored with the chlorine (B) repair kits in a designated location available at all times.

The facility's only activity is to treat surface water to drinking water standards for customers in the Texarkana area.\n\n\n\nLiguid chlorine is the only chemical used in sufficient quantity at the facility to be regulated under the RMP program. Up to sixteen (16) one ton cylinders are stored on site at any one time with no more than four cylinders, piped independently, used in the process.\n\n\n\nTexarkana Water Utilities is dedicated to the safe and proper handling of chemicals necessary for the production of drinking water and treatment  of wastewater for its citizens. Utility management has consistently budgeted and the elected bodies of the two Texarkana's have consistently approved funds to support personnel and citizen safety preventative maintenance training, chemical awareness and handling, emergency response and equipment related to chemicals used at the facility.\n\n\n\nSeveral training and procedural methods make a worst case release unlilkely. The site is staffed twenty-four (24) hours a day with periodic inspections of the chlorination facilities made on each of the three daily shifts. Hightly trained personnel and an extensive preventative maintenance program keep all chlorination equipment in like new condition. The chlorination room is monitored by a remote chlorine gas detector and alarm set a 1 ppm. Safety procedures, including those associated with chlorine are standardized through written Standard Operating Procedures (SOP's).
