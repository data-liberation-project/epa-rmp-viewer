      "SummaryText": "Edgewell (formerly Energizer) uses isobutane in aerosol filling in quantities exceeding the RMP threshold.\u00a0 Recently, a second processing line using isobutane has been added, but the quantity on site and worst case and alternate scenarios have not changed.\u00a0 \r\n\u00a0\r\nEdgewell has developed and implemented a robust RMP program.\u00a0 Release prevention begins with appropriate design, layout, and installation of equipment in accordance with recognized engineering standards at the time of construction and during any renovations.  Procedures are in place to govern the delivery of isobutane to the tank, and Edgewell personnel must be present during delivery.\r\n\r\nThe isobutane tank and piping comply with applicable engineering standards, best practices, and Florida codes.\u00a0 This includes the use of explosion-proof isobutane pumps, a nearby fire hydrant with a 250 gpm capacity, protective bollards and barbed wire, sufficient signage, an emergency stop/alarm at the pump bulkhead, and adequate level, temperature, pressure and lower explosive limit (LEL) indicators/alarms.\u00a0  \r\n\r\nOperating procedures, mechanical integrity inspections, and ongoing training, all updated when necessary, ensure ongoing safe operation of the process.\u00a0 Management of change procedures are in place to address planned changes.\u00a0 Any incidents will be thoroughly investigated and regular audits are performed to verify that implemented procedures are effective.\u00a0 \r\n\u00a0\r\nA written emergency response plan has been developed for the facility and coordinated with the local emergency planning commission (LEPC) and fire department.  If LEL sensors are tripped outside near the tank, the process automatically shuts down, sounds the alarm, the plant is evacuated and local emergency responders are contacted.    \r\n\r\nThere have been no incidents/accidents involving isobutane in the past five years.\u00a0 There are no planned safety improvements at this time."
