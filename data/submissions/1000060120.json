The Albany WTP produces potable water for the City of Albany, as well as for Fort Griffin Special Utility District.  This Facility is an ultra-filtration WTP.  Chlorine gas is used in the disinfection process at the WTP.  Up to 10,750 pounds of chlorine may be stored at the Albany WTP.  Because the stored quantity of chlorine onsite exceeds the threshold quantity for chlorine (?68.130; Table 1), the City developed this Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The Albany WTP is subject to Program 2 RMP requirements (?68.12(c); ?68.155(b)).  A Management System overseen by the City's Treatment Superintendent is implemented to ensure that the RMP and associated Prevention Program are implemented correctly and maintained up-to-date.  The City's accidental release prevention and emergency response policies include a commitment to safety and to implementation of safe procedures to ensure accidental releases of chlorine gas are prevented.\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention program (Prevention Program) includes required elements of 40 CFR Part 68 such as safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigation.  Detailed documentation of each element of the Prevention Program is contained within the text of the RMP.  Operator training is key to the effectiveness of the Prevention Program.  The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) licensing program for water operators is used as a training tool, along with site-specific RMP training.  TCEQ licensing testing and on-site observation and demonstration are used to evaluate comprehension of all training materials.  Written operating procedures are used in conjunction with on-the-job training to ensure that certified water operators are proficient in performing their duties before being a"

Certified water operators conduct daily inspections and any problems with the chlorine systems are corrected and documented.  In addition, the certified water operators ensure that the equipment used in the disinfection process is maintained according to the manufacturers' recommendations (?68.56(a)).  Because of these efforts, the Albany WTP has not had a chlorine release that resulted in an injury, either on-site or off-site, within the previous five (5) years (?68.42(a); ?68.155(d)).  As part of the Program, the City will periodically perform compliance audits, hazard reviews and incident investigations, according to a predetermined schedule described in the RMP and as needs dictate.  These compliance audits and hazard reviews document any planned changes to improve safety (?68.50 & ?68.58; ?68.155(f)).  Currently, there are no planned changes to improve safety at the Facility (?68.155(f)).\n\n\n\nThe Albany WTP complies with the emergency response regulations per Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR ?1910.38, as well as with applicable fire codes and the standards set forth by the Chlorine Institute.  The Albany WTP is a non-responding Facility for emergency response.  The Albany WTP operators are trained to notify the City's Fire Department via call to 9-1-1 in the event of a release from the Albany WTP.  The City of Albany's Fire Department will serve as the first responder and coordinate the emergency response according to the county-wide Emergency Response Plan, including the evacuation of surrounding residents when required (?68.90(b); ?68.155(a) & (e)).\n\n\n\n"
