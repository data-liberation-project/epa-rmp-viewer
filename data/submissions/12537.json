ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES \nFarmers Cooperative Grain & Supply Co. complies with ANSI-61-1 requirements for anhydrous ammonia storage and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws. We are committed to the prevention of any accidental relase of anhydrous ammonia. If an emergency were to accur, it is our policy to notify our local fire department and request that they respond to the emergency. \n\n2.,  DESCRIPTION OF OUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED. \nThe primary purpose for this facility is storage of fertilizers for sale to the agricultural sector. Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for sale to our producers. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors. \nThe maximum amount of Anhydrous Ammonia stored at this facility is 118,450 pounds. \n\n3.  WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\nWe used RMP Comp to determine the worse case scenario release at our facility. Failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would have off site consequences. The alternative release scenario is based on the most likely incident to accur which is a break in a transfer hose, although the excess flow check valve would limit the amount of loss of ammonia. \n\n4.  GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS.\nThe facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and all applicable state codes and regulations. The facility has implemented the provisiosn of \"safety Reqluirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61-1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of anhydrous ammonia\".\n\n5.  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nWe never had an accident involving anhydrous  ammonia that caused death, injurie"

THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\na) In the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous ammonia system, it is our policy to notify the Stratton Fire Department and require that they respond to the emergency. We have disscussed this policy with the fire department, and members of the fire department have inspected our system. \nb) The facility has a written emergency plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38.\nc) The facility has provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY. \nSafety improvement is an on -going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no addtiional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
