The original RMP, submitted on 6/16/99, included information on flammable synthesis gas containing hydrogen present at the facility in quantities less than the 10,000 pound threshold.  Beaumont Methanol chose to submit an initial RMP even though there was not a threshold quantity of RMP listed flammable gases at the facility in order to inform its employees and community neighbors of potential risks posed by its operations.  The methanol plant was modified in 1999 to allow co-production of anhydrous ammonia.  As a result of the modification anhydrous ammonia was present at the facility in an amount above the threshold quantity in January 2000.  The RMP was revised on December 16, 1999 to include anhydrous ammonia.  Beaumont Methanol completed construction of a 20,000 ton ammonia storage tank which was placed into service during the month of May 2000.\n\nIt is Terra's policy to prevent accidental releases from the Beaumont Methanol facility by effective Process Safety Management programs and procedures.  This includes the following:\n\n*Participation by all plant employees in every element of PSM.\n\n*Conduct regular scheduled process hazards analysis.\n\n*Utilize current and accurate process safety information.\n\n*Maintain current and accurate written operating procedures.\n\n*Provide timely and comprehensive training for all employees involved in operating and maintaining process equipment.\n\n*Oversee the activities of contractors and ensuring that they are trained to perform their job safely.\n\n*Follow established pre-startup safety review and management of change procedures to ensure that modifications are adequately evaluated for safety.\n\n*Administer a comprehensive mechanical integrity program to ensure that process equipment is maintained in accordance with good engineering practice and accepted industry standards.\n\n*Investigating incide"

Key elements of the PSM program include: 1) stringent design standards of equipment which incorporate substantial safety factors and include state of the art monitoring and control instrumentation; 2) extensive process safety information that is accurate and up to date; 3)  well trained operating, maintenance, and contractor personnel; 4) written operating, maintenance, and safe work procedures; 5) mechanical integrity procedures for process equipment inspections and quality control; 6)  management of change and pre-startup review procedures; 7)  periodic, detailed evaluation of each process area by a team utilizing HAZOP methodology;  8)  regular PSM  program audits; and 9) employee participation in every element of the PSM Program. \n\nFive-Year Accident History\nThere have been no accidental releases from covered processes at the Beaumont facility within the past five years that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThe Beaumont facility also has a comprehensive Emergency Response Pro"
