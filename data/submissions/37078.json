The original RMP, submitted on 6/16/99, included information on flammable synthesis gas containing hydrogen present at the facility in quantities less than the 10,000 pound threshold.  Beaumont Methanol chose to submit an initial RMP even though there was not a threshold quantity of RMP listed flammable gases at the facility in order to inform its employees and community neighbors of potential risks posed by its operations.  The methanol plant was modified in 1999 to allow co-production of anhydrous ammonia.  As a result of the modification anhydrous ammonia was present at the facility in an amount above the threshold quantity in January 2000.  The RMP was revised on December 16, 1999 to include anhydrous ammonia.  Beaumont Methanol completed construction of a 20,000 ton ammonia storage tank which was placed into service during the month of May 2000.\n\nIt is Terra's policy to prevent accidental releases from the Beaumont Methanol facility by effective Process Safety Management programs and procedures.  This includes the following:\n\n*Participation by all plant employees in every element of PSM.\n\n*Conduct regular scheduled process hazards analysis.\n\n*Utilize current and accurate process safety information.\n\n*Maintain current and accurate written operating procedures.\n\n*Provide timely and comprehensive training for all employees involved in operating and maintaining process equipment.\n\n*Oversee the activities of contractors and ensuring that they are trained to perform their job safely.\n\n*Follow established pre-startup safety review and management of change procedures to ensure that modifications are adequately evaluated for safety.\n\n*Administer a comprehensive mechanical integrity program to ensure that process equipment is maintained in accordance with good engineering practice and accepted industry standards.\n\n*Investigating incide"
