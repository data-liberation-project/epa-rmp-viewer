      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nMonell CO2, LLC owns and operates the Monell CO2FLEX Plant (CO2FLEX Plant) located in rural Sweetwater County, Wyoming. The CO2FLEX Plant is a recently constructed Natural Gas Liquids (NGL) plant which recovers hydrocarbons in the form of NGLs from a CO2 recycle/reinjection stream that is part of a miscible CO2 flood of an oilfield. Oil and gas production, from the nearby FDL Energy's Monell Unit is treated in FDL's facility, where oil and water are separated from the CO2 gas stream via separators. The gas is then sent to the CO2FLEX Plant for treatment.\r\n\r\nThe CO2FLEX Plant consists of two processes - NGL Fractionation Area and Product Storage Area. The inlet gas in the plant is processed through a refrigeration process involving temperature change which condenses hydrocarbons, propane +, forming a propane + (Y-Grade) product. The Y-Grade product is stored in a pressurized tank with maximum volume of 5,000 gallons. A Crude Mix product is stored in a 9,000 gallon pressurized tank. \r\n\r\nThe facility utilizes a propane refrigeration system. Propane storage of 10,550 gallons is located onsite and is associated with the refrigeration system. \r\n\r\nA total rupture of the 10,550 gallon propane tank resulting in a vapor cloud explosion would pose the worse-case scenario for the CO2FLEX Plant. The 10,550 gallon tank has been evaluated for total tank rupture using the RMP*Comp offsite consequence analysis resulting in a distance to endpoint of 0.3 miles. Public receptors are within a 0.3 mile radius of the propane vessel. The worst case scenario has the potential to affect persons within the endpoint of the off-site consequence analysis. The plant is also subject to OSHA's PSM program. Therefore, this RMP has been evaluated for a Program 3 level RMP under 40 CFR 68. \r\n\r\nThe CO2FLEX Plant is located in a remote area and is normally occupied by Monell CO2, LLC personnel. There is no accident history to report as this is a newly constructed plant. Should an em"

This policy has been discussed with the local fire chief at Fire District 1 in Rock Springs, Wyoming.\r\n\r\nA total rupture of the 9,000 gallon Crude Mix tank resulting in a vapor cloud explosion was modeled as an Alternative-Release scenario for the CO2FLEX Plant. The 9,000 gallon tank has been evaluated for total tank rupture using the RMP*Comp offsite consequence analysis resulting in a distance to endpoint of 0.2 miles. Public receptors are within a 0.2 mile radius of the crude mix vessel. \r\n&#8195;\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nThe CO2FLEX Plant has a commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, CO2FLEX Plant trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the CO2FLEX Plant, and/or notify the necessary outside agencies.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\n\r\nThe CO2FLEX Plant maintains an emergency action plan, which is in place to help protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including: \r\n1. proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, \r\n2. evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, and\r\n3. notification of local emergency response agencies \r\n\r\nEmployees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency duties.

This employee participation plan addresses each accident prevention program element. \r\n\r\nThe CO2FLEX Plant utilizes a Behavior Based Safety and Loss Prevention System that provides for observation and critique of job task to modify any unsafe behaviors prior to incidents occurring. The CO2FLEX Plant also uses this system to develop and document Job Safety Analyses (JSA) for various job tasks and to track and communicate near loss and actual loss related to personnel losses, operational losses and financial losses.\r\n&#8195;\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe CO2FLEX Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address: chemical properties and associated hazards; limits for key process parameters and specific inventories; safety interlocks; suppression systems; vent and relief studies; and equipment design basis/configuration information. \r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS), Safety Data Sheets (SDS), or Product Safety Data Sheets (PSDS). For specific process areas, the CO2FLEX Plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, flow, composition) in the equipment specifications and operating procedures. The CO2FLEX Plant maintains the process within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\n\r\nThe CO2FLEX Plant also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.

The recommendations from these revalidated PHAs are also forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of each revalidated PHA recommendation is documented and retained.\r\n&#8195;\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe CO2FLEX Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations,      (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, (6) out of service (shutdown) mode, and (7) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. In addition, the CO2FLEX Plant maintains information on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the CO2FLEX Plant has implemented a training program for employees involved in operating a process. New operational employees receive training on the CO2FLEX Plant's Operating Procedures, and basic training in process operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.

The purpose of the PSSR is to see that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check that construction is in accordance with the design specifications and required safety systems are operationally ready. A PSSR also verifies that appropriate safety, operational and maintenance procedures are in place, and adequate training has been provided to the appropriate personnel. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.
