The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a program that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\r\n\r\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The Odessa Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper material and spare parts are used when repairs are made. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a Management of Change (MOC) team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\r\n\r\n4.9 Safe Work Practices\r\nThe Odessa Plant has four core safe work permit practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  The Odessa Plant predominately uses the Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP) technique to perform Process Hazard Analysis (PHA). The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to management for review. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive attention first. All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Odessa Plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.

These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\n4.10 Management of Changes\r\nThe Odessa Plant has a system to manage changes to processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process-operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before implementation. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, equipment information, and procedures are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\r\n\r\n4.11\tIncident Investigation\r\nThe Odessa Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion or toxic gas release that could lead to personal injury, severe environmental impact, or major property damage. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.

Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\r\n\r\n4.4 Operating Procedures\r\nThe Odessa Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  The procedures clearly state operating limits, consequences for deviation, and appropriate responses for deviation.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary. These procedures are reviewed and certified annually as current and accurate. The operating procedures are available in the company intranet (SharePoint) and a hard copy of the procedures that is updated quarterly is also available in case of power outage on a thumb drive.  \r\n\r\n4.5 Training\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Odessa Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in facility operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own before they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at a competent level.
