Raw water is processed and disinfected with chlorine in the treatment process. The Wastewater Treatment Plant maintains a maximum inventory of 8,000 pounds of chlorine in one-ton containers, which above the threshold level and is therefore subject to the requirements of the Risk Management Program.\n\nChlorine, a chemical required by regulation to be used in the disinfection process, has been in use at the Wastewater Treatment Plant since operation began.  No accidental releases of chlorine meeting the requirements of the five year accident history have occurred at the Plant.\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\n\nThe off-site consequences of potential accidental releases of chlorine at the Plant were assessed in accordance with requirements established in 40 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 SLAB Atmospheric Dispersion Model, an EPA-recognized computer modeling program, was used to model a worst case release scenario and an alternative release scenario for chlorine.  \n\nThe worst case scenario is a model of a release under specific conditions established by EPA, including release volume, duration, and weather conditions. Active safety systems in place at the Plant that are designed to minimize the effects of a chlorine release cannot be considered in the worst case scenario.  \n\nThe worst case release scenario is required to assume the release in a ten minute period of the entire contents of the largest vessel of the regulated chemical onsite, which for the Wastewater Treatment Plant is a one-ton chlorine container.  Meteorological conditions required by EPA rules are assumed for the release.  The toxic endpoint for the worst case release scenario is estimated to reach a point offsite of the Plant.   Public receptors are located within the release area, but no sensitive environmental receptors designated by EPA would be affected in this release scen"

Active safety systems at the Wastewater Treatment Plant are considered for each alternative release scenario. Average weather conditions at the Plant are used for this release scenario, as recommended by EPA regulations.\n\nFor the chlorine alternative release scenario, failure of a pipe in the chlorine feed system is assumed.  While the toxic endpoint for the chlorine alternative release scenario is estimated to reach a point beyond the Plant boundary, no sensitive environmental receptors designated by EPA are affected by this release scenario.  Public receptors are located within the release area.\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Wastewater Treatment Plant is subject to Prevention Program 2 of the Risk Management Program.  In accordance with the requirements of Program 2, the Wastewater Treatment Plant maintains specifications for the equipment associated with the chlorine feed system and has documented the codes and standards adhered to in designing, constructing, and operating the system.  The safe operating ranges for the chlorine system are documented, and it is operated within these safe ranges.\n\nA hazard review has been conducted for the chlorine system and identified action items are expected to be completed by _______________ (insert date).  When a major process change is made to the system, there are procedures in place to conduct a hazard review.  Otherwise, a hazard review is conducted every five years.\n\nWritten procedures for the operation and maintenance of the chlorine system are also in place at the Wastewater Treatment Plant.  Procedures are reviewed and updated periodically by Plant personnel and whenever a major process change occurs.\n\nWastewater Treatment Plant operators receive training in the operation of the chlorine system through classes and on-the-job instruction.  Competency is determined throug"

Only qualified operators operate the chlorine system.\n\nA team of City and Plant personnel conducts a compliance audit of the Plant operations and procedures once every three years and whenever a major process modification is made.  A compliance audit checklist has been developed based on American Water Works Association recommendations.  A system to correct any deficiency discovered during the compliance audit is in place.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, or a situation that could lead to an accidental release, there are procedures in place to investigate such incidents, develop findings and recommendations for corrective action, and implement the recommendations.\n\nPersonnel working at the Plant are trained to notify emergency personnel in the event of a significant chlorine leak.  In the unlikely event a chlorine release requiring the assistance of offsite emergency response personnel occurs, the City of Cleburne Fire Department is responsible for responding to the accident, coordinating the emergency response effort, and notifying potentially affected areas in the surrounding community."
