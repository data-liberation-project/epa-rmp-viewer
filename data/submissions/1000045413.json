THE MORRISVILLE BOROUGH MUNICIPAL AUTHORITY OPERATES THE MORRISVILLE WATER FILTRATION PLANT LOCATED AT 405 RIVER ROAD WITHIN LOWER MAKEFIELD TOWNSHIP, AND THE COUNTY OF BUCKS. OUR ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICY IS SUPPORTED WITH POLICIES OF U.S.E.P.A., SARA TITLE III, PA.D.E.P., PA ACT165, AND THE BUCKS COUNTY EMERGENCY RESPONSE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.\r\n\r\nb.     THE CHLORINATION SYSTEM INSTALLED AT CONSTRUCTION DURING 1968, CONSISTS OF TWO ROOMS. THE SCALE ROOM HOLDING TWO ONE TON CYLINDERS MOUNTED ON A SCALE, AND VACUUM REGULATORS MOUNTED ON EACH CYLINDER. THE OTHER ROOM CONTAINS THE RATE SETTERS, EJECTORS AND DISTRIBUTION BOARD. EACH ROOM IS EQUIPPED WITH CHLORINE GAS DETECTION UNITS WITH ALARMS MOUNTED OUTSIDE THE CHLORINE ROOMS AND A REMOTE ALARM INSIDE THE MAIN BUILDING. OUR CHLORINE SYSTEM IS A COMPLETE VACUUM SYSTEM TO REDUCE THE RISK OF LEAKS. EACH ROOM HAS HAD THE VENTILATION SYSTEM UPGRADEDTO INSURE COMPLETE VENTING TO THE OUTSIDE WITH REMOTE EXHAUST FAN SWITCHES. THE WATER PLANT IS MANNED 24 HOURS A DAY, YEAR ROUND WITH A MINIMUM OF TWO EMPLOYEES PER SHIFT.\r\n\r\nTHE SAFETY EQUIPMENTIS ACCESSIBLE INSIDE THE MAIN BUILDING AWAY FROM POTENTIAL HAZARDOUS LEAK AREAS.\r\nTHE ENTIRE CHLORINE AREA IS CHECKED EVERY HOUR BY ONE OF THE OPERATORS ON DUTY.\r\n\r\nc.

THAT  THE OWNER AND OR OPERATOR SHALL ASSUME THAT THE ... MAXIMUM QUANITY IN THE LARGEST VESSEL ... IS RELEASED AS GAS OVER 10 MINUTES, DUE TO AN UNSPECIFIED FAILURE.\r\nTHE ALTERNATIVE SCENARIO IS DEFINED AS  MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THAN THE WORST- CASE RELEASE SCENARIO.\r\n\r\nd.
