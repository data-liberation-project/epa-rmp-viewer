      "SummaryText": "The Schroeder Milk Company, located at 2080 Rice Street, Maplewood, Mn, is a production facility offering a wide range of dairy products. Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant at this facility to provide cooling for production and storage areas. Our refrigeration system is a closed loop system with normal operating pressures that range between a low side of 0 psi to a high side of 160 psi. The maximum amount of ammonia in the system, at any one time, is estimated at 22,000 pounds.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario for a Toxic Substance:\nOur worst-case release is the failure of the largest vessel in our refrigeration system. This vessel is called the High Pressure Receiver (HPR) and has a maximum capacity of 17,250 pounds. Although the normal operating level of this receiver is 8,625 pounds, the worst-case analysis takes into account the possibility the HPR would be full. In calculating the area affected by this failure, the engine room enclosure, where the HPR is located, will provide passive mitigation, thereby reducing the toxic endpoint. The engine room has an air volume of 19,530 cubic feet with roof ventilation that produces 30 room air exchanges per hour. Using the tables and equations found in chapter 4 of  EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration, the toxic endpoint was calculated at .90 miles. Based on census data provided by Landview III, within this radius is a population of 9,100, two school, residential housing, retail and light industrial businesses, and recreational areas. There are no hospitals located within this area. \n\nAlternative release scenario for a toxic substance:\nThe alternative release toxic endpoint was also determined using EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration reference tables and equations. A pressure relief valve failure was the most likely cause of an ammonia release. Using the tables provided in the RMP Guidance, a 10 minute release of ammonia at 540 lbs/min, from the High Pressure Receiver relief valve, would affec"

There is also one school, some residences, industrial and retail businesses. There are no hospitals within this radius. \n\nAccidental Release and Emergency Response Policies:\nThe Schroeder Milk Company has established an in-house emergency response team to quickly respond to and handle releases of Anhydrous Ammonia. The established steps include initial training under the OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.120 HAZWOPER. The facility has also established annual retraining for all personnel that are on the HAZMAT Team as well as periodic spill drills and plant wide evacuation drills to assure all employees are prepared in the event of an emergency. We have also coordinated efforts with the Maplewood Volunteer Fire Department to establish a joint response program. These established plans and procedures shall be periodically reviewed to assure that they are current and up to date.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nWe have trained the refrigeration operators and selected production and office personnel in Hazardous Waste Operation and Emergency Response, 29 CFR 1910.120. The trained personnel will assess each release situation and determine the appropriate emergency response to initiate. This could be by simply tightening a packing nut or flange bolt or initiating a system shut down. Schroeder Milk has established written operating procedures for the ammonia refrigeration system and has included in those procedures the Emergency Shutdown and isolation in the event of a release. We have also purchased Level A and Level B Chemical Suites, Self Contained Breathing Apparatus and other appropriate equipment to support the in-house HAZMAT team. This team will coordinate their efforts with the outside emergency services to assure the safety of all.\n\nFive Year Accident History: \nThere have been no accidental releases in the past five years.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention P"

In addition, to maintain the mechanical integrity and safety of this process, this facility practices the following industry codes and standards:\n \nASME Boiler & Pressure Valve Codes\nANSI B31.3 Piping Code\nIIAR industry guideline for safety and good engineering practices\nNFPA guidelines for fire protection equipment\n  \nThrough regular audits, training, maintenance, testing and inspection programs Schroeder Milk has established a history of safe operation and that community emergency action plans are current and training with community services is done for a safe response in the event of an accidental release."
