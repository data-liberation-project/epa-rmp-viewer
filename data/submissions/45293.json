The facility is located at:\r\n\r\n       Central Elmore Water Authority\r\n       65 Lakepoint Road\r\n       Eclectic, AL  36024\r\n\r\nThis RMPlan has been developed to meet the standards published in the 40 Code of Federal Register (CFR) part 68.  In order to meet the accidental release prevention provision under the Clean Air Act ?112(r)(7), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), promulgated these regulations.  The provisions require facilities that exceed the cited threshold quantities for certain chemicals to develop a RMPlan.  The goal of a RMPlan is to focus on reducing the risk of accidental releases of certain chemicals; thereby, preventing harm to employees as well as potentially catastrophic impacts to the public.  Over 60 accidental releases of regulated chemicals at water treatment plants (WTP?s) and wastewater treatment facilities in the United States were reported between 1986 and 1995.1\r\n\r\nChlorine is currently stored and/or used in the water treatment process at these facilities and the quantities stored on site exceed the 2,500-pound threshold for coverage under the RMP Program.  Currently, chlorine is delivered to the facilities in 1-ton cylinders.  Typically, five, 2,000-pound cylinders are on-site.\r\n\r\nIn order to illustrate the areas that could be impacted from a release of the chemicals into the atmosphere, a hazard analysis was conducted to determine the offsite consequences.  Two analyses were performed in order to estimate the offsite consequences from two release scenarios.  The first release scenario is the case defined by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as the ?worst case? scenario.  This scenario assumes that the largest vessel is full and it releases the entire contents of the containers during a ten-minute period.  The second scenario (or alternative scenario) is based on a situation more likely to occur which will cause a release of chemicals at the facility.  The radius of impact was determined based on the guidance"

      "SummaryText": "provided in Chapter 4: ?Offsite Consequence Analysis? of the General Guidance for Risk Management Programs dated October 27, 1998 and the Compliance Guidance and Model Risk management Program for Water Treatment Plants.  The distance to the end point concentration was determined with the aide of the Computer Program Aerial Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres, version 5.2.1 (ALOHA).  The National Safety Council developed this program for emergency planners.  ALOHA works in conjunction with the Computer-Aided Management of Emergency Operations (CAMEO) database and Mapping Operation for Response, Planning and Local Operational Task (MARPLOT) program.\r\n\r\nIn all release scenarios, the toxic end point concentration remained the same.  The toxic end point for chlorine is three parts per million (ppm) or 0.0087 milligrams per liter (mg/l) which is the endpoint concentration published in the CFR Part 68.  The American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) has listed these concentrations as the ?maximum airborne concentration?, at which nearly all individuals could be exposed to for up to one hour without experiencing or developing life threatening health effects.  This level is referred to as the Emergency Response Planning Guideline (ERPG-2) concentration.  \r\n\r\nResults of the hazard analyses for the EPA ?worst case? scenario led to an area defined by a 2.2-mile radius for chlorine.  This 2.2-mile radius encompasses 15.2 square miles.  The estimated population within this area is 100.  The alternative off-site consequence analysis yields significantly smaller areas.  A valve failure was assumed to occur for the alternate analysis.  The resulting area is described by a 0.3-mile radius circle around the plant.\r\n\r\nThe key to a successful risk management program is to first define hazard, risk and undertake a comprehensive approach to prevention.  The Center for Chemical Process Safety has defined hazard as:\r\n\r\nA chemical or physical condition that has the potential for causing"

After the supervisor has been notified, he shall have an individual designated who will be responsible for notifying all of the on-site personnel of the suspected release.  All other personnel, except for the confirmation team, shall prepare for immediate evacuation and move uphill and away from the suspected release.  The on-site supervisor shall designate a second person that shall accompany the supervisor during the release confirmation.  The team shall be equipped with a radio that is in contact with a third person who should be positioned in a safe location.  The third person will be responsible for immediately notifying all parties in the event that the confirmation team becomes incapacitated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Section 4.3\tLeak Detection Procedures\r\n \t\tIn case of a minor leak the following procedures should be followed:\r\n \r\n1. Use 26? Baune ammonia water and hold it near suspected points. White fumes will indicate the exact location\r\n2. Keep your head higher than the leak and take a position that allows wind to blow gas away from you.\r\n3. If leak is in equipment, close valves on chlorine container. If the leak in the container cannot be stopped, try to move the container to a safe, open area.\r\n4. If chlorine is escaping as a liquid, rotate the container so that the leak is in the uppermost portion. Chlorine thus escapes as a gas not a liquid. Liquid chlorine vaporized in the air, and the amount if gas produced is about 15 time greater than from a gas leak through an opening of the same size.\r\n5. Never put water on a chlorine leak. The water will increase the rate of corrosion and make the leak larger.\r\n6. Water may warm the chlorine and cause the chlorine to escape faster.\r\n7. If the operating system cannot use the chlorine fast enough, the chlorine should be passed into an alkaline solution, which will absorb it. Such a solution can be made using caustic"

Pinhole leaks in containers should be stopped by driving a hardwood peg or metal drift pin into the hole; the container should then be emptied as soon as possible.\r\n12. In an emergency situation, do not hesitate to contact your chlorine manufacturer, re-packer, or local supplier.\r\n13. Overfilled containers should be returned to manufacturers, or excess chlorine consumed immediately.\r\n\r\nIn case of a major release, the procedures outlined in Section 4.2 should be followed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Section 4.4\tAgency Coordination\r\nIf a release occurs at the water treatment facility, it is critical that all agencies are fully informed of the associated risk of the chemicals stored at the facility.

Copies of training certificates should be maintained as part of this document.  All personnel involved with the process should review this manual.  In general, the training requirements are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Instruction detailing physical, chemical and toxicological properties of the chemical.\r\n2. Instruction and drills using emergency equipment.\r\n3. Instruction and drills using the emergency repair kits.\r\n4. Instruction and drills implementing the emergency response plan, and administering first aid.\r\n5. Instruction detailing reporting of releases.\r\n\r\nSection 4.6\tCommunity Awareness\r\n\r\nA vital part of implementing an effective emergency response plan is to have community awareness and involvement.  An informed public will make an evacuation successful.

It is also the responsibility of the supervisors to educate their employees properly handling chlorine and the dangers related to the mishandling of the chemical.  In addition, employees should participate in periodic drills to review the appropriate responses and know first aid procedures as well as who to call in case of an emergency.  These drills should include designating a person to check the chlorine monitors and wind direction indicators to determine if an evacuation is necessary, an evacuation plan, the proper safety equipment and the proper respiratory protection to wear as well as the procedure for obtaining further assistance.  The telephone numbers of the chlorine suppliers should be posted near each telephone.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, the number for the Chlorine Institute?s Emergency Plan (CHLOREP) through CHEMTREC in the United States is (800) 424-9300.

Currently, the quantity of chlorine stored at the facility exceeds the published threshold amount.  Specific requirements, which must be addressed in each facility?s RMPlan, depend upon the program level in which it falls.  The program level determination of a facility depends on several factors, including off-site consequence and coverage under other regulations.\r\n\r\nSection 2.2\tProgram Level Determination\r\n\r\nCurrently, there are three program levels associated with the Risk Management Program.  A facility will be included in Program Level 1 if it exceeds one of the threshold quantities, but does not have off-site consequences as determined by a hazard assessment.  Program Level 2 covers those facilities that exceed a threshold quantity, has off-site consequences, but are not regulated by the Occupational Health & Safety Administrative (OSHA) or state equivalent.  Facilities that fall into Program Level 3 are subject to OSHA regulations or state equivalent, when they exceed a threshold quantity and have potential off-site consequence or the industry has one of the specified Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes published in the 40 CFR Part 68.  Currently, municipalities are not subject to federal OSHA regulations, and Alabama does not have a state OSHA equivalent.  The off-site consequence analysis (Reference Section 3) indicates that there could be off-site consequences if a chemical release of chlorine occurs at the water treatment plant; therefore, this facil"

The EPA has requested that all submittals be transmitted electronically in a format generated with their program, with appropriate figures or maps.  For reference, a copy of the form has been attached as Attachment A.  A facility in Program Level 2 must conduct and/or complete the following:\r\n\r\n    * Conduct a hazard analysis. \r\n      * Develop a prevention plan.\r\n    * Implement an emergency response plan.\r\n    * Report any chemical accidents in the past five years.\r\n    * Registrar facility with the EPA.\r\n\r\nSection 3\tHazard Assessment\r\n\r\n    Section 3.1\tToxicology/Physical Properties\r\n\r\nIt is imperative that employees are informed about the physical properties and potential health hazards of the chemicals located at the facility.

In addition, chemical interaction information should be readily available to all employees as well, since some chemicals are incompatible with each other.\r\n\r\nChlorine is listed and regulated as an extremely hazardous chemical under Section 304 and can cause severe injury or death.  Chlorine is delivered to the water treatment facilities as a liquefied, compressed gas.  Chlorine gas is not explosive or flammable; however, it may support combustion.  It is a strong oxidizer and may react violently with substances such as water, ammonia, fuel oil, etc.  Chlorine gas is denser than air (density 2.49) and tends to settle in low areas.
