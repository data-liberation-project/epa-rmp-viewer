It is our belief that those things\r\nwhich contribute to  safe operations also improve quality\r\nand reduce costs.   This commitment to safety can be seen in\r\nthe investment of resources made for accident prevention.\r\nThese efforts include extensive employee training, and a\r\nsystematic approach to safety in the design, installation,\r\noperation, and maintenance of our processes.

Operators are organized as\r\nteams with extensive cross training enabling personnel to\r\nfunction in multiple roles.\r\n\r\nOne of the four major product lines produced at this\r\nfacility is the Morwet D-425 Dispersant.   This product was\r\nfirst produced in 1978.    35% formaldehyde solution is\r\nreacted with a sodium naphthalene process intermediate in\r\ntwo  batch reaction vessels.   The final product of this\r\nprocess is a water based surfactant with highly efficient\r\ndispersant properties.   This product is used in\r\nagricultural product formulations to retard sedimentation of\r\nwater dispersible granules such as herbicides, insecticides,\r\nand fungicides..    The formaldehyde solution is supplied\r\nfrom a 10,400 gallon storage tank.   The maximum intended\r\ninventory is limited to 9824 gallons due to the presence of\r\nhigh level warning systems and procedures which prevent\r\nmaterial additions beyond this level.\r\n\r\nA minor product line involves the manufacture of naphthalene\r\nbased products.   One of those products, scheduled for\r\ninitial production in August 1999, is  Di-Isopropyl\r\nNaphthalene.   This product is a process intermediate which\r\nis further processed at another Witco facility before being\r\nsold as an oil field drilling aid.

In selecting this\r\nscenario, operating experience suggested a scenario\r\ninvolving a hose failure represented a more credible release\r\nscenario than others considered.  In this scenario, a hose\r\nor hose fitting failure results in a release from a tank\r\ntruck during the process of unloading.  The release consists\r\nof a 200 gallons per minute stream which continues for a\r\nperiod of ten minutes.  Endpoints for toxic substances\r\nremain the same as for the worst-case.   Those parameters\r\nwhich significantly influence differences in the scenario's\r\noutcome include wind speed and ambient temperature.  In the\r\nworst-case release, an ambient temperature of 112x F and\r\nwindspeed of 1.5 meters per second is assumed.
