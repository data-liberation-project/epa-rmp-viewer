Lightburn Extraction Plant (LEP) is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility.  It is Dominion's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If a release does occur, regular personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  Dominion has contracted Weavertown Environmental Group as an Oil Spill Response Organization to provide additional emergency response expertise.  Also, Dominion will contact the Lewis County Emergency Dispatch to obtain additional resources from local volunteer fire departments, law enforcement and emergency medical services.\n\n2.    Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nThe LEP is a natural gas extraction plant which receives inlet gas which is then scrubbed to remove free liquids in the gas, compressed and dehydrated utilizing one molecular sieve bed.  After dehydration, the pressure is reduced and the gas is cooled through the expander side of the expander/compressor.  The gas is sent to an absorber where liquids condense and fall to the bottom.  The overhead gas is warmed, compressed, and sent back to Dominion Transmission, Inc.'s transmission pipeline system.  The mixed natural gas liquid (NGL) product containing pentane, isopentane [butane, 2-methyl], butane, isobutane [propane, 2-methyl], propane, and ethane is sent to one of the four 60,000 gallon product storage tanks.  The NGL product is a flammable mixture that meets the NFPA-4 criteria and is present onsite in a process in an amount that exceeds the threshold quantity (10,000 pounds) for applicability under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA) Risk Management Program "

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \nThe facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements, which are set out under 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with ASME B31.3.  The LEP facility is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The LEP facility is classified as a Program 3 process under USEPA's RMP.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at this stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nDominion LEP personnel maintain detailed records of process safety information that describes the hazards of regulated substances, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the regulated process.  Much of this information was compiled during the preparation of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nDominion LEP personnel conduct comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with the regulated process are identified and controlled efficiently.  Dominion LEP utilized the What-If and HAZOP method analysis techniques to perform these evaluations.  The studies were undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations.  The PHA will be revalidated at regular intervals of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within the covered process, Dominion LEP personnel maintain written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for safely conductin"

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.  Dominion LEP personnel develop and implement safe work practices to provide for the control of hazards during operations such as lockout/tagout; confined space entry; opening process equipment or piping; and control over entrance into a stationary source by maintenance, contractor, laboratory, or other support personnel.  These safe work practices apply to employees and contractor employees.\n\nTraining\nDominion LEP has a training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating the regulated process are competent in the operating procedures associated with the process.  Initial training for gas plant operations is provided and refresher training is conducted at least every three years or more frequently as needed.  Both initial and refresher training is documented and records of training are maintained onsite for at least three years.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nDominion LEP has written procedures for (1) maintaining on-going integrity of process equipment, which incorporates training for process maintenance activities, inspection and testing, (2) corrective action for equipment deficiencies, and (3) the application of quality assurance measures.  Dominion LEP personnel perform and document maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper installation and operation.  Process equipment examined by these checks may include, but is not limited to:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Qualified and trained personnel perform maintenance operations at the site.  Any equipment deficiencies "
