An incident case of this magnitude has never occurred on the premises because we use a Safety First approach in dealing hazardous chemicals.  By using this method we teach our employees that at all times, they are to wear the following protective equipment: insulated gloves, protective goggles that cover across the eyes and the width of the face, and a safety maskto prevent inhilation.  Our employees must wear clothing that covers the entire surface of the body, such as jeans or other leg protecting garments, and long sleeve shirts are preferred.  Clothes are close fitting to the body to prevent accidents due to loose garments.  A stock tank supply of fresh water is located directly adjacent to the filling pump station.  This provides an area of immediate resuce if a minor release/inhilation were to occur.  We stress to our employees the major importance of following our operation rules and guidelines, how they prevent accidents and, in the event of an accident, prevent serious injury or possible death.  Our employees are instructed never to leave the nurse tank during the duration of the filling process.  All employees are taught from beginning to end, the explicit instructions to filling the nurse tanks.  An employee is never left alone during the filling process until they are confident they can preform the task in a safe manner.  Filling instructions are posted near the office and in the pump house.  Our employees know that if there is ever a question or something they are unsure of, no matter what it is, they are to ask for help.  Many questions are acceptable whereas one incident is not.  If the worst case scenario were to occur, our residents that are in the direct, even indirect, path of the Anhydrous Ammonia cloud, will be notified by television, and als"

Our contact person for Lane County is Bill Taldo with Emergency Management whose number is posted in the office and also referenced in the RMP.  The deployment of the fire and rescue team is a planned exercise within the county and is practiced at random for update and continuing education purposes.  Lefty's Soil Service also makes its employees participate in CEU training each year as a way to enforce the Safety First approach to our operations, which has been proven successful as there have been no such releases as mentioned herein."
