This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility's processes.  It is the practice of Enterprise Products Operating LLC. (Enterprise) to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Shoup Fractionation and Cryogenic Gas Plant located in Nueces County, Texas is owned by Enterprise Gas Processing L.L.C. and is operated by Enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe Shoup Plant is a combined processing complex comprised of a cryogenic natural gas liquid recovery plant and natural gas liquids fractionation equipment.  The natural gas liquid recovery plant is designed to utilize the cryogenic turbo expander process to recover natural gas liquids from the inlet gas, and is assembled primarily from prefabricated, skid-mounted process components.     Produced natural gas is delivered to the facility from a gas gathering system and inlet gas pipeline.  The plant processes the gas utilizing a cryogenic turbo expander to remove recoverable natural gas liquids from the inlet gas.  The plant also receives additional recovered natural gas liquids from other gas processing plants in South Texas via several inlet hydrocarbon liquid pipelines.  The mixed hydrocarbon liquid streams produced at or delivered to the Shoup facility are fractionated into individual, purified ethane, propane, butane and pentane-plus natural gas liquid streams.

Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors and to bring any questions, comments or suggestions forward for open discussion.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nEnterprise keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain a safe operating process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemicals inventories and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Chemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).\r\n\r\nEnterprise also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure ratings, temperature ratings and electrical rating of equipment.  \r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\r\nEnterprise primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and What-if/Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of Enterprise staff which has operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.

The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\r\n \r\n\r\nRelease Detection\r\n\r\n* Hydrocarbon (hazardous gas) detectors and alarms\r\n* Fire detectors inside plant compressor buildings.\r\n\r\nRelease Containment and Control\r\n\r\n* Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases.\r\n* Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\r\n* Automatic shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature).\r\n* Curbs or dikes to contain liquid releases.\r\n* Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system) \r\n* Atmospheric relief devices.\r\n\r\nRelease Mitigation\r\n\r\n* Hand-held fire extinguishers \r\n* Personnel trained in emergency response and procedures.\r\n* Personnel protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus, etc.)\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nOver the past five years there have been no large or small releases which resulted in any injuries, property damage or offsite consequences.  \r\n\r\nEmergency Procedures Information\r\n\r\nThe Shoup Plant maintains a written emergency procedure, which is in place to protect worker and public"

      "SummaryText": "safety as well as the environment.  The procedures are for the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the plant facilities.  \r\n\r\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Shoup Plant is coordinated with the Nueces County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives.  The Shoup Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Shoup Plant conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and the Shoup Plant provides periodic refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the plant.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nThe Shoup Plant resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.  Other recommendations for possible changes to improve safety come from periodic accident prevention program audits, incident investigations, or employee suggestions and recommendations.  The following changes are planned for implementation at the Shoup Fractionation and Process Plant.  \r\n\r\n* Enterprise is currently in the process of reviewing and revising the entire safety management / accident prevention program to ensure that the program can be fully administered across the diverse nature of the facilities owned or operated by the company."
