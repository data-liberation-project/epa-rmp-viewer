All 14 elements of the OSHA PSM program, the EPA requirement for developing an Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA), and the RMP submittal are included within the facility's prevention program.  \n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Hermiston, Oregon processing facility produces various potato products such as french fries, hash browns, and formed potato products.  The plant site consists of a main processing plant, raw potato storage buildings, boiler/refrigeration facility, primary water treatment facility, and refrigerated cold storage.  Activities are conducted at this site during all months of the year.\n\n\n\nThe potato processing cycle includes several activities and processing steps.  The plant purchases the majority of its potatoes from local growers.  Since potatoes have a single growing season, they must be held under controlled storage conditions.  Prior to processing, the potatoes are separated by type and processed according to customer specifications.  The inspected, washed, peeled, and hand-trimmed potatoes are cut, blanched and fried.  The final products are frozen, packaged, and prepared for shipping.\n\n\n\nThe covered processes at the facility are closed loop anhydrous ammonia refrigeration systems.  The ammonia refrigeration systems allows the finished products to be quickly cooled and frozen.  There are three independent refrigeration systems at the facility, two of which have more than the Threshold Quantity (TQ) of anhydrous ammonia.  \n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe OSHA PSM component elements are organized as follows: 1) Employees participate in the elements of this safety and release prevention program whenever possible; 2) Ammonia awareness and PSM training is provided to all employees, operators and maintenance personnel receive a"

A contractor near the release was exposed.  \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Hermiston, Oregon facility plans to respond to releases of the covered process chemical, anhydrous ammonia, and therefore has developed an Emergency Response Plan (ERP).  The ERP has been reviewed with the Hermiston Fire Department and Umatilla County LEPC.  The purpose of the plan is to establish policies and procedures for protecting the health and safety of employees, contractors, and visitors, and to comply with all applicable federal and state regulations.  Training of employees and contractors includes providing a copy of the plan upon initial employment at Lamb Weston, Inc. and reviewing it for their specific assignment, annual refresher training for current employees, and review for all whenever the plan is changed. In addition, plant evacuation drills are conducted on a regular basis.\n\n\n\nThe plan is comprehensive enough to deal with all types of emergencies specific to the Lamb Weston Hermiston, Oregon facility and defines the following:\n\n\n\n?    Preferred means for reporting fires, hazardous materials incidents, medical, and any other emergencies;\n\n?    Emergency escape routes and assembly areas;  \n\n?    Procedures to account for all employees including contractors and visitors; and\n\n?    Names of agencies and persons to contact.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nSafety systems and preventative maintenance measures will be constantly evaluated and improved.  The facility will evaluate recommendations from Process Hazard Analyses and Compliance Audits in a timely manner and implement, as soon as possible, those recommendations that will reduce the possibility of a release and/or mitigate the consequence of an unintentional release.\n\n\n\n"
