Neal Plant\n\nRMP Executive Summary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\n\n\nAt Braskem America, Inc. Neal Plant, we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner. We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\n-A description of our Neal Plant and use of substances regulated by EPA's risk management program (RMP) regulation\n\n-An overview of the Neal plant accident release prevention programs\n\n-The five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n\n-An overview of our emergency response program\n\n-An overview of the improvements made at the facility to minimize the potential for accidental chemical releases that could adversely affect our employees, public and the environment\n\n-Certifications in accordance with RMP rule\n\n-Relevant details information about the Neal plant's risk management program \n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES:\n\n\n\nThe Neal facility produces polypropylene using multiple chemicals and unit operations. The process utilizes the regulated flammable substance propylene along with catalyst and hydrogen as feedstock.  The process contains the RMP regulated substance propylene above the threshold quantity in storage vessels and reactors, columns, tanks and piping within the unit. \n\n\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards to employees, the public, and the environment posed by these chemicals.\n\n\n\nREVISION OF NEAL FACILITY MAXIMUM INTENDED INVENTORY\n\nExisting on-site designated chemical storage is being modified.

      "SummaryText": "The maximum on-site propylene and propane inventory is being increased from 10,100,000 lbs. in 2014 to 15,000,000 lbs. in 2019 due to an increase in the projected maximum number of propylene railcars that can be stored onsite.\n\n\n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO\n\nPrevious worst case scenario submitted with a tank volume of 94%.  The scenario was revised to provide for tank volume of up to 100% capacity. This increase in volume changed the projected impact distance from 0.49 miles to 0.5 miles.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\n\n\nThe centerpiece of the accident release and prevention program at the Braskem America, Inc. Neal facility is Process Safety Management. This is a fully comprehensive prevention program designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. We take a systematic and proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. Management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n\n\n-Process safety information\n\n-Process hazard analysis\n\n-Operating procedures\n\n-Training\n\n-Mechanical integrity\n\n-Management of change\n\n-Pre-startup safety review\n\n-Compliance audits\n\n-Incident investigation\n\n-Employee participation\n\n-Hot work permit\n\n-Contractors\n\n\n\nWe actively encourage participation by all employees in process safety management. Relevant process safety information is available to employees. Employees participate in PHA revalidation studies and PHA studies consistent with our Management of Change Program. Procedures provide information to employees to assist them in performing their jobs safely and correctly. Employees and contractors are trained and are included in the investigation of incidents and accidents. We engage experienced employees in developing and providing our training programs. We also encourage employee suggestions for improvement.\n\n\n\nAs prescribed by our Management of Change procedure, Pre-Startup Safety Reviews are design"

      "SummaryText": "ed to ensure the safety of process operations following new installations or modifications. Our Mechanical Integrity Program includes written procedures governing the inspection and maintenance of affected process equipment. The Neal Plant also has developed and implements Hot Work Permit procedure to prevent performance of hot work in potentially dangerous areas. \n\n\n\nThrough implementation of these multiple elements of our prevention program, the Neal Plant minimizes accidental chemical releases. In order to enhance and reinforce the Neal Plant and employee commitment to the standard underlying these management systems, the Company has established both specific accountability and controls for implementation of these systems in support of the Neal Plant's high standards for accident prevention.\n\n\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\n\n\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at the facility. In the past five years, there have been no releases at the Neal Plant of any RMP regulated chemicals,  as addressed in 40 C.F. R. 68.42(a) as having an adverse impact on employees, the community, or the environment. If an incident governed by 40 C.F.R. 68.42(a) were to occur, we would conduct formal incident investigations designed to identify and address the root cause.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\n\n\nWe have developed and maintain an emergency response plan which includes planning and training elements for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nBraskem believes in a philosophy of continuous improvement. A number of programs are in place to monitor the status of ongoing efforts and continually seek opportunities to improve. The facility maintains employee safety teams that meet regularly and a structured safety process."
