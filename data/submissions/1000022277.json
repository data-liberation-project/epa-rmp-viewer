The program includes operating procedures for startup, normal operation, shutdown and emergency shutdown, inspection and maintenance schedules and identifies responsibilities of key personnel.\n\nAn emergency response program is in place at the plant. Employee safety training is conducted both during pre-employment orientation and annually thereafter. The program includes procedures for evacuation and notification for all types of emergencies, including accidental ammonia releases, and identifies response actions and responsibilities of key personnel. The emergency response program and procedures have been coordinated with Deaf Smith County Emergency Management. Evacuation drills at the plant are conducted annually."

      "SummaryText": "Caviness Beef Packers, Ltd., is an existing beef cattle slaughtering and packing plant located approximately 5 miles southwest of Hereford, in Deaf Smith County, Texas. The facility utilizes an ammonia refrigeration system for cooling and freezing products throughout the plant, which is identified as the stationary source for the purposes of the Risk Management Plan. The plant has had no accidents related to the ammonia refrigeration system in the past 5 years. An accidental release prevention program and emergency response program are in place in accordance with OSHA and EPA regulations. All existing OSHA PSM information is incorporated into this Risk Management Plan.\n\nThe Worst-Cast Release Scenario is taken to be the failure (punctured tank, etc.) of the High Pressure Receiver located on the northwest side of the plant building. The release quantity is 17509 lb over a period of 10 minutes, using a wind speed of 1.5 mps, stability class F and rural dispersion, to a toxic endpoint of 200 ppm, results in a distance of 2.5 miles. No passive mitigation is available for this scenario. The estimated residential population within this radius is 221, based on 2000 Census data (2010 Census data was not yet available).\n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario is taken to be a valve failure either inside or outside the plant building. Valve failure is modeled assuming a \u00c2\u00bd-inch hole releasing ammonia at 180 psig, resulting in a release rate of 535 lb/min. Using average conditions of 3 m/s wind speed, stability class D and rural dispersion, to a toxic endpoint of 200 ppm, results in a distance of 0.4 miles. The overhead door to the refrigeration room is typically open in summer, so passive mitigation is not accounted for. The estimated residential population within this radius is 0, based on 2000 Census data and aerial photography. \n\nThere are no environmental receptors within either release radius, based on review of USGS maps and aerial photography.
