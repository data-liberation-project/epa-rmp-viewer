All TOLLC employees are knowledgeable of the safe work practices applicable to their area or job, and abide by them. TOLLC employees perform their work with maximum regard for the safety of themselves, co-workers and the general public. \n\n\n\nThe 112(r) regulated flammable substances managed at the Red Wing Creek Gas Plant II facility include butane and propane. Additionally there is natural gas condensate tank and off-spec NG Liquids. \n\n\n\nOffsite consequence analysis, the movement and dispersion of a regulated substance was calculated using EPA's RMP*Comp program. This method predicted pollutant concentration downwind from the source, taking into consideration the physical characteristics of the pollutant, the physical characteristics of the site, weather conditions, and the circumstance of the release.\n\n\n\nTOLLC field personnel are provided various levels of training dependent on their overall job responsibilities. Specific training programs may include respiratory protection, lockout/tagout procedures, worker right to know/hazard communication standard. Additionally, personnel are knowledgeable as to the characteristics and hazards of the flammable material stored at the facility and any conditions likely to worsen emergencies such as weather or mechanical equipment failure. TOLLC employees are trained in the proper use of chemical extinguishers during the incipient stage of a fire. Routine training will continue to be provided to plant personnel. If in the future, new safety technology relating to the regulated process is developed, installation of such technology will be further evaluated.\n\n\n\nDepending on the situation, procedures to be followed by the discovering employee(s) to mitigate the emergency may include:\n\n?    Stop the leak/release if it can be DONE SAFELY WITHOUT RISK.\n\n?    Shut upstream source off\n\n?    If fire has occurred, let ve"

No vehicles, smoking or any ignition source allowed in hazard area.\n\n?    Isolate hazard area and limit entry to emergency responders.\n\n?    Stay upwind and uphill away from release.\n\n?    Remain in a safe location until the designated supervisor arrives.  Assist with any immediate    response , containment, and equipment utilization as directed. Further secure the site from livestock and unauthorized persons.\n\n?    In the event of a spill or if heavy equipment is needed, contact appropriate contractor.\n\n\n\nThe Red Wing Creek Gas Plant II has had no releases that caused death, injuries, property damage, or environmental damage either on or off site. Operations personnel discovering a release, fire or explosion are to immediately notify the TOLLC designated shift supervisor by radio, telephone or by direct contact. "
