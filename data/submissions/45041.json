      "SummaryText": "General\n\tThe West Shore Regional Water Treatment Plant (WSRWTP) is part of the Pennsylvania American Water (PAW) Mechanicsburg system.  The system serves approximately 32,000 customers in Cumberland and York Counties, west of the Susquehanna River near Harrisburg, PA.  The WSRWTP is a new facility designed with an initial treatment capacity of 12.0 MGD, with facilities designed for future expansion to 16.0 MGD.  Water from the Yellow Breeches Creek is pumped directly to the plant via a new raw water intake and pumping station.\n\tTreatment processes include oxidation of iron and manganese and organic matter, Superpulsator clarification, dual media filtration, and chloramine disinfection.  This plan addresses chlorine used in the treatment process.  The plant is operated 24 hours per day, all year.\n\tThe water treatment plant includes a chlorine storage room, which contains up to twelve (12), one ton cylinders (24,000 pounds) of chlorine liquified under pressure, a hoist, scale(s), vacuum regulators and two gas detector/alarm units.  A chlorine feed room is located adjacent to this storage room and has a five pre and post chlorinators, as well as a gas detector/alarm unit.  The chlorination system uses remote vacuum-actuated feed lines and has vacuum regulators attached directly to the chlorine container gas valves, mitigating against high pressure gas releases through the chlorinator system.  Water treatment operators regularly check the room and its equipment, inventorying the rate of chlorine use and adjusting the feed rate as necessary.  A chlorine gas scrubber is provided to mitigate and neutralize leaks that may occur in the chlorine storage room.\nAccidental Release Prevention\nThe West Shore Regional Water Treatment Plant\u00bfs accidental release prevention program is based upon the following elements:\n1.\tHigh level of training for the operators.\n2.\tPreventative maintenance program for equipment.\n3.\tUse of state of the art process and safety equipment.\n4.\tUse of accur"

This program includes an emergency response decision tree and a notification plan.  Emergency response drills will be conducted with the fire companies, and the operation and response procedures will be reviewed and updated on a regular basis.\nPlanned Facilities to Improve Safety\nThe facility is new.  No safety improvements were identified during the hazard review."
