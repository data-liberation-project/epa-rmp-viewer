This Risk Management Plan summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to the community of hazardous chemical releases.  The plan summary is organized to correspond with specific EPA RMP definitions and requirements, including:\n\n-Introduction;\n-Elf Atochem's Policies to Protect Health, Environment, and Safety;\n-Facility Identification and Regulated Substances in Covered Processes;\n-Hazard Assessment\n-Prevention Program\n-Five-Year Accident History;\n-Emergency Response Plan; and\n-Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\n\nELF ATOCHEM POLICIES FOR HEALTH, ENVIRONMENT, AND SAFETY\n\nElf Atochem is committed to employee, public, and environmental safety by conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive risk management program that covers areas such as equipment design and installation, plant operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the Crosby plant.  The Risk Management Plan formalizes and documents these activities.\n\nThis commitment to health, environment, and safety (HES) starts with the CEO.  Senior management routinely dedicates time to review HES matters.  This emphasis on safety is carried through to the facility level, where the Plant Manager and the Safety Team regularly review safety performance, take corrective actions, and strive for continuous improvement.  The success of Elf Atochem's HES programs is also reflected by a strong commitment to safety by employees and contractors.\n\nElf Atochem's HES programs include policies, procedures, standards, and guidance materials designed to fulfill Elf Atochem's commitment to health, environment, and safety.

The facility manufactures liquid organic peroxides which are primarily used in the production of plastic resins, polystyrene, polyethylene, polypropylene, PVC, and fiberglass.  Certain substances used and produced within the facility are regulated substances under 40 CFR 68, the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule.  These substances are present at or above the minimum threshold for RMP applicability and for the Crosby plant include Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) and 2-Methyl Propene (Isobutylene).\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\nTOXIC WORST CASE SCENARIO\n\nThe worst-case accidental release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances involves a catastrophic failure of the Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) storage tank.  Sulfur Dioxide is purchased and transported to the Crosby facility via pressurized tank trucks.  SO2 is stored as a gas in a pressure controlled storage tank.  Administrative controls limit the quantity of SO2 stored on-site to 90% of the storage tanks capacity.  This quantity is assumed to be released over a 10 minute period and that the entire quantity is released as a vapor.  Based on dispersion modeling, using the EPA Off-Site Consequence Analysis (OCA), and EPA assumptions, the resulting concentrations of SO2 from the worst-case scenario release caused off-site impacts.\n\nIt should be noted that the worst case scenario is recognized by regulatory agencies and Elf Atochem as an extremely unlikely event.  Mitigation and prevention procedures and measures are implemented by Elf Atochem to reduce the risk of the worst case event occurring.\n\nFLAMMABLE WORST CASE SCENARIO\n\nThe worst-case accidental release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances involves a catastrophic failure of a 2-Methyl Propene (isobutylene) storage t"

Administrative controls limit the quantity of isobutylene stored on-site to 90% of the storage tanks capacity.  This quantity is assumed to be released over a 10-minute period.  It is further assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which comes in contact with an ignition source, with 10% of the total released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.   Based on dispersion modeling, using the EPA OCA look-up tables, and EPA assumptions, the 1 psi overpressurization resulting from the isobutylene vapor cloud explosion caused off-site impacts.\n\nAgain, it should be noted that the worst-case scenario is recognized by regulatory agencies and Elf Atochem as an extremely unlikely event.  Mitigation and prevention procedures and measures are implemented by Elf Atochem to reduce the risk of the worst-case event occurring.\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE MITIGATION MEASURES\n\nThe multiple layers of preventive and mitigation measures in use at the Crosby facility make it very unlikely that either worst-case scenarios will occur.  In the unlikely event that such a release occurs, Elf Atochem has mitigation measures in place to reduce any potential impacts.\n\nIn compliance with regulatory criteria associated with RMP evaluations, active mitigation systems cannot be considered in modeling worst-case scenario impacts; however, the significant planning and subsequent implementation that Elf Atochem has made in active mitigation measures could effectively reduce the risk associated with an RMP worst-case related incident.

Due to the elevated temperature of the organic peroxide intermediate mixture, the resultant mixture underwent a rapid decomposition.  From this decomposition, approximately 180 pounds of isobutylene was released.  No off-site injuries or property damage resulted from this incident.  Property damage occurred on-site and was localized to the facility's production unit.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE STATEMENT\n\nThe Elf Atochem Crosby facility maintains a written Emergency Response Plan.  The plan includes procedures for notifying civil authorities and the public in the event of an incident; documentation of proper first aid and medical treatment necessary to treat accidental human exposures; procedures for the use of emergency response equipment and for its inspection and testing; descriptions of the training programs for all employees in the relevant emergency response procedures; and the review and update of our response plan to reflect changes at the facility and to ensure that employees are informed of these changes.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES FOR HEALTH, ENVIRONMENT AND SAFETY\n\nSafety has been a part of the culture at the Crosby facility for many years.  An example of Crosby's dedication to safety is that in March of 1999, the facility achieved 16 years without a plant employee lost time incident.  Chemical exposure risks to employees and the public have been minimized through ongoing internal risk reduction efforts as well as regulatory requirements.  The Crosby facility is also continuing with its efforts to upgrade the tank systems of the regulated substances to provide remote access controls for these tank systems.\n\n\nCERTIFICATION\n\nI certify to the best of my knowledge, the information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry, that the information submitted is true, accurate, and complete.
