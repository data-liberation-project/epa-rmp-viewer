Headquartered in Salisbury, Maryland, the family-owned, privately held company has operations in 13 states.  Fifteen processing facilities produce about 50 million pounds of poultry products each week.  Perdue also has grain storage and merchandising operations and is ranked among the top 20 largest US grain companies.  In addition, Perdue manufactures edible oils, specialty feeds, livestock feed ingredients and premium pet food ingredients.\n\nThe Perdue Farms Georgetown Processing Facility (P-2178) is located at 200 Savannah Road, Georgetown, Delaware. This facility is the primary source of production for roasters.  Perdue Farms purchased this facility in 1978 and started operations in January 1979.  The facility is sited on about 70 acres, on the north side of town, east of the town circle, about ? mile north of Route 9.  Some residences and farmland bound it.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is regulated under CFR Part 68.   It is used onsite for refrigeration of product. The Georgetown facility has four separate ammonia systems ranging from 4,000 pounds to 14,600 pounds.  In each system, ammonia is distributed throughout the components (compressors, condensers, evaporators, etc.).  Each system has equipment both inside and outside the facility.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nAs a concerned member of the communities in which Perdue facilities are located, the company takes its role as a responsible corporate citizen very seriously. All Perdue facilities are operated to protect employees, contractors and the public from injury and illness, and to minimize environmental impact.  A company-wide safety and wellness program stresses safe conditions and safe practices.  Perdue?s poli"

The program involves a wide-range of senior management personnel, including the Vice President of Environmental Services and the Director of Safety and Security.  Additionally, Perdue conducts regular safety meetings and provides a wide variety of environmental, health and safety training to its staff.\n\nAccident Release Prevention Program\nPerdue Georgetown has complied with Delaware?s Extremely Hazardous Substance Risk Management Act (EHSRMA) since its promulgation in 1989 and the OSHA Process Safety Management regulation 29 CFR 1910.119 of 1992.  Up-to-date process information, such as equipment information, piping and instrument diagrams and Material Safety Data Sheets, are kept onsite.  Employee participation includes operating and maintenance procedures development, review and training.  Contractors are required to submit qualification statements of competency.  Process hazard analyses with recommendations have been done, and corrective actions taken. Annual mechanical integrity inspections are scheduled.  In addition, Perdue performs internal audits on its PSM substances. \n\nFive Year Accident History\nThere have been no on- or off-site accidents involving anhydrous ammonia at the Perdue Georgetown facility that have resulted in death, injuries, property damage or environmental damage.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nPerdue Georgetown has implemented a comprehensive Emergency Response Plan in accordance with the OSHA PSM regulations.

The Plan contains specific information regarding emergency response organization and procedures, as well as incident notification, mitigation and incident preparedness.  Evacuation exercises are conducted, and drills are scheduled with the local emergency responders (Georgetown Volunteer Fire Department with call box backup from Milton and Lewes).  Perdue Georgetown is a member of the Sussex County Local Emergency Planning Committee and is part of the community emergency response plan.\n\nPerdue?s Georgetown and Corporate personnel participated in an ammonia refrigeration seminar sponsored by the Kent County LEPC in 2003.   The State of Delaware and DEMA (Delaware Emergency Management Agency) have instituted the First Alert Telephone Notification System that allows for a ?reverse 911? procedure for notification of communities in the event of a chemical release or other emergency.   The system can be activated by the Fire Company Incident Commander, Manager of Sussex LEPC or the SERT (State Emergency Response Team).\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nPerdue Georgetown has made significant, ongoing improvements to its ammonia refrigeration systems in the last five years.   Some existing pumps have been replaced with a more secure pump design. Pressure relief valves (PRVs) have been added to chilling tanks, and manual temperature controls on the chillers have been made automatic.    Automatic purgers and new isolation valves have been added.   Three evaporative condensers have been replaced.   Some piping has been replaced, and the piping support system has been enhanced.   Identified ammonia compressors have been changed out, and System #1 received a new high-pressure receiver (HPR).   Two alarm systems have been improved, and roof ladders between various levels have been added for quicker emergency response time.\n\nAs part of Perdue Farms? continual impr"

Perdue is planning on adding additional walkway bridges over roof piping.  An ice maker and a condenser in System #1 are scheduled for replacement.    There will be some microprocessors added, and an ammonia detection system in the attic is planned.   The five-year PRV changeout program will continue along with additional labeling.    Off-site training for operators and technicians is also planned."
