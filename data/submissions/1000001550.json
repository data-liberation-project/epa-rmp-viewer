In addition to the Management Programs, there is a scrubber system that is used to neutralize residual chlorine after the transfer process.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nAn investigation into the Pool Chlor of Tucson facility's accident history revealed that there have been no reportable chlorine releases over the past five years (March 2004 - March 2009) that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 10 pounds.  In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from a chlorine release.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nPool Chlor of Tucson is a designated non-responding facility.  In the event of an accidental release of chlorine, Pool Chlor of Tucson will call 911 in order to reach the Tucson Fire Department's HAZMAT team.  Pool Chlor of Tucson has a B-kit available at the facility for emergency responder to use to mitigate a chlorine release.  Employees will evacuate the facility to a point that is upwind of the hazard.  Evacuation drills are performed annually.  The emergency action plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nPool Chlor of Tucson has revalidated the Process Hazard Analysis (Februrary 2009) which generated mitigation measures (recommendations) to improve safety at the Pool Chlor facility.  The scheduled completion date of all changes resulting from the PHA Revalidation is February 2010.  In the meantime, Pool Chlor of Nevada's safety committee has completed several items, including some recommendations, in a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.
