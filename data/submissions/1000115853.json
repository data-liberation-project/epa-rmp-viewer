E. - THE DALLES, OR 97058\n\nOCG's Downtown Plant is committed to be a responsible member of the community in which it operates by giving top priority to operating in a safe and environmentally sound manner. Policy dictates that OREGON CHERRY GROWERS, LLC personnel continuously identify methods to reduce the use of hazardous materials and to reduce the risk to the community and environment through implementation of new technology and procedures. This commitment to safe and environmentally sound operations is documented in the policy and compliance manuals, and the OCG mission statement, which are both made available to all employees. The Accidental Release Prevention Program policy states:\n\nIt is the policy of Oregon Cherry Growers' Downtown Plant to:\n\nComply with all applicable safety, health, and environment laws and regulations; Ensure that all unsafe conditions are properly identified and reported, and promptly corrected; Provide training to all personnel so that they can consistently and safely perform their duties; and maintain a safe workplace through prevention, detection, and mitigation.\n\nOregon Cherry Growers, LLC management stresses safe and environmentally sound operations in employee training programs, and in written materials available at the plant. Safety and environmental programs include monthly safety meetings with all employees and a joint worker/company safety committee. There are regularly scheduled internal safety and environmental audits conducted by OCG personnel and periodic safety and environmental audits by third-party auditors.\n\nIn addition, Oregon Cherry Growers, LLC has many critical and technical processing systems in place as part of our operations.  One such area is our Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management Plan (RMP) programs.  The organization's President and CEO has assigned the following individuals to faci"

Other processing at this facility includes dark sweet cherry processing and frozen dark sweet cherry processing. Fresh cherries are cooled using chilled water in hydrocoolers to product quality. Fresh and frozen products are stored in cold rooms and freezers respectively. Our mission is to produce quality cherry products in safe processing operations and protect our employees, our growers, our customers, the public, and the environment.\n\nThe covered PSM-RMP processes for this facility include:\n\nSulfur Dioxide: Sulfur Dioxide gas is transferred from either 90-ton railcars or 5-ton cylinders. Sulfur Dioxide gas is bubbled into salt water to prepare brines that preserve, firm and bleach the cherries. This process is essential to preserve cherry quality. To assure that Sulfur Dioxide is handled safely, only trained, qualified operators are authorized to make cherry brine. Oregon Cherry Growers has a long-standing safety program which includes annual SO2 training for all brine making crews, Process Safety Management, meetings when a process change occurs, and continuing follow up to assure safe practices are followed and improved if possible. Process team members assist in the update of our procedures and safety information.\n\nProcess improvements completed include perimeter monitoring for Sulfur Dioxide, electronic shut offs, double reliefs for the sulfur dioxide system and electronic surveillance systems. The facility has completed coordinated training with local emergency response agencies and applies the principles of continuous improvement to all chemical handling p"
