The prior Owner/Operator has fully divested itself from the facility.  ACS, LLC is continuing its lease and operations at this location with the new property owner, TLF-Yuma, LLC.  This correction is intended to more accurately reflect the policies & procedures of ACS, LLC and update the facility name, which is now ACS, LLC - Site #2, without re-setting the 5-year RMP update timeline.        \n\n\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe ACS, LLC - Site #2 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies are simply not to have accidental releases or emergencies.  It is a primary goal of ACS, LLC to protect employees, visitors and neighbors from harm due to company operations.  The company endeavors to execute these policies through the implementation of its Safety Program.  The company safety program includes, but is not limited to a comprehensive Process Safety Management (PSM) program which is specifically designed and intended to prevent accidental releases.  The PSM program is a coordinated effort with ACS's refrigeration partner, Western Precooling Systems (WPS).  WPS is a stakeholder in the operation and has offices and staff in Yuma, AZ about 4 miles from the facility.  WPS is a well-known reputable supplier of portable ammonia refrigeration equipment & services within the industry.  Trained WPS Refrigeration Technicians are on-call to the facility and are intended to support the Fire Dept. during an emergency situation.\n\n\n\nACS has adopted an overall \"Non-responding facility\" policy; has established an Emergency Action Plan and has taken the steps necessary to be included in the Yuma Community Emergency Plan.

One of the ways that emergency response pre-planning is coordinated and kept current is via the annual submittal of appropriate Reports, and periodic tours by the Fire Department.  ACS & WPS both support and participate in the annual Yuma Area Ammonia Safety Day, which has been instrumental in coordination with local emergency responders. Local fire and police departments with mutual aid agreements would provide emergency response for a major release event.  \n\n\n\nWPS policy includes maintaining appropriate emergency capabilities and to deal with emergencies safely if and when they do happen.  Key WPS employees attend 1910.120 (q) Emergency Response training that is refreshed annually.  WPS maintains and controls its own ammonia emergency equipment.  Each company strives to execute its emergency response policies through skilled employees that are provided with adequate and appropriate equipment and training (workers employed or contracted by ACS are trained for their emergency actions.  Refrigeration Technicians employed by WPS are trained for their emergency actions).\n\n\n\n1.2 STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nACS, LLC - Site #2 is located at 4101 S.

The facility provides refrigeration effect for the removal of field heat from freshly harvested vegetables (produce commodities) and subsequent short-term temperature-controlled storage prior to shipping distribution throughout the country.  The fresh produce is on-site generally four days from harvesting.  The facility is a seasonally operated plant with product harvest periods beginning in mid-November and finishing in early April.

Pressure and temperature controls are installed in accordance with appropriate standards, including isolation and overpressure relief valves.  At certain times of the year portable cooling equipment is required to augment the fixed refrigeration equipment at the facility, which is common in the industry. Due to the seasonal operation of the Plant, the refrigerant is removed and placed in a storage vessel at the end of each season.  The storage vessel is secluded from traffic and has a water sprinkler system to reduce temperature & pressure during very hot days in the Yuma area.   The system was constructed per the applicable codes at time of construction circa 2001.  Appropriate fire and life safety measures were engineered into the Plant, including an ammonia sensor and independently monitored alarm system.\n\n   \n\nInterconnecting piping and other associated equipment between the portable components is permanently mounted.  Additionally some vessels and the Cold Room evaporators are permanently mounted.  Portable refrigeration equipment is owned by or is leased in partnership with Western Precooling Systems.  Detailed information about stationary and portable refrigeration equipment is depicted on Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams, International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) Ammonia Refrigeration Safety Inspection Checklists, Facility Diagrams and other Process Safety Information within the RMP Program.\n\n\n\n1.3 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe RMP Prevention Program is very similar to OSHA's PSM Program.

Provide thorough team evaluation of the refrigeration system (Process Hazard Analysis-PHA).  The evaluation considers a number of potential problems including: mechanical problems, human errors, and external events (e.g. earthquakes).  Safety recommendations developed by the team are reviewed and addressed by ACS (addressed under PHA chapter).  The PHA was updated and revalidated in November 2011, by a team representing management, engineering, operations and maintenance.\n\n3. Written procedures (SOP's) and policies that establish how the refrigeration system should be operated and maintained, and how to investigate accidental releases or a \"near miss\" (addressed under Operating Procedures, Mechanical Integrity, and Incident Investigation chapters).\n\n4. Certification of refrigeration operators to safely operate the refrigeration system.  ACS certifies operators following completion of operator training and ACS's confirmation of the operator's ability to apply what they have learned (addressed under Training chapter). ACS' training program is augmented with a highly qualified vendor that is a RETA-Certified Industrial Refrigeration Operator (CIRO).  ACS employees have also completed RETA training.\n\n5. Employee Involvement in the Prevention Program.  This is addressed on two levels.  First, refrigeration equipment operators participate in the planning and evaluation of the Prevention Program (e.g. PHA study team, writing and/or reviewing operating procedures, Incident Investigation team, etc.).  This involvement encourages ownership of the Prevention Program and positively affects the operators' day-to-day activities.

Implementation of additional measures when changes are planned (procedural or mechanical).  These measures begin before any changes are made and may include a PHA, operator training, and Process Safety Information updates plus other measures required by ACS's Management of Change Procedure.  If a mechanical change is required and for maintenance contracts, ACS has a procedure for selecting a contractor based on the company's experience and safety history.  Additionally, if welding, grinding, or other \"Hot Work\" occurs inside the building and close to the refrigeration system, an ACS Hot Work permit is required.  The purpose of the permit and associated Hot Work procedure is to minimize the possibility of a fire.  Following completion of a mechanical change, a pre-startup safety review is required before the system can be started.  (These areas are addressed under Management of Change, Contractor Qualifications, Hot Work Permit, and Pre-Start-up Safety Review).\n\n7. Verification of ACS's compliance with the RMP/PSM program.  This self-audit process is an important tool to confirm whether each of the elements in the Prevention Program (and RMP) has been implemented and properly documented by ACS personnel.
