TVA is committed to setting the standard for\nenvironmental excellence among utilities and federal agencies, and to making the Tennessee\nValley a model in sustainable energy, resource, and economic development and management.\nTVA assures that employees are aware of their environmental responsibilities, use effective\nenvironmental processes, and are held accountable for performance.\n\nTVA management and employees will be responsible for maintaining compliance with\nenvironmental requirements and striving for environmental excellence in performing their\nrespective duties. We will assure environmental protection and reduce risks to our employees\nand communities in which we operate through proper environmental review of new\ndevelopments and through safe technologies, operating procedures, and emergency\npreparedness. All activities will be conducted in accordance with current environmental and\nhealth and safety regulatory requirements.\n\nII. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThis affected facility consists of an anhydrous ammonia storage facility including two 18,000\ngallon storage tanks with supporting unloading equipment, liquid transfer pumps, piping to\nconvey the liquid ammonia, vaporizers to convert ammonia from a liquid to a vapor, an\nammonia vapor transport line, and a gas dilution and injection system to inject ammonia into a\nselective catalytic reduction emission control system.\n\nThere is only one regulated substance at the facility \u00bf anhydrous ammonia.

Summary of Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario(s), including\nadministrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances to the end point for each\nreported scenario, were developed. To perform the required offsite consequence analysis for\nthe facility, the very conservative EPA RMP*Comp Model was used.\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves the complete rupture of one 18,000 gallon storage\ntank. A maximum release of 81,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia over a 10 minute period\nwas considered. The released quantity has not been limited by a system of administrative\ncontrols. Under worst case meteorological conditions of Class F stability and 1.5 m/s wind\nspeed, the ammonia vapor would have offsite end point concentrations impacting populated\nareas.\n\nThe alternative case release scenario with the worst credible case offsite impact involves the\nrelease of 78,000 pounds of ammonia vapor loss from the failure of a pressure safety valve to\nreseat or from ruptured vapor piping. Under typical metrological conditions of Class D stability\nand 3 m/s wind speed, the ammonia vapor would have offsite toxic end point levels.\n\nIV. Description of Release Prevention Program\n\nProcess Safety Information \u00bf TVA maintains documentation of safety information concerning\nchemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs and specification associated\nwith the process.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis \u00bf TVA conducted comprehensive analyses of the process to ensure\nthat hazards associated with the process were identified and controlled effectively. The\nHazardous and Operability Study (HAZOP) analysis methodology was used to assess the\npotential hazards of the process.

      "SummaryText": "t of an accidental release of a regulated substance.\n\nV. Five Year Accident History\n\nAn incident occurred on August 18, 2008.  Three contract workers repairing tube leaks in a coal-fired \nboiler were exposed to ammonia vapor.  One was hospitalized for several days and the other two were\ntreated and released.  The vapor had been released from a leaking vapor isolation valve and entered\nthe boiler via over-fire air inlets.  It is estimated that less than 10 pounds of vapor was released and\nvented from the stack via the boiler flue gas duct work.  Due to the small size of the release there were\nno off-site impacts.  The vapor was confined to the boiler and flue gas duct work.  The faulty isolation\nvalve and failure to follow procedures were determined to be contributing factors.  An upgrade in\nequipment and a change in procedures were the corrective actions resulting from the incident.  \n\nVI. Emergency Response Plan\n\nTVA has an emergency response plan in place to respond to accidental releases of hazardous\nmaterials. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response plan requirements including\nadequate first aid and medical treatment, safe shelter-in-place locations, notification of local\nemergency response agencies and the public, the qualified contractor responder for postincident\ndecontamination of affected areas. The plan will be promptly updated to address any\npertinent changes within the process that would require a modification of the emergency\nresponse plan. In addition, periodic emergency response drills are conducted to keep\nemployees, contractors, and local responders familiar with the plan.\n\nVII. Five-Year Update\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of the 40 CFR Part 68, the Risk Management Programs for\nall TVA facilities are reviewed in detail prior to the five-year anniversary of the original\nsubmissions of the RMP. An audit was conducted March 13-15, 2007 for the purpose of\nrevalidating the Allen Fossil Plant RMP."
