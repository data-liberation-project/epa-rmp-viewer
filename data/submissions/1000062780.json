Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR ?5189\n\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR ?1910.119\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Vignolo Delmart Cold Storage has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1 Vignolo Delmart Cold Storage, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Vignolo Delmart Cold Storage has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following process which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\n\n\nProcess Name               | Process Chemical              | Process Quantity(lbs.)\n\nAmmonia Refrigeration        Anhydrous Ammonia               42,000\n\n\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses and physical property damage.\n\n\n\n1. Our company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have: \n\n2. Prepared a unified program ba"

The facility has an ammonia refrigeration system that provides refrigeration capacity to six (6) cold storage rooms, four (4) precooling rooms, and two (2) hallways.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system utilizes flooded refrigeration design and operates as follows: high pressure liquid from the high pressure receivers is piped to each cold room where it passes through an expansion valve into a low pressure accumulator vessel mounted on the roof.  Low temperature liquid circulates by thermal convection through the evaporator coils in the cold rooms.  Low pressure and temperature gas collects in the accumulator vessel, and passes through a pressure regulator into a suction line. The suction line returns the vapor to the main suction accumulator located in the engine room, which separates any residual liquid from the gas. The gas is piped to four (4) screw compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas.  The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to two (2) water cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquefied and returned to the high pressure receivers. Liquid separated from the suction return gas in the main suction accumulator drains into the liquid transfer vessel.  Operation of a float switch activated solenoid valve raises the pressure in the liquid transfer vessel to the point the liquid can be drained into the high pressure receivers. \n\n\n\nThe Vigno"

      "SummaryText": "lo Farms Delmart facility was originally built in the 1998 and has been added to and modified several times over the years since then.  Most recently the following projects have occurred:\n\n2007 - Industrial Refrigeration Services installed Room 3\n\n2009 - Industrial Refrigeration Services installed Precool 3\n\n2012 - Industrial Refrigeration Services installed Room 6 and Precool 4\n\n\n\nThe facility was designed and installed by professional refrigeration engineers in accordance with industry standards at the time.  It was also built in compliance with the Uniform Mechanical Code and Uniform Building Code applicable at the time of construction. The system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and safety relief valves which vent ammonia gas to the adsorption tank if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point. Lastly, each system has an emergency \"dump box\" that contains switches and valves to turn off equipment and vent ammonia if necessary.\n\n  \n\nThe ammonia system at Vignolo Farms Delmart consists of vessels which are interconnected, or which are co-located such that a release of ammonia could impact the ability to operate vessels that are not directly connected.  Therefore, the system is treated as a single process.\n\n\n\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\n1.3.1 General \n\n\n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nVignolo Delmart Cold Storage has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are report"

It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment.  \n\n\n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nVignolo Delmart Cold Storage has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\n\n\n\nVignolo Delmart Cold Storage's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n\n- California \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 8 CCR ?3220\n\n- Federal \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 29 CFR ?1910.38 \n\n\n\nStrategically, we will respond \"minimally\" to a release.

In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Vignolo Delmart Cold Storage's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\nVignolo Delmart Cold Storage has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Vignolo Delmart Cold Storage has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\n\n\nFor the future, Vignolo Delmart Cold Storage now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\".
