The Facility Policy\n    The owners, management, and employees of Progressive Ag Center, LLC are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If any accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the public and the enviroment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n    The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\n    Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application. Anhydrous Ammonia is used for crop production nutrients\n\n   The maximum quantity of ammonia stored would be 130,000 pounds in our 30,000 gallon storage tank. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a tank truck holding 40,000 pounds.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternate release scenario.\n  \n   A. The worst-case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as a gas over ten minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 130,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 20 ppm) is 4.4 miles.\n\n   B. The alternate release scenario for anhydrous ammonia based on the hazard review is a 2 minute release from a break in a 1 inch transfer hose. The distance to endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .3 miles.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\n    The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standars Institute, Inc and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Admini"

The Five-Year Accdent History\n\n  A. There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n      Have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility, nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or enviromental damage.\n\n6.  The Emergency Response Program.\n\n     The facility has:\n\n   A. A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standards, 29 CFR 1910.38\n\n   B. Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title 111 (EPCRA)\n\n   C. Coordinated with local emergency responders\n\n      Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to access the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no specific anhydrous ammonia recommedations for implementation at this time."
