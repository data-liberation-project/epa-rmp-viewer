      "SummaryText": "REASON FOR RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN RESUBMISSION AND UPDATE\n\nStolthaven Houston, Inc. is updating the facility's Risk Management Plan (\"RMP\") in November of 2024 as a result of planned changes involving additional Vinyl Acetate Monomer (\"VAM\") storage and handling in a new Covered Process at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal.  Since the facility's last RMP update in December of 2020, Stolthaven Houston has also significantly reduced the maximum inventory of Toluene Diisocyanate (\"TDI\") stored on-site, and ceased handling Acrylonitrile.    VAM, TDI, and Acrylonitrile are all regulated toxic substances under the RMP regulations.  \n\nThe specific changes associated with this RMP update include:\n\n- Adding VAM storage in Internal Floating Roof (\"IFR\") Storage Tank Q30-13 above the Threshold Quantity, and associated VAM handling, in a new covered process at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal. \n\n- Removing a previously Covered Process from the RMP for Acrylonitrile Transfers.  Stolthaven Houston no longer handles Acrylonitrile on-site.  \n\n- Updating the D-Tank Farm Covered Process to reflect a 30,000-barrel reduction in the maximum TDI inventory stored on-site.  TDI is no longer held in Low-Pressure Storage Tank D30-10, which previously represented the Worst-Case Release Scenario for this chemical at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal.  \n\n- Providing a new Worst Case Release Scenario for toxics.  Previously Acrylonitrile represented the Worst Case Release Scenario for regulated toxic chemicals handled at the facility.  \n\n- Updating facility contact information, and  \n\n- Various data element updates since the December 2020 RMP certification.  \n\n\n\u00a7 68.155(a):  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nStolthaven Houston, Inc. is committed to operating and maintaining our processes related to bulk chemical storage and distribution in a safe and responsible manner.  The facility uses a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning program"
