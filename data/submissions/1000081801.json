Designed as a two-stage, closed loop system, liquid ammonia is circulated as needed to the evaporators where heat is absorbed and removed from the product.  The ammonia is not used or mixed in any manner with other chemical processes. The high side of the system operates at a pressure of 125 to 180 psig; intermediate operating pressure is 25 to 30 psig and the low side operating pressure is 5\" Hg to 7\" Hg. Maximum quantity of ammonia on-site is 40,000 lbs. Since the refrigeration system contains more than 10,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, Echo Lake Foods has developed and implemented a Process Safety Management (PSM) program for the refrigeration system.\n\nAs part of the PSM program, Echo Lake Foods has completed a process hazard analysis, developed written operating procedures, trained employees on awareness and system operation, established procedures to conduct management of change procedures and pre-startup safety reviews, and developed a mechanical integrity program for ammonia refrigeration equipment. In addition to the daily monitoring of the refrigeration process, Echo Lake Foods implements an ongoing preventive maintenance program to ensure the refrigeration equipment and safety systems are maintained in good operating condition.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nA PSM program, which meets the requirements of the RMP general accidental release prevention program, is being implemented by Echo Lake Foods to address the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system at the Huntington, IN facility.
