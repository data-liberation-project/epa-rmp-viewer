It is the policy of Inland-Joseph Fruit Co. to adhere to all applicable federal and state safety and environmental regulations.\n\nInland-Joseph Fruit Co.\u00bfs emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans and training of employees in evacuation and the handling of minor ammonia releases.\n\nInland-Joseph Fruit Co.\u00bfs emergency response policy to major ammonia releases is to call the Yakima County ammonia response team.  This team is made up of area public safety responders and ammonia refrigeration personnel from area warehouses.  (Work in conjunction with local Fire Department and Police to ensure a proper and safe response.)\n\nAt Inland-Joseph Fruit Co. anhydrous ammonia is used on-site. Ammonia is listed on the Extremely Hazardous Substance (EHS) list.  \n\nB.\tFacility and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nInland-Joseph Fruit Co. is a fruit processing and cold storage facility, located at 300 N. Frontage Road, Wapato, WA.  The facility is located in Yakima County, on the Yakima Tribal Nation.  The plant property is fenced and kept locked for the hours that it is not in operation.  \n\nThe regulated substance used at Inland-Joseph Fruit Co. is anhydrous ammonia (CAS# 7664-41-7). The use of anhydrous ammonia is as a refrigerant.\n\nThere are 12,300 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in two (2) single, independent refrigeration systems on the facility and is the only process subject to the RMP program.  The system with the greater amount of ammonia has 7,400 pounds in its inventory; the other has 4,900 pounds.\n\nInland-Joseph Fruit Co. has established policies, procedures and training to reduce the risk of an accidental hazardous substance release for the safety of its employees and"
