Rohm and Haas first came to\nTennessee in 1943 as part of the national defense effort in World War\nII.  In a government-owned Plant, the company began production of\nPlexiglas acrylic sheet for use in American military aircraft.\nFollowing the war, Rohm and Haas purchased the Knoxville facility and\nexpanded its production capabilities to include acrylic polymers.\n\nAlthough no longer a Plexiglas manufacturer, the Rohm and Haas\nKnoxville Plant continues to provide acrylic polymer products which\nare used by our customers in the manufacture of laundry detergents,\nfacial creams, diaper wipes, paint, caulk, paper coatings, and fiber\nfilled products. In all phases of its operation, the Plant stresses\nsafety and protection of the environment.\n\nWe are pleased to provide information on our safety and emergency\npreparedness plans, as well as the systems and training at Rohm and\nHaas designed to prevent accidental releases.\n\nThe EPA Risk Management Program\n\nIn a series of rules promulgated between 1994 and 1998, the U.S.\nEnvironmental Protection Agency established the Risk Management\nProgram (RMP) under Clean Air Act Section 112(r).  The RMP contains a\nlist of toxic and flammable chemicals.  Facilities that manage more\nthan a threshold amount of a listed chemical may be subject to the\nRMP.  Covered facilities must assess the risks associated with their\nmanagement of the listed chemicals and produce a plan to prevent\nreleases and incidents.  In order to assist in emergency planning,\ncovered facilities must evaluate \"worst case\" and \"alternative case\"\nscenarios that would result from the release of a listed chemical.\nFinally, the covered facility must make their risk management program\navailable to the public.  This summary is part of Rohm and Haas\nKnoxville's communication effort.\n"

      "SummaryText": "\nRegulated Substances Handled\n\nThe RMP regulated chemicals used by the Plant in the manufacture of\nacrylic polymers are Acrylonitrile, Aqueous Ammonia (30% Ammonia Gas\nin Water), and Vinyl Acetate.   Each are listed as RMP toxic\nchemicals.  Acrylonitrile and Vinyl Acetate are raw materials that\nare chemically combined to form acrylic polymers.  Aqueous Ammonia is\nused as a neutralizer to adjust the pH of polymers.\n\nAcrylonitrile and Aqueous Ammonia are transported to the Plant in\ntank trucks and stored in individual unpressurized storage tanks.\nVinyl Acetate is transported to the Plant in railcars or tank trucks\nand stored in two unpressurized storage tanks.  Each chemical is\ntransferred through closed piped systems to specific polymer\nproduction units for processing.  The final polymer products produced\nat the Plant are non-toxic and non-flammable.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Rohm and Haas Company Knoxville Plant has a long standing\ncommitment to providing a safe workplace and implementation of\nprocedures and practices to prevent accidental releases.  This\ncommitment is clearly stated in the following Rohm and Haas Company\nhealth and safety principles:\n\n4    We will ensure our worldwide operations and products are free\n  from significant risks to the health and safety of our employees,\n  customers, carriers, distributors, the general public, and to the\n  environment.\n\n4    We will meet or exceed all applicable laws and regulations,\n  participate in voluntary initiatives such as Responsible Carer and\n  strive for continual improvement in our Environmental, Health, and\n  Safety performance.\n\n4    We will provide our employees with a safe workplace and support\n  their efforts to work safely.\n\n4    We will strive to eliminate or reduce emissions, discharges, and\n  wastes from every stage of our operations.\n\n4    We will communicate, listen and be responsive to our employees,\n  customers, neighbors, and governments, and we will sh"

The plan has been designed to meet the\nrequirements of all relevant regulations requiring emergency response\nplans, and is intended to prevent and mitigate the consequences of a\nhazardous material spill, protect the well-being of Rohm and Haas\nemployees, the surrounding community, and the environment, and serve\nas a reference to responders in the event of an emergency.  Copies of\nthe Plant response plan have been provided to the local Police and\nFire Departments, a local hospital, and the local and State Emergency\nManagement Agencies.\n\nA trained on-site incident commander is assigned the responsibility\nof coordinating the Plant response to any incident which may occur\nincluding communicating response needs with the local Fire Department\nresponders.  An incident commander is on duty at the Plant 24 hours\nper day.   Plantwide emergency evacuation alarm systems are tested\nquarterly, and Plant evacuation drills are held annually.  Fire alarm\nbells are tested monthly.  Furthermore, the Plant regularly holds\n\"table top\" exercises to discuss and drill on the proper response to\na Plant emergency scenario.

EPA notes that the worst case scenario is designed\nprincipally to support a dialogue between the source and the\ncommunity on release prevention, and not to serve as the sole or\nprimary basis for emergency planning.  Based on previous Plant\nhistory, in addition to the several layers of protection in place,\nthese worst case scenarios are highly unlikely to actually occur.\n\nThe Plant worst case scenario is based on the detailed requirements\nfor worst case scenarios as prescribed by the RMP rule and assumes a\nrelease of the entire contents of the Acrylonitrile storage tank.\nAlthough the capacity of the tank is 67,100 pounds of Acrylonitrile,\nhigh level alarms and Plant inventory control procedures prevent more\nthan 60,000 pounds from being present in the tank.  As a result, the\nworst case scenario assumes the ten minute release of 60,000 pounds\nof Acrylonitrile.  In addition, passive mitigation (i.e., a retention\ndike) limits the exposed surface area of the pool that would result\nand reduces the release rate to the atmosphere.  Computer modeling\nindicates such a release would have a significant offsite impact.  Of\ncourse, Plant safety procedures and practices make a such release\nvery unlikely.\n\nThe RMP rule also defines the alternative release scenario.  Unlike\nworst case scenarios, the alternative release scenario can be limited\nby active mitigation and safeguards, such as alarms, automatic\nshutdowns, and operator interventions.  According to EPA, the\nalternative release scenario is a more useful communication tool for\nthe public and first responders for emergency response preparedness\nand planning.\n\nThe alternative case scenarios for the Plant were chosen after review\nof the Plant spill history, process hazard analyses, and discussions\nregarding potential scenarios with knowledgeable and experienced\noperating department personnel.
