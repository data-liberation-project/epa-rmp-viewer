      "SummaryText": "The PPG Architectural Coatings Fairburn Georgia Distribution Center (DC) complies with applicable Georgia, and US EPA regulations and applicable Department of Transportation requirements.  PPG's EHS Policy incorporates the elements of several voluntary global industry initiatives, including Responsible Care; and Coatings Care, which help companies manage safe and environmentally responsible practices in the chemicals and coatings industries.  Employees at the Fairburn DC are trained in accident prevention, hazard communication, emergency response, safe material handling practices, and fork truck driving safety.  Central to PPG's focus on safety and the environment is its EHS Policy. The policy provides the guidelines under which PPG markets, distributes and manufactures products globally in a responsible manner that protects employees, neighbors, customers and the environment. \n\n\n\nRegulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nPPG Fairburn DC is part of the PPG Architectural Coatings business unit.  The Fairburn DC stores paint, stain, and related products and distributes them to dealers, stores, and home centers.  Products are stored in various containers including aerosol spray cans.  Some of the aerosols contain propane, butain, isobutane, and methyl ether, which are used as propellants.  These four materials are regulated flammable substances under the EPA RMP regulation.  The aerosol products are stored in a separate storage room designed for this purpose.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe facility opened at the end of 2012.  There have been no accidental releases of aerosol products.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe RMP regulation requires that covered processes be classified as Program Level 1, 2, or 3.  The PPG Fairburn DC aerosol storage process is classified as a Program Level 1 process.  The Worst-Case scenario has no off-site impact and because there were no accidental releases in the previous 5 years. Submission"
