      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThis report contains the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the ammonia refrigeration system located at the Unilever Ice Cream facility in Hagerstown, MD.  This revised RMP was prepared in accordance with the requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RM Program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).  Originally prepared with assistance of Primatech Inc, this revision is being prepared as a 5-year timely resubmission of the risk management program.  The information presented in this report reflects the data element requirements of the final EPA RMP submission.  \n\nA. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nUnilever Ice Cream recognizes management's responsibility in protecting it's employees, equipment, property, and the environment.  The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the Hagerstown facility. \n\nTo accomplish the Company's goal in controlling accidental losses, the facility has established a Plant Safety Program and a Plant Safety Team.  The objectives of the Plant Safety Program are to:  achieve maximum efficiency and safety performance, reduce losses associated which damage of property, and the economic burden resulting from injuries and accidents.\n\nOne of the activities associated with the Plant Safety Program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response programs which are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119), and EPA's Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).  The Engineering Services Manager is responsible for implementation of the Risk Managem"

      "SummaryText": "ent Program.\n\nThe purposes of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs are to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid property damage. \n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs help prevent accidents and minimize consequences because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.  \n\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nUnileer Ice Cream operates an ice cream production facility in Hagerstown, MD.  The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing capabilities.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7664-41-7) contained in the system is in excess of 10,000 pounds.  Since an ammonia release from the system could pose a risk of offsite public impact and the system is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard, the system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's RM program.\n\nC. Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\nA? Employee Participation:  This program involves the employees in establishing and implementing the program.  Employees are also to be involved when a process hazard analysis is conducted.  The program also ensures that all employees have complete access to the program.\nA? Process Safety Information:  Written information has been collected which enables the employees to identify and understand the potential hazards in the system.  The written information includes the ammonia MSDS and details of the design of the ammonia refrigeration system.\nA? Proces"

      "SummaryText": "s Hazard Analysis:  Formal studies using the What-If technique have been conducted to look at the system and identify potential hazards.\nA? Operating Procedures:  Written, detailed procedures have been developed which describe the steps to be followed to ensure that the ammonia refrigeration system is operated safely.\nA? Training:  A training program has been developed which ensures that employees are trained on all aspects of the system and on the duties, which they should perform to ensure the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.\nA? Contractors:  All contractors are screened and evaluated before they perform work on or near the ammonia refrigeration system.  The contractors are also periodically evaluated to ensure that they perform work by following safe work practices.\nA? Pre-Startup Safety Review:  A pre-startup safety review is completed for all new ammonia projects to verify that all new ammonia projects to verify that all safety programs are in place, training has been performed, and construction has been completed according to design standards before the project is put into use.\nA? Mechanically Integrity:  This program ensures that the ammonia refrigeration system have been properly installed and is maintained using preventive maintenance procedures to minimize unexpected breakdowns or failures.\nA? Hot Work Permit:  These procedures ensure that a signed permit is obtained prior to any cutting, welding, or burning.\nA? Management of Change:  The procedures are designed to ensure that all changes made to the ammonia refrigeration system are properly reviewed.\nA? Incident Investigation:  The procedures ensure that any incidents (and near misses) are investigated, reviewed, and documented using an investigation team.\nA? Compliance Audits:  There are procedures to conduct regular audits of the program to ensure that the program is in place and working properly.\n\nD. Five-Year Accident History\n\nThree ammonia-related incidents were identified for the "

      "SummaryText": "Hagerstown facility in the previous five years.  On October 12th 2004, less than one (1) pound of liquid ammonia was released from a pipe joint over an eight (1) minute time period.  One (1) employee received medical treatment.  This incident did not result in property damage or offsite impacts.  On July 11th 2005, a vapor release occurred from a valve leak.  Less than one (1) pound of ammonia vapor was released over a two (2) minute time period.  One (1) employee received medical treatment.  This incident did not result in property damage or offsite injuries.  On January 21st 2008, approximately thirty-eight (38) pound liquid ammonia released from a pump seal over twenty (20) minute time period.  One employee received medical treatment.  The incident did not result in property damage or offsite injuries.\n\nE. Description of the Emergency Response Program\n\nAn emergency response program has been implemented at the Hagerstown facility.  This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to ammonia spills and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures describing how the facility will respond to ammonia spills and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures.  The program has been coordinated with the Washington County LEPC.  \n\nThe emergency response program consists of the following elements:  \n\nA? Organization Plan and responsibilities\nA? Communications Procedures\nA? Detailed Action Plans \nA? First Aid Procedures \nA? Emergency Medical Treatment Procedures \nA? Evacuation Plans\nA? Description of Outside Assistance Available \nA? Site Re-Entry Procedures \nA? Training Programs and Drills\n\nF. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nTwenty five (25) recommendations to improve safety were documented for the equipment and procedures during the ammonia refrigeration system PHA revalidation in April 2009.  The recommended changes shall be evaluated and considered, with implementation as required."
