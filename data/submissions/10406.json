      "SummaryText": "The BOC Gases Miamiville facility, owned and operated by The BOC Group, Incorporated is located at State Route 126, Miamiville, OH. The management and employees of the Miamiville facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of acetylene.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the community and the environment.\n\nThe facilities primary operation is the manufacturing, storage and distribution of acetylene.   Acetylene is manufactured by the addition of Calcium Carbide into water in a reactor vessel . A chemical reaction takes place and the acetylene is the compressed into cylinders containing an inert filler material and acetone. The acetylene dissolves into the acetone in the cylinder. Each cylinder is checked for weight of acetylene to insure that they have the proper amount of product. Cylinders are removed from the fill lines and placed into storage for shipment.  \n\nThe worst-case scenario, based on the EPA's definition for a flammable gas release, would be the rupture of a #5 cylinder containing 620 ft3 (42 lb) of acetylene. The results would be a maximum release of 42 lb. of  acetylene over a 10 minute period.\n\nThe endpoint of  1 psi overpressurization from a Vapor Cloud Explosion was determined to be 0.03 miles using the RMP*Comp. (1.06) software. The weather conditions used were a wind speed of 1.5 meters/sec., Stability Class F, an air temperature of 77 degrees F and urban topographical terrain.\n\nThe impacted area would affect no (0) residents and no special receptors. The only public receptor affected is a recreational path. The results are based on the 1990 US Census data obtained from \"Land View III\" and actual observations.  No industries or businesses are within the endpoint.  No passive/active mitigation or administrative controls were considered in this assessment.\n\nThe alternativ"

This release would result in a fire/explosion of  5 lb of acetylene.\n\nThe release endpoint of 1 psi overpressurization was determined to be 0.03 miles using the RMP*Comp. (1.06) software. The Weather conditions used were a wind speed of 3.0 meters/sec., Stability Class D, and air temperature of 77 degrees F and urban topographical terrain.\n\nThe affected area would include the recreational path and no residents and  no public receptors or businesses. No Passive and Active Mitigation systems were considered\n\nPassive and Active Mitigation systems are in place throughout the process system. These  would reduce the likelihood of a release or the release itself. These include check valves in the fill lines, and Emergency Shut-off Valves , Flame Arrestors , vents, relief valves, grounding equipment, rupture disks, purge systems, a preventive maintenance schedule for the system, and safeties.\nThere were no reportable accidents in the last five years.\nThe facility has developed a comprehensive prevention program designed to prevent accidental releases of acetylene.  The program utilizes state-of-the-art technology, sound engineering practices, administrative controls and active employee participation.  Employees serve on task groups and teams in developing and maintaining risk management program elements.  They are frequently consulted concerning the various aspects of the program and ways to continually improve the safety of the process. \n \nWritten process safety information was developed for the acetylene system to enable managers, supervisors, and employees to identify and understand the process hazards.  This information was utilized to develop a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) which assists management and employees in making decisions for improving safety and reducing the consequences of releases of hydrogen.

The PHA was review and updated in May 1996 and will be updated at least every 5 years. \n\nDetailed 0perating procedures exist which describe tasks to be performed, dates to be recorded, operating conditions to be maintained, samples to be collected, and safety and health precautions to be taken.  The procedures were reviewed/approved to ensure they are technically accurate by employees, managers and personnel with the technical expertise/knowledge of the process.  The operating procedures were review in September 1998 and are annually reviewed/revised as necessary to reflect current operations.\n\nEmployees are thoroughly trained, including maintenance and contractor employees.  The training meets and exceeds the requirements as outlined in OSHA's hazard communication standard 29 CFR 1910.1200.  Training includes operating procedures, safe work practices, emergency procedures (including alarms), special assignments, evacuation and emergency response; safety rules and procedures; routine and nonroutine work authorization; and other pertinent process safety information.  Each employee trained has a defined and documented program based on their job duties.  The training goals and objectives have been established and written in clear and measurable terms.  Hands-on training is provided to employees to enhance their senses beyond listening.  In addition, employees receive traditional classroom instruction including lectures, videos, programmed and on-the-job instruction.  Employees are encouraged to actively participate.  The employees  are periodically evaluated to ensure they posses the necessary skills and knowledge via written tests, observation and/or oral interviews.

The screening program involves obtaining information on the contractor's safety performance, including injury and illness rates, and experience.  In addition, the contractor's safety performance, job skills, knowledge, and certifications (such as pressure vessel welders) are also verified. The contractors safety procedures were last review in May 1998.  \n\nPreStart-up Safety Reviews (PSSR) are used for new or modified processes to improve the design and construction of the process from a reliability and quality stand point.  The PSSR recommendations are resolved before final installations are complete. Other items completed prior to initial process startup include piping and instrument diagrams, operating procedures, and ensuring operating personnel are fully trained.  The initial startup and normal operating procedures are fully evaluated as part of the PSSR to assure a safe transfer into the normal operating mode for meeting the process parameters. The last PreStart-up Safety Review was conducted on  .\n\nAn on-going mechanical integrity program (maintenance) is used to ensure safe process operations. Equipment used to store, process, or handle ammonia has been designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize releases.  The mechanical integrity program includes the identification and categorization of equipment/instrumentation, inspection/tests and their frequencies, development of maintenance procedures and training of maintenance personnel, criteria for acceptable test results, documentation of test/inspection results, and documentation of manufacturer's recommendations to prevent failure of equipment and instrumentation.

BOC's Confined Space Entry Program is a separate permitting system designed to manage it's employees/contractors in performing this type of work. This Program was review in May 1998 for both employees and contractors.\n \n\nManagement of Change (MOC) procedures have been developed for permanent changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment and facilities.  MOC procedures are designed to ensure that prior to any change occurring, that technically qualified personnel with knowledge and expertise of the chemical process, reviews and approves the proposed changes.  This would include both technical and mechanical changes.  Process changes include all modifications to equipment, procedures, raw materials and processing conditions other than \"replacement in kind\".  A Process Change Authorization is required for all changes.
