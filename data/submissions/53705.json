The facility is subject to the Federal Risk Management Program, Cal/OSHA Process Safety Management Program (PSM) and the California Accidental Release Prevention Program (Cal/ARP) in the Level III designation.  The Cal/ARP Program established additional state-specific requirements.  Additional state-specific requirements are addressed in an addendum report submitted to the local implementing agency (Department of Toxic Substance Control/Imperial County Certified Unified Program Agency a.k.a.

Cal/OSHA has cleared the facility of any Prevention Program deficiencies.\n\n1.1  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe 6th Street Cooling Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies are simply not to have accidental releases or emergencies.  The Company endeavors to execute this policy through the daily implementation of its Safety Programs.  The Company safety program includes, but is not limited to a comprehensive Process Safety Management Program (PSM). The PSM Program is an integrated approach to the safe operation of processes using Regulated Substances, and forms the Program Level III Prevention Program component of the RMP.

With this in mind, the priorities of protection of life, the environment, and then property have been established.  Only when these goals are achieved may the focus shift to resumption of business operations.\n\n6th Street Cooling has adopted a ?non-responding facility? policy.  A California Hazardous Material Business Plan has been developed and submitted to the local Certified Unified Program Agency; with a copy provided to the Holtville Fire Department.  The Plan is consistent with Emergency Action Plan requirements and includes written regulatory release or threatened release notification requirements.  The Business Plan includes the Hazardous Material Inventory consistent with EPCRA compliance in California, and the information necessary to be included in the Area Emergency Plan.  An Emergency Coordinator has been established.   Emergency response pre-planning is coordinated and kept current through the annual submission of appropriate reports.  The Fire Department has been contacted to make periodic tours of the facility.  Local response capabilities have been verified.  \n\n6th Street Cooling policy includes maintaining appropriate technical capabilities and to deal with incidental releases (as defined by OSHA) safely if and when they do happen.  Key employees have been qualified to use Negative Pressure Respirators; and attend 1910.120(q) Emergency training refreshed annually.

The facility provides refrigeration effect for the removal of field heat from freshly harvested produce and subsequent short-term refrigerated storage until the produce is shipped.  The Plant?s stationary refrigeration system is supported with portable refrigeration equipment during peak periods.  General maintenance is year-round, with major maintenance occurring in the off-season summer months.\n\nThe Regulated Substance in use is anhydrous ammonia (NH3).  Refrigeration equipment consists of Pressure Vessels, HydroVac? Vacuum Tubes, Refrigeration Trailers (Compressor Units), Ice-making equipment, Pressure Cooling Equipment, Cold Storage Room Evaporators and associated valves, instrumentation and piping.  \n\nVacuum tubes and Pressure Coolers are used to pre-cool agricultural product; the refrigerated storage portion of the facility is used for short-term product storage.  Evaporators (Room Units) in the storage sections of the facility maintain temperature until product is sold and shipped.  The refrigeration system is configured in a closed-loop system with isolation and overpressure relief valves installed in key areas. An ammonia-water diffusion system protects against accidental releases from High-Side Pressure Relief Valves.  Refrigerated storage space is monitored with ammonia sensors and an automated alarm system.  \n\n6th Street Cooling, LLC is supported by an affiliate company, Western Precooling Systems (WPS).  WPS is a statewide and well-known provider of ammonia refrigeration equipment and maintenance services.  WPS supports 6th Street Cooling, LLC from its Yuma Operations Office.

Other safety programs are integrated with the PSM Program, to the extent practicable and appropriate.  The written PSM document is maintained in the site RMP binder/or electronically via wbbm.\n\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nIt has become apparent in the industry that a mishap while draining oil from the system is one of the most common incidents to occur.  Special self-closing valves are installed as a permissive for oil drain flow.  If a release were to develop during the oil-draining task, the mechanic simply releases the handle of the self-closing valve and flow is terminated.  The facility has installed these types of valves at all oil drain points.\n\n?    Entrance to the facility is closely monitored  \n?    The facility is enclosed with fencing and gates\n?
