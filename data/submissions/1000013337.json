      "SummaryText": "The City of Seguin owns and operated the Walnut Branch Wastewater Treatment Plant in Guadalupe County, Texas.  The City of Seguin is aware of its' obligations under section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.  The City of Seguin notes that there are two obligations that are required of the Seguin Wastewater Treatment Plant.\n\n112 (r)(1)-Purpose and General Duty Clause:\nThe substance of the general duty clause is that the owner/operator that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has an obligation to ensure safe operation and to have a plan in the event of an accident.  The Walnut Branch Wastewater Treatment Plant has a plan in place to prevent and mitigate any emergency situation.\n\nRisk Management Plan:\nThe Walnut Branch Wastewater Treatment Plant has one process that involves a chemical stored in excess of threshold specified in 112(r), the chlorine used for disinfection.  The City of Seguin is aware of the potential hazards posed by storage and use of training for emergency response in the event of a release.\n\nThe purpose of the chlorine in wastewater treatment is to disinfect the water.  Chlorine is delivered as a compressed gas and liquified gas in one-ton cylinders and there are up to six (6) one-ton drums present at the Walnut Branch Wastewater Treatment Plant at any given time.  For planning purposes we considered the impact of a sudden release of chlorine gas within a ten minute period of time.  This worst case assumption has a potential of impact of 0.9 miles.\n\nThe City of Seguin Wastewater Treatment Plant has implemented procedures to prevent and respond to any chlorine releases.  Plant personnel are trained regularly on proper techniques in handling chlorine, use of safety equipment and safety procedures.  The City of Seguin Wastewater Treatment Plant has coordinated with its first responder, the Seguin Fire Department for implementation of these plans."
