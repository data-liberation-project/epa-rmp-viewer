This plant is subject to the EPA Risk Management Program Rule as it has an ammonia refrigeration system which contains more than 10,000 pounds of ammonia.  OBI  complies with both the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard and the EPA Risk Management Program.  The release scenarios outlined in RMP Section 2 and 3, and described below were developed in conjunction with the consulting company iWorkWise.\r\n\r\nThe City of Kodiak is located on the northeast coast of Kodiak Island and the plant is located in the industrial/commercial area of the City, to the Southeast of the city center.  Topographically, there is a steep mountain ridge close to and north and west of the plant.  Under the worst case scenario, the ammonia cloud reaches only to the end of the marina where it dissipates to below 200 ppm before reaching the city center.  Human receptors in this area include other seafood processing plants and commercial businesses that support the fishing industry, and recreational areas such as a public marina and park, museum, and cruise ship terminal.  As the nearby seafood processing plants are also subject to the Risk Management Program, they are prepared with emergency plans in the event of a release.\r\n\r\nThe more sensitive types of receptors such as schools and hospitals would be unaffected by a release for two reasons.  First, the public schools and the hospital in Kodiak are located beyond the worst case distance that the ammonia cloud would travel. Secondly, both the schools and hospital are several hundred feet of elevation gain above sea level where the release would have occurred.  Since ammonia clouds follow the lowest path, it is unlikely that any significant ammonia would reach these locations.\r\n\r\nWith a significant release (>500 pounds), the most affected receptors are"

Emergency protocols of recreational areas outside of the immediate area would be triggered through communication with the municipal emergency response system.\r\n\r\nThe Kodiak area, like much of Alaska, is rich in wildlife and eagles, deer and other animals may wander near the plant site, although this happens infrequently.  \r\n\r\nThe OBI Kodiak plant is committed to a strong safety and accident prevention program.  Even before the RMP rule applied, OBI participated in emergency response training and drills.  There is a continuing dialogue with the Kodiak Fire Department who would be the first responder in the event of a significant release."
