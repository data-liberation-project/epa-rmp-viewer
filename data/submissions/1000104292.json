The Palestine Plant is used for the manufacture of alkylated specialty chemicals (e.g., emulsion breakers, surfactants), which are predominantly used in the oil and gas industry. The process involves reacting ethylene oxide with various common chemicals, such as fatty alcohols and phenols, to produce a variety of products.\nThe facility is subject to the Program Level 3 RMP requirements. [The OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation also applies to the facility because the EO onsite exceed the PSM limit of 5,000 pounds.]\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the Verdant release prevention program that are in place at the Palestine Plant. \n2.\tEmergency Action Plan\n\nVerdant complies with applicable federal, state, and local regulations related to emergency response plans. This facility has an emergency action plan that provides instructions to employees on how to respond to an emergency. Employees and contractors at the facility are trained in the key aspects of the emergency action plan. Employees and contractors are also informed of hazards in the workplace. Employees who work with potentially hazardous substances receive proper training.\nVerdant coordinates with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) so that the LEPC is aware of the EO and PO operations and the emergency procedures proposed in the Palestine Plant Emergency Action Plan.
