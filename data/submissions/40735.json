It is also our policy to work with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies, and promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork, to orchestrate an effective contingency plan in the unlikely event that a process incident occurs at one of our plants.\nPrimary Activity\nThe primary activity at the Cedar Park Water Treatment Plant is municipal drinking water production.\nUse of Regulated Substances\nChlorine is used primarily as a disinfectant to ensure a safe drinking water supply.\nQuantities Handled or Stored\nChlorine: Up to 18,000 pounds\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\nThe EPA-defined worst case scenario is a failure of a 2,000 pound cylinder of chlorine. The 10 minute release is mitigated by a factor of 0.55 because a building encloses the process.  This is the equivalent of 1,100 pounds of chlorine being released.  Under worst case weather, chlorine could travel 1.55 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.\nAlternative Release Scenarios (ARS)\nA more conceivable release, although still remote, is failure of a flexible connection at the ton cylinder.  The release would be mitigated by an enclosure, resulting in a release rate of 5.8 pounds per minute, and an offsite distance of 0.26 miles.  This is about the most realistic release that would ever be expected to occur. However, the plant policy is to replace the flexible connections at prescribed intervals.  \nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe Water Treatment Plant is in compliance with the RMP Rule, 40 CFR 68.  The Water Treatment Plant has conducted a comprehensive review of all systems, as well as administrative, technic"

As a result of a Hazard Review at this plant, recommendations were developed to install or upgrade some safety items. \nFive Year Accident History\nThe Water Treatment Plant has never had a significant release of a hazardous substance as defined by this Rule.\nEmergency Response Program\nThis facility has an Emergency Response Program that is coordinated with the community plan.\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nThe following recommendations were made as a result of the Water Treatment Plant Risk Management Program. Some of the recommendations are currently being implemented. Others are being prioritized and budgeted accordingly.\nWe have updated our operating and maintenance (O&M) procedures, and have elaborated on procedures more prone to human error.\nWe have developed and adhered to an Emergency Response Program in conjunction with the City of Cedar Park Hazardous Materials (HazMat) Response Team, Fire Department, and the Fire Marshal.\nWe will ensure each maintenance technician receives all appropriate training toward his or her duties.\nWe will require each operator to be trained on the plant?s O&M.\nWe will procure and maintain an inventory of spare parts that are prone to failure, and replace such parts as part of a regular maintenance cycle, despite the existence or absence of apparent wear.\nWe will develop and implement a chlorine supplier audit program.  We will ensure that suppliers have emergency container repair, routine equipment maintenance procedures, and detailed pre-shipment inspection procedures."
