These programs and regulations coupled with company policy help to ensure the safe operation of the facility, protecting employees, neighbors, and the general public from chemical exposure. \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENTAL RELEASE HISTORY\n\nThe Brenntag Southwest Lancaster branch has not had a significant release resulting in evacuation of the facility since the start of operations at this location in 2004. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThis facility has emergency plans which are coordinated with local fire departments and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  For toxic and flammable products, the company's emergency response plans are based on information from the manufacturers of these materials. The emergency response plans for all company facilities include procedures for notification of potentially affected neighbors, the local fire authority, Federal, State, and Local agencies.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nIn order to continue to improve upon its safety record, Brenntag Southwest requires all of its facilities to conduct incident investigations, safety compliance audits, continuous training on normal and emergency procedures, and continuous community outreach actions including: educating and training neighbors, customers, fire departments, and emergency response teams.  These policies, along with improvements that have originated from internal programs such as the Employee Suggestion Program and from external sources such as industrial associations, aid the company in its continuous effort to enhance the safe handling and storage"
