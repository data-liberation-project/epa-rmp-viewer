Because there are employees at the facility more than 4 hrs./day, the station is subject to the OSHA PSM standard.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response \r\n\r\nAnadarko Petroleum Cooperation has a longstanding commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention. APC has an extensive operator and maintenance training program. Safety is a major concern in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. APC's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous materials. However, if a release does occur, personnel are trained on how to respond to such emergencies. If the situation requires, APC will notify, cooperate with, and support the various emergency response agencies.\r\n\r\nLocation and Regulated Substances \r\n\r\nThe Stanley Worthy CGF/CDP is a facility that receives production from area oil and gas wells via flowline. The production is treated to separate gas, water and condensate. The gas is further processed through a cryogenic process involving the rapid temperature and pressure change via a Joule-Thompson (JT) valve which condenses the lighter hydrocarbons, including methane, ethane, propane, butane and pentane, to condense forming a Natural Gas Liquid (NGL) product. The NGL product is stored in to eight pressurized bullet tanks, each with a volume of 30,000 gallons and operating pressure of ~200 psi.\r\n\r\nA total rupture of a 30,000 gallon NGL tank resulting in a vapor cloud explosion would pose the worse-case scenario for the Stanley Worthy CGF/CDP facility. The 30,000 gallon tank has been\r\nevaluated for total tank rupture using the RMP*Comp offsite consequence analysis resulting in a distance to"

This release is assumed to release 81026 pounds of material.  The tank has been evaluated for total tank rupture using the RMP*Comp offsite consequence analysis resulting in a distance to endpoint of 0.4   This event was selected as being a possible scenario for use in emergency planning and response. \r\n\r\nThere are public receptors are within a 0.4 mile radius of the NGL tank. The worst-case scenario would affect anyone within the endpoint of the off-site consequence analysis. Therefore, this RMP has been evaluated for a Program 3 level RMP under 40 CFR 68. The Stanley Worthy CGF/CDP is located in a remote area, but does have 4 full time employees.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe Station has developed an emergency response plan, which has been communicated to and is coordinated with local response agencies. The goals of the program are to protect employees and the public from the hazardous effects of releases and to minimize the effects of any releases. The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect station, personnel, and regulatory changes.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes for Improved Safety\r\n \r\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees. Employee safety meetings that focus on various safety issues, such as flammable substances, are held regularly. Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards through APC's Near Miss and Observation programs.\r\n\r\nAccident History\r\n\r\nSince the facility has been in operation, there is no accident history to report. Should an emergency involving the Stanley Worthy CGF/CDP NGL system occur, it is the Anadarko's policy to notify the Laredo Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. This poli"
