Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Polices\n\nHeinz Frozen Food Company s (HFFC) manufacturing sites comply with applicable federal,\nstate\nand local regulations.  As with all HFFC manufacturing locations, this food processing\nfacility has a formal worker safety program.  All employees are informed of hazards in\nthe workplace.\nEmployees who work with potentially hazardous substances receive proper training in the\nhandling of those substances.  This facility has procedures in place to safely\nremove employees from areas in the unlikely event that a hazardous substance release\nwere to occur, and to put in place emergency notification and response procedures.\n\n2.   Facility and Regulated Substances\n\nThis Heinz Frozen Food Company food processing facility is located at 221 Ore-Ida\nCourt, Pocatello, Idaho.  Frozen prepared foods are produced at this location.  Food\ningredients are received, blended, mixed, cooked, baked, assembled, frozen and\npackaged.  The regulated substance at this facility, anhydrous ammonia, is used in a\nclosed-loop refrigeration system for product cooling and freezing. Ammonia is the\nmost effective, energy efficient and environmentally safe chemical for keeping food\nat it's proper temperature.\n\n3.   Worst-Case and Alternate-Case Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case scenario consists of the release of ammonia from the largest vessel\nover a period of ten minutes.  The maximum quantity of ammonia in the vessel is\nlimited to 80-percent of the total volume of 14,400 pounds via written\nadministrative controls, resulting in a release of approximately 12,000 pounds of\nammonia.  There are off-site impacts under this worst-case scenario.\n\nIf"

The team develops corrective\nactions to prevent similar releases in the future.\n\nThe alternate-case scenario consists of the release of ammonia vapor from a safety relief\nvalve due to an overpressure condition in a vessel located in the facility s machine\nroom.  The relief valve is designed to vent ammonia to the atmosphere when its pressure\nrating is exceeded, preventing\npotential damage to other components in the refrigeration system.  The scenario\nresults in a 170pound ammonia release over a period of 15 minutes.  There are off-\nsite impacts under the alternate-case scenario.\n\n4.   General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Ammonia Specific Prevention\n\nAll Heinz Frozen Food Company manufacturing locations comply with the OSHA Process\nSafety Management for Highly Hazardous Chemicals (PSM) standard relative to anhydrous\nammonia. Therefore, this facility has programs to ensure proper operation and\nmaintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system.  Further, refrigeration system\noperators have been trained and are knowledgeable in the safe operation of the\nrefrigeration system.\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at this facility has been designed and constructed\nusing good engineering practices and to conform to industry standards.  The system\nincludes ammonia detection devices, an emergency shutdown switch located outside the\nmain mechanical room,\nhigh- and low-level switches in pressure vessels, and safety relief valves to avert\nserious system overpressure.  Periodic maintenance on the refrigeration system is\nensured via the use of a computerized maintenance management system.  Annual physical\nsystem audits are performed by\nan external refrigeration contractor to ensure system integrity.\n\n5.   Five Year Accident History\n\nDuring the past five years this facility has had no significant accidental releases of\nammonia.\n\n6.   Emergency Res"
