The entire 2,000 pound tank capacity is assumed to disperse at a rate of 200 pounds per minute for a period of ten minutes.\n\nWorst-case distance to toxic endpoint for 2,000 pound chlorine release is 1.3 miles.\n\nThe modeled distance to the toxic endpoint for chlorine under the alternate-case scenario is as follows:  92 pounds of chlorine to a distance of 0.1 miles.\n\nSid Copeland, Superintendent at the City of Louisville Water Treatment Plant is a qualified individual with overall responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the RMP.
