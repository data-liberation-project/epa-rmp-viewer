In addition to other state and local codes applicable to our facility and process. We maintain this process to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and use of Anhydrous Ammonia in our facility.\n\n\n\nOur goal is to promote overall worker, public, and plant safety. The SmithFoods Milk Process facility is located at 230 North Vine Street, Orville, Ohio. We manufacture dairy products. The facility has processing tanks, piping, packaging equipment, raw materials warehousing, finished goods refrigerated storage, an Ammonia refrigeration engine room, boilers, and miscellaneous utilities. \n\n\n\nThe Milk Processing Facility refrigeration system required for our production process necessitates the submission of this Risk Management Plan. The refrigeration system contains approximately 16,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. This surpasses the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds outlined in Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program regulations.\n\n\n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\n\n\nThe SmithFoods has implemented numerous policies and procedures to enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of Anhydrous Ammonia as well as other hazardous substances, fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses, avoid property damage, and offsite impacts.  Our safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices, which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment. These rules are detailed and improved as necessary. They are also communicated to and accepte"
