These programs provide for the implementation of detailed prevention and\n\nresponse procedures when storing and handling hazardous chemicals. The program objectives are to ensure\n\nworker and public safety and to provide environmental protection.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only substance at the facility that is regulated under the PSM and RMP programs.\n\nThis is the same type of ammonia commonly sprayed on fields by farmers to fertilize crops.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant throughout the plant to maintain desired meat temperatures in\n\ncoolers, freezers and working areas. Expelling heat caused from altering the ammonia between a liquid and a\n\ngas state creates refrigeration in the facility. This refrigeration system consists of a series of compressors,\n\ncondensers, evaporators, vessels, piping and valves.\n\n\n\nThe offsite consequences of analysis was determined utilizing RMP comp and the population data is based upon information pulled from Marplot. How to determine the WCS & ARS was derived from the EPA document, Risk Management Program guidance for offsite consequences of analysis (1999). \n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is operated with a variety of safety devices employed within the system,\n\nincluded are high and low level automated shutdown systems and high and low pressure automated\n\nshutdown systems. Alarm systems are utilized to provide early detection of problems within the system\n\nbefore shutdowns occur.\n\n\n\nThis facilities emergency response program is an action plan to respond to and resolve incidents associated\n\nwith the ammonia refrigeration system. The Fire Department / Hazmat Team will be notified so that\n\nthey can provide assistance during an incident. If it is necessary to contact the public regarding an ammo"

Therefore, we updated it as soon as we knew the correct inventory number.\n\n\n\nThe facility utilizes Process Hazard Analysis, Compliance Audits, Pre-Startup Safety Reviews, Mechanical\n\nIntegrity inspections, Preventative Maintenance activity, equipment inspections, and training to ensure\n\nmitigation and control of potential incidents.\n\n\n\nThe facility will make changes to the system and train as necessary to resolve items noted during the Process\n\nHazard Analysis, Compliance Audit, Pre-Startup Safety Reviews, and Mechanical Integrity inspections to\n\nimprove the safety of the system. Changes will be placed on an action list, evaluated, and implemented in a\n\ntimely manner.\n\n"
