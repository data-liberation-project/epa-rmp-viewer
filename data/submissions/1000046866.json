In addition, WLC uses anhydrous ammonia and titanium tetrachloride in quantities above the threshold quantity on the List of Regulated Toxic Substances in 40 CFR Section 68.130. \r\n\r\nFlammable Gases and Liquids\r\n\r\nBasic Information:\r\nEthylene is a colorless gas with a sweet odor.  Propane, sometimes referred to as liquefied petroleum gas, is nontoxic, colorless, and virtually odorless. Both of these materials are extremely flammable. Leaks have the potential to ignite and create a flash fire or a vapor cloud explosion.\r\n\r\nUses:\r\nEthylene is the basic building block for polyethylene plastics produced by Westlake. Polyethylene is used in many common items including toys, food containers, automobiles, and garbage bags.  Propane is used as a modifier in some polyethylene product formulations.\r\n\r\nAmmonia, Anhydrous \r\n\r\nBasic Information:\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is a clear, colorless gas with a sharp, intensely irritating odor. The vapors are irritating to the eyes and respiratory tract. Contact with the liquid can cause frostbite. Long-term exposure to low concentrations or short-term exposure to high concentrations can result in adverse health effects from inhalation. Gaseous ammonia is lighter than air, but vapors from a leak may initially hug the ground. Ammonia gas is normally not considered a serious fire hazard, but at high enough concentration and under the right conditions, it can ignite and burn. Ammonia is soluble in water, forming a corrosive liquid. \r\n\r\nUses:\r\nWLC uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant. \r\n\r\nTitanium Tetrachloride\r\nBasic Information:\r\n\r\nTitanium tetrachloride is a heavy liquid with a yellowish color and a sharp, pungent odor. It reacts with water or atmospheric moisture to produce a white cloud of titanium oxide and hydrochloric acid vapors. Long-term exposure to low concentrations of hydrochloric acid or short-term exposure to high concentration"

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nWestlake Longview Corporation (WLC) came into existence in December 2006 when Westlake Chemical Corporation purchased Eastman Chemical Company's polyethylene assets located within the Eastman Chemical Company Texas Operations (TXO) plant site near Longview, Texas.  With the sale of these and other assets within TXO, the plant site has developed into a closed access industrial park, also known as the Sabine Industrial District.  WLC's production personnel include Eastman Leased Workforce operators.  \r\n\r\nWLC is subject to safety policies and expectations of both Westlake Chemical Corporation and TXO.  The accidental release and emergency response policies of Eastman Chemical Company are summarized in its Administrative Policies.  Per WLC procedure WLC-H&S-001 General Safety Policies, all WLC employees, Leased Workforce operators, and contractors are required as a minimum to follow the TXO Authorized Safe Practice Manual (ASPM).  WLC-H&S-017 Site Emergency Plan designates how WLC will interact with the TXO comprehensive site emergency plan. \r\n\r\nAs described in HSE Standards of Practice, Westlake Chemical Corporation accepts our responsibility to protect the environment and the health and safety of our employees, their families, and the public. Human health and safety, environmental, and process safety (HSE) performance are core values of the corporation and will be managed as an integral part of our business to benefit employees, customers, neighbors, and shareholders. All Westlake employees are responsible for assuring that we achieve continuous and measurable improvement...

Since its beginning, WLC has integrated its safety and emergency response practices and processes with those of TXO. Prior to this Risk Management Program (RMP) submittal, WLC was considered part of the TXO plant site for purposes of compliance with RMP.  In the event of an emergency, TXO provides emergency response services and coordination with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  These support services will not change because of the independent RMP submittal; WLC will continue to work closely with TXO to ensure a safe work environment and effective emergency response, if needed.\r\n\r\nRegulated Substances Description\r\n\r\nWLC uses ethylene and propane in quantities above"
