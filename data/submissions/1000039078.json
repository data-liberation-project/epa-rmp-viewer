This commitment is demonstrated by the investment of significant resources in accident prevention, such as personnel training, mechanical inspection, process control systems and by recognition of safety as a primary factor in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes. However, if an accidental release does occur, trained plant personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nTo prevent accidental releases, the Tioga Gas Plant Complex achieves control of hazardous materials by:\n\n\n\nA   A commitment to OSHA's Process Safety Management and HAZWOPER standards, EPA's RMP, and the \n\n    Department of Transportation's Hazardous Materials Transportation Act regulations, which promote \n\n    and require adherence to process safety activities designed to prevent accidental releases.\n\n\n\nB   Development and use of Hess Corporation and Tioga Gas Plant Complex safety, operating, \n\n    maintenance, emergency response, engineering design and construction policies, procedures and \n\n    practices designed to prevent accidents and potential releases.\n\n\n\nC   Knowledge of and adherence to applicable industry recognized and generally accepted good \n\n    engineering practices  (RAGAGEP), specifications and recommended practices that address and provide \n\n    guidance for the proper design, construction and operation of facilities containing hazardous materials.\n\n\n\nD   A comprehensive equipment inspection and testing program.\n\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Tioga Gas Plant Complex, located at 10340 68th Street NW, Williams County, North Dakota processes raw natural gas from area oil/gas wells to produce Ethane, Propane, Butane, Natural Gasoline, Sulfur, and clean Natural Gas for industrial and residential use.

The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is involved. The procedure addresses emergency response, proper first aid and medical treatment, evacuation plans, accounting for personnel, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public. In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection and testing and instructions in the use of emergency response equipment.
