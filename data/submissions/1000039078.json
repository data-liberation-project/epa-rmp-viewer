The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is involved. The procedure addresses emergency response, proper first aid and medical treatment, evacuation plans, accounting for personnel, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public. In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection and testing and instructions in the use of emergency response equipment.
