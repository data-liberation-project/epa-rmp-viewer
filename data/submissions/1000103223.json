Appendix C consists of the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the worst case release scenario. \n\nV.\tHazard Assessment \u0096 Alternative Release Scenarios (ARS)\nAppendix B consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the alternative release scenario.  Appendix D consists of the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the alternative release scenario. \n\n \nVI.\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and the EPA Risk Management Program.   However, as discussed throughout this document Home Run Inn is continuously improving this program. \n\nThis prevention program covers those processes that handle ammonia above the threshold quantity for both PSM and RMP rules. The most recent audit of the PSM program was conducted on September 2, 2021, and the next audit will occur before September 2, 2024, in compliance with the requirement to conduct PSM audits every three years.

      "SummaryText": "I.\tIntroduction\nA Risk Management Program has been implemented at the Home Run Inn facility located at 1300 International Parkway in Woodridge, Illinois, for the reduction of accidental releases of hazardous materials. This 5-year, updated Risk Management Plan (RMP) summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to site personnel, contractors, visitors, and the community and environment at large of hazardous chemical releases. The RMP is organized to correspond with specific U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP, Program 3 of 40 CFR 68, definitions and requirements of Subpart G, including: \n\u0095\tIntroduction;\n\u0095\tHome Run Inn policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\n\u0095\tFacility identification and regulated substances covered processes;\n\u0095\tHazard Assessment;\n\u0095\tPrevention Program;\n\u0095\tFive-Year Accident History;\n\u0095\tEmergency Response Plan; \n\u0095\tEmergency Communications;\n\u0095\tSpill Reporting / Environmental Release Procedures;\n\u0095\tPlanned changes to improve safety; and\n\u0095\tManagement Program\n\nII.\tHome Run Inn Policies To Protect Health, Environment and Safety\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at Home Run Inn; this RMP formalizes and documents these activities. Home Run Inn is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and to the environment. It is Home Run Inn policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations. \n\nThis RMP has identified potential hazards and has taken steps to design and maintain a safe facility, in order to prevent releases, and minimize the consequences of accidental releases, which could occur. This RMP addresses potentially catastrophic chemical releases that could result in immediate harm and acute health effects to offsite receptors (public and environmental). Home Run Inn has developed an Emergency Action Plan that contains procedures designed to maximiz"
