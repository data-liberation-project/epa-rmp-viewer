      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary: Tertiary Facility RMP\nFacility Information\nThis Risk Management Plan (RMP) applies to the covered processes utilized at the City of Stockton Municipal Utilities Department (MUD) wastewater treatment facility. The RMP describes the program developed by the City to prevent accidental releases of chemicals that could cause serious harm to people or the environment and to reduce the severity of releases that may occur. Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are stored and used at the Tertiary facility, located off State Highway 4 at John Turk Road, just west of the San Joaquin River. Aqueous ammonia is also stored and used at the facility, although the concentration is below threshold at 19% ammonia.\n\nTreated wastewater is disinfected with chlorine to inactivate pathogenic bacteria and viruses and meet the treatment plant\u00c2\u00bfs permit requirements. Since ammonia is present in domestic wastewater, the addition of chlorine to the treated wastewater forms chloramines, which are more stable and persistent than free chlorine. If the ammonia level in the treated wastewater is too low to form chloramines, ammonia must be added to the treated wastewater prior to chlorination.\n\nAfter the wastewater is disinfected with the chloramines, it is dechlorinated with sulfur dioxide to remove any residual chlorine prior to discharge of the treated effluent to the San Joaquin River.\n\nLiquid chlorine is delivered to the treatment plant in 90-ton rail tank cars. The maximum inventory at any time is two tank cars. Liquid sulfur dioxide is delivered by tank truck and then transferred to the storage tank. The maximum inventory of liquid sulfur dioxide at the plant is one 3,700-gallon tank. Aqueous ammonia, 19% is stored in  a 3,500 gallon poly tank with secondary containment and in 270 gallon polymer totes.\n\nCorporate Commitment to Safety\nCity of Stockton, Municipal Utilities Department, is committed to operating in a manner that complies with all Federal and State standards, provides saf"

The policy emphasizes the need for employees at all levels to accept full responsibility for safety and to perform their job duties in a manner that will assure the safety of City employees and the public at all times.\n\nEmployees must be aware of the hazards of their work and are properly trained to perform their job duties safely. Management is responsible for directing the enforcement of safety regulations with the emphasis on proactive incident prevention.\n\nEmployee Training\nEmployees attend annual Chlorine safety training, including job specific training and simulation of repair kit type \u00c2\u00bfC\u00c2\u00bf.  Most employees that work with Chlorine, Sulfur Dioxide and Aqueous Ammonia are also 40-hour HazWoper trained and all have attend the First Responder Awareness and Operations level training.\nMUD had developed and compiled written safety information to enable employees to understand the hazards of working with chlorine and sulfur dioxide. A process hazard analysis has been completed to comply with Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations under Title 8 of the California Code of Regulations.\n\nChlorine Prevention Plan\nThe chlorination system provides for the addition of chlorine gas in solution. The vapor pressure of chlorine in the tank car forces liquid chlorine through the supply manifold to the evaporators. Rupture discs between the manifold and the two outer most tanks burst at approximately 400 psi to relieve pressure in the tanks and prevent pipe and equipment damage. A pressure switch activates an alarm when the rupture disc is burst. The temperature required to increase the vapor pressure to 400 psi is 180 degrees Fahrenheit, which will not be seen at ambient conditions. P"

Each valve opens when the temperature of the water in the evaporator water jacket attains a preset level. Should the water temperature drop below this set point, the valve closes to prevent carryover of liquid chlorine to the gas metering equipment. The chlorine pressure reducing and shutoff valve will also close on power failure or on pressure drop.\n\nSafety equipment includes a chlorine gas leak detector that activates an alarm if the chlorine level exceeds 1.0 ppm, and two 30-minute rated self-contained breathing units. A Chlorine Institute Emergency Repair Kit \u00c2\u00bfC\u00c2\u00bf is located near the chlorine unloading area for immediate accessibility.\n\nEach chlorine tank car is double-lined and is equipped with pressure relief valves set at 360 psi. The cars are within a locked, fenced compound and are continuously monitored by gas detectors along the fence perimeter and at the rail car domes. The compound is continuously monitored by video surveillance equipment.\n\nChlorine evaporators were upgraded in 2007 \u00c2\u00bf 2008 and additional video surveillance capability was added in 2008. Powell auto-shutoff valves were installed in Feb, 2008.\n\nSulfur Dioxide Prevention Plan\nSulfur dioxide is delivered by tank truck to the storage tank. The tank is protected from rupture by overpressure by two expansion tanks mounted on the storage tank. In the event of overpressure of 135 psi, the pressure relief valve will release. The temperature required to increase the vapor pressure of sulfur dioxide to 135 psi is 135 degrees Fahrenheit, which will not be seen at ambient conditions.\n\nLiquid sulfur dioxide is fed from the storage tank to the sulfur dioxide building where it is evaporated into gase"

Provisions are made for excess pressure or vacuum to be automatically relieved.\n\nOne ambient sulfur dioxide leak detector is provided at the effluent control building which activates an alarm if the sulfur dioxide level exceeds the set point of 5 ppm. Another detector is provided at the enclosure surrounding the sulfur dioxide storage tank.\n\nThe Sulfur dioxide tank and evaporators were replaced in Jan and Feb, 2008, and Powell auto-shutoff valves were installed on the tank in June, 2008.\n\nAqueous Ammonia (19%) is under threshold for EPA-RMP.\nAqueous ammonia (19%) is delivered by tank truck and transferred to a 3,500 gallon storage tank located in a secondary containment barrier on a concrete pad adjacent to the head of the chlorine contact canal. Additionally, a tote (approximately 275 gallons) of 19% aqueous ammonia is in place near the nitrifying biotowers (NBT) for use in snail kill operations.\n\nAccident History\nDuring the past 5 years, the facility has had 3 releases of aqueous ammonia. Two from  structural failures and one from an overfill. No one onsite or offsite was injured. The causes of structural failures were remedied.\nThere have been no releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide in the last 5 years. (2004 \u00c2\u00bf July 2009)"
