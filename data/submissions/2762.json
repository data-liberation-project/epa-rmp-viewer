It is one of the larger employers in Winnebago County.  It currently employs approximately 420 people.  It manufacturers fine printing papers from recycled fiber that is de-inked in the on-site pulp mill.\n\nThis facility has a long history of cooperating with local response agencies; in particular, the Neenah Fire department and the Winnebago County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\nThis facility is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for our workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, the Bergstrom facility has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a Risk Management Program that helps manage the risks associated with our chlorine use areas.  The program must also comply with the requirements of EPA\u0012s 40 CFR 68 Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs and OSHA\u0012s 29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.\n\nA.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Bergstrom facility is committed to the safety of its workers and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.   The Company\u0012s Environmental Policy commits the Company to a continuing effort to reduce adverse environmental impacts, which may be caused by its operation.  In the Policy\u0012s administrative direction, Paragraph D. specifically addresses emergency situations and is quoted below:\n\nThe Company will employ effective environmental protection technologies and strategies in all operating facilities as a means of both protecting the environment and also of reducing any environmental health and safety risk to our employees and the communities in which we operate.

Bergstrom Facility and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Bergstrom facility is an integrated paper mill producing fine papers from recycled fiber that is de-inked on-site.  The de-inked fiber is bleached using a hypochlorite process.  This facility handles only one substance regulated by RMP rules in sufficient quantities to be covered.\n\nAs a result of the use of this regulated substance, the following process is covered by the RMP rule:\n\n                                         Regulated Process Quantity\n\n           Process                         ProgramLevel                  Substance               Pounds\n\nChlorine Tank Car Unloading              3                               Chlorine                360,000\n\n\n\nC.  Off-Site Consequence Analysis\n\nThe RMP rule requires that an off-site consequence analysis be conducted for a worst-case and alternate release scenario for the toxic substance chlorine.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for chlorine is a failure of a 180,000-pound railroad tank car of chlorine at the chlorine rail car unloading area.  The maximum distance to the toxic end point concentration is 21.6 miles.  The residential population in this area is approximately 370,000 people and includes schools, residences, hospitals, prisons, recreation areas, and industrial areas.   The development of this scenario was required by the regulations.  However, it is an event that is extremely unlikely to occur.  The Company has checked with the Chlorine Institute regarding the possibility of a car rupture while in the possession of a user.  We were informed that the car is designed to withstand transportation accidents and there has never been a major rupture of a car while at a user\u0012s site or at a producer\u0012s site being loaded.\n\n\nThe alternate release scenario for chlorine is a failure of the vaporizer gasket adjacent to the chlorine tank car unloading area.  This scenario assumes that chlo"

A small residential and commercial area that includes a small section of a city park is located within this distance.  The total population in this area is less than 150 people.  \n\nD.  Accidental Release Prevention Program In Chemical Specific \n              Prevention Steps\n\nThe RMP rule requires a Program 3 prevention program for the chlorine tank car unloading area.\n\nThe prevention program is summarized in Chapter 18 Prevention Program of the Process Safety Management Manual.  Full details are given in the following chapters of Volume 1 of the Process Safety Management Manual:\n\n\n                                           Process Safety Management\n\n          Item                                    Chapter                                                 Title\n\nHazard Review                                 3                                     Process Hazard Analysis\nOperating Procedures                      4                                      Operating Procedures\nTraining                                            5                                      Training\nMaintenance                                     8                                      Mechanical Integrity\nIncident Investigation                      11                                      Incident Investigation\nCompliance Audit                            13                                     Compliance withSafety Audits\nManagement of Change                  10                                     Management ofChange\nPre-startup Review                          8                                      Pre-startup SafetyReview\nContractors                                      6                                      Contractors\nEmployee Participation                     1                                       Employee Participation\nHot Work Permi"

The chlorine vendor supplies chlorine by a Department of Transportation approved railroad tank car.  This railroad tank car is then used as an on-site supply for chlorine in the process.  All piping, valves, vaporizers, etc., are consistent with the Chlorine Institute standards.  Workers who perform operations involving chlorine receive training emphasizing industry accepted handling procedures that are consistent with the Chlorine Institute and OSHA\u0012s guidelines.\n\n\nE.  Five-Year Accident History\n\nThe Bergstrom facility maintains a five-year accident history that fulfills the requirements of the RMP rule.  This history indicates a good record of accidental release prevention over the past five years.  Only one release of this regulated substance, which resulted in a consequence of interest, has occurred from the chlorine area in the last five years.  The release affected several railroad employees that were on-site at the time.  No members of the general public were involved. \n\nThis release is documented in Chapter 17. \n\nF.  Emergency Response Programs\n\nThe Bergstrom facility has established a written emergency response plan that complies with the RMP rule and with other federal contingency plan regulations.  The plan is described in detail in Chapter 12 of Volume 1 of the Process Safety Management Manual.  This plan has been communicated to local emergency response officials through the LEPC.  Notifications have been made to all counties in Wisconsin that may be affected under the worst-case modeling scenario.  Regular dialogue is maintained between Bergstrom Division and the LEPC, the local fire department, and the local rescue squad. \n\nG.  Planned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nThe Bergstrom Division of P. H. Glatfelter Company constantly strives to improve the safety of the"
