If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Seward County Sheriff's Department, and request their help.  This facility is mainly used as a fill station, and therefore, has no full time employees.                                                                                                                                                                   We are an agricultural based business.  We sell Anhydrous Ammonia to farmers for fertilizer, for corn, wheat, etc.  We have two Anhydrous tanks, on is l8,000 gallons the other is 13,000 gallons, also used in association with the tanks are piping, valves, and other miscellaneous equipment.                            The worst-case scenario for our Anhydrous Ammonia fill plant would be failure of our 18,000 gallon tank, resulting in a gas release.  According to our guide, the distance to endpoint is 1.02 miles.  Estimated population of approximately 0, since there are no residences, towns, businesses in this rural area.  However, we have taken into consideration the possibility that there might be a motorist passing by on the Highway.

In the event of an emergency involving our Anhydrous Ammonia system, it is this company's policy to notify the Seward County Sheriff's Department and request that they respond.
