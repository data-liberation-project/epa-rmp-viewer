      "SummaryText": "Risk Management Plan Executive Summary\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Murphy Oil USA, Inc. (Murphy Superior) Superior Refinery has a long-standing commitment to employee and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our highly trained personnel, working in cooperation with appropriate governmental agencies, will quickly respond to control and contain the release. In the unlikely event of a catastrophic release, the refinery, working in conjunction with local emergency management staff, is well prepared to respond and mitigate adverse consequences to the community or the environment. The refinery maintains an accurate and comprehensive emergency response plan. This plan is also maintained in the Douglas County Emergency Government Center. Emergency notification of the public is coordinated through these agencies.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Murphy Oil Superior Refinery, located in Superior, Wisconsin, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products including: fuel gas, propane, butane, fuel oil, and gasoline, from raw crude oil. The refinery has several regulated flammables, such as propane and butane as well as hydrogen fluoride (HF), which is a regulated toxic substance.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the refinery. Because processes that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements that are part of the RMP Prevention Program and describes the management system in place to implement "

Each element of the OSHA PSM standard is assigned an element leader and the responsibilities of the element leaders are outlined in the PSM program which is maintained at the refinery.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Murphy Oil Superior Refinery encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management, accident prevention and operations. Examples of employee participation include but are not limited to updating and compiling technical documents, serving on various committees, development of procedures, and participating as members of process hazard analysis (PHA) teams. Employees have access to information created as part of the refinery accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees are involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan. In addition, the refinery has a number of programs in place that address process safety and employee safety issues. These processes include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety. The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Murphy Superior refinery keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). This information is available to all employees through a computerized access system. This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.

The refinery has a computerized process control system which helps the operators to ensure that the process is maintained within these limits. Process control systems, monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems) provide a safe operating environment.\n \nThe refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe Murphy Superior refinery has a comprehensive program in place to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe refinery primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolut"

This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained pursuant to normal policies.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Murphy Superior refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained pursuant to normal policies. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained pursuant to normal policies.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Murphy Superior refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process. \n\nIn addition, the operating procedures at the refinery provide guidance on how to respond to upset conditions for specific process or equipment parameters.

All new employees receive basic training in refinery operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties, tasks and to train on the written operating procedures. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through written tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training. Murphy Superior also conducts annual HAZWOPER training and has a system in place to provide operators with regulatory training updates. Training manuals are available to the operators for most positions.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Murphy refinery uses contractors to supplement its work force. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform refinery personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) "

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR team uses checklists to verify aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a final check that program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Murphy refinery has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner.

Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service. The temporary use of equipment would be allowed only after the system is reviewed to determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment until a repair can be made (e.g. reduction of pressures or temperatures). The temporary use of equipment is covered under the MOC policy which addresses these types of issues.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The Murphy refinery incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that equipment and parts are suitable for their intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Murphy refinery has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of all personnel including employees and support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) procedures for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Murphy refinery promptly investigates incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire, explosion, or toxic gas release that caused major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to refinery management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.
