The ammonia refrigeration process at High Liner (process) has been designed and operates in compliance with EPAA?s Accidental Release Prevention rule, and applicable State and local codes and regulations.  High Liner has qualified engineering, operations, and maintenance personnel knowledgeable in the safe operation of compressed ammonia systems in direct responsibility of the process.  The process is also designed and operated in compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health AdministrationA?s Process Safety Management (OSHA-PSM) rule. \n\nThrough its Emergency Action Plan (i.e., Emergency Evacuation Plan) as required under OSHA-PSM, High Liner has emergency response procedures in place that comply with the Accidental Release Prevention Program (ARPP).\n\nA DESCRIPTION OF YOUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nHigh Liner is a food processing facility primarily engaged in the preparation and packaging of seafood products.  The facility has a maximum inventory capacity of 11,600 pounds of anhydrous ammonia within the process.  The ARPP applicability threshold for anhydrous ammonia is 10,000 pounds.  As High LinerA?s anhydrous ammonia storage capacity exceeds this threshold, the facility is subject to the program and is required to prepare a RMP for this process.  The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system at High Liner is the only process that stores a substance in greater quantities than the ARPP applicability threshold.\n\nThe process is subject to Risk Management Program 3 because it is subject to OSHA-PSM provisions and it is not eligible for Program 1.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe process is currently designed and maintained in compliance with American National Standards Institute / American Society of "

      "SummaryText": "Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) guidance, and American Society of Mechanical Engineering (ASME) guidance as documented in Volume 2, Section 6 of High LinerA?s PSM Plan.  Process verification takes place through design audits by trained personnel and/or certified consultants.  The schedule of such verifications is at least once every three years.  \n\nPreventative maintenance (PM) is an active part of High LinerA?s daily operations.  PM is performed on a computerized schedule in accordance with OSHA-PSM and, in many cases, the process safety equipment PM schedule prescribed by High Liner exceeds recommended equipment maintenance schedules.  Ammonia detection sensors are present at nine locations (oil storage room, boiler room, Frick room, FES room, the vent line, engine room, freezer, tempering room and the shrimp cooler) and are tested quarterly.  Relief valves are replaced, inspected, repaired, tested and/or sealed by an ASME certified agent on a five-year schedule.  Differential pressure gauges are replaced immediately upon discovery of any damage that may breach the integrity of the compressed ammonia process.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWithin the last five years, High Liner has not had an accident involving compressed ammonia that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nA process release would be detected by ammonia sensors located in the oil storage room, boiler room, Frick room, FES room, the vent line, engine room, freezer, tempering room and the shrimp cooler.  A process release would also be detected by the employees through odor.  The fire alarm and CO2 suppression system are tested/checked annually.  The ammonia sensors are tested quarterly.  An alarm signal is triggered and would sound throughout the facility.  An alarm is also activated at ADT if ammonia is detected in the engine room, freezer area, tempering room, or the shrimp coole"
