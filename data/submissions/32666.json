In addition our policy is to adhere to all federal, state, and local laws.  The goal of the Farm Country Coop is to provide for the safety of their employees, their customers and the general public.  In order to fulfill this goal Farm Country Coop has hired a company named Regulatory Consultants, Inc. (RCI) to maintain and administer comprehensive safety programs and procedures.  RCI safety services supervisors audit and monitor facility compliance with safety standards of the company.  All locations are required to conduct their own internal audit utilizing checklist survey forms that are reveiwed regularly and updated as necessary to ensure all applicable federal, state and local regulations are covered.\n\nEach location has a site safety coordinator as a leader of our RMPs.  These coordinators are given training to monitor the day to day safe work activities, maintain the required reulatory recordkeeping, conduct regular safety meetings, conduct employee training and act as the location's contact with RCI.  The site safety coordinators are also the location emergency contact.\n\nA description of our facility and the regulated substances handled.\n\nThis facility is a wholesale farm supply distribution center as such we store and distribute a wide variety of pesticides and fertilizers including Anhydrous Ammonia.  Anhydrous Ammonia is received by truck, is handled and stored on-site and is a regulated substance by the EPA requiring us to comply with the Risk Management Program.  We sell anhydrous ammonia to grower customers in either 1,000 gallon or 1,500 gallon nurse tanks.  The customer applies the ammonia into the soil as a source of nitrogen fertilizer for growing agricultural crops.  This facility maintains approximately 28 1,000 gallon nurse tanks and 32 1,500 gal"

Therefore, the total facility anhydrous ammonia storage capacity for our facility is 607,600 pounds.

The facility complies with the MN Dept. of AG standards (1998), OSHA (29 CFR 1910.11), EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule as well as all applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations.  Our ammonia systems is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shutoffs and emergency shutoff valves.  The load-out risers used for the purpose of filling the nurse tanks are protected by excess flow valves and fill line breakaways to immediately stop the flow of ammonia if a line or a hose fails.  All of the main storage tank valves and the riser load valves are locked when not in use.\n\nOur ammonia system is inspected on a regular basis with maintenance and preventative maintenance scheduled and documented.  Liquid and vapor valves, hoses, excess flow valves, gauges, and relief valves are replaced when necessary and/or according to the guidelines in the ANSI standards.
