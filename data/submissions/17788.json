These procedures seek to provide for employee safety, public health, and response agency interaction with respect to the disinfection process.\n\nThe City of Thomson Usry Pond Water Plant withdraws raw water from Usry Pond.  Finished water from the plantis disinfected with chlorine and is distributed to residents and numerous industries in the City of Thomson and McDuffie County.  The chlorination process includes one-ton chlorine cylinders, chlorination equipment, electrical equipment, and a chlorine gas detection system.\n\nModeling was performed using RMP*Comp for both the worst case and alternative scenario to determine the potential consequences associated with an accidental chlorine gas release.  For each case, atmospheric dispersion modeling was used to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine gas before its concentration decreases to a theoretical \"toxic endpoint\".  \n\nThe worst case scenario involves failure of a one-ton cylinder yielding a cumulative release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine over a duration of ten minutes.  The distance to \"toxic endpoint\" was 1.3 miles.  The alternative (more likely) scenario involves mechanical failure of one flexible manifold connections (pigtail) allowing an unnoticed release to occur through this hole for one hour.  The distance to \"toxic endpoint\" under this alternative was 0.1 miles.  In support of the probability that a worst case scenario is not likely to occur, a review of process history indicates that no reportable accidental releases (greater than ten pounds) has occurred in the past five years at the Usry Pond plant.\n\nThe following key elements are included in the City of Thomson's RMP:  operator training, preventative maintenance program, chlorine gas detection equipment, standard operating procedures, hazard review of equipment and operati"
