TCSLC is a member of the National Association of Chemical Distributors and has been certified to be in compliance with the Responsible Distribution Code. The company is also an active member of the Chlorine Institute, a trade group that develops and establishes recommended practices for the safe handling of chlorine. The TCSLC facility is a repackager, manufacturer and distributor of various industrial chemicals. Major markets include drinking water treatment, wastewater treatment, industrial applications, agriculture, and food processing. Chlorine, sulfur dioxide, and ammonia (including mixtures and byproducts) are distributed to the water treatment, wastewater treatment, agriculture and industrial markets. Thatcher Group states in its EHS Charter that the Environmental, Health, Safety, and Security Mission is to achieve a manufacturing environment that we are proud of by continuously improving our ability to provide our customers with quality products and services that meet their needs while operating with the highest standards of safety and environmental compliance. To operate with the highest standards of safety and environmental compliance, our commitment to EHS must include: compliance with work instructions and procedures; clear expectations; a constant focus on prevention; active participation; awareness on and off the job; strong leadership; and personal responsibility. Further, a commitment to EHS must include personal accountability for their EHS performance and for the EHS performance of those they manage or supervise.\n \nIn addition to EPA's RMP rule, the Thatcher Company complies with State and Federal OSHA's Process Safety Management, EPA's State and Federal Hazardous Waste Generator, DHS's Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standard and DOT's Pipeline and Hazardous"

In this RMP submission, there are two Worst-case toxic release scenarios and six Alternative Case toxic release scenarios evaluated for chlorine, ammonia, and sulfur dioxide. The Hazard Prediction and Analysis Capability (HPAC) model was developed by the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) through the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA). These HPAC models has been approved by the Chlorine Institute and is published in their Pamphlet 74 Edition 6.\n\nTo ensure a common basis for comparisons, EPA defined the worst-case scenario as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single vessel or process line that results in the greatest distance in any direction to an endpoint. The alternative release scenario is a release that is considered more reasonable or \"more likely.\" These maximum distances are used to determine the radii for circles around the covered processes. Residential populations within these circles are required to be determined based on available census information; hence, the population number for each scenario is reported as part of this RMP submittal. These estimates were acquired from the EPA Marplot software. Since wind direction cannot be anticipated for an accidental release, EPA mandated the circle estimation method. This method greatly overestimates the population potentially exposed to an individual release since the prominent wind direction and other factors are not considered. Generally, Thatcher Company components for the accidental release prevention program includes a commitment to process safety, an understanding of hazards and risk, management of risk and learning from experience as well as compliance with regulatory requirements. The plant has a Process Safety Management (PSM) system for the covered processes as defined by OSHA. The chlorine, ammonia, and sulfur dioxide program documentation include the following PSM elements: process safety information; proces"

Throughout the plant, a hierarchy of controls has been implemented including hazard elimination, substitution, engineering controls, toxic gas sensors, administrative controls and personal protective equipment to minimize or eliminate exposure to hazards. Infrastructure security improvements at designated areas in the plant have been implemented that provide layers of protection against deliberate man-made incidents in accordance with applicable elements of U.S. Department of Homeland Security's CFATS Risk Based Performance Standards.\n\nIn the past five years, Thatcher Company has had one accidental release that resulted in a plant evacuation that occurred on June 19, 2019.  While moving a railcar with the trackmobile, it became uncoupled and rolled into a railcar that contained sulfur dioxide.  The momentum of the collision snapped the liquid SO2 unloading piping.  Hazmat personnel as well as the local fire fighters responded quickly.  Some plant personnel as well as some neighbors were treated locally.  There was one OSHA recordable injury.  NRC was notified that 1000-9000 lbs were released.  Final calculations showed that 9000 lbs were released.  There were 7 employee or contractor injuries on site, and 30 people off-site received medical treatments.\n \nIn an effort to maintain a safer workplace and being aware of the various chemicals handled and the hazardous nature of those chemicals, TCSLC has developed an Emergency Response Plan (SOP EHS-13).  The plan outlines actions and procedures to be utilized in the case of emergency action involving fires and the releases of, or substantial threats of releases of hazardous substances.
