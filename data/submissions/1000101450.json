Finally, SFI has undertaken a rigorous approach to PSM\r\ncompliance auditing. Findings from the audits are reported to the facility, which then must correct\r\nthe findings and provide written documentation of resolution of the findings to SFI's Safety Director.\r\nLastly, the PSM written program incorporates the Plant's emergency response plan and places\r\nspecial emphasis on handling accidental releases of hazardous chemicals and coordination of\r\nemergency response with local fire departments and other emergency response organizations.\r\nMany of SFI's refrigeration and maintenance personnel have completed 24-hour HAZWOPER\r\nHAZMAT technician level training program. This training includes topics such as classification\r\nsystems and hazards identification; ammonia spill control and containment; respiratory protection; air\r\nmonitoring instrumentation; proper personal protective equipment; medical monitoring; and proper\r\ntermination procedures for emergency response activities. The facility conducts annual\r\nHAZWOPER refresher training to keep employees current and comfortable with their responsibilities\r\nunder the plan using classroom discussion and response to mock emergency scenarios. The facility\r\nalso conducts drills during which the emergency response team practices implementation\r\nof the incident command system to respond to mock emergency situations.\r\nAs part of the RMP requirements, SFI undertook a review of the potential offsite consequences of\r\nthe accidental release of the worst-case scenario in the system.

The facility\r\ncompleted an initial process hazards analyses (PHAs) for ammonia using the industry standard\r\nHAZOP Analysis developed through the International Institute for Ammonia Refrigeration.\r\nThe most recent PHA revalidations was completed in 2022 using the HAZOP methodology. The PHAs were completed using technical and operations staff from the Smithfield Plant as well as experienced facilitators.
