Sea-3 LLC. owns and operates a 560,000 barrel fully refrigerated propane import/export storage facility in Newington, NH on the Piscataqua River approximately 6.5 miles upstream from the sea buoy at Portsmouth, NH.  The site consists of a total area of 10.8 acres. There are two aboveground storage tanks (AST) containing propane, one 400,000 barrels, the other 160,000 barrels located on 7.02 \"upland\" acres.   The two ASTs are situated within a large diked area.   Additionally, three (3) 90,000 gallon above ground horizontal storage tanks were added to the facility in 2019.  The railcar loading/unloading facilities and flare are situated on 3.80 acres of \"riparian land\", separated by the Pan Am railway right-of-way. The dock serving the terminal is upstream of Sea-3's land and is owned by Sprague Energy Corporation. \n\nIn 2017, Blackline acquired Sea-3 Inc. and the Newington terminal, a joint venture formed by Blackline Partners LLC and TPG Sixth Street Partners.  This acquisition allowed for further investment and modernization of the facility.  Under Blackline Partners, the terminal continued its essential role in New England's propane distribution network. Blackline Partners focused on operational safety, regulatory compliance, and maintaining the terminal\u0092s crucial role in energy distribution, especially in supporting New England\u0092s heating needs during peak winter months.\n\n1.

These agencies were involved in the development of the plan which is available to all cognizant officials in the pamphlet \"Sea-3 Emergency Procedures.\"  The sections involving facility employees were developed by Sea-3 management in conjunction with the operating staff and outside consultants.  All new employees are given initial training in health safety and emergency and operation procedures.  \n\nEmployees receive refresher training on an ongoing basis.  This training is documented in accordance with the training records requirements of OSHA's Process Safety Management program and EPA's Risk Management Program.  Sea-3 staff receive Fire School classroom and live fire training.\n\nIn addition to the Sea-3 Emergency Procedures noted above, emergency response is also covered in the \"Sea-3 US Coast Guard Operating and Emergency Procedures Manual.\"  The US Coast Guard also maintains its own written operating and emergency plan, \"Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) Contingency Plan\" issued by the USCG Marine Safety Office in Portland, Maine.\n\n6. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nThe facility has been in operation since 1975.  Safety reviews as well as compliance audits; Process Hazards Analysis, (PHA) etc., have been undertaken periodically since that time.  All issues have been addressed and many recommendations arising from these reviews have been implemented through equipment additions and/or changes as well as procedural changes.\n\nThe sea-3 facility in 2025 plans on recertifying the facility operators on the Sea-3 OPs.  The facility is also planning to conduct a Table Top exercise with the Newington, NH Fire Department. \n\n7.0 PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT (PSM)/RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN (RMP) PROGRAM ELEMENTS:\n\nThis section discusses the elements of the PSM/RMP program elements:\n\n7a. PROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION:\n\nThe Sea-3 facility maintains process safety information (PSA) including toxicity, permissible exposure limits, physical,"

Piping & Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs), design codes and standards, material balances, electrical classification and emergency relief system design are included in the facility PSI.   PSI is updated accordingly as process changes take place, equipment modifications are made or when new chemicals are introduced into the facility.  The facility is designed and operated in conformance with NFPA 58 - Standard for the Storage and Handling of Liquefied Petroleum Gases. \n\n7b. PROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS: \n\nThe most recent facility Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was completed on December 13, 2022 and included a Hazard & Operability Study (HAZOP).  The HAZOP involved participation from eight (8) of the Blackline Midstream employees and one (1) external team member who functioned as the facilitator and scribe.    There were eighty-three (83) Nodes analyzed for safety and health, environmental, community and business consequences of interest. Two-Hundred Ninety-Seven (297) scenarios and consequences were safety risk ranked.  This methodology resulted in forty-eight (48) recommendations. \n\n7c. OPERATING PROCEDURES:\n\nThe facility maintains its operating procedures (OP) and reviews the procedures on an annual basis or more often to reflect current practice.   The OPs have been developed to address safe operating limits including consequence of deviations, safety and health considerations, and safety systems.  OPs have been prepared for Initial Start-Up, Emergency Shut-down, Breaking into Lines, Control of Entry into the Facility, Lock-Out Tag-Out, Confined Space Entry, and Hot Work, etc.\n\n7d. TRAINING:\n\nThe Sea-3 facility provides employee training on its OPs, health and safety hazards, safe work practices, and on its emergency operations.   Refresher training is provided every three (3) years and when an accident or incident occurs at the facility.    Employee training programs include a combi"

Leaning is measured by utilizing quizzes, instructor participant questioning, and a demonstration of equipment competency as required.  \n\n7e. MECHANICAL INTEGRITY:\n\nThe facility mechanical integrity (MI) program focuses on the maintenance, repair and testing of facility equipment including the LPG aboveground storage tanks (ASTs), tanks offloading and loading piping systems, safety relief venting systems, pumps, compressors, and system controls.   Sea-3 maintenance employees receive training on the process and hazards associated with the work they are performing.   The MI program also involves inspection and testing of the equipment to ensure that it continues to operate in accordance with its design parameters.  Inspections and equipment testing are scheduled on a weekly and monthly basis according the established equipment PM schedule.  \n\n7f. MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE:\n\nManagement of Change (MOC) procedures are in place at the Sea-3 facility that address the technical basis for the change, the impact on employee health and safety, a description of the modifications to the OPs as required, the time frame needed to complete the changes and authorizations indicating review and approval of the subject MOC modifications.   PSI and OPs are updated and revised accordingly based on the conditions noted in the MOC.  Employees are informed when a MOC is implemented to ensure that they understand any potential safety hazards and how the changes will impact facility operations. \n\n7g. PRE-STARTUP REVIEWS:\n\nPre-startup safety reviews (PSRs) are performed at the Sea-3 facility when modifications represent significant changes to the facility operations on employee safety.   The focus of the facility pre-start up reviews are to identify, confirm and verify that the equipment satisfies the design specifications and parameters, that appropriate procedures are in"

COMPLIANCE AUDITS:\n\nThe Sea-3 facility most recent Compliance Audit (CA) was completed on October 31, 2022.  The CA reviewed all the program elements of the PSM Plan and the RMP.   The CA was conducted by one external auditor and two Blackline Partners employees including the Terminal Operations Manager, Jay Griffin and the Maintenance Manager, Paul Winkley.  The audit identified 98 findings which resulted in 41 corrective action recommendations to enhance regulatory compliance at the Sea-3, LLC Newington, NH Propane Terminal's PSM/RMP program.  \n\n7i. INCIDENT INVESTIGATIONS:\n\nTo date the Sea-3 facility has had no major incidents which required investigation.   Should an incident occur the Sea-3 facility does have an incident investigation (II) process in place that initiates an investigation promptly on or before within 48-hours, establishes a team to conduct the investigation, prepares an investigation report identifying what occurred and the root cause of the incident, identifies appropriate corrective actions, and retains the written report for documentation purposes and further reference.  \n\n7j. EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION:\n\nSea-3 employees participate in and are involved in a number of the PSM/RMP program elements including the PHA, CA, MI, OPs, II, PSRs, and Hot Work (HW).
