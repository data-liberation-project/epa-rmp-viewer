Introduction\nA Risk Management Program has been implemented at the Arm-Eck Acquisitions LLC (Armour-Eckrich), Hastings facility, for the reduction of accidental releases of hazardous materials. This Program summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to site personnel, contractors, visitors, and the community and environment at large of hazardous chemical releases. The Risk Management Plan (RMP) is organized to correspond with specific U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP, Program 3 of 40 CFR 68, definitions and requirements of Subpart G, including: \n?    Introduction;\n?    Armour-Eckrich policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\n?    Facility identification and regulated substances covered processes;\n?    Hazard Assessment;\n?

Armour-Eckrich?s Policies To Protect Health, Environment, and Safety\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at Armour-Eckrich; this RMP formalizes and documents these activities. Armour-Eckrich is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and to the environment. It is Armour-Eckrich?s policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations.\n\nThis RMP has identified potential hazards and has taken steps to design and maintain a safe facility in order to prevent releases, and minimize the consequences of accidental releases, which could occur. RMP addresses potentially catastrophic chemical releases that could result in immediate harm and acute health effects to offsite receptors (public and environmental).

Facility Identification\nThe Armour-Eckrich facility is located at 2001 Summit Avenue in Hastings, Nebraska. The facility is engaged in processing meats such as beef, pork and poultry meat patties, meatballs and bacon strips.  Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to preserve the meat products.\n\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. There is one refrigeration system onsite that is used for refrigerating meat products. The amount of ammonia currently present in the refrigeration system is approximately 68,000 pounds, which is above the minimum threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds. \n\nA topographic map identifying the site location is included as Appendix A. An area map is included as Appendix B. \n\nIV.    Hazard Assessment ?

This prevention program covers those processes that handle ammonia above the threshold quantity for both PSM and RMP rules. The last audit of the PSM program was conducted on April 5, 6 and 7, 2005 in compliance with the requirement to conduct PSM audits every three years.  The elements of the PSM / Program 3 prevention program and a brief description are listed below.\n?    Employee Participation ? Armour-Eckrich has developed a site-specific employee participation plan that ensures employees and their representatives are consulted when conducting and developing process hazard analyses and other information required to be developed under the PSM/RMP regulation.  In addition, the employee participation program ensures employees and their representatives have access to process hazard analyses and all other information required to be developed under PSM/RMP.  Employees at Armour-Eckrich have assisted in developing the initial PHA for the ammonia process and will participate in updating and revalidating the PHA every five years.  In addition, employees have assisted in the development of other PSM/RMP information such as the development of operating and preventative maintenance procedures.\n?    Process Safety Information ? Armour-Eckrich has developed a site-specific PSI program that ensures information pertaining to the hazards, technology, and equipment of the process are properly developed and maintained. Process safety information for the ammonia process has been compiled and was last reviewed and updated as of May 29, 2002.\n?    Process Hazard Review ? Armour-Eckrich has developed a site-specific PHA program that ensures a PHA is conducted initially, at a minimum of every five (5) years, and whenever a change is significant enough    to require a change in PSI.

The Standard Operating Procedures were updated on August 9, 2003. Annually, the operating procedures will be reviewed and certified as accurate.\n?    Training ? Armour-Eckrich has developed a site-specific training procedure that ensures employees operating the ammonia process have the knowledge to safely operate the process, are aware of the potential hazards of the process, and understand the causes of process problems.\n?    Management of Change ? Armour-Eckrich has developed a site-specific management of change procedure that ensures changes (except for replacement in kind) to the ammonia process, such as additions of new equipment or changes in operating, maintenance, or other procedures are documented. \n?    Pre-Startup Review ? Armour-Eckrich has developed a site-specific pre-startup safety review procedure that ensures a safety review is performed when modifications to the ammonia process are significant enough to require a change in PSI.\n?

Incident Investigation ? Armour-Eckrich has developed a site-specific incident investigation procedure that ensures each incident that either results in a release or could have resulted in a release of anhydrous ammonia is investigated, within 48 hours, by a team of at least one person knowledgeable in the process.  This procedure also makes provisions to ensure a report is prepared at the conclusion of the investigation and findings are promptly addressed. \n?    Compliance Audit ? The facility completed an original RMP on June 21, 1999 for the ammonia refrigeration system that held a charge of 55,000 pounds of ammonia. The amount of ammonia currently present in the refrigeration system is approximately 68,000 pounds. A compliance audit was conducted on April 5, 6 and 7, 2005, and the next compliance audit will be conducted by April 7, 2010.

Response activities will be coordinated with the Adams County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Hastings Fire Department (which includes a HAZMAT Team). This coordination effort includes providing the fire departments with site diagrams and hazardous material information, meeting with fire department personnel to discuss facility operations/processes, and periodic on-site inspections by fire department personnel.\n\nThe facility maintains an ERP on file at the plant. According to the ERP, facility employees are responsible for investigating and assisting the fire department (if necessary) with response to accidental releases of ammonia. The plan includes annual training of all employees on evacuation procedures and emergency notification procedures. The plan also includes annual training for emergency response team members. It identifies the Emergency Response Coordinators, Evacuation Coordinators and alternates. In addition to the facility ERP, the plant is included in a community emergency response plan developed by the Adams County Local Emergency Planning Committee. Armour-Eckrich coordinates with the Hastings Fire Department (which includes a HAZMAT) on emergency response activities. \n\nThe facility has two windsocks present onsite for use in determining wind direction in the event of an ammonia release.  One is located at the east side of the plant at the north side of the truck parking lot, and the other one is located at the southwest corner of the plant. \n\nResponders receive HAZWOPER training through classroom instruction and drills.
