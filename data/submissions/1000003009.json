Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\n\nThe management and employees of  Illini FS-retail division of GROWMARK, Inc.are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Tolono Fire Department, Douglas County Local Emergency Planning Committee or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  \n\n2.  The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility, which is located at 1004 E Co Rd 1450 N, is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The storage and handling system consists of 1 - 120,000 gallon 30- 1,000 gallon and 12-1,500, and 12- 2,000 gallon storage tanks, loading risers, associated plumbing and nurse tanks.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 900,000 pounds, this includes the amount of andydrous ammonia that could be stored in nurse tanks.\n\n3.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  Compliance with these regulations and on-going training of our employees make up our accident release prevention program.\n\n4.  Five year accident"

      "SummaryText": " history.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n-     have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\n-     to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n5.  The emergency response program.\n\nThe facility has:\n\n-     a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n-     provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving anhydrous ammonia, it is our policy to notify the Pesotum Fire Department and Douglas County LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency.  Our emergency action plans have been coordinated with both the fire department and LEPC.\n\n6.  Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no specific safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
