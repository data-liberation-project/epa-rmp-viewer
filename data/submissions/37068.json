      "SummaryText": "This Britz Fertilizers, Inc. facility located at a railroad siding near Helm, California, is a distribution site for the transfer of anhydrous ammonia to other Britz and farmer owned storage tanks.  It is not manned on a daily basis, and the ammonia rail cars are received only periodically, during ammonia fertilization seasons.\n\nThe Britz employees who work at this site are thoroughly trained in the safe handling of anhydrous ammonia with a combination of classroom and on-the-job training sessions.  These employees are also trained to respond to accidental releases by evacuating at right angles to the direction of wind and ammonia flow and then proceeding to communication sources where they can notify the company.  The company, once notified, will initiate the pre-established notification program to government agencies, if a release goes or threatens to go off-site.\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia is the only listed RMP Program material handled at this site, which exceeds the program's threshhold quantity.  There are two processes at this site which handle the ammonia:\n\n      1.  Anhydrous ammonia railroad tank car (30,000 gallons/156,000 pounds) load-out, and\n      2.  Anhydrous ammonia storage tank (18,000 gallons/78,000 pounds) load-in/storage/load-out.\n\nThe RMP Program 2 has been selected for this facility because it is a distribution site for the anhydrous ammonia as a nitrogen fertilizer for farmers who utilize it on their crops.  It does not qualify as a Program 1 due to the presence of public receptors within it's worst-case toxic end point zone.\n\nThere has been 1 accidental release and no near misses involving anhydrous ammonia at this site in the past 5 years.  During the evening of 27 September 2001, the vapor valve on a 30,000 gallon anhydrous ammonia rail car opened slightly and release ammonia vapors.  The vapors traveled downwind approximately 1/4 mile to a tomato processing plant where they were detected by workers.  The tomato processing plant notified the f"

Two Britz employees responded, and when permitted by the responding agencies, shut the valve while wearing appropriate PPE.  One Tomato plant employee reported being nauseated by the ammonia vapors. \n\nThe emergency response program for this site consists of the evacuation plan (described in paragraph 2 above), the county-wide emergency response plan with the Fresno County Fire Protection District as the designated emergency responder, and our provisions for notifying schools and government agencies in the event of a release which threatens to go off-site.\n\nThe training program for personnel who work at this site includes both initial training for new employees and refresher training for longer-term personnel.\n\nSome changes may be made in the physical processes due to the analysis of the inspections/audits performed in conjunction with the preparation of this RMP."
