This\n\ncommitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training\n\npersonnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our\n\nprocesses. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of\n\nregulated substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control\n\nand contain the release.\n\n\n\nThe Bryan Hicks gas plant, located 1 mile east of Hwy. 6 on Old Reliance Road near Bryan,\n\nTexas, produces propane from a mixed stream of natural gas liquids. The plant also treats natural\n\ngas liquids to remove CO2. Some of the chemicals produced or used include ethane, propane,\n\nbutane and diethanolamine.  The plant also stabilizes condensate trucked in from field locations.\n\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\n\n\nThere are no toxic chemicals stored at the Bryan Hicks gas plant above the EPA Threshold\n\nQuantity. The threshold quantity is the level set by EPA for each toxic or flammable chemical\n\nwhich if stored at the site requires compliance with the EPA's Risk Management Program\n\nregulations. Generally, if the amount of a substance stored on-site is less than the threshold\n\nquantity, there is little danger to the public.\n\n\n\nThere are several flammable substances stored at the site above the 10,000 pound threshold\n\nquantity for flammables. Examples of flammables at the site include ethane, propane and butane.\n\nThe worst-case scenario associated with a release of flammable materials is a vapor cloud\n\nexplosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of a 40,000 gallon storage tank containing natural\n\ngas liquids condensate. Based on EPA analysis, the distance away from the plant affected in this\n\nworst-case scenario would be approximately 0.47 miles. \n\n\n\nA more probable rele"

      "SummaryText": "ase scenario would involve the release of raw mix liquid stream (assumed to\n\nbe propane) due to a failure of the plunger packing in the pump bringing liquid to the site. Based\n\non 55 gallons/minute pump rate and 20 minutes of release (at which time the perimeter gas\n\nmonitors would stop the release), the total release would be 4653 pounds of propane. The\n\naffected distance based on EPA guidance is less than 0.17 miles, or approximately 900 feet. \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Bryan Hicks gas plant has a very active accident prevention program in place, primarily based\n\non the OSHA Process Safety Management regulations. A summary of some of the accident\n\nprevention programs that are in place follows.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Bryan Hicks gas plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain\n\nsafe operation of the processes. These documents include material safety data sheets for all\n\nchemicals on-site, up-to-date process and instrumentation drawings, equipment data sheets on all\n\nvessels and equipment and process parameter safety limits. This information, in combination with\n\nwritten procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and\n\nmaintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure\n\nthat safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nThe Bryan Hicks gas plant has a very comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated\n\nwith the various processes are identified and controlled. Each process is systematically examined\n\nto identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. The\n\nwhat-if/checklist analysis technique is used to perform these evaluations. The analyses are\n\nconducted using a team of people with operating, maintenance, engineering and safety experience.\n\nThis team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process, as well as accident p"

All approved recommendations from the\n\nPHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. \n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate\n\nsignificantly from the original design and to ensure that new technology is used where\n\nappropriate, the Bryan Hicks gas plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis\n\nresults. These periodic reviews will be conducted at least every 5 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe Bryan Hicks gas plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process\n\noperations. These procedures are used as reference by experienced operators, and provide a basis\n\nfor consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and certified\n\nas current and accurate.\n\n\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nOur employees at the Bryan Hicks plant have an average experience of 18 years.

The facility recently had a joint simulated emergency drill with the\n\nlocal emergency planning coordinator of Brazos County. Not only did we learn more about their\n\ncapability, but they became more familiar with our operations and how to respond in case of an\n\nincident.\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\n\nThe Bryan Hicks gas plant has had very safe operations over its history. However, the facility\n\ncontinually looks for improvements, both to the process and to safety issues at the facility. Our\n\ncompany is very active in promoting coordination between the local emergency response agencies\n\nand our facility personnel. Ongoing communication between our facility and the emergency\n\nresponders is an integral part of our operations."
