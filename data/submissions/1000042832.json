      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE\n\nPROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Huckabay gas plant has a long-standing commitment to employee and public safety. This\n\ncommitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training of\n\npersonnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our\n\nprocesses. Our standing practice is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable\n\nreleases of regulated flammable substances. However, if a release does occur, trained gas plant\n\npersonnel will take appropriate action to control/mitigate the release.\n\n\n\nA DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Huckabay gas plant, located in rural Erath County, Texas, operates a variety of processes\n\nto recover petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane, condensate) from field gas. \n\nThe gas plant also recovers the regulated flammables, pentane and ethane. There are no\n\nthreshold quantities of toxic substances present. As such, The Huckabay gas plant is a Program 1 RMP facility.\n\n\n\nThe Huckabay Gas Plant is one of the many facilities operated by Enbridge G&P (North Texas) L.P. Natural gas streams enter the Plant and are separated into liquid and gas. The liquid stream is routed to the oil/condensate tanks and later loaded into trucks. The natural gas stream is then sent to a glycol dehydration unit. The natural gas stream is then sent to the amine unit. Following the amine unit, the natural gas stream is then stored within one (1) 30,000-gallon pressurized tank until it is sent offsite via pipeline. \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Huckabay gas plant. \n\nBecause processes at the gas plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's\n\n(EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety\n\nand Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management"

Examples of employee participation range from updating\n\nand compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a\n\nprocess hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of\n\nthe gas plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the\n\naccident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is\n\nmaintained at the gas plant and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In\n\naddition, the gas plant has a number of initiatives in place that address process safety and\n\nemployee safety issues.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Huckabay gas plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe\n\noperation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated\n\nhazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment\n\ndesign basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the gas plant are assigned\n\nresponsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  The reference documents\n\nand their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help\n\nemployees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure\n\ntreatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is\n\nsupplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known\n\nhazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.

Within this program, each process is\n\nsystematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to\n\nmanage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe gas plant primarily uses the What If technique to perform these evaluations.
