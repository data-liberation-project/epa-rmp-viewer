Vopak USA is a member of the NACD, National Association of Chemical Distributors and follows stringent guidelines to assure that all of our products are handled in the safest manner and according to all applicable rules and regulations, to prevent any incident from occurring that would involve a release or effect the public or our valued customers.  Vopak USA Odessa, TX - facility is a distributor of products such as Formaldehyde, but we do not repackage the material.  The largest single contained vessel at our facility is a 330 gallon IBC.  These are brought in by truck and then unloaded by forklifts to a storage area and then re-shipped to our customers.  A worst-case scenario has  been conducted for Formaldehyde, to determine if there was a release, what is the worst thing that can happen, how many residents and businesses would have to be notified and evacuated, what is the furthest distance the product would affect and it takes into account the temperature differences, different types of mitigation, etc.  Then an alternative scenario was conducted.  The alternative scenario is a more realistic example of what may occur in the event of a release and takes into account the same types of information as the worst case scenario.  Hazard analysis has been conducted on handling each of the products from the point of placing the order for the product through receiving and storage of the product until shipment to the customer.  Every possible problem that may be encountered has been addressed and a Risk Reduction Alternative developed to reduce the chance of anything going wrong.  Standard Operating Procedures have been developed for the safe handling of products distributed by Vopak USA.  All employees have been trained on these procedures and have refresher training any time a procedure is revised or a change is made.  Maintenance schedules are se"

All trucks are maintained under contract maintenance and have a preventative maintenance performed every 10,000 miles as well as any needed repairs done on a regular basis.  MSDS's are maintained for every product handled by Vopak USA and are continuously updated on a regular basis when changes are made by the manufacturers.  When there is a change made, the MSDS is immediately scanned into the computer system and all customers who purchase the products are automatically faxed a copy of the updated MSDS.  Regulatory Compliance Audits are conducted on an annual basis at all facilities to ensure we are operating in accordance with all applicable rules and regulations.  If there are any findings, corrective action is initiated and the problem corrected.  Any incident that occures is documented and an incident investigation conducted.  Causes are identified and preventive measures taken to eliminate a possibility of re-occurence.  Vopak USA has an Emergency Response Plan developed and implemented at each of their facilities to assure all employees are evacuated in the event of an emergency, chain of command is initiated, proper authorities are called and appropriate actions are taken with our communities in the event of an emergency.  Vopak USA works closely with their local Fire Fighters as they are our means of Emergency Response.  The Fire Departments are invited to the facilities to overview the hazards they may encounter in the event of an emergency and a plan developed to assist us in case the need should ever arise.  In the event of a release, environmental companies are contacted which specialize in HAZMAT Response and clean-up.  Then our Chem Care division would be contacted which specializes in hazardous waste disposal.  Vopak USA is also an active participant in the local LEPC which meets on a monthly "
