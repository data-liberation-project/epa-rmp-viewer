The facility has a training program, which includes both internal and external emergency responders.\n\nThe emergency response procedures at this facility ensure emergency response coverage 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  There are also adequate provisions for coordination with outside agencies, such as the North Lawrence Fire Department, the LEPC and OPTECH Environmental Services in the event of an emergency.\n\n2.0\tProcess Description and Regulated Substance\n\nThe Kraft Foods North Lawrence facility produces blended yogurt and cottage cheese.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for the primary process at this facility is 311513 and 311514.  The facility is also capable of packaging yogurt and cottage cheese products.  Several areas of the facility are refrigerated to preserve the food products.\n\nAmmonia is the only Kraft Foods North Lawrence regulated substance under 40 CFR 68.  The ammonia is utilized as a refrigerant for the cooling of yogurt, cottage cheese and dairy ingredients and is located in various locations in the facility.\n\nKraft Foods North Lawrence exceeds the 10,000 pounds threshold according to 40 CFR 68.  The quantity of ammonia presently stored on site is approximately 18,000 pounds.\n\nAmmonia is classified as a Group 2 refrigerant per ASHRAE Standard 34-1989.  Its distinctive pungent odor is very noticeable to most people, even in small quantities.  Ammonia is flammable in a very narrow and high range of concentration with a high ignition temperature.  Ammonia is not toxic, but can be corrosive to the human tissue.  Ammonia is readily absorbed into the moisture of the skin and at high concentrations can cause burns.
