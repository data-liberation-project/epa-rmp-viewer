The facility is a 2,100-MW nominal electric generation facility with generation capacity provided by two 775-MW gas-fired boilers (Units 1 and 2, with fuel oil firing capability) and a 550-MW combined-cycle unit (Unit 4) arranged in a 2 x 2 x 1 configuration (i.e., two combustion turbines, each equipped with an unfired Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG), with the two HRSG directed to a single steam turbine).  A third gas-fired boiler (Unit 3) was retired in 2007.  Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) systems were retroactively installed on Units 1 and 2, and Unit 4 was equipped with an SCR system at start-up.  The SCRs employ aqueous ammonia injection technology to control emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx).  Aqueous ammonia is classified as a toxic chemical subject to the requirements of the RMP Program.  The aqueous ammonia used in these SCR systems is an approximately 30% solution of ammonia in water.\r\n\r\nThe aqueous ammonia storage and handling system at Cedar Bayou is comprised of storage tanks, transfer pumps, and piping which terminate at the vaporizer for each unit where the aqueous ammonia is atomized and vaporized.  The two tanks each have a capacity of 30,000 gallons, and each tank is equipped with a pressure relief valve, a vacuum breaker valve with flame arrestor, and liquid level indicators.  \r\n\r\nAll other regulated substances onsite are below applicable thresholds for RMP.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nNo accidents have occurred with respect to the aqueous ammonia storage and handling system in the past 5 years.  The SCR system on Unit 2 began service on 2/6/04 and the SCR system on Unit"

Cedar Bayou employees have been trained in this plan and would be the first responders in the event of an emergency. \r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nA hazard review of the aqueous ammonia storage and handling system at Cedar Bayou was conducted as part of this RMP.  There are no specific changes currently planned to improve safety as the safety program in place is robust and no accidents have occurred."
