The plant uses a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of employees and the public, as well as the protection of the environment.  This summary provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that the plant has designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\n* A description of the plant and the use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation;\n\n* An overview of the accidental release prevention programs;\n\n* A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule;\n\n* An overview of the emergency response program; and\n\n* An overview of improvements at the plant to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting employees, the public, and the environment.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe plant is currently shutdown for a unit conversion.  In the near future, the plant will operate two production units: 2-Ethylhexanol (2-EH) and Plasticizer (PX).   The Phthalic Anhydride (PA) Unit was permanently shutdown in July 2016.  The PA Unit did not utilize threshold quantities of any substance on the EPA's List of Regulated Substances.  \n\n\n\nThe 2-Ethylhexanol (2-EH) Unit will startup in 2017.  In the past, this unit produced 2-Propylheptanol (2-PH) and contained a threshold quantity of Raffinate (a Flammable Mixture) as a feedstock which contained 1-butene, isobutene, butane, isobutene, cis-2-butene, trans-2-butene and butadiene.  The Raffinate has been cleared from the process equipment in anticipation of the unit conversion.  The 2-EH Unit will use propylene as a feedstock and produce propane as a byproduct.  Additionally, the 2-EH Unit will use anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in a chil"

The PX Unit does not utilize threshold quantities of any substance on the EPA's List of Regulated Substances.  \n\n\n\nThe plant is located in Harris County adjacent to Route 225 on the Houston Ship Channel.\n\n\n\nThe 2-EH Unit will utilize substances that are on the EPA's List of Regulated Substances.

This standard is a fully comprehensive prevention program designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  The plant takes a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals through the requirements of OSHA's PSM Standard.

The plant program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, the plant coordinates the plan with the Houston area Channel Industries Mutual Aid Organization (CIMA) and the local community emergency response plans.\n\n\n\nRECENT CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nSince 1999, the plant has implemented several projects to improve the fire protection systems, including repairing and upgrading fireproofing, and replacing underground firewater pipelines.  The plant purchased a \"Quick-Attack Fire Truck\" and an \"Emergency-Response Trailer\" to add capability to the already existing fire truck and emergency response equipment.  Pipeline isolation valves were installed to the feedstock pipeline as part of the past project to convert the 2-EH Unit to 2-PH.  More recently, in 2013, the Confined Sp"
