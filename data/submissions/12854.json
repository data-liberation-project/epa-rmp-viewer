The ton containers are received and kept in a separate room with proper handling and storage and feed equipment with a maximum of 4,000 pounds and average of 2,000 pounds in storage.\n\nThe storage room is a 15' x 15' steel reinforced enclosure with two outward opening doors.  A chlorine monitor can detect low levels of chlorine and activate an alarm and an exhaust fan located at floor level.  This is tested at least once per week.  The containers are moved on to container cradles by use of a mon orail with a  lifting beam.\n\nThe water treatment plant is manned by at least one person, twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.  In the event of a chlorine leak, this person has been instructed to first determine the extent of the leak and if more than one helper is needed, to call the Marion Fire Deptartment (also manned twenty-four hours a day) for assistance.\n\nEach operator on duty has been instructed on safety procedures and hazards associated with chlorine handling and emergency response.  Within the past two years we have received instruction from the Marion Fire Department on the used of self-contained breathing apparatis and protective clothing needed to go into a chlorine filled environment.  All personnel have access to "

In addition, the city has a safety director who regularly has had safety and first-aid training at the job site during working hours.\n\nIn a worst case release, the Marion Fire Department would be the first agency to respond for leak repair or containment and evacuation of the affected area.  The Marion Fire Department would have assistance with evacuation from the Marion Police Department and Williamson County Emergency Management Agency.(LEPC)  \n\nWater plant and fire department personnel have been instructed on using the ton container repair kit \"B\" which is designed to contain most leaks encountered with containers.  To minimize risk from late night/early morning leaks, container changing is only done from 7:00 a.m. - 2:00 p.m., Monday-Friday by the plant superintendant and assistant.\n\nThe chlorine leak detector and feed equipment were both updated and installed in December 1998 and January 1999 respectively, and are serviced and calibrated on a yearly scheduled basis by a Honeywell Company service technician.\n\nThe chlorine feed system consists of a chlorinator directly mounted to the ton container and uses a single pressurized connection to minimize leaks.  Its all-vacuum operation causes  air to enter the system, in case a malfunction occurs. This prevents gas from escaping.  The system shuts down automatically if the operating vacuum is lost or the water supply to the ejector is interrupted.  The feed system is operated manually so the operator is at the chlorinator when it is turned on and can determine a feed or leak problem immediately upon start-up.\n\nWe have had no accidental releases of chlorine in the past five years.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety include more frequent training of both on-site and fire department personnel.
