In this way we promote overall plant, employee and public safety.\n\n\n\nThese programs help this facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these programs help prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.  Our safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities. This facility has one refrigeration system using Anhydrous Ammonia as the refrigerant. The amount of Anhydrous Ammonia contained in this system is above the EPA threshold reporting quantity required to comply with the RMP standards.  \n\n\n\nAmericold is committed to the safety of its employees and the surrounding community. This commitment includes both human health and the protection of the environment.  Safety is ensured through careful preventative measures and emergency planning. The intent of our release prevention policy is to minimize all potential risks that could possibly lead to an accidental ammonia release. This program focuses primarily on the safe operation and the mechanical integrity of the process equipment. Our safety programs help to prevent accidents because they focus on rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities or pieces of equipment. These rules are reviewed and improved as necessary. They are also commu"

Our emergency response program provides the following response actions for employees: what to do if an ammonia smell is detected, proper evacuation procedures and meeting locations.  The Americold - Chambersburg, PA facility conducts a Fire/Ammonia Leak drill annually to ensure procedures are being followed and are effective.\n\n\n\nThis facility has NOT experienced a recordable Ammonia release in the past five years. \n\n\n\nThis facility is in the process of implementing Ammonia Process Safety Management Inc. (APSM), a powerful online tool to enable comprehensive and companywide standardization of PSM and RMP compliance related elements. Americold and this facility will continue to use this system to manage its compliance programs in an easily accessible online format that is also consistent, efficient, and provides effective control from the top down to enhance collaboration, efficiency, reporting and accuracy."
