      "SummaryText": "JASPER WATER TREATMENT PLANT\nRMP EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nFacility Description\n\nThe Jasper Water Treatment Plant (WTP) treats water from the Mulberry Fork of the Warrior River to provide drinking water for the city of Jasper, Alabama and surrounding areas. The plant's capacity is 18 million gallons of water per day.  On a normal day it treats about 10 million gallons of water. The final treatment operation in the plant involves injection of chlorine into the treated water to kill any pathogens present and to provide residual amount of chlorine that will kill any pathogens that may be present in the water distribution system.\n\nChlorine used for this disinfection is stored as a liquid under pressure in one-ton cylinders. The cylinders are stored in a concrete, cinder block, and steel room within the water treatment building. When connected to the process, chlorine is withdrawn from a cylinder using a slight vacuum, and it is immediately dissolved into a slipstream of the treated water. This chlorine water is then mixed with the entire plant water flow to achieve the desired residual concentration. The WTP may have as many as eight one-ton cylinders of chlorine on site at any one time.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Jasper Waterworks and Sewer Board (JWWSB) is committed to completely preventing harmful releases of chlorine from the WTP.  This commitment is demonstrated by the level of regular training provided to water plant operators and by the routine contract maintenance of all elements of the chlorine gas system.\n\nThe JWWSB is also committed to incorporating industry standard good practice into its emergency response practices for the WTP.  The model being used for the update is an industry standard prepared by the Chlorine Institute. When fully implemented, the program will provide the best practical measures to protect the community from large-scale releases.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe first element of the accidenta"

Chlorine Institute standards and good engineering practice were used in these designs.\n\nAnother important element of the plant's accidental release prevention program is maintenance of gas systems. Silver Sales, which is a regional supplier of operating and maintenance services for gas storage and injection equipment, currently provides yearly review of the gas systems.\n\nSilver Sales personnel test the critical components and maintain all the equipment in good working condition. The plant, through Silver Sales, currently replaces all the gaseous tubing in the system yearly and replaces the rigid gas piping every three years. Silver Sales also keeps plant personnel updated on newer technologies and equipment being used for the type of gas systems in the WTP. Dixie Crane inspects the hoists used to lift gas cylinders from the delivery truck and move them into storage positions in the chemical feed building. This inspection is done yearly. If any deficiencies or concerns are noted during the inspection, they are immediately addressed.\n\nTraining is the third major element in the plant's release prevention program. Only trained personnel are allowed to perform any activity related to use of chlorine including unloading gas cylinders, connecting cylinders to the process, operating the gas injection processes, or disconnecting empty cylinders for the process. Harcross Chemicals Incorporated, which is the WTP's supplier of chlorine, provides this training every two to three years. Training consists of eight hours of classroom lecture and hands-on demonstration.\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nThe WTP has experienced no harmful accidental releases of chlorine in the five year prior to this update.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe WTP emergency response plan consists of evacuation of the facility and immediate notification of the Walker County Emergency Management Agency (EMA).
