Truck Terminal facility, we handle propane, which is considered a hazardous flammable gas by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The same properties that makes propane valuable as a fuel also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling propane to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends on the manner in which we handle propane combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\nWe at Martin Gas Sales, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with Mutual Aid Mont Belvieu which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release. \n\nFacility description and regulated substances handled \n\nOur Martin Gas Sales, Inc. Mont Belvieu Truck Terminal facility is a propane storage and distribution facility.  The primary purpose is to distribute propane to both residential and industrial customers.  Propane is used by our customers as a fuel.  Propane is received by via truck transport or pipeline and stored in eleven 30,000-gallon "

The pipeline runs between the Truck Terminal facility and a Diamond Shamrock gas processing facility.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, and authorized contractors. \n\nThe regulated substance handled at our Truck Terminal facility is propane.  The maximum quantity of propane that can be stored at this facility is 1,100,000 pounds in eleven 30,000-gallon storage tanks. \n The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nThe EPA defines worst-case release scenario as the failure of our largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed.  The entire contents of the tank are assumed to release as a vapor cloud, which finds an ignition source.  Ten percent of the released quantity is assumed to participate in the resulting explosion.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario as defined by the EPA is highly unlikely to occur.  During the evaluation, the scenario assumes none of the facility's mechanical controls or safety systems are operational, assumes no emergency response efforts take place, and assumes it occurs under the worst weather conditions.  \n\nMartin Gas Sales, Inc. has incorporated a company policy that limits the maximum filling capacity of all propane storage tanks to 80% at 60:F.  Therefore, our worst-case release scenario would result in a release of 100,000 pounds of propane from a 30,000-gallon storage tank.\n\nTo evaluate the worst-case release scenario, we have utilized RMP*Comp, the EPA recommended software.  Based on 100,000 pounds of propane released, the distance the affects of a vapor cloud explosion is expected to have no serious harm to the general public is 0.4-mile from the location of the storage tank.\n\nThe EPA states an al"

Active and passive mitigation systems may be considered for the alternate release scenario.\n\nThe alternative release scenario deemed most likely to occur is a the failure of a flexible transfer hose.  The transfer hose connects to iron piping.  Excess flow valves at the storage tank and truck transport function to stop the flow of propane out of the storage tank and truck transport.  Therefore, the propane released would be limited to 470 pounds of propane, the amount in the transfer hose and iron piping.\n\nIn this alternative release scenario, the entire contents of the transfer hose and piping would be released before facility personnel could implement actions to stop the release.  RMP*Comp estimates the distance endpoint for the release of 470 pounds of propane to no longer pose a hazard to the public as 0.04 mile.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps\n\nOur Truck Terminal facility complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)'s Process Safety Management (PSM) rule,  EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  Our facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\n    Training\nMartin Gas Sales, Inc. has a comprehensive training program to ensure employees are competent in the operations and procedures associated with the propane process. \n\n    Mechanical Integrity\nThe Truck Terminal facility carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.
