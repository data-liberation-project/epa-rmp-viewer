      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAndrew and William McFadin were the first to carve homesteads in the Posey County wilderness\nin 1805.  Travelers on the Ohio were glad to see the homesteads and were attracted to the bluffs \"landing\".  In 1806, the struggling community was named McFadins Bluff. In 1816 a group of men gathered at the cabin of Andrew McFadin and renamed the now thriving community, \"Mt. Vernon\";  in honor of George Washington and his plantation on the Potomac River. Indiana was also admitted to statehood in 1816. As the community continued to grow and expand, a Water Treatment plant was constructed in 1886 on the high bluff overlooking the beautiful Ohio River.  The plant remains, today, in its original location.\n\nTHE PROCESS\n\nThe City of  Mt. Vernon Water Department accidental release prevention policy involves a  unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices. All applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are followed.  The Water Department emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans that are tailored to the facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPAs Emergency Response Program  requirements.\n\nThe Mt. Vernon Water Treatment Plant Chlorination Station has been installed to disinfect the flow in  the Mt. Vernon Trunk Lines. This water serves Mt. Vernon  and rural areas within 3 miles of the city.  The chlorination station is located on College Avenue and Water Streets.  The station includes a totally enclosed chlorination room, which contains liquid chlorine containers, a chlorinator, and various safety equipment; and an instrument room, which contains a flow recorder, various electrical panels, and additional safety equipment. The chlorine is used and dispensed from two one-ton containers. The facility is normally unmanned. Water treatment operators visit the facility each"

The facility is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management regulation because Indiana is a \"Program State\".\n\nSCENARIOS\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified as \"worst case scenario\" and \"alternative case scenario\". The worst case scenario (WCS) as defined by EPA; which states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the ... maximum quantity in the largest vessel ... is released as a gas over 10 minutes,\" due to an unspecified failure. The alternative case scenario (ACS) is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario\".  Atmospheric dispersion modeling has been performed to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint for each scenario.  The toxic endpoint used is specified by EPA at  3 ppm, which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2) or (.0087 mg/liter). This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the \"maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action\".\n\nAdditionally, because the chlorine cylinders are unloaded, stored, and dispensed  inside a fully enclosed block building; a credit of 55% of the total amount released has been incorporated.  The resultant releases were plotted using NOAAs ALOHA toxic modeling program.\n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO\n\nThe contents of one, one-ton cylinder (2000#) was considered released over  a 10 minute period due to catastrophic cylinder failure of unknown consequence.  This would create a release rate of 200# per minute.  Taking a credit (55%) for passive mitigation of the block building; the actual release rate plotted would hence be 110# per minute.  Using this information and the prescribed atmospheric c"

Actuation of the chlorine detector is an active mitigation measure considered, and even though in this worst case scenario it would not minimize the release size; it would allow for the Water Treatment plant operators to begin emergency response and notification measures at an earlier time; thus minimizing the risk to the public.  \n\nIt should be noted that it would be extremely difficult to have a release comparable to this worse case scenario because of all the safeguards in place.  About the only two ways a release of this magnitude could occur would be if the safety release plug on the cylinder were to fail, or if the cylinder itself, were to fail.\n\nALTERNATIVE CASE  SCENARIO\n\nA rupture of a  =\"  flexible plastic solution line feeding chlorine from the cylinder to the chlorinator was considered.  The flow through this line is regulated at 200# per 24 hour period; or .139# per minute.  Taking into consideration the passive mitigation of the block building; the actual release rate plotted would hence be .076# per minute.  Using this information and the prescribed atmospheric conditions of 3.0 meters per second wind speed at stability class D, and plotting for a release that continues for 60 minutes; the distance to the toxic endpoint is 53 yards.  Actuation of the chlorine detector is an active mitigation measure, and even though it was not considered in this scenario; it would definitely  minimize the released amount since it would allow for executing the Emergency Response and notification plans at an earlier time; resulting in action being taken to stop the release within the first 60 minutes.\n\nACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of chlorine at this facility in the past five years.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nFourteen changes to improve safety (recommended actions) were identified in February 1999 \nduring a HAZOP con"
