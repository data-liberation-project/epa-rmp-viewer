The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes or emergency response procedures.\r\nThe overall emergency response program for the Facility is coordinated with the Will County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which involves local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. The Facility has the capability of communicating with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire departments, industrial neighbors, and mutual aid with industry) around-the-clock. This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Facility conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and local emergency response organizations. Additionally, the Facility provides occasional refresher training to local emergency responders\r\n\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nThe Facility resolves all findings from HAZOP studies, some of which result in modifications to the process.  The resolutions and resulting changes are tracked internally to ensure completion.

Examples of employee participation range from compiling and updating technical information to participating as a member of a team that systematically analyzes new and modified processes for hazards. Teams that represent a cross-section of levels and areas of the facility are formed to revise and update safety standards and to investigate accidents and issue reports to appropriate personnel. Safety focus teams in each area promote individual responsibility for safe work behaviors. Some individual employee responsibilities include writing operating procedures and Job Safety Analysis (JSA) plans, serving as compliance auditors for the facility, and serving as members of the facility's Fire and Emergency Response Team. \r\n\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information: \r\n\r\nDocuments are maintained describing process safety information for the MAN process. These documents describe chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Chemical specific information, including exposure hazards and treatments, and emergency response considerations are provided in safety data sheets. The process operators use a computerized control system to assist them in managing the MAN process within the design ranges. \r\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical ratings of equipment, piping and instrument drawings, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are properly maintained. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis:"

      "SummaryText": ". \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \r\n\r\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the policies established by FHR. These policies include: \r\n\r\n\u00bf Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations. \r\n\u00bf Operating and maintaining the assets such that unintentional releases are minimized. \r\n\u00bf Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible. \r\n\u00bf Correcting findings identified in regular audits of the facility. \r\n\r\nINEOS is committed to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of its processes. The Joliet facility adheres to process safety policies, guidelines, and best practices that have been developed based on company and industry experience over the years. INEOS's practice is to implement the controls necessary to prevent releases of regulated substances to the environment. However, if a release does occur, trained INEOS personnel will respond to control and contain the incident. \r\n\r\nPrevention Program \r\n\r\nThe INEOS Joliet Chemical Plant MAN process is operating under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program. Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and an emphasis on safety have contributed to process safety at the facility. The prevention program has identified hazards and taken steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases. The executive summary details the management system in place to implement this prevention program. \r\n\r\nThe facility has had no RMP chemical release accidents over the last 5 years. \r\n\r\nEmployee Participation: \r\n\r\nEmployees are encourage"

      "SummaryText": "INEOS Joliet, LLC - Joliet Facility\r\nEPA Risk Management Plan (RMP)\r\nExecutive Summary\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction and Policies \r\n\r\nThe INOES Joliet, LLC- Joliet Facility is located at 23425 West Amoco Road in Channahon, Illinois. The Joliet facility was purchased from Flint Hills Resources LLC on November 30, 2018. \r\n\r\nINEOS is committed to managing all operations in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of employees, customers, contractors, and the public while fully complying with applicable laws and regulations. INEOS's management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of its Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event of an accidental release, the five-year accident history of the facility, and planned changes to improve safety at the plant. \r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances \r\n\r\nThe Joliet facility, operated by INEOS, is an intermediate chemicals facility located in Channahon, Illinois. The facility processes various chemicals that serve as intermediate materials to produce polyester fibers, fiberglass gasoline tanks, paints, wire coatings, plastics, insecticides, and food additives. As part of its Maleic Anhydride unit (MAN Process), the facility uses n-Butane, an EPA RMP-covered chemical, in quantities greater than the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs. The n-Butane Sphere contains an inventory of 3,446,200 lbs. of n-Butane, with another 4,200 lbs present in the n-Butane Vaporizer at any given time. \r\n\r\nThe facility is subject to the OSHA process safety management standard, 29 CFR 1910.119, and regulated under EPA Risk Management Program 40 CFR Part 68 Program Level 3 requirements"
