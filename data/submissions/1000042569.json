(Grace) Super High Activity Catalyst (SHAC) Plant in Norco, LA is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training.  It is company and site policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such an unforeseeable release does occur, the site has HazWoper trained individuals on site to control and mitigate the effects of releases.   Furthermore, the SHAC Plant is located inside of the Momentive Chemical Site Facility, on land owned by Shell Chemical LP.  Emergency response services for the manufacturing complex, including the SHAC Plant is provided by  Shell.\r\n\r\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nGrace purchased the Norco SHAC Plant from the Dow Chemical Company in December 2013. The facility's primary activity is catalyst manufacturing. The facility annually produces more than 800,000 pounds of catalyst. The material produced at this facility is sold to customers in the United States and abroad. The catalyst is used by our customers primarily in the manufacturing of polypropylene resin. The site has one RMP-regulated toxic substance - titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) and one RMP-regulated flammable substance - isopentane.  The maximum inventory present at our facility is 700,000 pounds of TiCl4 and 250,000 pounds of isopentane. Both substances are located within the manufacturing process area and contained in tankage.\r\n\r\n3.

The facility is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard ( 29 CFR 1910.119). The facility is also subject to the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) Section 302 notification requirements. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at the SHAC Plant.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nGrace's SHAC Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, process technology, and equipment information. This information is documented, maintained up to date, and available for operating personnel associated with the facility.  \r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nProcess Hazard Analyses are conducted or revalidated at least every five years to identify major process hazard scenarios and to recommend corrective actions needed to prevent their occurrence.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nGrace's SHAC Plant maintains written operating procedures for the purposes of safely conducting activities within the covered processes. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nGrace's SHAC Plant has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Refresher training is provided at least every three years.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nGr"

Emergency response for the manufacturing complex, including the SHAC Plant, is provided by Shell.  The Shell Chemical Plant maintains a trained emergency squad to handle fires, explosions, toxic vapor and releases, spills, and medical emergencies. The plant squad trains and drills with local emergency responders to enhance their skills and tactics for responding to an accidental chemical release. Critiques are held on drills and actual events. In addition to the plant emergency squad, St. Charles Parish Emergency Operations Center (EOC) is notified immediately when an incident occurs. The EOC determines the community impact and takes the appropriate action to protect the community. Additional resources are also available through mutual aid organizations if needed.\r\n\r\nThe emergency response program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations. Detailed emergency response plans are developed and coordinated with the St. Charles Parish EOC and the community.\r\n\r\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nOn-going programs, such as process hazard analysis reevaluations, continually aim to improve process safety.
