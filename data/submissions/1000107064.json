Several safety features are utilized in the covered processes including:\n\na)\tRelease detection-Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms, Release containment/control;\nb)\tProcess relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases;\nc)\tValves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated);\nd)\tAutomated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high pressure and temperature); and\ne)\tRelease mitigation: Fire suppression and extinguishing systems. Our employees are trained to fight small fires or initiate an ESD only.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Norse plant has experienced one reportable accident in the past 5 years.\n\nKinder Morgan's approach is to investigate incidents or events that could have reasonably resulted in an uncontrolled release of hazardous substances, to determine ways to prevent these events from recurring.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThis facility maintains a written emergency plan, which is in place to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment. The Emergency Plan is provided to assist personnel who react to and respond to plant emergencies. It contains information relating to recognition and reporting of emergencies, minimizing hazards, and actions that must be taken to protect personnel, property and gas service. The objective of the Emergency Plan is to assure that personnel who could be involved in an emergency are adequately trained to recognize and deal with emergency situations in an expeditious and safe manner.\n\nFacility personnel are trained to take defensive or incipient firefighting actions. Local fire departments will be responsible for extinguishing fires that have gone beyond the incipient stage. Therefore, this plan is limited to providing guidance for our employees to evacu"

INCIDENT INVESTIGATION\n\nIncidents are promptly investigated that result in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, flammable gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to gas plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. The final resolution if each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHA revalidations.\n\n12. COMPLIANCE AUDITS\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, this facility periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every three (3) years. Both Operations and Corporate staff personnel may participate as audit team members. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to gas plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at this facility have hazards that must be"

Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment. Another integral part of the MI program is quality assurance. Quality assurance measures are incorporated into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\n9. SAFE WORK PRACTICES\n\nThis facility has safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include; control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.\n\n10.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. The Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP) analysis technique is the primary tool used to perform these evaluations. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience, as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. The PHA team findings are forwarded to local and company corporate management for resolution. To help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results at least once every 5 years.\n\n4. OPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nThis facility maintains written operating procedures that address various modes of process operations. These procedures are used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. These procedures provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit deviations for specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n5.

As part of this commitment we have established a system to promote the safe operation at this facility. One component of this system is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at this facility and complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).\n\nThe RMP at this facility consists of three (3) elements:\n\n1. A hazard assessment to help understand: \nThe potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases; and \nAccidents that have occurred during the last 5 years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances).\n\n2. A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes).\n\n3. An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes.\n\nThis facility has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards or controls against release of a hazardous substance and injuries and damage to its employees, the public and the environment. We limit the use of hazardous substances. Before using a hazardous substance, less hazardous alternatives are considered. When a hazardous substance is used, consideration is given to the potential for this substance to adversely affect our workers, the public and the environment, and we take steps to prevent any such effects.\n\nThe safety program consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule.
