      "SummaryText": "The Burris Refrigerated Logistics facility in Orlando, Florida provides logistics services for customers, including storage and distribution of packaged perishable goods, throughout the East Coast of the USA.  We are proud of our safety record and take stringent precautions to ensure that our operations are designed and activities are performed so we minimize hazards and control risks in our workplace.\n\nTo prevent damage to materials being stored, we need to maintain appropriate temperatures in parts of our facility and operate a refrigeration system to accomplish this.  The system we operate is a commonly used, standard refrigeration system, using anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant.  This refrigerant is regulated (under 40CFR part 68) and we recognize that a release of this substance could present a hazard to the public and environment near our facility.  Therefore, we follow special practices for controlling hazards and managing risks within this process to ensure such a release does not occur. \n\nOur approach for controlling potential risks from a release of ammonia includes:\n- Following recognized good engineering practices in the design, installation and operation of refrigeration equipment and ensuring this equipment meets all applicable codes and standards.\n- Continually assessing hazards so we can minimize risks in our processes.\n- Using release prevention practices that have been recognized as effective by federal and sate experts\n- Maintaining contingency plans for responding to any emergency that may occur and coordinating these plans with local response agencies.\n\nIn assessing the hazards of our refrigeration process, we use EPA-approved methods to determine that the worst-case release would be represented by a release of approximately 9,000 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia from the Receiver located inside our buildings.  Although very unlikely to occur, we have determined, using techniques and parameters specified by EPA, that such a release could affect a port"

      "SummaryText": "ion of a circular area of 1.5 miles surrounding our site.  This area includes residences, schools, and neighboring commercial and industrial sites and a total population of 40 people (1990 US Census).  There would be no environmental impacts from such a release.  This distance is reduced to about 0.6 mile, and a population of 10 people would be affected, in the unlikely event that a release occurred, despite our prevention practices, under actual operating conditions.\n\nOur release prevention program focuses on preventing hazardous releases of anhydrous ammonia.  We use equipment and follow management practices that are consistent with recognized good engineering practices and meet OSHA regulations, ASME and ASTM specifications and other national standards.  The Refrigeration Process we used is a completely closed system so an escape of ammonia is very unlikely.  If such a release were to occur, however, monitoring devices would immediately alert us so that quick action can be taken to minimize the impact.  These and other activities are part of our Emergency Contingency Plan that is coordinated with the Orange County LEPC.\n\nIt is our policy to continually seek new and better ways to operate and continually improve the safety of our operations and our Orlando facility has been designed to include the latest in our safety and environmental protection advancements.  Following startup in August 2001, we will be closely monitoring all operations to identify ways to continue to improve and maintain our leadership in environmental, health and safety practices."
