Executive Summay, Durham, NC\n\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Brenntag Southeast are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental  release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the  processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\t\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Chemical distribution.  We have 5 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Hydrogen \tFluoride(Hydrofluoric Acid], Ammonia (aqueous), Formaldehyde (solution), Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous).  Ammonia (aqueous),and Formaldehyde  (solution) are repackaged and stored for distribution.  Hydrogen Fluoride (Hydrofluoric Acid), Chlorine, and Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous) are only stored for  distribution.                              \n\u00a0\nThe maximum inventory of Hydrogen Fluoride (Hydrofluoric Acid) at our facility is 33,264.00 lbs. while Ammonia (aqueous), Formaldehyde (solution), Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous) are present at our facility in Maximum quantities of 24915.62 lbs.,24776.31 lbs.,18750.00 lbs. and 10350.00 lbs. respectively.\n\u00a0\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for  each reported scenario. To perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations and the EPA's RMP*Comp(TM).

The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  The released quantity has been limited by a system of administrative controls.  Passive mitigation systems such as dike(s) are also taken into account to calculate the scenario.  These mitigation systems have the effect of limiting the spread of product.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance of 0.8 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe alternative release scenario for Chlorine involves a release from Chlorine storage.  The scenario involves the release of a 150 lb cylinder.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 1 minute.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L  is 0.2 miles.\n\u00a0\nThe alternative release scenario for Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous) involves a release from Sulfur Dioxide storage.
