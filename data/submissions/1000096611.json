It is Automated Solutions, LLC's (AS's) policy to adhere to all applicable federal,\n\nstate, and local laws. If an emergency were to occur, AS's policy is to notify the City of Lenoir\n\nFire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\n\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled: This facility manufactures\n\npolyethylene (PE) foam. Isobutane is used in PE foam manufacturing. The regulated process\n\nconsists of one 12,000-gallon isobutane storage tank and associated PE foam manufacturing\n\nequipment.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case and alternative release scenarios: AS's worst-case scenario is failure of a full\n\n12,000-gallon storage tank resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. The resulting distance to the\n\nendpoint extends offsite and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint. AS's\n\nalternative release scenario is a break in a 2-inch diameter pipe handling the vapor phase leading\n\nto a 60-minute release and vapor cloud explosion. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends\n\noffsite and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint. No administrative controls\n\nand mitigation measures where used to limit the impacts of the reported scenarios.\n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule, the Occupational Safety and Health\n\nAdministration's Process Safety Management standard, and all applicable state and local codes\n\nand regulations. The isobutane system is designed, installed and maintained in accordance with\n\nNFPA-58 and state law.\n\n\n\nFive-year accident history: AS has never had an accident involving isobutane that caused\n\ndeaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterin"
