The Mama Rosas facility has a thorough emergency training program for on-site emergency responders.  The facility has implemented Mama Rosas HAZWOPER plan (emergency response program) which is a plan designed for the safety of its employees, the community and the environment.  This detailed emergency response program includes procedures for handling an emergency - the established action plan and appropriate personnel involved in containing a hazardous release (HAZMAT team).  As part of this emergency response program, Mama Rosas emphasizes a thorough training program and medical surveillance of the HAZMAT team prior to and after an incident.  With the potential dangers associated with a hazardous chemical release, Mama Rosas has researched and developed safe containment and disposal procedures as well as an evaluation procedure following an emergency response.  All of these components make the Mama Rosas HAZWOPER plan a thorough and comprehensive plan for release prevention and emergency response.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response policies at the Mama Rosas facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage 24 hours - 7 days per week.  There are also provisions for coordination with outside agencies such as the Sidney Fire Department in the event of an emergency.\n\n\n\n*From this point in the Executive Summary, anhydrous ammonia will be synonymous with ammonia.\n\n\n\n2.0    PROCESS DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nMama Rosas is a producer of prepared frozen pizzas.  The NAICS code for this process at this facility is 311412. Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to preserve the food products. \n\n\n\nMama Rosas has one regulated substance under 40 CFR 68: ammonia.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the refrigeration of the foods in the various areas of the plant.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia threshold for triggering appli"

      "SummaryText": "cability to 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds. The Sidney plant has two ammonia refrigeration processes for the preservation of the food products.  Ammonia System #1 has approximately 12,000 pounds of ammonia in the process. Ammonia System #2 has approximately 24,900 pounds of ammonia in the process. The total ammonia inventory is approximately 36,900 pounds of ammonia.\n\n \n\n3.0    WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration systems have associated hazards that can potentially affect on-site employees and the general public off-site if there is a release from the system.  Described below are the associated hazards for the regulated chemical.  Though there are other scenarios possible, EPA only requires that one worst-case and one alternative scenario be reported for each process.  See supporting letter the details the worst and alternate case release scenarios.\n\n\n\nA Worst ad Alternate Case Scenario were calculated for this Risk Management Plan. A Worst Case Scenario was used with a liquid release totaling roughly 12200 pounds over ten minutes with a release radius of 1.4 mile.  An Alternate Case Scenario was used with a liquid release totaling roughly 11,200 pounds over ten minutes with a release radius of 0.30 mile.\n\n\n\n4.0    GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nMama Rosas has developed an OSHA PSM program for their ammonia refrigeration systems. At Mama Rosas, ammonia falls under the RMP Program 3 prevention program which is identical to the OSHA PSM program.  EPA has said that if the process is in compliance with OSHA PSM, then it is compliance with RMP Program 3.  Thus, Mama Rosas ammonia PSM has been reviewed and determined to be complete for the RMP document.  \n\n\n\nThere are several aspects of the ammonia prevention program that are key:\n\n\n\n1.    The ammonia PSM program at Mama Rosas includes provisions for employee involvement, procedures for working with contractors, pre-startup safety reviews an"

The different sections of the PSM document detail employee participation (hazard analysis team), process safety information, process hazard analysis (PHA - what-if/checklist), operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity, hot work permits, management of change, incident investigation, compliance audits and emergency planning and response (HAZWOPER plan).  The plant, therefore, maintains good training, certification, and employee awareness of operating procedures.\n\n\n\n2.    Mama Rosas has researched information pertaining to the properties and hazards of ammonia, sought professional assistance from experts in the ammonia refrigeration industry, and used many internal resources to develop the Block flow diagrams and P&IDs have been developed and are updated as the ammonia refrigeration system audits are completed.\n\n\n\n3.    Mama Rosas has established a hazards analysis team (comprising of plant employees) responsible for updating existing operating procedures for the refrigeration system and also verifying and documenting the mechanical integrity of the system.\n\n\n\n4.    In the event of a catastrophic release or an incident which could have resulted in a catastrophe, investigations will be undertaken (this is a policy of the PSM document).  Necessary preventative measures will be taken to reduce the risk of incident reoccurrence.\n\n\n\n5.0    FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere was a small leak on September 11th, 2019.  The leak was isolated in 15 seconds with only ? pound of ammonia being released.  The ammonia vapor was pulled into a nearby ventilator and ammonia vapor was blown down into a production area where personnel were working. Employees and contractors were evacuated with 5 employees needing EMS attention.  No one offsite was impacted during the September 2019 release.\n\n\n\n6.0    EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nAs mentioned previously, the Mama Rosas facility has developed an OSHA hazardous substance emergency response program called HA"

The HAZWOPER document contains detailed procedures for: 1) pre-emergency planning and coordination; 2) personnel roles and lines of authority; 3) training; 4) communication; 5) emergency recognition and prevention; 6) safe distances and places of refuge; 7) site security and control; 8) emergency alerting and response; 9) ammonia decontamination; 10) emergency medical treatment and first aid; 11) critique of response and follow-up; 12) personal protective and emergency equipment; and 13) medical surveillance.\n\n\n\nMama Rosas emergency response plan (HAZWOPER) is a detailed document which discusses the role of employees and management in an emergency situation.  All emergency response personnel undergo training and records of this training are maintained and updated on site.  The plan outlines specific procedures for evacuations, incident alarms and alerting.  Depending upon a given situation, the Fire Department will be called to provide back-up emergency responders and equipment.   The Fire Department will be called for all fire related emergencies.  The incident commander has ultimate control of implementation of the emergency response plan.\n\n\n\n7.0    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nBased on the completed Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for ammonia, a list of action items were developed and their status monitored to ensure that implementation was accomplished. Mama Rosas is committed to continuous improvement of our policies, procedures, and facility. It is the intention of Mama Rosas to remain an industry leader. New technology, training techniques, and equipment are continuously being added to our system.\n\n"
