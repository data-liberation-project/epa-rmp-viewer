All emergency response personnel undergo training and records of this training are maintained and updated on site.  The plan outlines specific procedures for evacuations, incident alarms and alerting.  Depending upon a given situation, the Fire Department will be called to provide back-up emergency responders and equipment.   The Fire Department will be called for all fire related emergencies.  The incident commander has ultimate control of implementation of the emergency response plan.\r\n\r\n7.0\tPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nBased on the completed Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for ammonia, a list of action items were developed and their status monitored to ensure that implementation was accomplished.

Ammonia System #1 has approximately 12,000 pounds of ammonia in the process. Ammonia System #2 has approximately 24,900 pounds of ammonia in the process. The total ammonia inventory is approximately 36,900 pounds of ammonia.\r\n \r\n3.0\tWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration systems have associated hazards that can potentially affect on-site employees and the general public off-site if there is a release from the system.  Described below are the associated hazards for the regulated chemical.  Though there are other scenarios possible, EPA only requires that one worst-case and one alternative scenario be reported for each process.  See supporting letter the details the worst and alternate case release scenarios.\r\n\r\nA Worst ad Alternate Case Scenario were calculated for this Risk Management Plan. A Worst Case Scenario was used with a liquid release totaling roughly 12200 pounds over ten minutes with a release radius of 1.4 mile.  An Alternate Case Scenario was used with a liquid release totaling roughly 11,200 pounds over ten minutes with a release radius of 0.30 mile.\r\n\r\n4.0\tGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nMama Rosas has developed an OSHA PSM program for their ammonia refrigeration systems. At Mama Rosas, ammonia falls under the RMP Program 3 prevention program which is identical to the OSHA PSM program.  EPA has said that if the process is in compliance with OSHA PSM, then it is compliance with RMP Program 3.  Thus, Mama Rosas ammonia PSM has been reviewed and determined to be complete for the RMP document.  \r\n\r\nThere are several aspects of the ammonia prevention program that are key:\r\n\r\n1.\tThe ammonia PSM program at Mama Rosas includes provisions for employee involvement, procedures for working with contractors, pre-startup safety reviews an"

The Mama Rosas facility has a thorough emergency training program for on-site emergency responders.  The facility has implemented Mama Rosas HAZWOPER plan (emergency response program) which is a plan designed for the safety of its employees, the community and the environment.  This detailed emergency response program includes procedures for handling an emergency - the established action plan and appropriate personnel involved in containing a hazardous release (HAZMAT team).  As part of this emergency response program, Mama Rosas emphasizes a thorough training program and medical surveillance of the HAZMAT team prior to and after an incident.  With the potential dangers associated with a hazardous chemical release, Mama Rosas has researched and developed safe containment and disposal procedures as well as an evaluation procedure following an emergency response.  All of these components make the Mama Rosas HAZWOPER plan a thorough and comprehensive plan for release prevention and emergency response.\r\n\r\nThe emergency response policies at the Mama Rosas facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage 24 hours - 7 days per week.  There are also provisions for coordination with outside agencies such as the Sidney Fire Department in the event of an emergency.\r\n\r\n*From this point in the Executive Summary, anhydrous ammonia will be synonymous with ammonia.\r\n\r\n2.0\tPROCESS DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nMama Rosas is a producer of prepared frozen pizzas.
