      "SummaryText": "The City of Hermiston Public Well No. 5 has been supplementing the city water system with sanitary water for more than 25 years while remaining committed to protection of the community and the enviroment. We willingly observe the most stringent industry safety precautions to prevent hazards in the workplace. City management and water operations staff have instituted procedures to ensure a safe working enviroment is maintained that emphasizes proper handling and containment of hazardous materials. The City's safety planning emphasizes prevention of a release, the plan also identifies in-house or community-based expertise which would be called upon to minimize the impact to the community.\n\nPublic Well No. 5 is located  in the northwest section of Hermiston just west of U.S. Hwy 395 in Umatilla County, Oregon. Disinfection of water is accomplished through chlorination with chlorine gas. Well No.5 falls under EPA RMP and OSHA PSM regulations due to the storage and use of chlorine gas for disinfection. Well No. 5 currently stores, at a maximum, 4,000 lbs of chlorine in pressurized 1 ton containers.\n\nNo accidents associated with the storage of chlorine gas at Well No. 5 since it was built in 1979. And, there has never been a reported accidental release of chlorine of any kind in the City's water system in over 10 years.\n\nAn extensive Off-Site Consequences Analysis(OCA), of the worst case scenario and alternative release scenario has been performed with the aid of the EPA's RMP*CompO and other EPA guidance documentation.\n\nThe City of Hermiston Public Well No. 5 falls under Prevention Program 3. The City of Hermiston has prepared an extensive and imformative documentation package that covers all the elements addressed under Prevention Program 3 requirements. The City of Hermiston provides extensive training for all employees who work on the chlorination process,  including emphasis on stringent procedures for maintaining the integrity of the chlorination equipment.

      "SummaryText": " 5 is continuously monitored for potential hazards that could affect the chlorination process. When a potential problem is identified, it is scheduled for immediate correction. Some changes have been implemented to the original chlorination process since the well was contructed in 1979, including the addition of alarms for the chlorine detectors to the City's System Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA). Also, updated equipment has been installed, general improvements to the system have been made. In-place safety plans will take every precaution necessary so that any future change deemed necessary will be correctly designed, constructed, and operated.\n\nThe City of Hermiston has created a focused Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that will be followed in the event of an accidental release chlorine at Well No. 5. Employees are trained in the procedures of this EAP to ensure its policies are quickly and effectively implemented in an emergency. Coordination with Hermiston Fire and Emergency Services and the regional Hazardous Materials Team (HAZMAT) constitutes significant elements of this EAP. The regional HAZMAT Team for this area of Oregon is based out of Hermiston.\n\nWe believe the outstanding safety record of the City of Hermiston and Well No. 5 related to chlorine gas will continue. The City's focus will continue to be maintenance of a safe working enviroment for its employees and protection of the community."
