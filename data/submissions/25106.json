According to EPA look-up tables, the distance to the endpoint is 6.9 miles.  There are private homes and a public school within the distance to the endpoint with a total population of 1431.  There are several small businesses in one story buildings with fifteen or less employees each.\n\nOur alternative release scenario is a transfer hose failure.  According to EPA lookup tables the distance to the endpoint is 1.3 miles.  There are private homes and small businesses within the distance to the endpoint with a total population of 530 people.  Emergency shutoffs, excess flow valves, and riser breakaways are used to limit exposure.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations for anhydrous ammonia.  We have never had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caused death, injuries, property, environmental damage, or evacuations.\n\n In the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous facility, it is our policy to notify the Mills County Communications Center, who will notify the local fire department, rescue squad, law enforcement, and County Emergency Coordinator.
