RPC's objective is to prevent unwanted releases of ammonia into locations that could potentially expose Associates and others to serious hazards. An effective program requires a systematic approach to evaluating the entire system. Workplace and process safety are major concerns to management and Associates alike. The prevention and mitigation of unwanted releases of ammonia into locations that could expose Associates and the community to serious hazards is of primary concern.\r\n\r\nThe Facility has incorporated many safety features in the design of the ammonia refrigeration system to prevent system failures and to mitigate potential releases. The predominant safety concern with closed-loop ammonia systems is an inadvertent buildup of pressure exceeding pressure ratings or capacities of equipment due to ammonia expansion. The Facility's ammonia system is continuously monitored by automated control systems that shutdown pump and the components if deviations from normal operating conditions occur. Further, the system is equipped with pressure relief valves on all pressure vessels and most, if not all, additional locations within the ammonia system where ammonia could become trapped.\r\n\r\nRPC considers the health and safety of each Associate as its most important responsibility.

The main Site building was originally constructed in 1977 with an approximately 15,500 square-foot cold storage warehouse addition constructed in 2006. The Facility normally operates 6 days per week, 24 hours per day.\r\n\r\nThe Site manufactures dough products, which are frozen for shipment. The Site's North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 311824 (Frozen Doughs Made From Purchased flour)\r\n\r\nAs part of the Site's refrigeration system, which is used to freeze the doughnuts for shipment, the Site handles quantities of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance/highly hazardous chemical as defined in the USEPA's RMP Rule and OSHA's PSM standard, in an amount exceeding the regulatory threshold  for anhydrous ammonia in a single process, i.e., the Site's refrigeration system. The Facility is registered to Program Level 3 under the USEPA CAPP program.\r\n\r\nThe anhydrous ammonia, which is liquefied under pressure, is contained in various vessels, accumulators, piping, and heat exchangers throughout the refrigeration system.
