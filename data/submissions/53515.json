Furthermore, it is committed to conducting business in a manner that is compatible with the balanced environmental needs of the community in which it operates.  This commitment requires compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, facilities which are designed and operated to high standards, and systematic identification and management of safety, health, and environmental risks.  In keeping with this commitment, FMC Corporation's Tonawanda Plant has established a comprehensive Safety Management System that strives to identify and eliminate all potential exposures that include, but are not limited to, personal injury/illness, property damage, fires, process incidents, and breaches of security.  The Safety Management System embodies and employs the spirit and intent of the concepts found in the ACC  Responsible Care Initiative, the OSHA PSM Standard, all other applicable regulatory standards, and FMC Corporation's Corporate Safety and Industrial Hygiene Policies and strategies.  The site was certified under the Responsbile Care Management Systems by an independent auditor, NSF-ISR.  This standard requires continuous improvements and for safety, process safety, environmental, and security performance commentary to be publicly available on the ACC website.\n\nThe Plant's Safety Policy:\nFMC is committed to operating a safe facility.

The estimated residential population within the area is ~302,900.  Modeling was performed using RMP Comp V1.01 assuming rural conditions and a wind speed of 1.5 m/sec.  Rural conditions were deliberately chosen to create a more conservative approach as was the F class stability.  Public impacts include schools, residences, hospitals, recreational areas, and major commercial office or industrial areas.  Environmental impacts include state parks and wildlife sanctuaries, preserves, or refuges.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios - RMP regulations require that at least one alternative release scenario be identified and analyzed for each regulated toxic chemical present.  A scenario that is more realistic than the worst case scenario was selected as the alternative release case.\n\nThe alternative release scenario simulates an ammonia railcar transfer line rupture.  The event is assumed to release 6,840 lbs of ammonia during a 20 minute period at a rate of 342 lb.min.  The estimated distance to the toxic endpoint (200 ppm) is 0.3 miles.  This scenario was modeled using RMP Comp (V1.01) and assumed a complete rupture of the liquid transfer hose during a railcar unloading.  The loss was assumed to be for 20 minutes duration with a manual response to close the railcar unloading valve and did not account for the excess flow valve in place on the railcar in order to keep the model conservative.  The estimated residential population within the area is ~3,900 persons.  Public impacts include parks and recreational areas, and major commercial office and industrial buildings.  The institutions, parks, and recreational areas within the 0.3 mile radius from the release source were located using WNY street maps from Map Works, Inc.  No environmental contacts are impacted.
