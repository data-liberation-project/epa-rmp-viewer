This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our practice is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, facility personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within their capabilities to minimize the risk to the public and notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\n\n\nFACILITY BACKGROUND INFORMATION\n\n\n\nMilton Hub facility is located in a rural agricultural industry area in Wilson County, Texas.  The Milton Hub facility is a natural gas processing facility which includes fixed and skid mounted natural gas processing equipment and natural gas liquids storage tanks.  The facility is normally occupied by Pecan Pipeline operations personnel.  The nearest potential receptors near the facility:\n\n1.    One occupied residence located approximately 1704 feet to the south of the facility.\n\n2.      The EOG Gillett field office is located across the street from the facility.\n\n3.    Farming activities in the area of the facility are occupied on a seasonal basis.\n\n\n\nTwo public receptors are within the area calculated for the worst case release scenario.\n\nNo public receptors are within the area for the alternate release scenario.\n\n\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Milton Hub. The above referenced processes at the Milton Hub are regulated by both the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) rule and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard.

Employees also participate in safety meetings, resolving certain safety concerns, and updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information pertaining to the process and critical equipment. \n\n\n\nEmployees have access to all information created as part of the Milton Hub's accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in a written employee participation plan that is maintained at the Milton Hub. This employee participation plan addresses each accident prevention program element. \n\n\n\nThe Milton Hub also uses this system to develop and document Job Safety Analyses (JSA) for various job tasks and to track and communicate near miss and actual loss related to personnel, operations.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Milton Hub keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address: chemical properties and associated hazards; limits for key process parameters and specific inventories; safety interlocks; suppression systems; vent and relief studies; and equipment design basis/configuration information. \n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS). For specific process areas, the Milton Hub has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, flow, composi"

The Milton Hub maintains the process within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nThe Milton Hub also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with procedures and equipment operating history, provides a basis for inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes so safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nThe Milton Hub has a comprehensive program to identify and control hazards associated with the various processes that are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify potential hazards and controls in place to manage these hazards, and recommend additional controls, as appropriate.\n\n\n\nThe Milton Hub uses a variety and combination of applicable methodologies to conduct PHAs. These PHAs address (1) facility siting, (2) human factors, (3) qualitative evaluation of a range of the possible safety and health effects of failure of controls on personnel, and (4) one or more of the following methodologies appropriate to determine and evaluate the hazards of the process, (a) What-if, (b) Checklist, c Hazard and Operability (HAZOP), (d) Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), (e) Fault Tree Analysis, and/or (f) an appropriate equivalent methodology. \n\n\n\nPHAs are conducted using a team of people who have the appropriate operating and maintenance experience for the process, as well as engineering expertise.

Implementation of additional prevention and/or mitigation options in response to PHA recommendations is based on a relative priority ranking assigned by the PHA team. The approved mitigation options in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nThe Milton Hub periodically revalidates these PHAs. These PHAs are revalidated at least every 5 years, and will be conducted at this frequency until the process no longer contains hazardous chemicals above the threshold quantities. The recommendations from these revalidated PHAs are also forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of each revalidated PHA recommendation is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe Milton Hub maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, (6) out of service (shutdown) mode, and (7) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. In addition, the Milton Hub maintains information on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nToo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Milton Hub has implemented a comprehensive training program for employe"

New operational employees receive training on the Milton Hub's Operating Procedures, and basic training in process operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years, or more frequently upon request. All of this training is documented for each operator, including skills demonstration used to verify that the operator understood the training. Process maintenance personnel are trained in their perspective duties for maintaining the mechanical integrity of critical process equipment and systems.

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the Milton Hub has procedures in place to verify that contractors perform their work in a safe manner. These contractor safety procedures include steps to verify contractors (1) have the appropriate knowledge and skills to perform their jobs safely, (2) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (3) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (4) understand and follow site safety rules and (5) inform facility personnel of any potential hazards that they introduce or find during their work.

In addition, the Milton Hub evaluates contractor safety programs and performance prior to selection of a contractor. Milton Hub personnel periodically monitor contractor performance with respect to their safety obligations, and provide contractors with applicable safety performance feedback.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\n\n\nThe Milton Hub conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to see that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check that construction is in accordance with the design specifications and required safety systems are operationally ready. A PSSR also verifies that appropriate safety, operational and maintenance procedures are in place, and adequate training has been provided to the appropriate personnel. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented. \n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nThe Milton Hub has established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) utilization of appropriately trained maintenance personnel, (2) developing written procedures, and (3) performing inspections and tests, and correcting identified deficiencies. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\n\n\nMaintenance person"

Written inspection, testing and maintenance procedures provide that work is performed in a consistent manner, and serve as a basis for training maintenance personnel in their relative assigned duties. Inspections and tests are performed to help verify equipment functions as intended and that equipment is within acceptable limits. If a deficiency is identified that presents an immediate safety concern, Milton Hub personnel will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service. \n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\n\n\nThe Milton Hub has safe work practices in place to help provide worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) safe practices manaul, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to isolate energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (4) a permit and procedure to verify that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help perform operations and maintenance activities safely.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\n\n\nThe Milton Hub has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including operating conditions of the process), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) determine that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, equipment information, and o"

      "SummaryText": "perating procedures are updated prior to incorporating these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel and affected contractors are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nThe Milton Hub promptly investigates all incidents related to a covered process that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the factors that may have led to the incident, and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to Milton Hub management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the recommendations. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future and revalidated PHAs.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nTo determine that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Milton Hub will periodically conduct an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits will be conducted at least every 3 years. Personnel familiar with the facility and Process Safety Management participate in these audits. The audit team develops findings that will be forwarded to Milton Hub management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports will be retained. \n\n\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTI"
