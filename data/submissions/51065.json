      "SummaryText": "The Central Elmore WTP is owned by the Central Elmore Water & Sewer Authority. The facility is located at 65 Lake Point Road, Eclectic, AL 36024. The parcel is further described as being in the Township 20 N, Range 20 E, Sections 22 and 27. The facility elevation is approx. 665 feet above sea level. The site consists of approx. 15 acres, bounded by rural residential to the north, south, east, and west. Elmore County Road 80 bounds the property along the north, northwest property boundry. An approx. 10,000 square feet concrete, steel, and brick building serves as the main plant for the facility. Most water treatment processes are conducted at this building. The front of the facility serves as the office section. The center of the facility is where the water treatment process equipment is located and operated. In the back section are located our chlorine rooms and bulk chemical tanks which include alum, caustic soda, and fluoride. The chlorine rooms are enclosed and contain ventilation through exhaust fans. The bulk chemical tanks are outfitted with a containment wall around them in the case of spills. The plant also consists of a 2MG clear well, a 250,000 gal. wet well, a wash water clarifier, and drying beds. Central Elmore's source water is Lake Martin which is controlled by Alabama Power. Our raw water intake is located 3 miles from the plant on Lake Martin. The plant is a USFilter Microfloc package plant. The process used is inline direct filtration. The plant contains 6 filter trains which can produce 2 MGD each.  Alum and chlorine are injected into the raw water line and then flow through the static mixer. Then the treated water flows into the adsorption clarifiers where the majority of solids are contained. Afterwards the water flows through our multimedia filters and chlorine, caustic, and fluoride are added prior to entering the clear well. Then the water is pumped from the clear well throughout the distribution system. The average plant production is 6 MGD "

      "SummaryText": "with a total plant capacity of 12 MGD. We completed the Risk Management Plan in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68 and EPA. We are required to have an RMP because we keep 5, ton chlorine cylinders on site, which exceeds the threshold limit set forth under Accidental Release Prevention Requirements of the Clean Air Act Section 112r(7). This RMP falls under Program 2 because the chlorine process did not meet eligibility requirements for Program 1, is not subject to OSHA, Process Safety Management (PSM)(publicly owned facility in a state that does not have a delegated OSHA program), and is not categorized in the applicable standard industrial codes (SIC). The plan provides the Central Elmore WTP staff and management with guidance for developing and implementing certain environmental and emergency response policies due to potential releases. This plan shall be maintained at the Central Elmore WTP and will be updated as needed by the Plant Manager. The RMP will be available on site for review by federal, state, and local agencies. All plant personel will be required to be up to date and review the RMP, attend chlorine safety classes, and understand and carry out the plant SOP's. All maintenance will be recorded and maintained on site. All plant personel will receive on the job training covering SOP's and the RMP. The worst case scenerio concerning chlorine release at this facility would include a toxic gas release of 1090 pounds in a 10 minute period into rural surroundings. The toxic endpoint would be .0087 mg/L; basis ERPG-2. The estimated distance to the toxic endpoint is 2.2 miles with a wind speed  of 3.4mph and air temperature of 77 degrees F. The offsite impact would affect approx. 100 people in the rural area. The alternative release scenerio would be a toxic gas release of 52 pounds per minute in a release duration of 60 minutes. The estimated distance to the toxic endpoint would be .3 miles. There have been no accidental releases at the Central Elmore WTP"
