      "SummaryText": " material present at the facility is anhydrous ammonia.  The facility uses approximately 50,801 pounds of ammonia as a refrigerant within a closed-loop system.  The system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold storage, freezer storage, dock operations, and food manufacturing.  The majority of the system is located in the Engine Room including the vessels and compressors.  The condensers are mounted on the roof, and the evaporators are located in their respective cold storage areas.  The ammonia refrigeration system was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the International Fire and Mechanical Codes at the time of construction.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nIn order to operate the ammonia refrigeration system, the facility complies with the following risk management regulations:\n\n\n\n1)  OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM); and\n\n2)  EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP).\n\n\n\nThese regulations impose numerous requirements on the facility to ensure the safety of the public and on site workers.  The following summarizes the key compliance programs that have been implemented by CTI Foods to prevent the accidental release of ammonia at the facility.  The written Ammonia Refrigeration Operating Procedures ensure that the ammonia system is operated safety.  The Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their jobs.  The Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the ammonia system is in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards.  The Management of Change program ensures that process modifications are implemented in a safe "

The Hot Work Permit program ensures that the CTI Foods employees and contractors perform hot work (e.g. welding) in a safe manner.  The Contractor Safety program ensures that ammonia-related contractors understand the hazards of ammonia as well as the facility's evacuation plan and must take specified precautions to safely complete job tasks.\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that the ammonia refrigeration system been designed with several safety features to limit the risks of a potential accidental release of ammonia.  For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the flow of ammonia throughout the system and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  The facility has also installed ammonia leak detectors in the Engine Room which alert plant personnel of an ammonia leak.  The operational parameters of the ammonia refrigeration system are also accessible remotely for the Maintenance Manager and/or Refrigeration Contractor to assist in making appropriate operational adjustments.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe EPA's RMP Program defines \"accident\" as the following:\n\n\n\n\"The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process.\n\n\n\nThe release must have caused at least one of the following:\n\n\n\n?    On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (?68.42(a)); or\n\n?    Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (?68.42(a)).\"\n\n\n\nA review of the facility's accident history revealed that there have been no significant releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pou"

In addition, there have been no releases of ammonia that meet the RMP definition of \"accident\" as described above.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\n\n\nThe CTI Foods facility has an emergency response plan in effect.  The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) has been developed by CTI Foods and designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n  1.) To protect the safety and well being of employees, guests, contractors, and neighbors offsite.\n\n  2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n  3.) To protect the environment.\n\n  4.) To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated routinely by the Environmental, Safety, & Health (EHS) Team.  This Plan is reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes and improvements.\n\n\n\nThe CTI Foods facility coordinates emergency response efforts with the local fire department on a periodic and ongoing basis.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) Revalidation Study, performed on July 22-23, 2015, generated mitigation measures (recommendations) to improve safety at the CTI Foods facility located in Saginaw, Texas.  A three-year Compliance Audit was also conducted on November 2-3, 2016 to review compliance status of each element of the PSM/RMP programs.  The mitigation measures from these studies include additional training, key maintenance related tests/inspection, and enhanced emergency response policies and procedures.  The CTI Foods facility is planning to complete several items, including the recommendations, over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for employees and contractors.
