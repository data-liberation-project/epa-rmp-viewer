      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1.0\tRelease Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Kraft Foods facility in Tulare, California has an excellent record in preventing releases of anhydrous* ammonia.  This facility submitted the initial RMP in June 1999.  This is a re-submittal as required by anniversary date.  There have been no reportable ammonia releases since the initial RMP was filed.  This facility has implemented an electronic preventive maintenance system.  This is a system that uses a real time database to track preventive maintenance, training, inspection dates and issue reminders to responsible groups.  Training is tracked on an internal spreadsheet.\n\nThe emergency response policies at the Tulare facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage 24 hours per day and 7 days per week through employees with emergency response training.  There are also adequate provisions for coordination with outside agencies, such as the Tulare City Fire Department, in the event of an emergency.\n*From this point in the Executive Summary, anhydrous ammonia will be synonymous with ammonia.\n\n2.0\tProcess Description and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Tulare, CA plant is a manufacturer/processor of dairy products and dairy byproducts. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes for the primary processes at this facility are 311512 and 311513.   The facility is capable of producing and packaging various dairy products for consumer intake.  Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to preserve the dairy products.  Some of these areas include: storage tanks and silos containing raw materials and product.\n\nThe Tulare plant has one regulated substance under 40 CFR 68: ammonia.  Ammonia is used as a cooling agent in the plant\u00c2\u00bfs refrigeration process. \n\nThe ammonia threshold for triggering applicability to 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds. The quantity of ammonia stored on-site is 86,000 pounds.  Thus, 40 CFR 68 is applicable to Kraft Foods in Tulare.\n\n3.0\tWorst-case and Alter"

      "SummaryText": "native Release Scenarios\n \nThe ammonia refrigeration system has associated hazards that can potentially affect on-site employees and the general public if there is a release from the system. Although the alternative release scenario is more probable, the US EPA requires that one worst-case and one alternative release scenario is reported for each regulated chemical. Described below are the associated hazards and the worst-case and alternative release scenarios for each regulated chemical.\n\nAmmonia \n\nAmmonia is classified as a Group 2 Refrigerant per ASHRAE Standard 34-1989.  The dominant characteristic of this chemical is its toxicity.  It is a self-alarming chemical by its distinctive pungent odor.  Due to this odor, persons exposed to ammonia vapor will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small concentrations.  Ammonia is flammable in a very narrow and high range of concentration with a high ignition temperature.  It is not poisonous, but it is corrosive to human tissue.  Ammonia is readily absorbed into the moisture of the skin and, at high concentrations, can cause severe burns.\n\nThe risks to persons in an accidental release of ammonia include:\n\n1.\tIrritation of respiratory tract,\n2.\tCorrosive attack of skin and other tissue,\n3.\tFreezing of skin and other body tissue when contacted by liquid ammonia.\n\nBelow is a description of the release scenarios for ammonia and their off-site consequences:\n\nWorst-case scenario - The largest potential release of ammonia will occur with a puncture in the high-pressure receiver (HPR) located outside on the west side of the plant approximately 150 yards from the property line. The total quantity of ammonia that can be stored in the high-pressure receiver during a pump-out is 29,600 pounds with administrative controls.  The volume of the HPR is 885.14 cubic feet.  The HPR is limited to 90% of the volume per ASHRAE 15-1994-9.11.4 (administrative controls).  Therefore, at a volume of 796.63 cubic feet (90% of 885.14 cubic feet) an"

Thus, ammonia\u00c2\u00bfs physical state in the worst-case release is a gas.\n\n \tThe ammonia worst-case scenario was modeled using EPA\u00c2\u00bfs RMP*COMP to obtain the distance to endpoint.  The endpoint is defined by the US EPA as the Emergency Response Planning Guideline, Level \u00c2\u00bf 2 (ERPG-2) which was calculated to be 3 .1 miles.  The ERPG-2 was developed by the American Industrial Hygiene Association and is applicable to human exposures for up to one hour.  The ERPG-2 is intended to protect individuals from health threatening or escape impairing injury and is not generally considered fatal.\n\nRural dispersion coefficients were used during the modeling runs for the Tulare facility in accordance with Appendix W to Part 51 \u00c2\u00bf Guidelines on Air Quality Models Section 8.2.8.\n\nThe estimated affected residential population is 865 people.  The types of affected receptors are listed in EPA\u00c2\u00bfs RMP*SUBMIT.\n\n\tAlternative Release Scenario - This scenario is more likely to occur than the worst-case release.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario is an ammonia gas release through a pressure relief valve (PRV) on the high-pressure receiver, which is located outside at the west side of the plant. The actuation of the PRV will produce a horizontal jet release.  There is no applicable administrative control or passive mitigation associated with the PRV. Active mitigation of the release is human intervention (PRV is shutdown at 10 minutes from the start of the release, a total of 480 pounds of ammonia is rel"

The estimated affected residential population is 8 people.  \n\n4.0\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Tulare plant has developed an OSHA PSM program for their ammonia refrigeration system. Ammonia falls under the RMP Program 3 prevention program, which is identical to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program.    EPA has said that if the process is in compliance with OSHA PSM, then it is compliance with RMP Program 3.  Thus, the Tulare facility\u00c2\u00bfs ammonia PSM should meet the requirements for the RMP document.  \n\nThere are several aspects of the prevention program that are key: \n\n1.\tSince most of the pipework is out of the way of people and the machinery, there is less of a chance of an ammonia release.\n2.\tThe plant maintains good training, certification and employee awareness of operating procedures.\n3.\tThe plant has developed a strong preventive maintenance and inspection program.\n4.\tAn ammonia detection system is present at the facility that alerts facility personnel\n5.\tUtility personnel are present on-site and assigned to the ammonia system 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and all year round\n\n\n5.0\tFive-year Accident History\n\nThe review of this facility's accident history includes the following range of dates: June 1, 2004 \u00c2\u00bf May 31, 2009.

The in-plant contacts in the event of an emergency are listed in the Plant Emergency response Plan.  Back-up personnel are also available in the event that the primary incident response personnel cannot be contacted.  The on-site emergency response plan includes information about the frequency of employee emergency response training as well as a detailed description of the training content.  There are also specific procedures to follow in the event of a fire and ammonia emergency.\n\nAt the discretion of the incident commander, the Tulare City Fire Department will be called upon to provide back-up emergency responders and equipment.  The Tulare City Fire Department responds to all emergencies where fire alarms are used for evacuation in addition to all fire related emergencies.  In every case that the fire department is called, the Kraft Tulare and Tulare City Fire Department HAZMAT Response Teams will be placed on standby and an ambulance will be called to the scene.\n\n7.0\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nBased on the Process Hazard Analysis (what-if PHA) completed for ammonia, a list of action items were developed and are being monitored to determine if implementation was accomplished.  Some of the projects undertaken to improve safety at the facility include an operational test program for ammonia sensors, operator training (all operators attended the University of Wisconsin ammonia training course), and all ammonia valves are being tracked on a spreadsheet for maintenance schedules.  There are numerous examples of proposed safety improvements as a result of the PHA.  These include:\n\n1.\tAddition of an auto suction system.
