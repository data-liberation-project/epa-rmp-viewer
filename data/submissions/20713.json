A well organized safety program provides a safe working environment and promotes increased efficiency at all levels.  (IIPP)\n\nACCIDENT HISTORY\nNone to report\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\nThis facility used EPA's Risk Management Program  Guidance For Wastewater Treatement Plants (40CFR Part 68) for performing offsite consequence analysis (OCA) for the worst-case leak scenario.\n\nThe worst-case leak scenario is described in the compliance guide as the largest container losing all of it's contents in 10 minutes, this equates to a 200 lb/min leak of chlorine gas.  This facility is in a rural area and using the tables given in the compliance guide, a leak of this magnitude would effect a radius from the plant to 3.0 miles.\n\nIt is unlikely that a leak of this magnitude would occur because the process system is inspected daily and the chlorine containers are located in a brick building that is monitored 24 hours a day for process leaks and all buildings have intruder alarms to guard against vandalism.  All plant operators and a Chlorine Response Team are trained to respond to and stop process leaks.\n\nALTERNATIVE LEAK SCENARIO\nThis facility used the same guide as mentioned above to perform the OCA for the alternative leak scenario.  A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was performed on the chlorine system at WRP #7 and it was determined that a more likely (yet not likely) leak scenario than the worst-case scenario , would be from the rupture or separation of the flexible connections from the 1-ton containers to the manifold system.  This could occur through an earthquake, vandalism or material defects, but the mitigating factors that make these situations unlikely will be explained in another paragraph.\n\nUsing the EPAs guide, a leak as desc"

All plant operators are trained in emergency response.  The crew of employees trained in response to chlorine leaks at domestic well sites have been trained to respond to chlorine gas leaks at the WRPs as well.  This two person crew will respond to plants after hours with the standby operator to unmanned plants or to plants that need assistance.  There will always be three employees on call with pagers ready to respond to chlorine leaks. The employees on call for chlorine response are rotated weekly.\n\nTRAINING\nChlorine response personnel are scheduled quarterly to be trained in use of emergency repair kits, personal protective equipment and emergency response procedures; scheduled annually to be trained in the hazards and handling of chlorine & CPR/First Aid.  The district has purchased a 1-ton container and a 150 lb cylinder to practice emergency repairs.\n\nALARMS\nWRP #7 is equipped with chlorine gas detectors that will alarm at 1.0 ppm and at 3.0 ppm at the plants alarm page of the computer and to the Control Operator located in Coachella.  The Control Operator will be able to let the responders know which a"

The chlorine gas concentrations are also transmitted to a LED readout located on the north wall of the chlorine building.\n\nThes detectors are programmed to test every 24 hours, in addition to this the operators perform manual test weekly on the chlorine alarms to ensure a properly working detection system.\n\nCALL OUTS\nWhen a gas leak alarm occurs during the hours the plant is staffed, the plant operators will respond to the leak with three operators.  The Chlorine Response Team can be dispatched to the plant during the staffed hours if the plant staff is unable to respond to the leak with a three person team.\n\nWhen Control receives a gas leak alarm after hours the Control Operator will call out the Chlorine Response Team and the sanitation standby operator.  Upon arrival both will wait at the entrance gate for the other to arrive and will enter the plant together.\n\nRESPONSE TO MINOR LEAKS\nTwo employees will respond with SCBA's, chlorine repair kit B, gloves and a bottle of 26 degree Baume Ammonia.  The Third Person will also respond with a SCBA and stay near the truck radio.\n\nThe First and Second Person will don their SCBAs, keeping each other in sight at all times.  Using the ammonia they will locate the leak.  Once the leak is located and is confirmed to be a system leak and not a vessel leak, the gas supply valve on the container can be shut off by turning the valve clockwise one full turn.  When this has been done the Third Person will let control know whether repairs have been made or if further assistance is needed.\n\nRESPONSE TO MAJOR LEAKS\nSame as above except the response team will wear fully encapsulated suits if a severe gas leak has occurred or if the response team finds a vessel leak.  The Third Person will notify control to send police and fire department personnel to the scene to secure and evacuate the surrounding area if necessary.  The district's standby staff person and Training/Safety Specialist will be called as well.\n\nPLANNE"

Plans are under way to change the presure system to a vacuum system which would automatically stop drawing chemicals from the containers if the process system is adversely effected."
