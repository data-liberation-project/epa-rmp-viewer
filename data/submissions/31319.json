The facility has an extensive Risk Management Program that follows OSHA and EPA guidelines. The Program emphasizes employee training, emergency response,and equipment inspection/maintenance.\n\nThe WITF stores and utilizes chlorine,which is a regulated substance under this rule. The substance is stored in one-ton containers. The maximum quantity on site at any given time is 6,000 lb.  Chlorine is used for the disinfection of treated wastewater prior to discharge.\n\nThe WITF's Risk Management Program covers all aspects of safely handling/storing chlorine.  This program requires employees to rountinely inspect and maintain all the process equipment.  The program requires that the employees receive training on all aspects of process equipment to ensure a safe operating environment,and more importantly, to minimize the possiblity of a  release.\n\nThe WITF has had no accidental releases of chlorine within the last 10 years.\n\nThe facility has its own emergency response plan program, but all uses the local emergency response agency resources.  Response to releases and public notification shall be handled together by the local response agencies and the employees of the facility.\n\nThe facility has a alarm system that is connected to a dailer that will notify the on call person of a release during non-working hours.  There is a on call person available 24 hours a day to respond to any alarm."
