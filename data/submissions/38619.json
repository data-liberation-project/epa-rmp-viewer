      "SummaryText": "The Coleman Company, Inc. is located at 5605 North 119th Street; Maize, Kansas. There are two propane tanks with the maximum capacity of 30,000 gallons each, located on site. Propane is a listed flammable substance under the Risk Management Plan regulations found at 40 CFR 68, and is subject to those regulations since it is stored in a quantity in excess of 10,000 pounds. It is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling propane to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to the personal health of Coleman Company?s employees as well as to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community. It is Coleman?s policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations. The Coleman Company handles propane in a safe manner based on:\n- safety devices\n- design of the facility\n- safe handling procedures, and\n- training of personnel.\n\nIn the previous five years, there has been one propane release that is included in the accident history that led to three employee injuries on site. No other accidents have occurred involving propane that resulted in any on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or that resulted in any offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\nThe Coleman Company developed the emergency response program at this facility. The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and evacuation of facility employees.\n\nThe facility practices a program of continued improvement for safety and environmental compliance. Practices and procedures are continually reviewed, and changes are recommended and implemented to improve safety and environmental compliance."
