      "SummaryText": "The Columbia Basin Project is one of the largest agricultural irrigation projects in the Western United States, encompassing about 670,000 acres in central Washington State.  Dominating the geographical setting of the \"Big Bend Region,\" the Project extends north to south from the Ephrata-Soap Lake area to the Tri-Cities, and east to west from Connell and Warden to the Columbia River.  Water for the Project is pumped from Franklin D. Roosevelt Lake (Columbia River), behind Grand Coulee Dam, into Banks Lake.  From Banks Lake, the Main Canal carries water to the northern end of the Project, where secondary canals deliver water throughout the irrigated area.  The Potholes Reservoir, in the central portion of the Project, captures return flows from the northern Project area and, in turn, provides water to the southern Project area.  Additional return flows enter the Columbia River within the Wanapum, Priest Rapids, and McNary Pools.\r\n\r\nThe South Columbia Basin Irrigation District, one of three irrigation districts in the Columbia Basin Project, is a quasi-municipal corporation organized in February of 1938.  Statutory procedures for district formation were little different in 1938 than at present.  A petition was signed by more than 50 landowners and presented to the Board of County Commissioners.  Public hearings took place.  The District was named, the exterior boundaries defined, and certain lands excluded by the Commissioners' actions.  Contracts for a water supply, construction of irrigation works, and repayment of the District's share of the portion of the total Project construction cost allocated to irrigation were negoitated by the Bureau of Reclamation in 1944 and 1945.  \r\n\r\nThe contract, transferring operation and maintenance responsibilities for constructed works from the Bureau of Reclamation to the Irrigation District, was signed in December of 1968.  In January 1969, the South Columbia Basin Irrigation District assumed operating responsibility for facilitie"

Each director serves a three-year term with two directors elected in years one and two and one director elected in year three.  Management and Administrative functions are performed by the Secretary/Manager and the Assistant Secretary/Treasurer under policies established by the Board.  The District employs approximately 105 individuals.\r\n\r\nThe administrative office for the South Columbia Basin Irrigation District is located at 1135 E. Hillsboro, Suite A, Pasco, WA.  The District also has four watermaster offices and a chemical storage facility.  Their locations are as follows:\r\n\r\nEltopia Watermaster Office\r\n921 Eltopia West Rd.\r\nEltopia, WA  99330\r\n\r\nMesa Watermaster Office\r\n101 Pepiot Rd.\r\nMesa, WA  99343\r\n\r\nWahluke Watermaster Office\r\n141 Second Foot Rd.\r\nOthello, WA  99344\r\n\r\nLangford Storage Facility\r\n1971 Newport Dr.\r\nMesa, WA  99343\r\n\r\nMattawa Watermaster Office\r\n18897 Rd.

Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\r\n\r\nIt is the District's policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations regarding the transportation, storage, handling, and application of acrolein for the control of submersed and floating weeds and algae in irrigation canals.  The District is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.\r\n\r\n2.  The Langford Storage Facility and the substance handled:\r\n\r\nThe Langford Storage Facility was constructed in 1998 and is used to store Acrolein.  The maximum inventory of acrolein at the facility is 42,000 pounds.  The largest container of Acrolein is 3000 pounds.  Acrolein is used by the District to control aquatic weed growth in designated sections of the canal system.\r\n\r\n3.

Failure of our largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount possible would release 3000 pounds of acrolein.  The EPA's RMP-Comp model was used to predict the greatest traveling distance for acrolein following a worst case release.  The model estimated that a worst case release may travel 8.1 miles before reaching the toxic endpoint.\r\n\r\nAlternative Scenario - The alternative release scenario represents a more realistic potential release or more likely accident.  The EPA's RMP-Comp was used to predict the greatest traveling distance for acrolein following a puncture 15 square inches of a storage tank.  The model estimated that for this type of release, the chemical may travel 1.2 miles before reaching the toxic endpoint.\r\n\r\n4.  The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps:\r\n\r\nThe District has in place a Process Safety Management plan for acrolein which complies with the Occupational Safety and Health standard, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.\r\n\r\n5.  Five-year accident history:\r\n\r\nWe have had no reportable releases of acrolein during the past five years.\r\n\r\n6.  The emergency response program:\r\n\r\nThe Langford Storage Facility has an Emergency Action Plan.  The plan has been reviewed and distributed to the Local Emergency Planning Committee.\r\n\r\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety:\r\n\r\nThe District regularly reviews its safety plans and procedures.  Improvements are implemented when identified."
