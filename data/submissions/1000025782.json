(HOVENSA) Oil Storage Facility has a long-standing commitment to its employees, public safety and the surrounding environment.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training employees and implementing safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of its processes.  The company's policy is to protect the community and its workers from accidental releases of chemical substances and to reduce the extent and impact of a release.  However, if a release does occur, personnel are trained to respond, control, contain, and mitigate the release.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe HOVENSA Oil Storage Facility, located on the south shore of St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, is in a predominantly industrial/commercial area.  The Facility provides employment for about 200 people (HOVENSA and Contractor employees).  The Facility has two regulated flammables: propane, butane.  No toxic material is stored here.\n\n\n\nHOVENSA has proactively reduced the potential off-site consequences by vacating company housing units that may be impacted by a flammable release.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the HOVENSA Oil Storage Facility. Facilities at the storage terminal, which are regulated by the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule, are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  This summary addresses each of the PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nThe HOVENSA Oil Storage Facility requires employees to participate in all facets of their PSM and accident prevent"

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents, developing operating procedures and chemical information, and participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the facility and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the Oil Storage Facility has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and HOVENSA and contractor employee safety issues.  These initiatives are being developed by different teams to further promote both process and personal safety. \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe HOVENSA Oil Storage Facility keeps a variety of technical documents used to maintain safe operation of each process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Documents are maintained in the Facility Livelink system and are accessible by all employees.  (Specific departments within the Facility are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information).  \n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS) and HAZCOM lists.  The Facility ensures that each process is maintained within acceptable operating limits, by using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automatic shutdown systems). \n\n\n\nThe Oil Storage Facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of each process equipment. These documents are accessible on-lin"

This information includes materials of construction, design pressures, temperature ratings, area electrical classification, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provide a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nThe HOVENSA Oil Storage Facility has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage such hazards.\n\n\n\nThe HOVENSA Oil Storage Facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis, \"What-If\", or PHA checklist technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating, technical and maintenance experience, as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates process hazards along with accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to the Facility Management Team.  Resolution implementation of mitigation options, in response to PHA findings, is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This risk ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate from the original design safety features, the HOVENSA Oil Storage Facility periodically updates and reva"

Once again, the team findings are forwarded to the corresponding departments for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.  The results of the PHA findings are reviewed with appropriate employees/contractors.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe HOVENSA Oil Storage Facility maintains written procedures.  These procedures are referenced by certified operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are certified annually, or as often as necessary to ensure that they are current and accurate.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the HOVENSA Oil Storage Facility maintains key process parameter documents that provide guidance on how to respond to abnormal operating conditions.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the HOVENSA Oil Storage Facility has maintained a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New process operators receive basic training in facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing such training, a new operator is paired with a senior certified operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  When operators demonstrate proficient knowledge (e.g., through knowledge tests and performance tests) to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they are certified to operate the corresponding unit independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training (re-certification) on the operating procedures to "

Some contractors work on or near process equipment; therefore, the Oil Storage Facility (1) informs contractors of hazards known to the Facility which are related to the contractor's work and the processes in the area of such work; (2) makes sure that the contractor understands what to do in the event of an emergency; (3) develops and implements safe work practices, such as permit systems, to control contractor entrance, presence and exit from the process areas; (4) provides the contractor with site safety rules and applicable safe operating practice procedures; and (5) requires that contractors inform site safety personnel of hazards they encounter. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the HOVENSA Oil Storage Facility evaluates contractor safety programs and performance as a part of the contractor selection process.  Also, facility personnel periodically monitor and evaluate contractor performance to verify that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations once onsite.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\n\n\nThe HOVENSA Oil Storage Facility conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.

The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections/tests and documenting results, (4) preventive maintenance, (5) correcting identified deficiencies, and (6) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\n\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable operating limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service, or a Management of Change (MOC) team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\n\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity progr"

This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and replacement parts are used when repairs are made. \n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\n\n\nThe HOVENSA Oil Storage Facility has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) process unit control entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tag-out procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed in a safe manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\n\n\nThe HOVENSA Oil Storage Facility has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process-operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided with the necessary training regarding the change.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nThe HOVENSA Oil Stor"

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to the facility management for approval.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are completed`.  \n\n\n\nThe final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHA studies. \n\n\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the HOVENSA Oil Storage Facility conducts a PSM audit, at least every three years, to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to facility management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are completed and the final resolution of each finding is documented.  The two most recent audit reports are retained.  \n\n\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe processes at the HOVENSA Oil Storage Facility have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The Program 3 prevention program requirements are applied to all RMP-covered processes at the HOVENSA Oil Storage Facility.  Program 3 incorporates the most rigorous program requirements for release prevention.  \n\n\n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program "
