This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our facility adheres to process safety policies, guidelines, and best practices that have been developed based on company and industry experience over the years.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe BP Decatur Works is located at 1401 Finley Island Road, Decatur, Alabama 35601.  The facility is owned by BP p.l.c.   The plant manufactures paraxylene, purified terephthalic acid, and dimethyl 2,6-napthalene dicarboxylate as intermediates for the polyester industry.  In these processes, the plant uses three covered flammable chemicals and no toxic chemicals in sufficient quantities to be listed. Ethylene and propane are used as refrigerants, and 1-3 butadiene is used as a reactant.  Two of the plant's processes are covered under the RMP regulation. \n\n\n\nThe BP Decatur Works is subject to the Clean Air Act Title V permitting regulation and operates under permit ID: 712-0002.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\n\n\nFollowing is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the BP Decatur Works.  Because processes at the plant that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nThe BP Decatur Works ch"

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of process hazard analysis (PHA) teams.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan.  In addition, the facility has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and works management.  Some of these teams are the Works Process Safety Committee, Plant HSSE Committee, and Contractor Safety Committee.\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe BP Decatur Works keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Operating areas within the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the process safety overview information for each process to help employees and visitors locate any necessary process safety information.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).

For specific process areas, the plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition).  The plant assures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).  In addition, tables summarizing the consequences of deviation from these limits and the corrective actions to take are readily available.\n\n\n\nThe plant also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, piping and instrument drawings, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and plant changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nThe BP Decatur Works has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe BP Decatur Works exclusively uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures "

All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked in an electronic database until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the BP Decatur Works periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and tracked.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe BP Decatur Works maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures are written by experienced operators or foremen as needed and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  \n\nIn addition, safe operating limits are maintained to provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.

Entry-level standards have been set for new operators in conjunction with educational institutions.  In addition, new operators receive basic training in plant operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is placed on shift with experienced personnel to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge and skills to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe BP Decatur Works uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their work place, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.

A Contractor Safety Committee actively pursues safety improvement for on-site contractors. A Contractor Safety Forum is an active group of contractor management personnel who meet periodically to share lessons learned and best practices.\n\n\n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\n\n\nThe BP Decatur Works conducts a PSSR for any new plant or plant modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  Works process supervision uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nThe BP Decatur Works has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.
