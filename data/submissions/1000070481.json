Cordova facility is located in Cordova, Alaska. The facility is staffed year-round and also employs a large seasonal workforce during the processing season, with the highest number of employees on site from June 15th until September 15th.  During that time, the facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. The facility processes and stores fresh and frozen seafood using anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in a closed-loop system. Purchased in 1996 by Copper River Seafoods, the facility was originally built in 1969 and has been upgraded and expanded over the years. Ammonia is the safest refrigerant available and has excellent warning properties; it is extremely pungent at levels far below dangerous concentrations.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program \r\nThe Copper River Seafoods, Inc. Cordova facility implements a prevention program to comply with the requirements of the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119), which is designed to prevent accidental releases of certain chemicals held in quantities over given thresholds.  The PSM program addresses all required elements including employee participation, process safety information and system drawings, operating procedures, hot work permits, management of change, mechanical integrity, training, pre-startup review, compliance audits, process hazard analysis, contractor safety, incident investigation and emergency response.  The system has many built-in safety features including high-level controls and indicators, pressure relief valves, automatic and manually controlled valves and shutoffs, and leak detectors.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\nPer the re"

      "SummaryText": "quirements of 40 CFR 68.42, facilities must include a five-year accident history for all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  There has been no such incident at the facility in the past five years.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response\r\nThe Copper River Seafoods, Inc. Cordova facility maintains a written emergency response plan per 29 CFR 1910.120 to facilitate safe response to potentially uncontrolled ammonia releases.  The plan identifies personnel designated and trained to conduct the necessary duties during an emergency.  Responsibilities include notification of and communication with local responders and authorities, orderly evacuation of the facility and coordinating and conducting responses, as well as maintenance of emergency equipment and trained personnel. \r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nSafety at the facility is improved continuously through the process hazard analysis process, safety meetings, employee suggestions, accident, incident and near-miss investigations, and as the result of internal and external audits and inspections. Upgrades are planned on an ongoing basis as needed to keep the system in safe working order."
