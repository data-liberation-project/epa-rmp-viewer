Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nWe at Sysco Food Services of Atlanta are committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeable, if such a release does occur, our highly trained employees are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with the College Park Fire Department, who provides our emergency response services.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nWe have one regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is Ammonia (anhydrous).  The Maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) that is expected to be present in this facility, based on process/operational requirements, is 15,500 pounds.\n\n3.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nOur facility has taken the following steps as required by 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  Our Ammonia (anhydrous) process is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 reporting requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place for our facility.\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\nSysco Food Services of Atlanta maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with the process.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our process are identified and controlled efficiently.
