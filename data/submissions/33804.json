Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department (Lee County LEPC) and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. \n\n2) Facility Information: This is a new facility put into service 11-01-2001. The primary activity at the facility is the storage for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.    \n\n3)  The worst-case release scenario and the alternate release scenario.  An analysis of the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical worst-case and alternative-case accidental releases have been addressed in our Hazard Assessment and information is in our Risk Management Program. \n \n4)  The accidental release program:  The facility complies with the provisions of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  The OSHA standard is referenced in this RMP Registration Form; see Section 8.3 (b).\n\n5)  The Five-Year Accident History:  There have been no ACCIDENTAL RELEASES of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site; nor to our knowledge, has THERE BEEN ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES resulting in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage. \n\n6)  Emergency  Action Plan.\n\n     The facility has:\n\n     a.     A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard"
