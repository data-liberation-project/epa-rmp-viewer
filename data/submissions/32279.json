Our policy is to implement\nreasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of\nregulated substances.  Examples of controls to prevent\nreleases include (1) installation of pressure relief valves\nto prevent rupture of vessels due to overpressurization, (2)\nroutine visual inspection and thickness checks to ensure\nvessels and piping are in good condition, (3) using\nmaterials of construction that are compatible with the\nprocess chemistry, (4) vessel pressure and temperature are\ncontinuously monitored and (5) use of carbon and water\nscrubbers to remove small amounts of emissions.\n     \n     However, should a release occur, trained personnel will\nrespond to control and contain the release.  Mitigation\nmeasures that have been included in our design include\ninstallation of isolation valves, fire suppression systems\nin areas where flammable chemicals are present and fire\nfighting equipment in all process areas, a fully implemented\nemergency response plan, appropriate PPE and an alarm system\nfor early notification of a release.

There are strict requirements for\nchoosing and modeling worst-case release scenarios; as a\nresult, these scenarios are often exceedingly conservative\nand represent a situation that is quite unlikely to occur.\nThe purpose of the alternative release scenarios is to\nprovide emergency planners with more information about the\nchemicals we handle and their relative hazards.
