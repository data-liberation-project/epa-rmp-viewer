Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nConsolidated Natural Gas's  Galmish Loading and Storage Facilities are committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our  release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If a release does occur, our regular personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  CNG has contracted Weavertown Environmental Group as an Oil Spill Response Organization to provide additional emergency response expertise.  Also, CNG  will contact the Wetzel County  Emergency Dispatch to obtain additional resources from local Volunteer Fire Departments ( VFD), law enforcement agencies and emergency medical services.\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nThe title of the Galmish Loading and Storage Facility is self explanatory.  This facility handles 4 regulated substances.  Propane, Butane, and Isobutane [Propane, 2-methyl] are stored in spheres until loaded on tank cars or tank trucks.  Propane can also be pumped back to the Hastings Extraction Plant to replenish the propane refrigeration system during start up operations.  The fourth regulated substance at Galmish Loading and Storage Facility is Ethyl mercaptan  [Ethanethiol].  Ethyl Mercaptan is used to odorize propane so that a leak of this otherwise odorless substance can be detected by smell. The maximum inventory of Propane at our facility is 1,712,000.00 lb. while Butane, Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl] and Ethyl mercaptan  [Ethanethiol] are present at our facility in quantities of "

The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios, we have used Equations from Appendix D of the EPA's Off site Consequence Analysis Guidance.  For alternative release scenario analyses, we have employed the equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Propane Storage Sphere  #2 in the Galmish Loading and Storage Facilities process.  The scenario involves the release of 1,712,000 lb. of Propane.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the maximum distance of 0.97 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.  The affected population is approximately 200  people.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances involves a release from Normal Butane Storage Sphere in the Galmish Loading and Storage Facilities.  The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Explosion.  The scenario involves the release of 1,139,000 lb. of Butane in 10 minutes.  The release is also controlled by active mitigation measures that include deluge system(s).  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 PSI overpressure is 0.56 miles. The affected population is approximately 100 people.\n\n\n\n4.

A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  We also have an air operating permit ID pending under Title V of the Clean Air Act.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nCNG maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes at Galmish Loading and Storage Facility.  Much of this information was discovered and or confirmed during the preparations for the Hazards and Operability Analyses for Process Safety Management.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses was Hazards and Operability Analysis.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Galmish Loading and Storage Facility  maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after an extended outage.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to employees involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nGalmish Loading and Storage Facility has a training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the "

Refresher training is provided at least every  3 years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nGalmish Loading and Storage Facility carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Beginning in 1996, Rohrback Cosasco was contracted to perform a mechanical integrity survey of the Galmish Loading and Storage Facility in conjunction with the Process Safety Management program.  In the course of this study, Rohrback Cosasco performed ultrasound inspections of process equipment, piping and vessels to establish a baseline against which future corrosion and erosion can be measured.  Additionally,  this study has established a schedule for future ultrasound and visual inspections.   Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Galmish Loading and Storage Facility  to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-startup safety reviews (PSSRs)related to new processes and to modifications in established processes will be conducted as a regular practice at Galmish Loading and Storage Facility.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe st"

These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nThe Galmish Loading and Storage Facility promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nThe Galmish Loading and Storage Facility believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.  An audit of the Employee Participation Policy was completed on 2/11/1999.\n\nContractors\nCNG hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Before any contractors are allowed to work at Galmish Loading and Storage Facility, they undergo an orientation conducted by the Process Safety Management team.
