Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Muleshoe Ag Services in Henrietta, Texas are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  We coordinate our response efforts with the Byers Volunteer Fire Department, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facilityA?s primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous ammonia stored in two 18,000-gallon interconnected tanks, and thirty-one 1,000-gallon nurse tanks at our facility in Byers, Texas (Figure 1).  The maximum amount stored is 56,590 gallons ( 293,064.7 pounds) including the capacity of the on-site nurse tanks.   The largest single storage vessel at our facility (two 18,000-gallon interconnected tanks) contains 157,467.6 pounds at  85% standard maximum storage capacity.\n\n3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios \n \n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention requirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nMuleshoe Ag Services maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes (Appendix E).\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facilit"

Any findings from the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nMuleshoe Ag Services maintains written operating procedures to ensure that activities within our covered processes are conducted safely.  These procedures address various modes of operation; the information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes (Appendix B).\n\nTraining\nMuleshoe Ag Services has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nMuleshoe Ag Services conducts documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operation.  Maintenance checks are conducted by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Examples of process equipment that would receive maintenance checks include:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner (Appendix C).\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Muleshoe Ag Services to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or other employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly notified of the modification and offered training to deal with it.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nMuleshoe Ag Services routinely conducts pre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and modifications in established processes.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operat"

Any non-compliance issue discovered during the audit is promptly corrected.\n\nEmployee Participation\nMuleshoe Ag Services truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facilityA?s implementation of the RMP, particularly information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\n5. Five-year Accident History\nMuleshoe Ag Services has had no accidental releases since starting operation.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, no accidental release has occurred during this period.\n\n6.    Emergency Response Plan\nMuleshoe Ag Services maintains a written emergency action plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan addresses all aspects of emergency response including first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, and in the event of an accidental release, Muleshoe Ag Services will contact local emergency response agencies and the public (Appendix A).
