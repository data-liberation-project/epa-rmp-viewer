The design and installation is understood, by the best of our knowledge, to meet or exceed all applicable federal, state and local codes. Industry best management practices (BMP) were also used in the design such as, but not limited to, the pipe trough system in order to keep all piping above ground and visible for inspection.  Safety of our employees, the community and the environment are priority values shared by all facilities of Pinnacle Agriculture Distribution, Inc. and the managers and employees of this facility are committed to ensuring safe operations. \n\nA hazard review has been conducted on the covered process and will be updated every five years or when changes warrant an update. Any discrepancies identified during these reviews will have corrective actions recorded and plans made to take those actions within a timely manner. \n\nWritten operating procedures have been put in place to give guidelines on the safe operations of anhydrous ammonia storage and transfer to nurse tanks. All employees performing such tasks will be trained on these operating procedures. \n\nA training program has been developed for this facility as part of the prevention plan. Employees will be trained initially before they start work and at least every three years or when process changes warrant new training. These trainings include Hazard Communication (29 cfr 1910.1200), Hazardous materials (49 cfr 172, Sub H), Anhydrous Ammonia Safety, RMP Prevention plan elements and system maintenance. Training methods will include class room and demonstration and competency methods will be a combination of written test and observation. \n\nInspection guidelines and mechanical and integrity information has been developed as part of the prevention plan. Periodic inspections using industry standard checklists will be conducted to identify issues and take actions accordingly.\n\nCo"
