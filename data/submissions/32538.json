Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe St. Charles Operations Cypress Catalyst Plant of the Union Carbide Corporation (a wholly owned subsidiary of The DOW Chemical Company) is committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner. We have implemented a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well to protect the environment. These programs include both Union carbides Responsible Care requirements and governmental requirements, such as the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule, Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and the Louisiana Chemical Accident Prevention Program.\n\n2. Description of the Facility and Regulated Substances\n\nThe St. Charles Operations Cypress Catalyst Plant is a manufacturing facility that annually produces more than 800,000 pounds of catalyst. The material produced at this facility is sold to 20 customers in the United Sates and abroad. The catalyst is used by both Union Carbide and our customers in the manufacturing of polypropylene resin. The RMP rule requires that if a facility, such as the  St. Charles Operations Cypress Catalyst Plant, has a specific amount (threshold) or more of any one of the 140 toxic and flammable chemicals, the facility must follow the RMP rule requirements for that chemical. The St. Charles Operations Cypress Catalyst Plant has one RMP-regulated toxic substance - titanium tetrachloride and one RMP-regulated flammable substance - isopentane."

General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe general accident prevention program consists of compliance with the RMP rule, OSHA's PSM standard, Louisiana Chemical Accident Prevention Program and implementation of Union Carbides Operation Safety Program and Episodic Risk Management System. Key elements include:\nEquipment Design: Vessels and other process equipment are designed according to recognized industry standards and/or governmental requirements.\nProcess Safety Information: Chemical Hazard, process technology, and equipment information is documented, maintained up to date, and available for operating personnel.\nProcess Hazard Analysis: Process Hazard Analyses are conducted every five years to identify major process hazard scenarios and to recommend corrective actions needed to prevent their occurrence. \nEpisodic Risk Management: Periodic reviews are conducted to identify hazards which could have significant community impact and to recommend corrective actions needed to prevent their occurrence. These reviews utilize advanced quantitative risk assessment techniques.\nOperational safety Standards: Design requirements for active and passive mitigation controls used to prevent major process hazards are documented in operation safety standards.\nOperating Procedures: Operating procedures provide detail on how to safely operate a process and are maintained up to date.\nOperator Training/Certification Program: The plant has a training and testing program which provides operator with the proper skills and knowledge prior to allowing them to independently operate a process.\nTechnical Staff Training and Support: Trained technical staff employees are available 24 hours a day to support operations.\nMaintenance Procedures: The plant has specific procedures for maintaining process equipment so that it operates safely.\nMaintenance Training: The plant trains persons who perform routine or complex maintenance tasks on process equipm"

This program includes accountabilities for timely and proper implementation of the program elements.\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases. Our company and employees are committed to the standards that these management systems set.

Emergency Response Program\n\nThe St. Charles Operations Cypress Catalyst Plant is located inside of the Shell Chemical West Site Facility. As a result of this unique situation, Union Carbide contracts the services of Shell Chemical Company and utilizes Shell Chemical\u00bfs Emergency Response Program.\n\nThe Shell Chemical Company maintains a written emergency response program to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.. The program consists of procedures for responding to releases of hazardous substances, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response including:\n*Proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures\n*Evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation\n*Notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs\n*Post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements, and\n*Inspecting, testing, maintaining, and using emergency response equipment.\nThe emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes.\n\nThe Shell Chemical Plant also maintains a trained emergency squad to handle fires, explosions, toxic vapor and releases, spills, and medical emergencies. The plant squad trains and drills with local emergency responders to enhance their skills and tactics for responding to an accidental chemical release. Critiques are held on drills and actual events. In addition to the plant emergency squad, St. Charles Parish DEP is notified immediately of the incident. The DEP determines the community impact and takes the appropriate action to protect the community. Additional resources"

Planned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nOn-going programs, such as process hazard analysis reevaluations, continually aim to improve process safety.  The following is a list of specific improvements that we are planning to implement at the St. Charles Operations Cypress Polypropylene Plant to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\nComplete the Layers of Protection Analysis to ensure the necessary layers are in place.\nConduct periodic process hazard analyses for all processes and implement resulting recommendations for improvements to safety equipment and procedures.\nConduct New Leader Reviews so that newly assigned production leaders have all of the process safety and reactive chemicals information necessary for their new jobs.\nAll new projects are designed around principles of inherent safety so that process safety is integrated directly into the design.\nChanges to new or revised systems seek to minimize the quantities of hazardous materials."
