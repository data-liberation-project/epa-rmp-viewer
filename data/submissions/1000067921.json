BEI Hawaii developed this site specific Risk Management Plans for BEI Hawaii's facility that are regulated under risk management program to comply with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Accidental Release Prevention requirements: Risk Management Programs under Clean Air Act Section 112(r) and to protect public safety and environment.  The goal of our risk management program is to prevent serious chemical accidents that could cause harm to our employees, the general public, and the environment and to reduce the potential impact of the accidental release.\n\n\n\nThis RMP consists of five chapters.  Chapter 1, Management, introduces the plans and describes the facility operations, management and responsibilities.  Chapter 2, Off-Site Consequence Analysis - Hazardous Assessment, provides hazard release consequences and impact in worst case and alternative scenario.  Chapter 3, Five-Year Accident History of Chlorine.  Chapter 4, Summary of Prevention Program, safety information, hazard analysis, operation procedures, prevention procedures are provided in the Process Safety Management Plan.  Chapter 5, Summary of Emergency Response program.\n\n\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nBEI Hawaii believes in a clean and safe environment and is dedicated to meet all applicable environmental standards in the operation of its businesses and services.  BEI Hawaii has established comprehensive policies and procedures for the operations of its facilities.  The policy is a commitment to environmental compliance that assigns the responsibility of implementing the policy to designated individual or individuals to ensure compliance.  The purpose of the policy is to provide employees with a safe and healthy working environment, and to protect the environment from pollutions.\n\n\n\nPreservation of the environment is a commitment that must be shared by all employees"

      "SummaryText": ".  Employees shall promptly report suspected violations of environmental laws, regulations or permits to their supervisor who shall take immediate action to verify the report and, if confirmed, stop the violation and take remedial or other appropriate action.  The incident shall be promptly reported to BEI Hawaii's Regulatory Compliance Officer, who will assist in making any necessary reports to regulatory agencies.\n\n\n\nOverall approach to chemical safety begins with the premise that safety is everyone's responsibility and working safely is a condition of employment. Workplace hazards are minimized through preventive measures such as facility and equipment design, purchase of less hazardous products and development of standard operating procedures. Control measures include facility inspections to discover potential problems, employee reports of hazardous conditions, training and a safety award program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\n\n\nThe BEI Hawaii - Hilo facility is located at 430 Kekuanaoa Street, Hilo, Hawaii.  The facility stores pesticides, fertilizers and industrial chemicals.  The products are warehoused at the facility and distributed to various locations throughout the Big Island.  The regulated substance handled at this storage/distribution facility is chlorine.  Chlorine is received in 150-lb and 1200 lbs cylinders which are Department of Transportation (DOT) approved packages.  BEI Hawaii receives chlorine from a chemical manufacture located on the west coast.  The chlorine manufacturer conducts regular cylinder inspection and maintenance.  On average, the BEI Hawaii facility stores approximately 20,000 lbs chlorine and maximum should be around 35,000 lbs depending on shipping schedules.  Because bulk sales are made directly to our customers, access to the facility is not restricted but the chlorine cylinders are stored in the back of facility where the access is limited.\n\n\n\n3.

      "SummaryText": "lure of a 1200 lb chlorine cylinder releases 1200 pounds of chlorine within a 10-minute time frame.  It is assumed that the entire contents of the cylinder are released as a dense vapor cloud.  The ERPG-2 toxic endpoint (for chlorine is 0.0087 mg/L [~3 ppm]) was predicted to be 0.9 miles downwind of the facility.  The EPA model RMPComp (version 1.07) was used to estimate the toxic endpoint distance assuming worst-case meteorology of 1.5 m/s stability class F, no mitigation measures, and that the material is stored as liquid under pressure.\n\n\n\nAlternative-case release scenario - a 1200 lb chlorine cylinder falls over and shears off the valve, leaves a 1\" circular hole on the cylinder releasing 120 lbs per minutes of chlorine in a 10-minute time frame.  It is assumed that the entire contents of the cylinder are released as a dense vapor cloud.  The ERPG-2 toxic endpoint (for chlorine is 0.0087 mg/L [~3 ppm]) was predicted to be 0.2 miles downwind of the facility.  The EPA model RMP*Comp was used to estimate the toxic endpoint distance assuming average meteorology of 3.0 m/s stability class D, no mitigation measures, and that the material is stored as liquid under pressure.\n\n\n\nThe BEI Hawaii facility maintains chlorine coffin for 150 lbs cylinder emergency release.   The Hawaii Fire Department also maintains \"A\" and \"B\" kits and a chlorine recovery vessel for emergency response.\n\n\n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Steps\n\n\n\nThe facility complies with applicable federal and state codes and regulations.  The facility maintains a Process Safety Management Plan that was developed and is operated in accordance with recommendations from the Chlorine Institute.  The BEI Hawaii Process Safety Management Plan addresses:\n\n?    process safety information (includes information on first aid and medical management procedures for chlorine)\n\n?    process hazard analysis\n\n?    operating procedures (including safe handling procedures for storage and loading)\n\n?    trai"

Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nOn 09/22/2016 a cylinder odor was noticed during morning walk around by Plant supervisor.  There was a cylinder discovered leaking at the valve stem by use of a hand held gas monitor. After failure to control the leak by trying to tighten the valve the cylinder was placed in a salvage container.  After it was discovered the salvage container was leaking and readings were above the PEL, the Fire Department Hazmat Team was called.   It was determined to submerge the container in water.  Monitoring plan was put in place for overnight and next morning.  \n\n\n\nThe next morning the plant manager came in to check on the cylinder.  Initial readings for cylinder we zero.  The plant manager determined the pool needed to be moved under cover due to the rain. When he moved the the pool the vapors were released from the water and affected the plant manager.  Hazmat returned to control, monitoring plan was written and submitted to HEER/Hazmat.  The plan was accepted and completed.  The cylinder was emptied into the water.  The water was neutralized and discharged with permission from the wastewater treatment plant.  \n\n\n\nTo prevent further incidents the following measures were put in place: More frequent calibration of chlorine sensors, more frequent rotation of the stock of chlorine cylinders, more secure packing methods to prevent any knocking of cylinders and valves, more frequent inspection of emergency equipment.  We also held a in depth training for mitigating leaks and emergency response.\n\n\n\n6.  Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe BEI Hawaii - Hilo facility is classified as a non-responding facility.

The BEI Hawaii - Hilo Facility has developed its own procedures as outlined in the BEI Hawaii Safety and Health Program incorporating information from Chlorine Institute Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities.  BEI Hawaii has coordinated response to incident involving chlorine with the Hawaii Fire Department Hazmat Team located in Hilo.  Operators are capable, however, of responding to incidental releases such as routine tightening of a valve, for example. \n\n\n\nBEI Hawaii - Hilo facility personnel will only perform defensive mitigation measures (i.e., secure areas, initiate water spray, etc.,) to limit the release until a response team arrives to establish the incident command.  We have discussed this program with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Hawaii Fire Department.  In addition, BEI Hawaii has arranged with local response contractors to deal with potential chlorine releases at the facility. \n\n\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nSince the last update security camera system has been installed around the perimeter and directly on the chlorine cylinders.  BEI Hawaii has already experienced reduced levels of chlorine at its facilities as a result of its efforts to educate and switch customers from chlorine gas to sodium hypochlorite (bleach).  At the end of June, BEI Hawaii - Hilo will no longer be in the chlorine business and therefor will no longer be storing chlorine cylinders at its facility.\n\n"
