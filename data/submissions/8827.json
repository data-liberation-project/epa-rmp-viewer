The compressor room is where the high pressure receiver (HPR) or storage tank is located inside the warehouse building.  The HPR is the largest capacity vessel in the ammonia refrigeration system,  capable of holding approximately  13,000 lbs. of ammonia. \n\nThe Miami Dairy has an ammonia refrigeration system which exceeds the 10,000 lb.

The HPR is the largest capacity vessel in the ammonia refrigeration system, capable of holding 9,740 lbs. of ammonia.\n\n\n3. Description of the Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe Worst Case release scenario is the rupture of the Warehouse HPR vessel, releasing 13,000 lbs. of ammonia gas over a ten minute period.  Under worst case weather conditions, using the equation for a mitigated gas release and the Ammonia Guidance Tables,  the ammonia gas could travel 1.2 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public or environment (reaching a concentration less than .14 mg/L).\n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario for the Warehouse is a leak at a rate of 186.3 lb./min. from the HPR liquid supply line due to pipe connection failure from worker/human error or corrosion of the pipe.  Under normally expected weather conditions, taking into consideration the enclosure mitigation, the ammonia gas could travel 0.30 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public or environment (reaching a concentration less than .14 mg/L), using the Ammonia Guidance tables.\n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario for the Dairy is a leak at a rate of 134.2 lb./min. from the HPR liquid supply line due to pipe connection failure from worker/human error or corrosion of the pipe.  Under normally expected weather conditions, taking into consideration passive mitigation of the building enclosure, the ammonia gas could travel 0.20 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public or environment (reaching a concentration less than .14 mg/L), using the Ammonia Guidance tables.\n\n4. Prevention Program\n\nThis facility exceeds the ammonia threshold quantity for the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, 1910.119, and is therefore subject to the PSM requirements.

      "SummaryText": "rposes, this places the Miami Facility's refrigeration processes in the Program 3 level.  The Miami facility will use its PSM program as the required Program 3 Prevention Program.\n\nThe Miami Facility has a program in place to comply with the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  The PSM Program was re-engineered in 1998 for the ammonia process.  The PSM Program includes a preventative maintenance plan which requires all ammonia refrigeration equipment to be periodically inspected and serviced.  This will ensure that the equipment remains in good operating condition and will minimize the probability of accidents due to faulty equipment.  In developing the PSM Program, the Miami facility also developed written operating procedures for the refrigeration process.  These procedures cover all phases of operation and include information on safety devices.  These procedures will be used to train all operators and mechanics who work on the ammonia refrigeration processes to ensure consistency of operation and minimize human error.  In addition, all refrigeration mechanics receive training through the Refrigeration Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA) training course.  These measures ensure that all refrigeration operators and mechanics are properly trained.  Existing safe work practices such as Lockout/Tagout and Hot Work Permit, were reviewed and updated to ensure that all non-routine work can be performed safely.  Other components of the prevention program include collection and review of all equipment information, the development of updated Piping & Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs), and the correction of any equipment design deficiencies found.  These actions will ensure that the equipment meets all refrigeration industry standards and that accurate equipment information will be available when needed.  To ensure that the Miami facilitiy's refrigeration staff has the skills necessary to identify unsafe conditions, Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)"

Other PSM procedures, including Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Compliance Audits, and Incident Investigation are also part of the program to ensure continued safe operation and prompt correction of deficiencies.  The PSM Program receives full support of plant management and involvement of employees at all levels.\n\n5. Accident History\n\nThe Miami Facility has had no accidental releases of ammonia in the past five years. \n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Miami Facility has an Emergency Response Program in place.  The program complies with 29 CFR 1910.38.  The site also has some internal emergency response capability and is developing a program to comply with paragraph (q) of 29 CFR 1910.120.  The current plan has been coordinated with the Metro Dade County Fire Department and Hazardous Materials Response Team, and the Regional Local Emergency Planning Committee.  Notification is made locally by dialing 911, and by notifying Florida State Warning Point at (800) 320-0519."
