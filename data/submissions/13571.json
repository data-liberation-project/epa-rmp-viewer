Two identical carbon disulfide storage tanks, four carbon disulfide day-tanks and four reactors are the assigned equipment for the covered process (see attached simplified process flow diagram).\n\n            Nylonge Corporation's SIC is 3089.  NAISC Code was selected as 32518 for the RMP.\n\n            The following elements will be briefly explained:\n \n(a) The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source were modified and updated on 02 October 1998. A standard operation procedure (SOP) provides instructions for Safe Unloading of Carbon Disulfide, which was generated on 01 May 1999. \n\n(b) The stationary source and regulated substance carbon disulfide handled: railcars filled with nitrogen to displace the carbon disulfude into one of two storage tanks via above ground piping. Each storage tank, located in a below ground concrete vault, is continuously and completely submerged in water. Carbon disulfide released from these tanks would sink to the bottom of the vault as it is more dense than water. The storage tanks are filled with water to displace carbon disulfide into one of the four day tanks via above ground piping. Day tanks supply the reactors and are contained inside each reactor room. Each reactor room is equipped with a sump containing water. Any carbon disulfide that leaked from a day tank would be contained inside the reactor room and would sink below the water to the bottom of the sump. Filling the day tanks involves automated and manual operation. The rate of filling is dependent on the normal flow of water into the carbon disulfide storage tank.\n\n(c) The worst-case release scenario is performed by EPA's RMP*Comp(TM) model with toxic endpoint of 0.16 mg/L and the distance to endpoint is 0.1mile [based on 37.2 lbs/min, the maximum amount of carbon disulfide, which"

The maximum storage capacity of each day-tank is 1,050 lbs. \n\n(d) The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are included in the Emergency Response Plan and Standard Operating Procedure (SOP):\n          If a minor leak occurs, immediately stop the unloading process by closing the appropriate valves.        Contain and clean up the spill using absorbent materials. Contact the Maintenance Department if repairs are necessary.\n          In the event of a major spill, if possible, shutdown the unloading process. Follow the Emergency Response Procedures as found in Nylonge Safety Standard 1400-1, Emergency Action Plan.\n          Follow the emergency/first aid guidelines in the MSDS if chemical exposure occures.\n\n(e) In the past five years, there has not been any accident involving the substance that lead to death, injury, response or restoration activities for an environmental receptor.\n\n(f) The emergency response program: Nylonge Corporation has developped a new Written Community Response Plan (ER) on 02 October 1998 and submitted to Lorain County LEPC.  \n\n(g) Planned changes to improve safety: n/a\n                                                                 ---- # -----"
