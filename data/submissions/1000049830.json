Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n  We at CR Briggs  are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental\n\n  safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release\n\n  prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures,\n\n  maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is\n\n  our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated\n\n  substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency\n\n  response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n  \n\n  \n\n     2.     The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled                                                                                   Our facility's primary activities encompass open pit gold mining. Regulated substances include Ammonia and Propane.  The regulated substances at our facility are involved in several uses.  Ammonia is used in the Specialized Catalyst Reduction (SCR.) of oxides of nitrogen.  Propane is used for heating and the firing of the dore furnace for gold recovery.  \n\n  \n\n  The maximum inventory of Ammonia at our facility is no more than 85% of 59255 lb. while Propane is\n\n  present at our facility in quantities of  15658 lb.\n\n  \n\n  \n\n     3.     The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release\n\n     Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\n  To evaluate the worst case scenarios, we have used the look-up tables and equations\n\n  provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Conseq"

The scenario involves the release\n\n  of 51,000 lb. of Ammonia in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation\n\n  controls, to be used depending on the physical state of the release, such as dikes, sumps and berms are also taken into account to calculate the\n\n  scenario.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum\n\n  distance of <5 miles miles is obtained corresponding to the toxic endpoint.\n\n  \n\n  \n\n  The alternative release scenario for Ammonia involves a release from the SCR Bed\n\n  located at the crusher in the storage tank and transfer piping. The scenario involves the release of 51000 lb. of\n\n  Ammonia in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls, to be used depending on the physical state of the release, such as dikes\n\n  and berms are taken into account to calculate the scenario.  The release is also assumed\n\n  to be controlled by active mitigation measures that include water curtain(s).  Under\n\n  neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint\n\n  of Ammonia is under 2 miles.\n\n  \n\n  The worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances\n\n  as a class involves a catastrophic release from the propane storage vessel at refinery\n\n  used for heating in the gold extraction process.
