Certified WTP operators conduct daily inspections and any problems with the chlorine systems are corrected and documented.  In addition, the certified WTP operators ensure that the equipment used in the disinfection process is maintained according to the manufacturers\u0092 recommendations (\u00a768.56(a)).  Because of these efforts, the Stamford WTP has not had a chlorine release that resulted in an injury, either on-site or off-site, within the previous five (5) years (\u00a768.42(a)).  As part of the Program, the City will periodically perform compliance audits, hazard reviews, and incident investigations, according to a predetermined schedule described in the RMP and as needs dictate.  These compliance audits and hazard reviews document any planned changes to improve safety (\u00a768.50 & \u00a768.58).\n\nThe Stamford WTP complies with the emergency response regulations per Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR \u00a71910.38, as well as with applicable fire codes and the standards set forth by the Chlorine Institute and the Texas Administrative Code.  The Stamford WTP is a non-responding facility for emergency response.  The WTP is included in the Jones County Emergency Response Plan.  Coordination activities are conducted in accordance with \u00a768.93 with the first responders [the City of Stamford Fire Department (FD)] and Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) (the county emergency manager) at least annually, and more frequently if necessary.  WTP operators are trained to contact dispatch via 911 in the event of a release.  The dispatch contacts the nearest first responder unit (typically the City of Stamford) which coordinates the emergency response according to the county Emergency Response Plan, including the evacuation of surrounding residents when required (\u00a768.90(b))."

      "SummaryText": "The City of Stamford, Texas (City) operates the Stamford Water Treatment Plant (WTP) which is located in Jones County, Texas on the east side of the City.  The WTP provides potable water to the City of Stamford, as well as the City of Lueders, Ericksdahl Water Supply Corporation (WSC), Sagerton WSC, and Paint Creek WSC.  Chlorine gas is used in the disinfection process at the WTP.  In order to meet the demand and accommodate supply shipments, up to four (4) 2,000-pound chlorine cylinders will be stored on-site at any one time.  Because the stored quantity of chlorine onsite exceeds the threshold quantity for chlorine (\u00a768.130; Table 1), the City developed this Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The Stamford WTP is subject to Program 2 RMP requirements (\u00a768.12(c)).  A Management System overseen by the City Manager (RMP Manager) is implemented to ensure that the RMP and associated Prevention Program are implemented correctly and maintained up-to-date.  The City\u0092s accidental release prevention and emergency response policies include commitments to safety and to implementation of safe procedures to ensure accidental releases of chlorine gas are prevented.\n\nThe accidental release prevention program (Prevention Program) includes required elements of 40 CFR Part 68 such as safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigation.  Detailed documentation of each element of the Prevention Program is contained within the text of the RMP.  Operator training is key to the effectiveness of the Prevention Program.  The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) licensing program for water operators is used as a training tool, along with site-specific RMP training.  TCEQ licensing testing and on-site observation and demonstration are used to evaluate comprehension of all training materials.  Written operating procedures are used in conjunction with on-the-job training to ensure that certified WTP operators are pr"
