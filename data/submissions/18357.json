The Risk Management Program contains twelve elements in the prevention program.  Each element within this program will be tied together with the management system to ensure development, implementation and integration of the risk management program requirements.\n\nThese twelve elements consist of the following:\n\nProcess Safety Management, Process Hazard Analysis, \nOperating Procedures, Training, Mechanical Integrity,\nManagement of Change, Pre-Startup Review, Compliance Audits,\nIncident Investigation, Employee Participation, Hot Work Permit, and Contractors.\n\nThe Cassco facility is committed to operating a safe and compliant facility for the protection of its employees, the general public, and the environment.  The facility has multiple safeguards pertinent to the ammonia process.  These include an ammonia detection and alarm system, exhaust purge fans, sprinkler system, common sumps, floor drains, controls which shut down the compressors if operating limits are violated, and the capability of shutting the entire system down if required.  Administrative controls are in place which limit the utilization of vessels at approximately 50% of their intended capacities.\n\nThe company has developed an emergency response and action plan which includes notification of emergency authorities/agencies and the public, to evacuation and first responder duties.",

      "SummaryText": "The Cassco Refrigerated Services facility located in Marshville, North Carolina manufactures ice for wholesale/retail distribution.  The facility, operating on approximately 15 acres, utilizes approximately 26,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant within an enclosed system for ice manufacturing and storage.\n\nThe Cassco Marshville facility refrigeration system is a standard refrigeration design using anhydrous ammonia as its refrigerant.  The system has four compressors, two operating at -30 F and two operating at +10 F.  Each of the compressors has numerous protective controls (motor overload, high discharge temperature, high discharge pressure, low suction pressure, and low oil pressure) that will shut down the compressor if operating limits are violated.  The compressors are normally run and shut down through the computer.\n\nThe compressors receive anhydrous ammonia gas from one of two refrigerant recirculators (V3 and V4), compress it, and discharge the hot, high pressure ammonia through oil separators to two condensers located on the roof of the facility.  The forced-air-cooled condensers transfer the anhydrous ammonia's heat to the atmosphere and return the condensed (liquid) anhydrous ammonia to the high pressure receiver(V1). High pressure liquid anhydrous ammonia is then transferred to V2, V3, and V4.  The liquid anhydrous ammonia is pumped at an approximate 2 to 1 ratio from the recirculators to the evaporators, through liquid flow regulators where the flashing anhydrous ammonia removes heat from the various areas.  From the evaporators, the anhydrous ammonia gas and liquid combination returns to the recirculators to begin the refrigeration cycle over again.\n\nAn outside supplier delivers anhydrous ammonia 1 to 2 times per year to replenish the ammonia in the system.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia, when properly used, has proven to be a safe and reliable refrigerant.  The sharp odor of ammonia provides its own warning agent.  Practically all accidents involvin"

A Risk Management Coordinator may be responsible for developing and implementing the overall risk management program, while other personnel may be responsible for developing and implementing the operating procedures element or developing a particular operating procedure.  The management system is, therefore, operating at each of these levels depending on the way these responsibilities are carried out.\n\nThe Risk Management Coordinator is responsible for all aspects of the development and update of the overall Risk Management Program.

The scenarios related to a worst case release scenario and an alternative release scenario.  This involved calculating worst case and alternative scenarios utilizing the RMP*Comp modeling program.\n\nThe facility considered worst case release scenarios relating to the V4 recirculator vessel within the enclosed ammonia system, as it would house the largest mass of a regulated substance at any given time.  The release model considered the potential release of 10,700 pounds of liquid ammonia from the vessel, during a 10 minute release.  The scenario endpoint was 0.5 mile.

The potential release assumed the breaking of a 4\" line and the release of 10,400 pounds of ammonia.  The predicted distance to the 200 ppm endpoint is 0.2 mile."
