              "Description": "This facility has ammonia sensors in the engine room that will alarm at 50ppm and activate the emergency ventilation system at 100ppm. Ammonia sensors are also located in the cooler and dock areas along with the freezer.  These sensors will alarm.  The system has safety relief valves installed with a 5 year replacement program.  High liquid level in the -20F & +20F vessels will alarm and compressors will be shut down.  This are low level alarms and will shut recirculation pumps off.  There is an interlock that will not allow the low temperature compressors to start before the high temperature compressors. A micro processor control panel on each compressor monitors system temperatures, pressures, oil pressures. The main control panel monitors the room temperatures and the evaporative condenser pressure by operating water pumps and the variable frequncy drive fan motors.   ",

      "SummaryText": "Roehl Cold Storage - Owen, WI is a Public Cold Storage Warehouse.  This facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system for product cooling and freezing for its customer base. This facility was purchased from the previous owner, Brock Cold Storage, previously purchased from Gardner Cold Storage of Pittsville, WI.  A PSM program had been developed, and was recently updated. Employees have been informed that ammonia is on the premise and that a PSM program exists and they have a right to review it. The  refrigeraton system operates as a two-stage, two-pressure system.  The -20F is the low stage for freezer operation and the +20F is the high stage for cooler and dock areas. This facility uses outside ammonia refrigeration contractors for construction and servicing of its equipment.  In-house personnel conduct minor service and documented evidence is maintained in file folders.  According to 40 CFR Part 68.42(a), there has been no accidental release at this facility.  For emergencies, the facility Emergency Action Plan (EAP) provides for implementing an emergency response.  The response is coordinated with the local Fire Department and local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) for assistance."
