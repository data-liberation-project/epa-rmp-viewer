Introduction:\r\nThe facility supplies a variety of grades of agricultural fertilizers and industrial chemicals.  Trammo North Bend Operations (TNBO) produces nitric acid and aqua ammonia solution.  Additionally, TNBO ships anhydrous ammonia and UAN without being processed.  \r\nAmmonia is the precursor chemical for most of the processes that take place on site.  Anhydrous ammonia is brought to the site by rail, truck or barge and stored in a low-pressure storage tank.  The ammonia is vaporized and oxidized over a Platinum metal gauze at high temperature and pressure.  This creates NOx gas that is then absorbed into water in two absorbing towers in succession.  The NOx absorbed into the water creates nitric acid.  The nitric acid is sold out of the facility in a number of different concentrations depending on customer specifications.  \r\nAqua ammonia (aqua) is made by absorbing anhydrous ammonia into water.  Aqua is used in many different applications, such as emission reduction.\r\nThe facility receives UAN by barge and stores it in two atmospheric tanks. The UAN can be shipped at various concentrations by dilution at the truck rack. \r\n\r\nB.  Accidental Release Prevention and Record:\r\nTNBO has an excellent safety record with no deaths or serious injuries to plant personnel or contractors since it was constructed in 1965.  In addition, the plant has operated without a lost time accident for over 12 years. There has not been a RMP reportable release of toxic chemicals in the last 5 years.\r\n* In case of a reportable chemical accident, information in the RMP will be updated within six (6) months of the date accident occurred.\r\n\r\nC. Accidental Release Prevention Policies and Program:\r\nAs part of the management system for Process Safety Management, a plant wide computer system is utilized to control maintenance and process safety functions.

This system is used to provide our employees with the necessary tools and records for process safety requirements.  It plays an integral part in the safety efforts of the plant. In addition, plant personnel routinely participate in monthly safety meetings.\r\nTNBO believes safety and protection of the environment must be second nature to all employees and full time contractors.\r\nEach plant employee is trained to be familiar with the Emergency Action policies and procedures through safety reviews and plant safety meetings. The Emergency Action Plan is reviewed on an annual basis during safety meetings as part of the employee refresher training.  The corporate environmental policy is also reviewed yearly.\r\nTNBO requires the Emergency Action Plan be followed in the event of an emergency. The emergency alarm system is tested each month and an emergency drill is held four times a year.\r\nLocal LEPC and Miami Township Fire Department personnel are furnished a copy of the Emergency Action Plan each time it is revised.  In addition, they are furnished copies of the Tier II document showing the chemicals stored on site, location, and quantities stored.\r\nTNBO participates in a local Community Advisory Panel composed of representatives from the plants on Brower Road; a group of community individuals including elected officials from the local communities; local school personnel; citizen representatives; and Miami Township Fire Department personnel.  \r\n\r\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program Steps:\r\n\r\nAccident release prevention steps include the fourteen elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management program, an Emergency Management System (EMS), and corporate oversight of the facility.  \r\nTNBO management strongly encourages all employees to participate in all facets of process safety and accident prevention.

TNBO has an employee participation plan that documents many other ways employees are involved in accident prevention and process safety.\r\nTNBO has a comprehensive PSM program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this system, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\nTNBO has well-established mechanical integrity practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps, compressors, and emergency shutdown systems.\r\nTraining of plant personnel includes: (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) emergency action plans, and (4) applicable safe work practices.\r\nTNBO has a comprehensive MOC system to manage changes to the processes.  This system requires that process changes be reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards.  The MOC system verifies that existing controls have not been compromised.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, equipment information, drawings, and procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, all effected personnel receive training on the change.\r\n\r\nD. Worst Case Scenario:\r\n\r\nThis information was removed from the executive summary in accordance with (40 CFR 68.190 (b) (6).\r\n\r\nE.  Anhydrous Ammonia Alternative Scenario: \r\n\r\nSeveral alternative release scenarios were evaluated by TNBO.  The most likely release scenario would involve a release of hot anhydrous ammonia from a pressure relief valve on the ammonia vaporizer bottle in the nitric acid plant.  This part of the process involves anhydrous ammonia under elevated temperatures and pressures.  This alternative scen"

Specifically, the process equipment is inspected on a regular basis.\r\n\r\nF.  Aqua Ammonia Alternative Release Scenario: \r\n\r\nSeveral possible aqua ammonia release scenarios were evaluated but the diked loading operation was selected as the most likely scenario since it involves the use of hoses and truck connections.  This alternative scenario could result in offsite consequences.\r\n\r\nG.   Nitric Acid Alternative Release: \r\n\r\nThis facility brings in 98% concentrated nitric acid by truck or rail car.  The 98% nitric acid is immediately diluted with product acid to a maximum of 83-84% when unloaded.  No acid is stored above 85% strength in any of the facilities storage vessels.  The unloading operation was selected as the alternative scenario because this is the only time 85% or higher strength acid is in the plant.  Standard unloading procedures and equipment checks are in place to reduce the possibility of an incident. This alternative scenario could result in offsite consequences.\r\n\r\nH.   Five Year Accident History:\r\n\r\nThe Trammo North Bend Operations facility has not had an RMP reportable accident or an EPA reportable quantity release of aqua ammonia or nitric acid in the last five years.  We believe the policies and programs in place at our facility will help us maintain our exemplary record in future years.\r\n\r\nI.   Emergency Response:\r\n\r\nTNBO works closely with the local fire departments and LEPC.  The facility Emergency Action Plan (EAP) covers accidental releases of facility chemicals, natural disasters, emergency response practices and procedures, and process safety topics.  The plan is reviewed each year with all employees.\r\n\r\n* Updates to the emergency contact information will be reported within one (1) month of change.\r\n\r\nJ.
