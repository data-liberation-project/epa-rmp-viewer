      "SummaryText": "This risk management plan (RMP) is for Progress Energy Florida, Inc.'s Hines Energy Complex.  The Hines facility is an electric generating plant that contains six combined-cycle natural gas/oil-fired combustion turbines.  The process affected by Section 112r requirements is the storage of aqueous ammonia in three separate storage systems. The three tanks are used to store aqueous ammonia for use in the selective catalytic reduction of Nox emissions. One tank serves combustion turbines 1A and 1B, the second tank serves combustion turbines 2A and 2B, and the third tank serves combustion turbines 3A and 3B.   The ammonia concentration in water is 30%, and it is stored in three 30,000 gallon tanks, which results in the storage of 63,036 pounds of ammonia in each tank; therefore the maximum amount of ammonia stored in each process is 63,036 pounds.  Each  tank is surrounded by a dike that is capable of holding the entire contents of the tank.  The dikes will provide passive mitigation in the event of a release.   Since the ammonia concentration is less than 44%, this process is not subject to the OSHA PSM standard.\n\nReleases are prevented through the use of well-maintained storage equipment.  There have been no releases of aqueous ammonia at the site during the last five years.  The first tank was installed in September 1998.  Ammonia storage quantities have been reported to, and emergency response procedures coordinated with, the District 7 LEPC, which is the Polk County Emergency Operations office."
