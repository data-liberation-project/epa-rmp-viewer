This commitment is supported by its Code of Ethical Conduct and policies on Business Ethics, Workplace Health and Safety, and Environmental Law Compliance and Management.  \r\n\r\nThe Callery Evans City Site is located in Butler County at 1424 Mars-Evans City Road between Mars and Evans City, Pennsylvania.  A small portion of the facility lies within the Borough of Callery; the majority is within Forward Township.  Callery owns approximately 88.74 acres but approximately 30 acres have been developed for commercial use.  The facility was purchased from Mine Safety Appliances Company (MSA) in September 2003.  MSA complied with the provisions of 40 CFR Part 68 and submitted their RMP to the agency in June of 1999, and then in December of 2013 as BASF, all elements of those submittals remain in place. In March 2017, Edgewater Capital Partners purchased the facility from the BASF Corporation which is now called Callery Evans City Site.  \r\n\r\nEPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, 40 CFR Part 68, also known as the Risk Management Program, were created to reduce the probability and severity of accidental releases and to stimulate dialogue between industry and the public to improve accident prevention and response.  In an effort to better educate the community, Callery has presented a summary of the Evans City Site Risk Management Program to the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), local firefighters, the Community Awareness and Emergency Response (CAER) Committee, and its own employees.  This written summary should also help other members of the community understand Callery's Risk Management Program.  Additional information is available by calling the CAER Committee Infoline at (724) 538-1200.\r\n\r\nRegulated Substances:\r\n\r\nCallery manufactures a range of chemicals based on alkali metal chemistry and boron hydride chemistry.

Boron trifluoride (BF3), Chemical Abstract Services Registry Number 7637-07-2 is the only substance used at the Evans City Site in quantities above the Risk Management Program regulated threshold quantity.  That regulatory threshold is 5,000 pounds for BF3.  Typically, Callery receives BF3 in specially constructed, Department of Transportation-certified, tube trailers with eight individual high pressure tubes permanently mounted to a truck trailer and spheres (net wt. 325 kgs. or 716.7 lbs.).  Maximum amount of BF3 on-site at any one-time is up to 22,000 pounds.  The BF3 is directly piped to Callery's process from the tube trailer or spheres which is standard industry practice.\r\n\r\nBF3 is commonly used throughout the world to manufacture synthetic motor oils, adhesives, pharmaceuticals, and flavors and fragrances.  Callery uses it to manufacture diborane, which is a basic boron chemical.\r\n\r\nOther materials listed by EPA in 40 CFR Part 68 are purchased, stored and consumed in quantities below their threshold quantities.  Callery has a procedure to limit the amount of these materials purchased and stored onsite such that they will not exceed these thresholds.\r\n\r\nRelease Scenario:\r\n\r\nEPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions require the preparation of a worst case and an alternate (or more likely) case scenario for the release of the regulated substances.  These release scenarios were prepared in October of 2016 by BASF in Wyandotte, Michigan.  The model used for the scenarios was the MARPLOT model.  The MARPLOT model is capable of modeling dispersions of high pressure releases of heavier than air gases, such as BF3.\r\n\r\nThe worst case scenario involves the catastrophic failure of one of the high pressure tubes on the BF3 trailer, resulting in a release of 2,000 pounds of BF3 gas over a 10 minute period.  The alternative scenario involves the occurrence of a 1/8 inch diameter hole in the unloading line from"

It is assumed that it would take Callery personnel 30 minutes to detect the release and close the remote shutoff valve on the tube trailer.  By procedure, BF3 is never transferred or used without supervision by a trained operator.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program:\r\n\r\nThe facility maintains a detailed Emergency Preparedness Plan.  The Plan is reviewed and updated periodically.  It details responsibilities and actions to be taken by facility personnel as well as by outside response organizations.  The facility has its own Emergency Response Team.  They, along with community firefighters, emergency medical services, HazMat Teams, and the LEPC have been trained to handle and to respond to a release of BF3 by the manufacturer of BF3.  In addition, they have held their own practice drills.  Callery works closely with the LEPC and other community responders to prepare and preplan for proper response.\r\n\r\nThe proper response to a release of BF3, which is a corrosive gas and will produce a white cloud, is to hit it with water spray in order to prevent its offsite migration by knocking down the cloud.  If the BF3 cannot be controlled this way, it will eventually react with moisture in the atmosphere or be diluted enough in the air so that it is no longer a hazard.\r\n\r\nMSA installed a CAS (Community Alert System) (siren and community education program) in 1998.  Callery has and will continue to maintain this equipment and the community education program element.  For a release of BF3 with offsite consequences, the proper community response is to shelter in place to prevent exposure to the material.  If needed, the siren would be used to alert the community to shelter in place and take proper precautions.  An all-clear signal will let the community know that the emergency is over.
