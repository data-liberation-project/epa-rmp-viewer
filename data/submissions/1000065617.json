The Tyler facility will be considered as a RMP Program 3 facility beginning in late September 2017 because the company intends to increase the quantities of acetylene and propylene stored on the site to above 10,000 pounds each.  The company does not manufacture acetylene or propylene and prior to submittal of this RMP, the onsite inventory was carefully managed to ensure that the site did not exceed a threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds of either product at any time.   \r\n\r\nThe following activities were conducted in support of the RMP, in accordance with EPA RMP guidance:\r\n\u00bf\tA risk and gap assessment of the current and future operations at the site was conducted.\r\n\u00bf\tThe elements of a Program Level 3 RMP plan were prepared.\r\n\u00bf\tA new health, safety, and environmental management system, to include the elements required by OSHA's PSM and EPA's RMP programs, was developed for the site \r\n        operations.\r\n\u00bf\tThe Offsite Consequence Analysis was conducted using the RMP*Comp model. \r\n\u00bf\tThe seismic analysis for the affected systems was reviewed for changes to the system, and changes to the building codes that may impact affected systems.\r\n\u00bf\tThe Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) for the facility was conducted using a combination What If/Checklist analysis method.\r\n\u00bf\tTWS prepared a new RMP registration submittal to reflect the changes to the site operations, specifically increases in the quantities of acetylene and \r\n        propylene stored on the premises.\r\n\r\nACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\r\nIt is the policy of Tyler Welder's Supply management to implement the requirements of this RMP.

For this project, PHA study facilitation was provided by IFO Group to assist a team of personnel from TWS in conducting an evaluation of the processes at the Tyler facility.    The PHA facilitator was familiar with the process and has been performing PHA facilitations since 1994.   \r\nThe potential risks identified by this PHA were connected to loss of primary containment during the acetylene and propylene delivery process and transfilling of cylinders.
