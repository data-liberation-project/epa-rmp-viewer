The Tyler facility will be considered as a RMP Program 3 facility beginning in late September 2017 because the company intends to increase the quantities of acetylene and propylene stored on the site to above 10,000 pounds each.  The company does not manufacture acetylene or propylene and prior to submittal of this RMP, the onsite inventory was carefully managed to ensure that the site did not exceed a threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds of either product at any time.   \n\n\n\nThe following activities were conducted in support of the RMP, in accordance with EPA RMP guidance:\n\n?    A risk and gap assessment of the current and future operations at the site was conducted.\n\n?    The elements of a Program Level 3 RMP plan were prepared.\n\n?    A new health, safety, and environmental management system, to include the elements required by OSHA's PSM and EPA's RMP programs, was developed for the site \n\n        operations.\n\n?    The Offsite Consequence Analysis was conducted using the RMP*Comp model. \n\n?    The seismic analysis for the affected systems was reviewed for changes to the system, and changes to the building codes that may impact affected systems.\n\n?    The Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) for the facility was conducted using a combination What If/Checklist analysis method.\n\n?    TWS prepared a new RMP registration submittal to reflect the changes to the site operations, specifically increases in the quantities of acetylene and \n\n        propylene stored on the premises.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\n\nIt is the policy of Tyler Welder's Supply management to implement the requirements of this RMP.

This objective will be accomplished by utilizing equipment designed for safe operation; utilizing good operating procedures; providing appropriate training to affected employees; and by coordinating response activities, as necessary, with the off-site emergency response providers. TWS management is committed to providing the resources necessary to implement this policy.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND AFFECTED PROCESS\n\nThe TWS facility located at 3539 Hwy 271 in Tyler, Texas receives bulk acetylene and propylene from various suppliers and in turn transfills individual cylinders of various sizes from manifolds connected to bulk cylinder trailers (acetylene) or bulk storage tanks (propylene).   TWS has the potential to store up to 35,000 pounds of acetylene and up to 30,000 pounds of propylene in bulk tanks and individual compressed gas cylinder at the facility at any given time.  \n\n\n\nThe acetylene is stored in DOT over the road trailers until is transferred to the acetylene cylinder fill lines.  The site has the capacity to store hundreds of empty, partially filled, and filled acetylene cylinders, ranging in size from MC to AC5.   The TWS facility receives bulk acetylene trailers from suppliers and in turn transfills individual acetylene cylinders of various sizes from a manifold connected to the bulk cylinder trailer.   The trailers received at TWS each contain a total of 90,000 cubic feet of acetylene stored in 200 individual cylinders at 250 psig and connected together to a common header on the trailer.  A cubic foot of acetylene weighs .07 pounds, resulting in a total of 6,300 pounds of product for each trailer if fully loaded.\n\n\n\nThe propylene is stored in four 1,000-gallon horizontal bulk tanks until it is transferred through a short common manifold to a single nearby fill station and scal"

The facility consists of 7 single-story buildings used for retail sales, offices, cylinder filling, warehousing, cylinder inspection and refurbishment, and other related operations.  Light commercial and residential development is present in the areas around the facility.\n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nIn accordance with the requirements for the Risk Management Plan, TWS has conducted an offsite consequence analysis to evaluate various emergency release scenarios.
