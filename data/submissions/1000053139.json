Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nWe at Enterprise Providence Terminal are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated the design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release does occur, our response activities are coordinated with Rhode Island Hazardous Material Planning District 5.\n\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nOur facility's primary activity is the storage and handling of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). We have two (2) regulated substances present at our facility. These substances are propane and ethyl mercaptan (ethanethiol). Propane is received by marine vessels, stored on-site and loaded to trucks for distribution in the Providence area and other nearby states.  Ethyl mercaptan is used to odorize the propane delivered tot he trucks for safety purposes.\n\n\n\nBoth compounds are classified as flammable under 40 CFR Part 68. No compounds classified as toxic are stored or used at the facility in amounts above their threshold quantities.  Details on the amount of flammable materials held on the terminal site are contained in the RMP data elements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Release Scenarios    \n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances as a class involve a catastrophic release from Tank Storage. The scenario involves the release of the contents of the large refrigerated propane storage tank, which contains the largest single quantity of flammable material at the terminal.  The Envitronmental Protection Agency's RMP-Comp program was used to calculate the distance to a 1 psi overpressure endpoint for the calculated "

The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Explosion. This scenario is based on the rupture of a 2-inch truck loading line and assumes that active measures (hydrocarbon detectors and automatic shut-off devices) stop the flow within 20 seconds.  The maximum amount of propane vented is assumed to be involved in a vapor cloud explosion.  Details on the alternate case scenario are contained in the RMP registration data elements..\n\n\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps.\n\n \n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at Providence Terminal.  \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nEnterprise maintains a record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all applicable processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The HAZOP methodology is primarily used to carry out these analyses. Hazard Analysis Revalidations are usually conducted using a checklist to review the previous hazard analysis and to review modifications made to the facility since the last hazard analysis.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of not than five (5) years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Enterprise maintains written operating procedures. These procedures ad"

The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nEnterprise has a training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Refresher training is provided at least every three (3) years, and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nEnterprise carries out maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks include, among others: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, pumps, valves, gas detectors, flame detectors, and temperature and pressure switches. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Enterprise to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Reviews\n\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Enterprise.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nEnterprise has conducted a"

These audits have been carried out at least every three (3) years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits will be implemented as soon as possible to improve compliance with the requirements of the RMP Rule.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nEnterprise investigates any incident that results in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nEnterprise truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. Company employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facilityA?s implementation of the RMP rule.  The employees at the facility are involved in the implementation of many of the issues in the accident provention program, including participation in the process hazard analyses at the facility.  \n\n\n\nContractors\n\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance construction activities. Prior to selecting a contractor, an evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out. Enterprise has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractorA?s work and the processes. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur while they ar working at Providence Terminal.\n\n\n\n5.

Emergency Response Plan\n\nEnterprise maintains a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notifications or local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\n\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced. In addition, the emergency response plan is updated to reflect any changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.  A copy of the emergency response plan is given to local emergency responders to improve the community response should an incident occur.\n\n\n\n7.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nRecommendations for changes to improve safety can arise from hazard reviews, program audits, incident investigations and employee suggestions to improve the safety of the operations at Providence Terminal.  The following changes are currently planned to improve th e safety of the operations at the facility.\n\n\n\n*  A new programmable logic controller (PLC) based digital process control system has been installed at the terminal to improve opeator control of process operations and response to any emergency siturations. \n\n\n\n\n\n"
