The facility treats municipal wastewater which is chlorinated and dechlorinated in the gaseous form prior to discharge.  \n\n\n\nThe facility site has 6,000 pounds of chlorine stored at any given time, in cylinders.\n\n\n\nUnited Water Environmental Services has implemented a comprehensive program to safely manage chlorine at the facility.  United Water's executive management team has committed to full implementation of RMP/PSM programs to prevent the release of highly hazardous substances.\n\n\n\nThere have been no chlorine incidents in the most recent five-year history period.\n\n\n\nThe facility is subject to RMP and OSHA PSM for chlorine. \n\nA PSM Compliance Manual was developed for the site. Key items included in the manual were:\n\n\n\n?    Written site specific procedures for Employee Involvement, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Pre-Startup Reviews and Self Audits.\n\n\n\n?    Chlorine safety information as required by the regulations\n\n\n\n?    Standard Operating Procedures for chlorine management\n\n\n\n?    Chlorine system maintenance procedures \n\n\n\n?    Training on PSM and its key components including Management of Change, Mechanical Integrity and Incident Investigation.\n\n\n\n?    Conducting Process Hazards Analyses for the chlorine process\n\n\n\n?    Developing an Emergency Response Plan \n\n\n\n?    Training in support of the certification of operators\n\n          \n\nThe Operations Manager and Operations personnel annually review and update procedures and activities to maintain compliance with all aspects of the PSM/ RMP regulations. \n\n          \n\nIn addition to RMP/PSM compliance, the plant has implemented a number of programs to improve the safe handling of chlorine.\n\n\n\nA full vacuum delivery system was in"

The vacuum process has proven to greatly reduce leaks by reducing the amount of equipment that is exposed to pressurized chlorine.  \n\n\n\nPlant inventories are being maintained to a maximum of 3 1-ton containers of chlorine  onsite.\n\n\n\nThe site's Emergency Response Plan (ERP) has been significantly upgraded. The services of a Hazmat Team to provide hazardous materials response has been obtained. Where necessary, communication plans have been developed to residences that may be impacted by a release. Chlorine drills are being periodically conducted.\n\n\n\nIn addition to Process Safety Management, the organization has an active safety program. United Water Environmental Services has an active Safety Committee. The committee meets monthly and its duties include reviewing new safety procedures, accident investigations, safety surveys and safety communications.\n\n\n\nAt the Wastewater Plant, there are monthly safety meetings to review an OSHA subject or discuss a safety issue. Routine training is conducted for topics such as:\n\n\n\n- Hazard Communications\n\n\n\n-Personal Protective Equipment\n\n\n\n-Lockout/Tagout\n\n\n\n-Confined Space\n\n\n\n"
