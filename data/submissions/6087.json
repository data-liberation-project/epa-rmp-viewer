This is a closed loop system to maintain temperature in the facility production and storage areas.\n\nWorst-case Scenario:\nThe worst case scenario release to toxic endpoint was determined using the RMP Comp guidance for Anhydrous Ammonia. The scenario was based on the following criteria:\n\nVessel:                                             High Pressure Receiver\nAmount released:                             7,350 lbs\nDuration of release:                          10 minutes\nRelease rate:                                    735 lbs/min\nWind speed:                                      1.5 meter/sec\nAtmospheric stability:                        F\nTopography:                                      Urban\n\nBased on the RMP Comp the toxic endpoint for this worst case scenario is 0.40 miles.\n\nAlternative Worst Case Scenario:\nThe alternative release scenario was determined using the RMP Comp guidance for Anhydrous Ammonia.
