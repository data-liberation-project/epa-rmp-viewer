The Facility Policy\n     The management, employees and board of directors of the Hamilton Farm Bureau Cooperative, Inc.\n     Are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia..  If an\n     accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, County LEPC, or other\n     authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n    The Hamilton Farm Bureau Cooperative, Inc. houses several customer service centers.  They include\n    five divisions; Agronomy, Feed Mill/Grain Elevator, Energy, Egg Processing, Lumber Supply\n    and Main Office.  Aproximately 160 people are employed at this location.\n    Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application\n    by farmers.  The maximum  quantity stored would be 204,000 pounds in two storage tanks, one of   \n    30,000 gallons and one of 18,000 gallons.  Anhydrous Ammonia is received by both trucks and rail. \n    \n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario for Anhydrous Ammonia:\n     A.   The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank,\n           released as a gas over a 10 minute period.  The maximum quantity released would be\n           127,500 pounds from largest storage tank, which represents the volume of the tanks at 85 percent\n           capacity as limited by design standards and administrative controls.  The distance to the endpoint\n           (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.16 miles.\n      B.  The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release form a break\n            in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .56 miles.\n\n4.  The accidental release prevetion program.\n      A.
