The alternate release scenario for chlorine will affect a residental population of 32 from Omussee Creek within 0.6 miles.\n\n\n\nThe WWT Division has complied with the OSHA PSM rule, although Alabama is not an OSHA state. The WWT Division conducts training for all operators in SOP,safe handling,and emergency response procedures. All safety equipment is regularly inspected and calibrated. Both training and inspections are documented.\n\n\n\nThe WWT Division has had no accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide gas in the last five years.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, WWT plant personnel wll notify the Dothan Fire Department by either radio or land line. The Dothan Fire Department's hazardous material team will take charge of stopping or mitigating the release of gas. The City of Dothan HAZ-MAT Team conducts quarterly Emergencey Response Drills.  \n\n      \n\nPerimeter motion sensors have been installed to detect the presence of unauthorized personnel entering the plant or the chemical storage area.\n\n\n\nThe WWT Division reviews SOP, conducts hazard analysis and performs an audit every three years in compliance with the OSHA PSM ru"
