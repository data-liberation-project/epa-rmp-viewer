We use a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning programs (ERPP) to help ensure the safety of the environment, the public and our workers. This document provides brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented and includes:\n\n - A description of our facility and the substances handled that are regulated by the EPA's RMP criteria;\n\n - An overview of our accidental release prevention programs;\n\n - The five-year history of accidental releases of chemicals that are regulated by EPA's RMP criteria and that meet EPA's criteria for reporting;\n\n - An overview of our emergency response program;\n\n - An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accident chemical releases from occurring and therefore adversely affecting the environment, public and ultimately our employees. \n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nVIIA St. Charles Terminal is a for-hire liquid storage terminal. Chemicals and refined petroleum products represent the majority of the bulk liquids stored, handled and transported in this facility. Products are received into and transported from the facility via ship, barge, pipeline, tank car and tank truck. \n\nAt this time the facility is storing six RMP-regulated chemicals which are as follows:\n\n    Ammonia (anhydrous)\n\n    Ethylenediamine [1,2-Ethaneiamine]\n\n    1-Pentene\n\n    Propylene [1-Propene]\n\n    1,3-Butadiene\n\n    Propane\n\n\n\nPyrolysis Gasoline (PyGas) contains several of the chemicals listed above in regimented amounts (reference SDS for more information). Ammonia (anhydrous) and Ethylenediamine [1,2-Ethaneiamine] are not part of mixtures and are the only RMP-listed toxics found in the operation.  1-3 Butadiene is also ha"

Our management system addresses each key feature of a successful prevention program including:\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOperating Procedures and Training\n\nMaintenance and Mechanical Integrity Programs\n\nManagement of Change\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nCompliance audits\n\nIncident Investigations\n\nEmployee Participation plans\n\nSafe Work Permits and other work derivative plans\n\nContractor Performance and Safety Plans\n\n\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program are utilized to prevent accidental releases at the St. Charles location. VIIA and its workers are committed to the standard that these system management systems set for the way we conduct business. Our corporate annual sustainability goals act as a control to help ensure that we are meeting the highest standard for accident prevention. \n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no releases of a regulated substance from a covered process in the past five years that resulted in onsite/offsite deaths, injuries, significant property and/or environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place. \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nVIIA maintains various contingency plans which address federal and state regulatory requirements for emergency response planning. Each program provides essential planning and training for effectively protecting the environment and the public during emergency situations. Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the community emergency response plan (Hahnville/St. Charles Parish). \n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThese include routine work process management reviews/audits to aid in optimizing operational discipline and address process safety gaps.
