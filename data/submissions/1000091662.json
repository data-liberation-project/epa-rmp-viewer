VIIA and its workers are committed to the standard that these system management systems set for the way we conduct business. Our corporate annual sustainability goals act as a control to help ensure that we are meeting the highest standard for accident prevention. \r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nThere have been no releases of a regulated substance from a covered process in the past five years that resulted in onsite/offsite deaths, injuries, significant property and/or environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place. \r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\nVIIA maintains various contingency plans which address federal and state regulatory requirements for emergency response planning. Each program provides essential planning and training for effectively protecting the environment and the public during emergency situations. Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the community emergency response plan (Hahnville/St. Charles Parish). \r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nThese include routine work process management reviews/audits to aid in optimizing operational discipline and address process safety gaps.
