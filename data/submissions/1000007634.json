Appropriate personal protection equipment is readily available.\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThe Bayer BMS plant experienced one incident meeting the RMP accident reporting criteria in the past five years.  A run-away reaction in the Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI) manufacturing unit overpressured a process vessel.  There were 17 OSHA recordable injuries and 22 first aid cases.  Ammonia was released.  There were no off-site impacts from this incident.  The process was thoroughly investigated and numerous improvements incorporated into the revised operations.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nBayer Baytown maintains a trained emergency response team on site at all times.  Each shift has an emergency response team with up-to-date training.  There are emergency medical technicians on each shift and an ambulance and fire truck staged for their immediate use.  An auxiliary trailer has additional equipment (air bottles, escape equipment, etc.) for immediate access during emergencies.\n\nThe emergency team includes members who have completed requirements for hazard materials (HazMat) response. Equipment for emergency HazMat response use has been prepared and staged at this facility.  \n\nThere is a designated organization which responds during daytime emergencies and off-shift emergencies.  The Emergency Operations Center (EOC) has equipment (maps, warning systems, P&ID drawings, MSDS, etc.) and supplies to direct the response.  The EOC is equipped with an emergency response modeling system to estimate the potential effects of a release on other areas of the facility or the community.  The EOC maintains lists of personnel to notify during an emergency.  The list also includes local emergency response personnel and organizations. \n \nThe Bayer Baytown facility is active in the Mutual Aid of Mont Belvieu (MBMA) industry mutual aid organization.

The talk was broadcast globally to all Bayer facilities.\n\nDescription of the Facility\n\nLocated in West Chambers County on 1,700 acres along Cedar Bayou, Bayer\u00c2\u00bfs first operating units came on line in 1971 with steady growth continuing over the next 30+ years.  The site doubled its manufacturing capacity between 1997 and 2001 with Bayer\u00c2\u00bfs largest-ever capital expansion ($1.4 billion). Known today as an industrial park, approximately 35% of the Bayer acreage is developed.  Bayer hosts four guest facilities (Hexion, El Dorado Nitrogen, First Chemical Texas, and Texas Brine) to provide raw materials for the facility and one energy center (Calpine Corporation) to produce steam and electricity for the entire complex.\n\nThe site is serviced by barge, rail and truck and has pipeline service to and from industry along the Houston Ship Channel region.\n\nPrimarily supporting the automotive and construction industries, products manufactured by Bayer Baytown include: \n\u00c2\u00bf\tpolycarbonate thermoplastic (used in CD/DVD\u00c2\u00bfs, auto and optical lenses, medical supplies and sports equipment)\n\u00c2\u00bf\traw materials for polyurethane foams (used in home and appliance insulation, cushions, and auto trim) \n\u00c2\u00bf\thigh-performance coatings (used in automotive, wood, flooring and furniture coatings) \n\u00c2\u00bf\tbasic inorganic chemical products, such as chlorine, hydrochloric acid,  and caustic, to be used as raw materials in our other processes, and for products for industry\n\n\nRisk Management Program (RMP)\n\nBayer Baytown has seven processes covered under RMP.  The management team at Bayer BMS - Baytown has designated the site as a Process Safety Management site.  All processes are covered at the full PSM level and are considered to be Program Level III processes under the scope of Risk Management.\n\nThere are five chemicals that are used in quantities greater than the threshold quantities as defined in the RMP regulations:\n\u00c2\u00bf\tAmmonia\n\u00c2\u00bf\tChlorine"

No covered flammable compounds are used at the site.\n\nManagement of Risk\n\nThe site is covered by Process Safety Management (PSM).  PSM (29 CFR 1910.119) is intended to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals. The PSM elements are:\n\nEmployee Participation:\nEmployees participate on numerous safety steering committees that potentially affect the work life of each area at the Bayer Baytown site.  Action items identified from inspections, incidents, process hazards analyses, etc. are provided to employees for review.  Involvement of personnel in the OSHA-VPP program has been exceptional.\n\nProcess Safety Information:\nAll site personnel have access to the company\u00c2\u00bfs electronic mail system and Intranet.  Chemical-specific information (Material Safety Data Sheets), operating information, and information on the equipment in the process are easily accessible.  The information resides in a controlled electronic system that is updated regularly.  All Process Safety Information (PSI) is verified at each scheduled process hazards analysis.\n\nProcess Hazards Analysis:\nEvery five years, process hazards analyses (PHA\u00c2\u00bfs) are conducted in each process unit.  The HazOp method is used to conduct PHA\u00c2\u00bfs.  Findings are identified, prioritized and then promptly corrected.  The information is shared with personnel who are impacted by the findings.  The action items and completion schedules are available through the electronic system.  Improvements in process control systems and safeguards are outcomes of the PHA process.\n\nOperating Procedures:\nOperating procedures addressing normal and abnormal operating situations are in place and implemented.

Employee training is documented and tracked through a network system.  The system allows specific training needs to be identified as well as tracks the completion of required modules. \n\nContractor Safety:\nControl of contractor activity in operating areas is well established.  A safety steering committee and safety council actively monitors the actions of contractors to assure their safety; the safety of the Bayer facility and its employees is maintained. Contract employees are required to participate annually in comprehensive industry safety training. \n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews:\nReviews are conducted of any new facility, major modification, or a change (management of change) before the new system can become operational.  Findings are addressed prior to startup.\n\nMechanical Integrity:\nMechanical integrity procedures are in place to ensure that maintenance workers understand how to perform their duties safely to maintain the facility.  Specific instructions for testing and inspections are included.  Testing and inspections are conducted as scheduled and documented.  Maintenance and engineering follow established codes, standards and company guidelines.\n\nHot Work and Control of Abnormal Activities:\nControl of hot work and non-normal situations is conducted to ensure that work does not contribute to or cause hazardous results.
