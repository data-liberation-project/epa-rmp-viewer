(\"Plains\") is committed to managing all operations in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of employees, customers, contractors and the public while fully complying with applicable laws and regulations. Plains management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the environmental, health and safety management systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.\r\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the facility, and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\r\n\r\nThe Brule Terminal is owned/operated by Plains, with local operation by Midwest Pacific Railroad. At the facility, railcars are stored on the property until marketing can find a suitable market for the liquids. Butane  is the only substance regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that is present at the Brule Terminal in amounts above threshold quantity. The facility is classified as Program Level 1 under the regulation.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by Plains. These high standards include:\r\n\u00bf\tOperating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations.\r\n\u00bf\tOperating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\r\n\u00bf\tOperating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\r\n\u00bf\tCorrectin"

      "SummaryText": "g non-compliance found during regular audits of the facility.\r\n\r\nPrevention Program\r\n\r\nThe Brule Terminal does not operate under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program since the facility is normally unmanned and remote. Since the facility has no public receptors within the worst case scenario distance, the facility is a Program Level 1 facility. No specific prevention program is required.\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nNo incident resulting in onsite injuries, death or property damage or offsite impacts from a butane release has occurred at the Brule Terminal within the last five years.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe facility has developed an emergency response plan, which will be coordinated with local emergency response groups such as the Mitchell Fire Department. The facility operator is responsible for coordinating the notifications required to initiate an emergency response. The Emergency Response Plan provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nCompliance with the environmental, health and safety management systems forms the framework for continuous safety improvement. Specific actions that will be taken in the future to improve the level of safety at the facility include:\r\n\u00bf\tCompliance reviews will ensure that the level of safety protection at the facility is periodically being evaluated for improvements.\r\n\u00bf\tAn ongoing dialogue with the local Fire Department will ensure a constant state of readiness to respond to any potential emergencies, as well as a means to implement improvements as the need develops."
