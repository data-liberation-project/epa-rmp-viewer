Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nTaylor Farms California conducts inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment prior to startup and during operations. These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases. On-site personnel and certified refrigeration contractors review the equipment as required. On-site personnel provide initial emergency response. On-site personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide first response. First response may include emergency equipment shutdown, system isolation, or controlled operation such as pump down to prevent or reduce an off-site release. No emergency operations will be performed that are beyond the capabilities of the operators or other on-site personnel. Local fire and police departments with mutual aid response will provide emergency response for a major release event. Refrigeration contractors would also be on-call to provide emergency response. Emergency response training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required to for new employees. Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\n\n\n2.    Description of Source and Substance Handled\n\nTaylor Farms California uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in their operations. The ammonia system is used for vacuum cooling, produce cooling, and water chilling. The refrigeration system at the facility is composed of fixed equipment, including: a reciprocating compressor, screw compressors, evaporative condensers, pressure vessels, ammonia pumps, evaporative cooling coils, falling-film water chillers, a plate and frame heat exchanger, ammonia detection, control systems and diffusion tank. The facility has six cold rooms housing the air-cool evaporators: the Raw Product Room, Cold Room A, Cold Room B, Cold Room C, Cold Room D, and the Vestibule. The mechanical "

This facility operates seasonally from approximately April 15 through November 15. The facility pumps down all the ammonia in the system to the high pressure receiver and low pressure receiver during the off season. The water chillers are moved to the Taylor Farms Food Service Facility in Yuma, AZ during the company's winter operation between November and April. \n\nAll compressors have safety switches that would shut down the compressors upon detection of unsafe operating conditions. Visual and audible alarms are installed on the low pressure receiver in case a high level situation arises in the vessel. The low pressure receiver high level float switch also shuts down the compressors when it senses a high liquid level in the vessel. The refrigeration control panel inside the electrical room schedules the fan coil defrost times and monitors the ammonia detectors inside the cold rooms. The system sends alarms to the refrigeration manager in the event of ammonia detection in the cold rooms. All pressure vessels and compressors are protected against high-pressure situations by safety relief valves. There are assigned responders (refrigeration contractors) experienced with ammonia refrigeration that respond to and determine specific actions for any incident. The refrigeration systems at the facility was constructed as per applicable codes and industry standards at the time of construction. The total ammonia charge of the refrigeration systems at the facility is approximately 10,800 lb. The refrigeration systems at this facility are single-stage vapor compression cycles. In general, the process chemistries for these systems are shown in Section V.A.2 in the hardcopy RMP binder.\n\nRefrigeration drawings are located in Appendix A.2-Refrigeration System Drawings in the hardcopy RMP binder, with refrigeration equipment locations found on sheets R1.0 and R2.0.

International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) \"Ammonia Refrigeration Safety Inspection Checklists,\" located in Appendix A.1 in the hardcopy RMP binder, describe equipment details.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas in its natural state and is extremely irritating to mucous membranes and lung tissue. The gas is pungent and may be suffocating as shortness of breath and labored breathing can develop if inhaled. Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and/ or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions. Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain and serious skin burn. See Appendix A.4 in the hardcopy RMP binder for Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\n3.    Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nTaylor Farms California maintains a release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases. The program includes regular inspections, monitoring equipment and logging conditions, scheduled maintenance, and operator training. There is a program to analyze releases for ways to prevent a similar future release, see Appendix J-Incident Investigation in the hardcopy RMP binder.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has specific safety procedures to prevent a release. Operators, contractors and mechanics are trained for safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system. They are also trained in emergency reporting and monitoring and assisting local emergency responders in the event of an ammonia release. There are emergency shut-off switches in the equipment yard for shutting down the king valve and to turn off the pumps. Ammonia detectors are installed in all refrigerated rooms. Personnel will automatically be notified if any detector exceeds its set point. Monitoring is done 24 hours per day. All of the re"

Five-Year Accident History\n\nAccording to Taylor Farms California personnel, there has been no releases of anhydrous ammonia in the last 5 years. \n\n\n\n5.    Emergency Response Program   \n\nTaylor Farms California is a \"Non-Responding\" facility. The facility only responds to situations that are within their capabilities. These may include emergency shutdown, equipment isolation and pumping down the system. No emergency response actions or site clean-up that are beyond the capabilities of the refrigeration personnel will be performed. In case of an emergency, the incident will be reported immediately to Safety Coordinator, Facility Managers, and RMP administrator. The Safety Coordinator is responsible in assisting county emergency responders upon arrival on site. This may include contacting emergency response agencies, schools, daycare centers, and acute care facilities that may be affected by the release. The Safety Coordinator will also be responsible for evacuation of employees if necessary and for coordination with community emergency responders if off-site evacuations are required.\n\n\n\n6.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nRecommended corrective actions to mitigate the potential for an accidental ammonia release are proposed on the tables located in Section VIII in the hardcopy RMP binder. The table items are a result from recommendations made during the Process Hazard Analysis, a Code Compliance Review, and a Safety Inspection performed by a qualified person. Some corrective items in the recommendation table originate from multiple codes but are listed only once. Specific facility areas and systems categorize recommendations resulting from the Safety Inspection, some of which may repeat general Process Hazard Analysis and Code Compliance Review items. Based on the severity of the hazards identified, implementation deadlines are also recommended. All "
