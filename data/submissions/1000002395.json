This objective will never be compromised and is the most basic obligation of all personnel at the plant. In fulfilling this commitment, we ensure that all Corporate Environmental, Health and Safety Policies and Principles are strictly followed. \n\nCollectively we have the responsibility to provide a positive impact on the Kankakee Community. This is accomplished by the elimination of hazardous exposures, injuries, fires, environmental releases, or damage to property. We are firmly committed to the protection of the health and welfare of our employees and the surrounding community. This objective is accomplished by using a hierarchy of controls, which emphasize engineering controls followed by administrative controls and personal protective equipment.\n \nThe plant's Emergency Response Plan is based upon a combination of governmental and company requirements. Local response capabilities have been reviewed to ensure a coordinated response with all appropriate agencies. The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire and police departments, governmental agencies, as well as any potentially affected neighbors.\n \nKankakee Facility and Regulated Substance Handled:\n \n\u00c2\u00b7 The primary purpose of the Rohm and Haas Kankakee Plant is to produce emulsions.  One of the raw materials used for the production of these emulsions is Vinyl Acetate, which is regulated under the EPA RMP Rule.  The finished product leaving the plant contains very low concentrations of this chemical, such that they no longer present a toxicity hazard.\n\u00c2\u00b7 Vinyl Acetate is transported to the plant in both rai"

All persons seeking to enter the plant are screened and required to undergo training in the plant safety rules prior to entry.\n   \nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program And Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n \nThe Rohm and Haas Kankakee Plant Program's comply with OSHA PSM and the EPA RMP Rules, as well as with all applicable governmental codes and regulations.  Included in the Kankakee Plant's accidental release prevention plans are  automated processes with level and flow measurement and control, minimum inventories of chemicals,  automatic emergency shut-off valves on process vessels, fixed foam system at the unloading area, redundant safety interlock systems, preventative maintenance programs, chemical detectors, remotely operated valves to isolate and minimize a release, annual training of employees, and multiple layers of site security. A comprehensive training and testing program has been developed for all plant employees to ensure that all equipment is operated in a safe and efficient manner.\n\nIncluded in the Kankakee Plant's Emergency Response Program are trained Incipient Fire Responders, trained Technician Level HAZMAT Responders, trained Industrial Medical Responders, trained Incident Commanders, onsite fire and spill response foam capability, onsite HAZMAT response equipment, fixed water spray fire protection systems, strategically located chemical sensors, onsite fire water containment basin(s), plant notification systems including alarms, phones, and radios, and neighbor/community notification procedures.

      "SummaryText": "maintained ready for use throughout all plant operations.\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History:\n \nDuring the past five years, no releases of Vinyl Acetate with off site consequences have occurred. \n \nEmergency Response Program:\n \nThe Rohm and Haas Kankakee Plant has an emergency response plan that has been coordinated with the community plan. The plan includes procedures for public notification of emergencies that may affect the surrounding community.  Our responders have participated in training and drills with the local fire department. Site HAZMAT plans are also coordinated with a private outside contractor. The site emergency response plan has been designed to meet the requirements of all relevant regulations requiring emergency response plans.  The plan is intended to prevent hazardous material spills, protect the health and well-being of Rohm and Haas employees and neighbors, protect the assets of Rohm and Haas and its neighbors, protect the environment, and to serve as a reference for responders in the event of an emergency.\n \nPlanned Changes To Improve Safety:\n\nThe Rohm and Haas Kankakee Plant has conducted numerous risk based studies on the processes which involve Vinyl Acetate.  These studies have validated that the existing process can be operated safely. Currently, the facility is considering the effectiveness of adding additional foam capabilities in the Vinyl Acetate Storage Tank and Dike Area. A decision will be made in the future as to whether this specific change will enhance safe operations. Additionally, the Kankakee Plant will continue past practices of periodically reviewing this processes to ensure continued safe operations."
