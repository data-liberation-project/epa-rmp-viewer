PGDP employees use both safety equipment and administrative controls to reduce the probability of a chlorine release.  These controls range from installation of vacuum regulators to frequent replacement of container valves.  The second type of control is one that mitigates the release once it has occurred.  These controls include the lazy rods, respirators, ventilation systems, and the chlorine detection and alarm systems that, either directly or indirectly, inititate emergency response actions.  The third method of controlling personnel injuries is to limit exposure time.  This is accomplished by providing alarms for personnel inside and outside the facility, adequate egress, and eyewash/safety showers within a reasonable distance from the chlorine source.",

INTRODUCTION\n\nThe United States Enrichment Corporation (USEC) has prepared a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PGDP).  The RMP is in accordance with the requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68.  The PGDP plant is subject to Process Safety Management (PSM) and RMP requirements.\n\n2.   MANAGEMENT AND ORGANIZATION\n\nUSEC is committed to conducting operations in a manner that protects the health and safety of the workers and the public, and protects the environment.  In order to meet these commitments, USEC has issued an operations policy manual which states, in part:  USEC is ultimately responsible for, and is committed to, safe operations,  maintenance, design, fabrication, and testing of the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant and is committed to conducting operations in a manner that protects the health and safety of workers and the public, protects the environment, and provides for the common defense and security.\n\nProgram and staff organizations are established for safety, safeguards and quality, and environmental, safety, and health with sufficient resources to support the line organization in safe operation of the plant.\n\n3.   GENERAL DESCRIPTION\n\n3.1  Facility Description\n\nPGDP enriches uranium using the gaseous diffusion process.  PGDP is located on a 3,425-acre site, of which 748 acres are within the controlled plant security fence.  The entire facility is owned by the United States Department of Energy (DOE).  \n\nUSEC leases and operates a  portion of the plant. The portion of PGDP leased by USEC contains more than 115 buildings with a total floor space of about 8 million square feet.  Four large enrichment process buildings constitute approximately 75 percent of the plants' total floor space.  There are also cooling towers, electrica"

Chlorine is managed in accordance with the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119 PSM program.\n\n3.3  Use of Regulated Substances\n\nRaw water is taken from the Ohio River, treated and supplied to PGDP for numerous uses.  A portion of the water is filtered and post-disinfected, using chlorine, and used to supply potable water, fire system water, cooling water, and other uses.  Raw water treatment takes place at the C-611 Water Treatment Plant which is located to the west of the plant.  Chlorine is used at two locations at C-611.  One location has two containers with one container connected to the manifold system, and one location with four containers of which two are connected to the manifold system at any time.\n\nA portion of the water treated at C-611 is provided to the recirculating cooling water (RCW) system.  This system provides cooling water to the enrichment process.  RCW is treated with chlorine, via chlorinators in four RCW pump houses,  to control the growth of microorganisms in the RCW system.  Two pump houses have two 1-ton containers with one container connected to the manifold system, and two pump houses have four 1-ton containers of which two are connected to the manifold system at any time.\n\nChlorine is also stored in 1-ton containers at a storage yard near the western boundary of the fenced area and at a storage yard near the C-611 facility. \n\n4.

      "SummaryText": "e have been no major releases of chlorine involving injury to site workers,  environmental effects, or any impact to the public within the past five years.  Chlorine releases have been limited to small leaks from manifolds and manifold connections.\n\n5.   ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nChemical safety at PGDP consists of the integration of environmental, safety, and health management systems to address chemical safety.  Chemical safety controls are designed to mitigate the adverse affects of the toxic materials used in the enrichment process to workers, the public, and the environment.  To achieve this objective, safety analyses, process hazard analyses, and industrial hygiene and safety programs are utilized.\n\n5.1  Systems\n\nAll chlorine feed facilities are equipped with container-mounted vacuum regulators which reduce the pressure of the chlorine from the vapor pressure of the liquid chlorine in the container to a partial vacuum.  Loss of vacuum for any reason causes the vacuum-regulating valve to close the gas supply, minimizing the release in the event of a break in the manifold.\n\nAll chlorine feed facilities are equipped with chlorine detectors which provide alarms to plant personnel in the event of a release.\n\nManually operated, remote valve closing rods are administratively required to be in place on the stem of open 1-ton chlorine container valves.  These valves can be operated from outside of the chlorinator rooms in the event of a release from the manifold system.\n\n5.2  Procedures\n\nPlant procedures are prepared in accordance with the requirements of a formal procedure system.  The procedure program includes the development, review and approval, revision process, distribution, and procedure configuration management.  Specific procedures for the operation and maintenance of chlorine systems and the handling of chlorine cylinders are managed within this procedure system.\n\n5.3  Training\n\nEmployee training is conducted by a dedicated training organization"

Personnel who operate, maintain, manage, handle, and have emergency response duties for chemicals covered by PSM are adequately trained for the particular chemical system or related activity.\n\nIf activities performed by non-PGDP personnel (contractor personnel) interface with chemical systems, appropriate training and guidance is required.  PGDP representatives provide guidance for training and job performance.\n\n5.4  Maintenance and Inspection\n\nThe Engineering group, in conjunction with the specific facility maintenance organizations and the manufacturer's recommendations, develops maintenance and inspection requirements and criteria for chemical systems.  These chemical safety requirements are based on PSM program requirements for the particular system.\n\nMaintenance of chemical systems is performed in accordance with the facility maintenance programs that include the PSM Mechanical Integrity program for systems covered under PSM.\n\nMaintenance work packages are prepared to provide the necessary technical and safety guidance for maintenance activities.\n\n5.5  Preventive Maintenance\n\nManufacturer's recommendations are used as guides for preventive maintenance on specific chemical systems and equipment.  Equipment installed or maintenance services provided by contractors for chemical systems are tested and inspected by the contractor as required by the contract for that project.  PGDP personnel also perform independent inspection and testing.\n\n5.6  Quality Considerations\n\nIndependent overview of maintenance activities on chemical hardware is addressed by the Quality Assurance and Configuration Management programs, as applicable.

The pre-startup safety review is an independent review to address the readiness of the system hardware, associated hazard controls, personnel (including required training), and procedures.  If the change does not require a change to process safety information, a pre-startup safety review is not performed.\n\n6.   EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nPGDP maintains a written Emergency Plan.  The Emergency Management organization is responsible for maintaining and updating the plan as appropriate.\n\n6.1  Organization\n\nThe Emergency Response Organization (ERO) is responsible for taking immediate mitigative and corrective actions to minimize the consequences of an incident involving the release of toxic substances (including chlorine) to workers, public health and safety, and the environment.
