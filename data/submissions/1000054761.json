      "SummaryText": "The Kiel, Wisconsin facility of Land O'Lakes, Inc. is a cheese manufacturing plant located in an urban setting.  The only highly hazardous chemical stored or otherwise used in sufficient quantity to require reporting under 40CFR68 is anhydrous ammonia, CAS #7664-41.7.  The chemical is used in a closed circuit mechanical refrigeration process. \n\n\n\nThe quantity of anhydrous ammonia in the process requires that Land O'Lakes - Kiel have an OSHA Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals:  this PSM program creates all of the accidental release prevention policies for this facility.  \n\n\n\nFacility employees will not respond to accidental releases of ammonia at this facility:  the community emergency response plans of Calumet County and Manitowoc County have included this Land O'Lakes facility.  Appropriate mechanisms are in place to notify these authorities when there is a need for response:  facility employees will call \"911\" and the emergency operators will notify the county hazardous materials response teams.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for this facility is the release of a completely-filled High Pressure Receiver whose contents would be expelled in 10 minutes during an idle system event, which is extremely rare.  The alternative release scenario is the inadvertent rupture of a refrigerant-containing pipe above the roof, due to human negligence.  For the alternative, more-likely scenario, planned mitigation measures include limiting access to the roof piping areas to only safety-trained employees and contractor employees.  Constantly secured access doors are the only means of roof access.  For the worst-case scenario, administrative controls include the strict regulation of process operations which might require the complete idling of the process.  The High Pressure Receiver is located in a remote indoor area, with restricted access, in an automatically fire sprinklered room.\n\n\n\nOnly trained refrigeration operator employees and contractor employees a"

      "SummaryText": "re allowed access to the refrigeration machinery room, for the purposes of conducting inspections, tests and maintenance.\n\n\n\nThere have been no ammonia process accidents in five years.\n\n\n\nThe facility has only an OSHA 1910.38 Emergency Action Plan, and does not have an OSHA 1910.120(q) HAZWOPER plan.  There are airborne ammonia detectors located in refrigeration machinery room which will generate attended alarms in the event of chemical releases above the permissible exposure limits.  Facility employees and visitors will be evacuated or sheltered in place, as the specific conditions may warrant.  Kiel Fire Department will be the first responders and they may enlist the assistance of county HAZMAT teams if needed. Plans to improve safety include scheduling and annually conducting onsite mock scenario drills with local fire and county HAZMAT groups.\n\n"
