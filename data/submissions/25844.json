The Diemer Plant will assemble an audit team that will include personnel knowledgeable in the Risk Management Program rule and in the process.  This team will evaluate whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the Risk Management Program rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process.  The results of the audit will be documented, recommendations resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program will be implemented.\nIncident Investigation\nDiemer Plant investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release (serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment) so that similar accidents can be prevented.  An investigation team is assembled and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.

MWDSC provides approximately 60 percent of the drinking water used by nearly 16 million people living on the southern California coastal plain between Ventura County and the Mexican border.\nDisinfection is a critical process used by MWDSC in the treatment of its drinking water.  Disinfection helps to protect public health by killing pathogens in the water and preventing the spread of waterborne diseases.  The use of chlorine as a disinfectant in the treatment of drinking water and wastewater has been the dominant disinfection method in the United States since it was introduced, around the beginning of this century.  MWDSC currently utilizes bulk chlorine for disinfection at all of its water treatment plants, including the Robert B. Diemer Filtration Plant (Diemer Plant).\nAs one might expect from its superior disinfection properties, chlorine is a hazardous substance.  Thus, storing and handling chlorine can present a risk to employees and the public without proper precautions.  MWDSC regards safe practices in the storing and usage of chlorine to be of primary importance and has an excellent safety record with chlorine.\nDiemer Plant\u00bfs chlorine storage and usage process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule (RMPR) and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program regulation.  Both of these regulations require submission of a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  It has also been determined that the chlorination facility qualifies as a Program 3 process under both RMPR and the CalARP Program.  An integral part of the RMP is a summary of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility, including a description of the possible consequences in case of an accident and the actions, which will be taken, by the facility in an emergency.\nThe following"

As discussed in the Executive Summary of the 1999 RMP submission under \u00bfPlanned Changes to Improve Safety,\u00bf MWDSC decided to provide a chlorine containment and scrubbing system to capture and neutralize an accidental chlorine release at the Diemer chlorination facility.  The decision to install the chlorine containment and scrubbing system was made to further enhance safety and mitigate offsite consequences of an accidental chlorine release. The chlorine containment and scrubbing system is now in operation.\nThe information required in the RMP Executive Summary is provided below for the upgraded chlorination facility at the MWDSC Diemer Plant.\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe MWDSC accidental release prevention policy for chlorine involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, trains staff in operation and maintenance practices, and uses tested and proven management system practices.  All applicable CalARP and RMPR Prevention Program requirements are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \nThe MWDSC emergency response policy for hazardous materials, including chlorine, involves the preparation of integrated contingency plans, which address emergency response for hazardous materials and are tailored to each facility.

This emergency response plan has been updated to reflect the new containment and scrubbing system and is being coordinated with local response agencies (Orange County Fire Authority and Anaheim Fire Department).  Diemer Plant has had an excellent safety record of chlorine use.\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\nThe Diemer Plant is located at 3972 Valley View Avenue in Yorba Linda, California.  The plant is situated north of the State Highway 91, and just east of State Highway 57 covering 200 acres.  The plant is designed to treat drinking water, including disinfection with chlorine.  The facility stores and uses chlorine, a regulated toxic substance under the RMPR and CalARP Program rules, as well as the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Cal/OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard. \nThe chlorination system at the Diemer Plant is composed of the following components: (1) a totally contained chlorine feed system to receive, store, and deliver liquid chlorine to the evaporators, chlorine expansion vessels, associated piping and valving, leak sensors and monitors, and instrumentation, (2) totally contained evaporators to heat chlorine and convert it to gas for use in the chlorinators (evaporator units, associated piping and valving, and instrumentation), (3) totally contained chlorinators to regulate flow of chlorine gas under vacuum to the ejectors (chlorinator units, associated piping and valving, and instrumentation), (4) ejectors to mix the chlorine gas with service water and inject chlorine solution at application points throughout the plant, and (5) chlorine gas treatment system for capture and neutralization of a chlorine release in the"

The storage vessels are totally contained in the chlorination facility storage bays at the east end of the Diemer Plant.\nThe process flow for the chlorination system begins at the liquid chlorine angle valves located on the storage vessels in each storage bay, connected by flexible metallic hose to the fixed piping system.  Liquid chlorine is transferred by its own vapor pressure from an on-line storage vessel in each storage bay to one or more evaporators in each evaporator room. \nEach evaporator uses an electrically heated water bath to vaporize the liquid chlorine. The chlorinators regulate the flow of chlorine gas (under vacuum) through venturi eduction to the ejectors.  The ejectors are located at various points throughout the facility, and introduce chlorine (under vacuum) into a water stream to form chlorine solution that subsequently mixes with the water supply at different stages of the treatment process for disinfection purposes.\nChlorine leak detectors are provided at various locations in the storage bays, evaporator rooms, chlorinator rooms, and pipe tunnels.  Based on the concentration and location of chlorine detected, the leak detection system will activate a succession of safety measures, beginning with visual and audible alarms, then start-up of the chlorine neutralization system and shutdown of the normal ventilation system, and, finally, automatically closing storage vessel liquid chlorine angle valve.  The Midland shutoff device is pneumatically driven and will either be activated automatically by an elevated chlorine concentration at several sensors or can be operated remotely to manually close the storage vessel liquid chlorine valves from several locations.\nA packed-bed chlorine gas scrubber system, consisting of two parallel scrubber units, is provi"

Caustic soda (20%) is used as the scrubbing media.  Emergency showers and eye wash stations are also provided throughout the chlorination facility and beside the scrubber system.\nThe chlorine pressure reducing valves, vacuum regulator valves, leak detectors, and computer control system are connected to uninterruptible power supply (UPS) system.  In the event power is lost at the chlorination facility, an alarm will alert the control room and activate an emergency generator system, which provides backup power within 5 to 10 seconds to run the filtration plant.\nThe control room at the plant is manned 24 hours a day, seven days a week, year round by at least two people.  Access to the plant is through guarded security gates, which are closed after regular hours, but monitored and controlled by the control room.  The chlorine area is monitored by video camera from the control room and has door alarms.  The plant is patrolled by security personnel around the clock.\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified as worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario.  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that the owner or operator shall assume that the ... maximum quantity in the largest vessel ... is released as a gas over 10-minutes, due to an unspecified failure. The alternative scenario is defined as more likely to occur than the worst?case release scenario.\nRMPR and CalARP regulations for Program 3 processes require an offsite consequence analysis for one worst-case release scenario that is estimated to create the greatest distance in any direction to a toxic endpoint resulting from an accidental release of regulated toxic substances from covered processes.

      "SummaryText": "uce offsite impacts under this scenario.  The scenario used for Diemer Plant is the release of the maximum quantity of chlorine in a single storage vessel over a 10-minute duration.  The chlorine is stored in an enclosed building, which results in a passive mitigation of any chlorine release. The release rate from the enclosed building was estimated per guidance from EPA regarding control efficiencies for buildings storing chlorine.\nThe released liquid chlorine was assumed to form a denser-than-air cloud and then disperse in the atmosphere.  The distance to the toxic endpoint was estimated using the EPA\u00bfs Dense Gas Air Dispersion (DEGADIS 2.1) Model.  The toxic endpoint selected by RMPR and CalARP rules for chlorine is 3 ppm, which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  The toxic endpoint was conservatively set by EPA to ensure public notification and that local emergency response planning takes into account the greatest possible impacted area surrounding the release point.  In practice, this type of a total failure of a chlorine storage vessel would be unlikely.  EPA-mandated meteorological conditions, namely atmospheric Stability Class F, wind speed of 1.5 meter per second, highest daily maximum temperature (114 degrees F), and average relative humidity (76 percent) were used for the worst-case release scenario analysis.  The results of the air dispersion modeling indicate that the chlorine worst-case release scenario has offsite impacts, though significantly less impact than before implementation of the containment structure.\nRMP and CalARP rules require that a scenario, which results in offsite toxic endpoint distance and is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario should be selected as the alternative release scenario, unless no such scenario exists.  Unlike the worst-case scenario, the alternative release scenario may consider \u00bfactive\u00bf mitigation such as automatic shutoff valves, excess flow valves, and containment with scrubb"

      "SummaryText": "ers.  Active mitigation is defined as requiring mechanical, electrical, or human input.\nThe alternative release scenarios must consider the facility accident history and/or failure scenarios identified in the process hazard analysis.  A review of the past five-year accident history data for the chlorination facility pursuant to these rules indicated that there were no such chlorine releases, which could have resulted in offsite (outside the Diemer Plant boundary) toxic endpoint distances.  Similarly, no credible accident scenario was identified from the process hazard analysis, where a release would reach offsite.  Thus, as with the previous (June 1999) RMP submission, an acceptable/credible alternative release scenario had to be selected based on expert judgment. \nThe alternative release scenario selected involves the release of chlorine from the monel flexible hose connecting the chlorine storage vessel to the chlorination process.  This scenario can occur if the operator uses a flex hose, which is worn or has a defect resulting in a crack during withdrawal of chlorine from the chlorine storage vessel.  This is the same alternative release scenario that was utilized in the previous RMP submission.   It is assumed that the crack developed in the flex hose (diameter 1-inch) corresponds to a hole of 0.1875-inch (3/16-inch) diameter.  If such a leak were to occur, the control room would be immediately warned by the chlorine alarms installed at the facility.  It is assumed that approximately two minutes would be required for chlorine sensors to detect the required chlorine concentration to automatically shut off the liquid chlorine from the storage vessel by activating the pneumatic shutoff device.  The automatic activation of the shutoff actuator and subsequent scrubbing of the chlorine released is considered active mitigation.  This will significantly reduce the total quantity of chlorine released inside the storage building during an accident and make the amount rel"

The chlorine release rate to the atmosphere from the scrubber would be minimal. Since the chlorine release from the scrubber stacks would be neutrally buoyant, EPA\u00bfs SCREEN3 model was used for the air dispersion analysis.  The meteorological conditions used for the alternative release scenario analysis were Stability D, wind speed of 3.0 meters per second, average air temperature of 63 degrees F, and average humidity of 76 percent.  The results of the dispersion modeling analysis indicated that there will be no offsite impacts.\n It may be noted that the occurrence of this scenario is highly unlikely because the flex hose is carefully inspected during each connection/disconnection operation, and during operator rounds, once each shift.  In addition, under the Diemer Plant preventive maintenance schedule, the flex hoses are replaced at least every two years (more frequently than recommended by the manufacturer).\nFinally, no chlorine releases that could have caused an offsite safety or health hazard (no offsite deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place) occurred at the Diemer Plant during the last five years.\nSummary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nDiemer Plant complies with California Occupational Health and Safety Administration (Cal/OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements.

Depending on the severity of the accidental release, external resources such as the Orange County Fire Authority and Anaheim Fire Department will be called to aid in handling a chlorine release.  As part of the emergency response program, the Diemer Plant has developed and implemented a Hazardous Materials and Hazardous Waste Contingency Plan (HMHWCP) for the purpose of protecting public health and the environment.  The HMHWCP has a special focus on responding to chlorine emergencies and has been updated to incorporate the chlorine containment and scrubbing system.\nThe HMHWCP plan is being coordinated with local response agencies (Orange County Fire Authority and Anaheim Fire Department).  The main elements of the emergency response plan are: (1) emergency response flow chart, responsibilities of various personnel at the facility, duties of on-scene incident commander, HazMat responder team, (2) details of release evaluation and prevention at the facility, (3) procedures for informing and interfacing with off-site emergency response organizations, and (4) details of the training program for all HazMat responders. \nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nAs part of an ongoing commitment to chlorine safety, MWDSC authorized a sizeable capital project at Diemer Plant to construct a facility for containment and scrubbing of both the chlorine process building and storage area (to capture and neutralize an accidental chlorine release).
