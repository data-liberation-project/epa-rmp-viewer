      "SummaryText": "The City of Denton Water Treatment Plant provides treated water to the City.  In the treatment process, chlorine and ammonia are used in the disinfection process. Treated water is distributed to residential, commercial, and industrial users. The Plant maintains a maximum intended inventory of 80,000 pounds of chlorine in two 20-ton tanks. Anhydrous ammonia is stored on-site at a maximum intended inventory of 14,000 pounds in two tanks. The inventory volume of each chemical is above the respective threshold quantities established by the Environmental Protection Agency. As a result, the Plant is subject to the requirements of the Risk Management Program.\n\nInitial operation of the facility by the City began in March 2003.  No accidental releases of chlorine or anhydrous ammonia meeting the requirements of the five-year accident history, as defined in the Risk Management Program regulations, have occurred at the facility to date.\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\n\nThe off-site consequences of a potential accidental release of chlorine and anhydrous ammonia at the Water Treatment Plant were assessed in accordance with requirements established in 40 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68.  SLAB Atmospheric Dispersion Model, an EPA-recognized computer-modeling program, was used to model a worst-case release scenario for chlorine and alternative release scenarios for both regulated chemicals.  \n\nThe worst-case scenario is a model of a chlorine release under specific conditions established by EPA, including release volume, duration, and weather conditions. In accordance with EPA limitations, active safety systems in place at the Plant that are designed to minimize the effects of a chlorine release cannot be considered in the worst case scenario.  Passive safety systems are permitted by the EPA to be considered. The chemical storage tanks are each located within separate enclosed rooms within a building with concrete and masonry unit walls on-site.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario"

Meteorological conditions required by EPA rules are assumed for the release.  The toxic endpoint for the worst-case release scenario is estimated to reach a point beyond the boundary of the facility. Since this facility is located in a populated area, the chlorine vapor would reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.  No sensitive environmental receptors are located within the release area.\n\nThe alternative release scenario represents the results more likely to occur in the event of a chlorine release at the Plant.  Active safety systems at the Plant are considered for each alternative release scenario. The Plant is equipped with dedicated scrubber systems for both the chlorine and ammonia systems that are designed to neutralize the entire contents of one tank. Average weather conditions at the facility are used for these release scenarios, as recommended by EPA regulations.\n\nFailure of a gas pipe in the chlorine feed system is assumed for the chlorine alternative release scenario.  The toxic endpoint for the chlorine alternative release scenario is not estimated to reach a point beyond the facility because the chlorine scrubber system is anticipated to capture the entire contents of chlorine released to the air within the enclosed chlorine storage room. This release scenario affects no sensitive environmental receptors designated by EPA.  No public receptors are located within the release area.\n\nFailure of a gas pipe in the ammonia feed system is assumed for the ammonia alternative release scenario.  The toxic endpoint for the ammonia alternative release scenario is not estimated to reach a point beyond the facility because the ammonia scrubber system is anticipated to capture the entire contents of ammonia released to the air within the enclosed ammonia storage room.

In accordance with the requirements of Program 2, the Plant maintains specifications for the equipment associated with the chlorine and ammonia feed systems and has documented the codes and standards adhered to in designing, constructing, and operating the system.  The safe operating ranges for the chlorine and ammonia systems are documented, and each system is operated within these safe ranges.\n\nA hazard review has been conducted for the chlorine and ammonia systems and identified action items are expected to be completed by December 31, 2003.  When a major process change is made to either chemical system, procedures are in place to conduct a hazard review.  Otherwise, a hazard review is conducted every five years.\n\nWritten procedures for the operation and maintenance of the chlorine and ammonia systems are also in place for the Plant.  Procedures are reviewed and updated periodically by facility personnel and whenever a major process change occurs.\n\nPlant operators receive training in the operation of the chlorine and ammonia systems through classes and on-the-job instruction.  Competency is determined through supervisor observation, operator demonstration of activities, and oral tests.  Operators receive refresher training at least every three years, or more often as necessary.  Only qualified operators operate the chlorine and ammonia systems.\n\nA team of City personnel conducts a compliance audit of the facility operations and procedures once every three years and whenever a major process modification is made.  A compliance audit checklist has been developed based on American Water Works Association recommendations.

The ERT coordinates response training with the Denton Fire Department. The facility maintains an up-to-date emergency response plan that includes procedures for responding to chemical releases, notifying the public of chemical releases, providing emergency health care, and other emergency information. Plant personnel are trained to notify emergency personnel in the event of a significant chlorine leak.  In the unlikely event a chlorine or ammonia release occurs, requiring the assistance of emergency response personnel, the Plant ERT and the Denton Fire Department are responsible for responding to the accident, coordinating the emergency response effort, and notifying potentially affected areas in the surrounding community."
