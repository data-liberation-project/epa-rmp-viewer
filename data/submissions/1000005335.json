This resulted in a final ruling by Occupational Safety and Health Administration of A?The Process Safety Management StandardA? in May of 1992.  Process Safety Management (A?PSMA?) is a self-auditing program that defines responsibilities of employers and contractors involved in work that affects (or occurs near) covered processes so that the safety of plant and contractor employees is adequately addressed.  PSM requirements have a structural format and the OSHA regulations provide the applicable details.\n\nThe San Emidio Geothermal Power Plant (SE) is located more then 14 miles from the town of Empire in Washoe County, Nevada.  SE is a nominal 4.8-megawatt (A?MWA?) facility that generates power from natural geothermal water.  The facility has operated since 1987 without catastrophic incidences or releases.  SE has a staff of five operators and a Plant Manager.  \n\nAt SE, iso-pentane is used as the motive fluid in converting the naturally occurring geothermal energy into electrical energy in a A?binary cycleA? power generation facility.  In the generation process, the iso-pentane liquid is preheated and vaporized, and the vapor used to drive a turbine to generate electricity.  The iso-pentane vapors exiting the turbine are cooled and condensed back into a liquid and reused in a closed loop cycle.  Fugitive and inherent operational pentane losses are made up from fresh iso-pentane stored onsite.  The process does not involve any chemical reactions or changes to the iso-pentane.\n\nA key item of the PSM program is the process hazard analysis that was performed in 1994 by the previous operator, Nevada Operations Incorporated.  This analysis used the Hazards and Operability Study (A?HAZOPA?) procedure pe"
