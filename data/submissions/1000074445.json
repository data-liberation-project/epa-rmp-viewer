(OREG2) Recovered Energy Generation (REG) facility complies with numerous standards for pressure vessel design and testing as well as all Federal and North Dakota process safety management requirements. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws. Copies of emergency response, process hazard analyses and process safety management documents and all technical drawing (P&IDS) for process equipment are accessible at the onsite location for reference. Regular inspection and testing of the pentane and thermal oil systems are performed to ensure equipment integrity is maintained. The facility is equipped with a network of leak detection equipment, automatic shutdown logic controls, insulation, safety relief valves, fire detection monitors. OREG2 provides high levels of training in operating procedures, safety and emergency response. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to implement the emergency response procedures to mitigate damages, and to notify the local responding fire department.\n\n\n\nDescription of Stationary Source\n\n\n\nThe OREG 2 process is located adjacent to a gas pipeline compressor station.  The pipeline compressor is driven by a natural gas turbine.  The OREG process is fueled by waste heat from the gas compressor's turbine exhaust.  \n\n\n\nWaste heat is converted to electrical energy by utilizing organic Rankine cycle (ORC) technology. The hot gases of the turbine exhaust flow through a Waste Heat Oil Heater (WHOH), where the heat from the gases is transferred to a thermal oil heat transfer fluid.  The heat transfer fluid reaches a maximum temperature of 572?F.  The thermal oil is then circulated to the shell and tube heat exchangers of an Ormat Energy Converter (OEC). The motive fluid (pentane) on the shell side is vaporized and these vapors drive an organic fluid turbine. The turbi"

On the thermal oil side of the heat exchangers, after exiting the heat exchangers, the thermal oil is routed through a thermal oil surge tank, thermal oil feed pumps, and back to the WHOH. \n\n\n\nThe power from this project is sold to Basin Electric Power Cooperative based in Bismarck, ND.  The facility is rated at 6000 KW. The net power output to the electrical grid is rated at 5100 KW. Power output is reduced in warm weather due to limitations of the air cooled heat exchangers.\n\n\n\nUse of Regulated Substance\n\n\n\nPentane, a flammable vapor/liquid is used as the working fluid in the organic Rankine cycle. Liquid pentane is pumped from a condenser to shell and tube heat exchangers. Thermal energy provided by thermal oil is transferred to the pentane. The thermal oil heat input causes the pentane to change physical states from liquid to high pressure superheated vapor that is passed through a turbine to produce electric power. The vapor is condensed and recycled back to a pressurized liquid recuperator vessel to complete the Rankine cycle. A pentane storage tank is available for makeup. The facility design is segregated into multiple sections, each having its own design specifications dictated by the pentane conditions in that section. The sections include: the low pressure process equipment, the high pressure process equipment, pentane unloading system, vapor recovery system, evacuation system and non-condensable removal system. Each section is protected by pressure relief systems that may include pressure safety valves, pressure control valves, control system shutdown and intervention logic and administrative practices.\n\n\n\nQuantities Handled or Stored\n\n\n\nThe pentane is normally found in both the operating and static portions of the process.  When in operation, the majority of the pentane is found "
