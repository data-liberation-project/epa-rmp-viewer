Albertsons operates many retail grocery stores throughout the southwest that are supplied through a distribution and transportation complex located in Tolleson, Arizona. Albertsons LLC Refrigerated  Distribution Center #8220 located on this facility employees 870 people and uses anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration of the products in storage. Anhydrous ammonia is subject to EPA regulation under 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Risk Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals. Albertsons LLCs Tolleson facility has never experienced  a release of ammonia involving consequences that affected residents or the environment.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nPursuant to RMP regulations (40 CFR 68) and the Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations (29 CFR 1910.119), Albertsons has developed a comprehensive written PSM program to protect employees and the surrounding community from exposure to the hazardous chemicals onsite. The facility completed process hazards analyses (PHA) for ammonia using the industry standard What-If?/Checklist Analysis developed by the International Institute of ammonia refrigeration (IIAR). The PHA's were completed using technical and operations staff from the Tolleson facility.\n\n\n\nAs part of the RMP requirements, Albertsons undertook a review of the potential offsite consequences of the accidental release of the largest vessel in the system. Although such a release is highly unlikely, the regulation requires this review.  In addition, elements of both the RMP and PSM programs are addressed including:\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation: This program involves the employees in establishing and implementing the program.  Employees are also to be involved when a process hazard analysis is conducted. The program also ensures that all employees hav"

The written information includes the ammonia MSDS and a description of the design of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA): Formal studies using the What-If/Checklist Technique have been conducted to examine the system and identify potential hazards. Any recommendations from the PHA are resolved to improve facility safety.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures: Written, detailed procedures have been developed which describe the steps which should be followed to safely operate the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nTraining: A training program has been developed which ensures that employees are trained on all aspects of the system and on the duties which they should perform to ensure the safe operation of the ammonia.\n\n\n\nContractors: All contractors are screened and evaluated before they perform work on or near the ammonia refrigeration system. The contractors are also periodically evaluated to ensure that they perform work by following safe work practices.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review: A pre-startup safety review is required for all new ammonia projects to verify that all safety programs are in place, training has been performed, and construction has been completed according to design standards before the project is put into use. A pre-startup safety review is also performed when the process safety information related to the system changes significantly.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity: This program ensures that the ammonia refrigeration systems are built and maintained using preventive maintenance procedures to minimize unexpected breakdowns or failures.\n\n\n\nHot Work Permit: These procedures ensure that a signed permit is obtained prior to any cutting, welding, or burning.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change: Procedures are designed to ensure that all changes made to the ammonia r"

Any recommendations from the audit are resolved to improve the prevention program. \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nAlbertsons is committed to minimizing accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration process at the Tolleson distribution center. Facility management is involved in the design, operation , and maintenance of the system. Albertson?s employees have been involved in the development of the PSM and RMP programs.  Management has committed to working with local agencies and the community to educate the public regarding the hazards of ammonia and to ensure a safe workplace and surrounding community. Specific questions regarding RMP compliance at Albertsons LLC should be addressed to Albertsons Environmental Affairs Department.  \n\n\n\nStationary Source And Regulated Substance:\n\nThe facility uses 47,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in a refrigerated warehouse.\n\nThe process is a closed loop system that operates continuously. Compressors and condensers cycle On/Off to comply with system demand during operation. Cold storage and dock areas use evaporators to maintain room temperatures.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nAn investigation into the facility's accident history reveals that there have been no releases of ammonia that meet the EPA RMP definition of an ACCIDENT during the past five years (June 2014 - June 2019).\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY REPONSE PROGRAM.\n\nThe facility has an emergency action plan in effect and is designed to: \n\n1.)
