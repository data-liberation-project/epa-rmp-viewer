      "SummaryText": "ExxonMobil Production Company King Ranch Gas Plant\nRisk Management Plan\nExecutive Summary\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\nThe ExxonMobil King Ranch Gas Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention (e.g., training of personnel, considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility, etc.).  Our approach is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances as well as other substances.  If a release does occur, our trained personnel will take steps to control and contain it until local emergency response organizations arrive.  Additional details are included in the other sections of this RMPlan.  \n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \nThis plant, located about 7 miles southwest of Kingsville, Texas, consists of one Program Level 3 process, which utilizes several operations (e.g., separation, dehydration, compression, refrigeration) to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas liquid mixture, methane) from a naturally occurring hydrocarbon gas mixture.
