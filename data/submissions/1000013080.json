All applicable procedures from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to.  PPL Montour LLC has developed accidental release mitigation policies specific to the covered process and chemical which are supported by other safety policies implemented by the plant.  The PPL Montour LLC emergency response program policy dictates the implementation of response plans detailed specifically to the PPL Montour LLC covered process and chemical and to the emergency response services available in the community.  An offsite emergency response plan, developed by the Montour County Emergency Management Agency, has been in-place for other chemicals at the site.  That plan has been modified to include anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\nFacility and Regulated Substance Handled\r\n\r\nThe PPL Montour LLC facility, located in Montour County is a fossil fuel based steam and electric plant.  Anhydrous ammonia is used to reduce nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions.  NOx is reduced by mixing and reacting with ammonia in the presence of a catalyst.  The anhydrous ammonia system includes railcars, and tanker trucks, bulk tanks, process piping, various safety & monitoring systems, compressors, and pumps.  This system is typically manned, and is monitored daily by operators.  The system was originally used on a seasonal basis in warm weather, but is now used year round. Maintenance employees are on staff to respond to any alarms and to maintain the system.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nAdministrative controls have been developed to minimize the potential for release and consequences.  These controls consist of storage volume limitations, dikes ar"
