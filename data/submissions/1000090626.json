And that's not counting the millions of gallons of wastewater produced by businesses and industries throughout the Fresno metropolitan area.\n\n\n\nThe Fresno-Clovis Regional Wastewater Treatment Facility is located at Jensen and Cornelia in southwest Fresno. Wastewater generated from homes and businesses in the metro area travels through 1700 miles of sanitary sewer lines to the Wastewater Treatment Facility. Treatment consists of two major steps; primary and secondary treatment, and a process to treat solids removed in the process at the plant.\n\n\n\nThe Fresno-Clovis Regional Wastewater Treatment Facility has a permitted capacity to treat 91.5 million gallons a day (mgd) of wastewater. Toxic materials and even too much water can hamper the treatment of wastewater. Minimizing harmful chemicals helps keep our biological process healthy, allowing us to adequately clean the water. Limiting the use of water allows us to continue to use present facilities and delays the need to further expand our facility, keeping sewer rates low for the community.\n\n\n\nThe Fresno-Clovis Regional Wastewater Treatment Facility management is not only committed to offering superior service, but also to maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  Fresno-Clovis Regional Wastewater Treatment Facility's safety and environmental policies are administered by the Wastewater Manager, who conducts periodic inspections of the facility to ensure compliance, and oversees the entire safety and environmental programs, including the CalARP Program.  \n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Fresno-Clovis Regional Wastewater Treatment Facility is located at 5607 W.

      "SummaryText": "ter Treatment Facility is to treat wastewater. In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains 13 Anaerobic Digesters that are used to digest processed primary and secondary sludge/scum. Microbes in the Digesters digest organic materials to generate digester gas which is comprised of approximately 60% methane. A maximum of approximately 18,052 pounds of methane, a regulated substance, is at the facility at one time. The system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, generates methane from the digesting process. Typical operating conditions range from 6.5\" water column on the low pressure methane side to 10\" water column on the high pressure methane side of the Digesters. The Conditioning Plant pressures range from -1 psig suction on the lower pressure side to 188 psig discharge on the high pressure side.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nIn order to operate the system, the facility complies with the Cal-OES California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.\n\n\n\nThe Fresno-Clovis Regional Wastewater Treatment Facility methane system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the Fresno-Clovis Regional Wastewater Treatment Facility operates in accordance with the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  It is important to note that the methane system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of methane. For example, Digester Gas pressures are maintained below their inline Pressure Vacuum Relief Valve (PVRV) settings of 10.0\" of water column. The Digester #7 PVRV is maintained at 10.0\" of water column and used as a secondary pressure relief for the Dystor unit.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe CalARP Program defines \"accident\" as the following:\n\n\n\n\"An unanticipated emission of a regulated substance or other extremely hazardous "

Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (19CCR2750.9(a)).\"\n\n\n\nBased on the above definition and an investigation into the facility's accident history conducted during the PHA meeting on September 17, 2020, there have been no releases of methane in the past five years (September 2015 - September 2020).\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe facility has an Emergency Action Plan (plan) in effect.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \n\n\n\n?    save lives;\n\n?    minimize and avoid injuries;\n\n?    protect the environment; and\n\n?    minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, methane health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated as needed. This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations.  \n\n\n\nFresno-Clovis Regional Wastewater Treatment Facility personnel circulate throughout the plant, taking note of unusual conditions in any portion of the system.  In the event that a methane leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will alert any personnel in the immediate area who are unaware of the danger and the Fresno-Clovis Regional Wastewater Treatment Facility Wastewater Manager.  The Wastewater Manager will determine what procedures and personnel are necessary to remedy the problem. Emergency agencies will also be notified as necessary as outlined in the Emergency Action Plan.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis, performed on September 17, 2020, generated mitigation measures (recommendations) to improve"

Although various weather conditions are common experiences at the facility, they are not considered to be a contributing factor to hazardous material accidents in California.  For incidents where the weather condition was identified, clear weather was reported for 90% of the incidents.  The remaining 10% of the incidents occurred during rain (4%), fog (3%), other (2%) which includes snow, hail and electrical storms, and the unknown category (1%). \n\n\n\nFlooding\n\n\n\nAccording to the Climate Diagnostic Center, most of the rainfall in Fresno, California occurs during the winter months, while the summer seasons are nearly rainless. On November 16-17, 1900, 2.86 inches of precipitation fell in Fresno, which was the wettest day in Fresno history.  Heavy rainfall and flooding have not been a safety concern for the Fresno-Clovis Regional Wastewater Treatment Facility. In the event of flooding, the methane system could be manually shut down until conditions warrant returning to normal operations.\n\n\n\nFire\n\n\n\nFires were considered under the guide words \"More Pressure\" and \"More Temperature\" during the HAZOP study.  The facility is mostly constructed of concrete and steel. In the event of a fire, the pressure relief valves would relieve the excess pressure by venting methane into the atmosphere.  In addition, the system is located outside decreasing the likelihood of a fire affecting the system.\n\n\n\nExtreme Winds\n\n\n\nThe methane equipment is located outdoors.  The equipment is designed for rugged conditions, utilizing durable construction materials such as steel.  Methane equipment at the site is not anticipated to be affected by strong winds.  Strong winds are most likely to disrupt the facility's electrical supply.  In the event that the facility loses electrical power, the methane system will shut down.  Operators will reset the system once power is restored.\n\n\n\nDATA ELEMENTS NOTE"
