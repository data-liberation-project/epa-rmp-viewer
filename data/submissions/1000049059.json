(Dominion) Lightburn Extraction Plant (LEP) is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility.  It is Dominion's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If a release does occur, regular personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  Dominion has contracted Weavertown Environmental Group as an Oil Spill Response Organization to provide additional emergency response expertise.  Also, Dominion will contact the Lewis County Emergency Dispatch to obtain additional resources from local volunteer fire departments, law enforcement and emergency medical services.\r\n\r\n2.\tStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\nThe LEP is a natural gas extraction plant which receives inlet gas which is then scrubbed to remove free liquids in the gas, compressed and dehydrated utilizing one molecular sieve bed.  After dehydration, the pressure is reduced and the gas is cooled through the expander side of the expander/compressor.  The gas is sent to an absorber where liquids condense and fall to the bottom.  The overhead gas is warmed, compressed, and sent back to Dominion Energy Transmission, Inc.'s transmission pipeline system.  The mixed natural gas liquid (NGL) product containing pentane, isopentane [butane, 2-methyl], butane, isobutane [propane, 2-methyl], propane, and ethane is sent to one of the four 60,000 gallon product storage tanks.  The NGL product is a flammable mixture that meets the NFPA-4 criteria and is present onsite in a process in an amount that exceeds the threshold quantity (10,000 pounds) for applicability under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency'"

This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with ASME B31.3.  The LEP facility is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The LEP facility is classified as a Program 3 process under USEPA's RMP.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at this stationary source.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nDominion LEP personnel maintain detailed records of process safety information that describes the hazards of regulated substances, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the regulated process.  Much of this information was compiled during the preparation of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). The OSHA Hazard Communication Standard (HCS) requires chemical manufacturers, distributors or importers to provide Safety Data Sheets (SDS), formerly MSDS, to communicate the hazards of hazardous chemical products. As of June 1, 2015, the HCS will require new SDSs to be in uniform format\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nDominion LEP personnel conduct comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with the regulated process are identified and controlled efficiently.  Dominion LEP utilized the What-If and HAZOP method analysis techniques to perform these evaluations.  The studies were undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations.  The PHA will be revalidated at"

During this orientation contractors are made aware of the known potential hazards related the contractors work, the hazards of regulated substances within the LEP facility, the safe work procedures required by Dominion, and a review of the Hot Work Permit Policy and the Lock Out/Tag Out Procedures used at the LEP facility.  Contractors are informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.  This information includes evacuation routes and assembly points.  Dominion LEP personnel will document that the contractor has received and understands the training.\r\n\r\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\nThe covered process at the Dominion LEP facility has hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  Collectively, these prevention program activities described above help prevent potential accidental scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human error.  In addition, the Dominion LEP facility incorporates safety features on its equipment to help (a) contain/control a release (e.g., diking and enclosures); (b) quickly detect a release (e.g., hydrocarbon detectors with alarms), and (c) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release (e.g., fire suppression and extinguishing).\r\n\r\n4.\tFive-year Accident History\r\nThe Dominion LEP facility is a new facility and has no five-year accident history.\r\n\r\n5.\tEmergency Response Program\r\nThe Dominion LEP facility has a written emergency plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The plan addresses evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  To ensure proper functioning, the emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes"

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.  Dominion LEP personnel develop and implement safe work practices to provide for the control of hazards during operations such as lockout/tagout; confined space entry; opening process equipment or piping; and control over entrance into a stationary source by maintenance, contractor, laboratory, or other support personnel.  These safe work practices apply to employees and contractor employees.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nDominion LEP has a training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating the regulated process are competent in the operating procedures associated with the process.
