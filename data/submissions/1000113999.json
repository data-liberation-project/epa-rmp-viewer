We expect all directors, officers, employees, consultants, contractors, or visitors, to comply with all safety requirements.\n\u0095\tAgri-Mark/Cabot constantly strives to improve its safety program to reduce risks and eliminate and/or minimize potential injuries, accidents and releases. Agri-Mark/Cabot's goal is to train employees to recognize unsafe behaviors, to encourage safe behaviors, and to be actively involved in the safety process. An ongoing effort to provide a safe working environment for all employees is a major concern of the Companies. It is important for all employees to become more actively involved in day today safety awareness, particularly as it applies to their individual jobs.
