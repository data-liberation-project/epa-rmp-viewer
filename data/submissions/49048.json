Accident prevention includes designing safe plants and operating facilities, conducting and providing safety training for employees and contractors, and developing and implementing safe work practices and procedures for the operation and maintenance of plants, processes, and operations facilities.  ConocoPhillips's policies and dedication to safety and environmental stewardship help to prevent accidental releases.  If, despite our best attempts to prevent such incidents, a release should occur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release in accordance with the plant's Incident Response Plan.  \n\n\n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations (40 CFR Part 68), which were promulgated in the Federal Register on Thursday, June 20, 1996, Vol. 61, No. 120.  \n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nThe Zofness Facility, located in Ward County, Texas is owned and operated by ConocoPhillips.  The Zofness Facility is a natural gas compression and dehydration facility. The Zofness facility operation includes inlet metering, compression and storage. Products are transported from the facility via pipeline.\n\n\n\nIn accordance with the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations (40 CFR Part 68), the Zofness Facility's inventory of chemicals was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances were on the plant site in quantities above the threshold quantities.  [Note: The term \"threshold quantity\" is the quantity above which the EPA has decided that the substance will be regulated.]  Our evaluation determined that the following listed flammable substances are handled by the plant in quantities above the substance's threshold quantity: natural gasoline (mixture of propane n-butane, isobutane, meth"

There are no toxic substances above the threshold quantity at the plant.\n\n\n\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE-CASE TOXIC RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n\n\nThe Zofness Facility does not have any toxic substances above threshold quantity. As the plant does not have any toxic substances, toxic release scenarios were not addressed. \n\n\n\nWORST-CASE FLAMMABLE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n\n\nThe RMP regulation requires the operator to model the worst-case release scenario, which the regulations define as the \"release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure.?  For flammables, this hypothetical worst case assumes an instantaneous release and a vapor cloud explosion.  These assumptions are required without regard to whether a scenario is realistic or improbable.  Natural gasoline was used in the model for the hypothetical worst-case flammable scenario.  The worst-case scenario was modeled on the assumption of the instantaneous release of all of the natural gasoline in the largest vessel. Under the stipulated guidelines, this hypothetical release, if ignited, would have an off-site impact, as determined by the use of the OCA Guidance.  [Note: The OCA Guidance is EPA's Off-Site Consequence Analysis Guidance document.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPassive mitigation systems were not applied because of the assumption for the scenario that the entire contents of the vessel be instantaneously released.  We believe that a vessel failure such as this is extremely unlikely because the vessels are carefully designed with significant engineering safety factors.  In addition, all pressure vessels are carefully inspected and pressure tested before they are placed in service, and the Zofness Facility follows a rigorous Mechanical Integrity Program to ensure that all process equipment is properly maintained and inspected, to prevent leakage or failure.\n\n\n\nALTERNATIVE FLAMMABLE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n\n\nThe RMP regulations require the operator to model a single ?alte"

For the Zofness Facility, this hypothetical scenario was modeled on the basis of a seal failure on the natural gasoline pipeline pump, which was assumed to last for sixty minutes.  Passive mitigation systems such as emergency shutdown systems would enable the plant to isolate and eliminate such a release within that time-frame.  The alternative release scenario has off-site impact as determined by the use of the OCA Guidance. \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nAND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Zofness Facility adheres to the policies and procedures provided in the Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  These policies and procedures include and embrace the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.\n\n\n\nThe following is a general overview of the main elements of the Risk Management Program that are currently in operation at the Zofness Facility.  The Zofness Facility has aligned and integrated its safety management programs at a high level with the Occupational Safety & Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) program regulations for consistency and effectiveness.  As a result, this overview describes the safety management system that is in place for each of the safety management program elements, which also make up the Risk Management Program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nAll employees (and contractors) at the Zofness Facility are involved and participate in all facets of Process Safety Management (PSM) and accident prevention.

More specific ways that employees can be involved in the Risk Management Program are documented in an Employee Participation Plan that is maintained at the plant.\n\n\n\nIn addition, employees and management have a number of initiatives in place that are designed to improve safety at the plant.  These initiatives are focused on both the plant processes and general worker safety (including slips, trips, and falls), and even off-the-job safety.  These initiatives include safety teams that have been chartered to improve safety, both on and off the job.  These safety teams typically have members from various functional areas of the plant -- including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management -- to ensure the team has a broad perspective, which leads to better ideas to improve safety.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nThe Zofness Facility has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the plant's operations and processes are identified and minimized.  This is a systematic procedure in which each part of the process is systematically examined to identify all of the potential hazards associated with the process, and to ensure that appropriate recommendations are developed and implemented to eliminate or control the potential hazards.\n\n\n\nThe Process Hazards Analysis procedure utilized at the Zofness Facility is carried out by a team of functional experts from engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety, who work with a PHA Facilitator to identify and evaluate all of the potential hazards that could possibly result in a release of a regulated substance.

This information is maintained in Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS), as part of the Hazard Communication Program at the plant.  \n\n\n\nFor process areas, the Plant has documented the safe operating limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, pressure, level, etc.).  The Plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems such as automatic shutdown systems.\n\n\n\nThe Plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes design flow rates, fluid properties, pressures and temperatures that were the basis of the sizing of the different subsystems or individual pieces of equipment.  The information on the process design also includes the materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical ratings of equipment.  The engineering data maintained at the plant includes a Plot Plan, Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&ID?s), Process Flow Diagrams (PFD's), Electrical Area Classification drawings, Safety Analysis and Function Evaluation (SAFE) Charts, Cause and Effect (C&E) Charts, and equipment specification/data sheets.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe Zofness Facility developed and maintains written operating procedures that provide plant operators with a clear understanding of the tasks involved in the safe operation of the facility.

These procedures provide the basis for consistent training of new operators, and they provide good reference materials for experienced operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and certified as current and accurate. Whenever a process modification is made, the procedures are revised as appropriate to cover the modification.  The procedures are kept current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\n\n\nThese procedures are used in employee training, and are readily available to employees to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nThe Zofness Facility employs a comprehensive training program for all employees at the plant.  New employees receive job-specific basic training in gas plant operations. All operating and maintenance personnel receive facility-specific process overview training.  Each employee receives training on, among other things, (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.  They are thereby trained in the specific knowledge, skills, and procedures needed to safely conduct their work.  In addition, each operator receives facility-specific training on how to operate the plant, including detailed training on the operating procedures, including startup, shutdown, normal operations, temporary operations, and emergency operations.  As part of this training, an operator in training is paired with an experienced operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (through tests and skills demonstration) the knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, only then can they work independently.

The Zofness Facility has a comprehensive system in place to manage and document any such changes to the plant's processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, or other changes be properly reviewed and authorized by a number of people with different functional expertise before being implemented.  This system of managing facility modifications is called Management of Change (MOC).  This system consists of a set of written procedures that are used to identify and eliminate hazards associated with a change to the facility's processes.  MOC ensures that facility modifications are formally reviewed and approved before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been negatively affected by the change.  A part of the MOC process ensures that any chemical hazard information, process operating limits, equipment information, and/or procedures are updated as appropriate to incorporate the effects of the modification.  A critical piece of the MOC process ensures that operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training regarding the process modification.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\n\n\nThe Zofness Facility conducts a Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) for any modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure before startup of the modified process or unit that the modification was completed in accordance with design specifications.  The PSSR is also intended to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are properly prepared for startup before the modified equipment is put in service.  Another key purpose of the PSSRs is to ensure that all personnel have been trained on "
