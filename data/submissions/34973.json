Chlorination is considered to be the most important process for preventing the spread of water borne disease in drinking water.  The are two methods of chlorination, breakpoint chlorination and chloramination.  The breakpoint chlorination process consist of adding enough chlorine to the water to satisfy the chlorine demand so that free available chlorine residual can be measured.  Chloramination is the process of adding chlorine and ammonia to water, which produces a mono-chloramine residual.  The chloramination process lowers the trihalomehtane levels in the finished water.\n\nThe Miami-Dade Water and Sewer Department (MDWASD) Alexander Orr Water Treatment Plant (WTP) uses chlorine and aqueous ammonia for disinfecting and lowering the trihalomethane levels in the finished drinking water to protect public health per state and federal water quality standards.  Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations.  The Alexander Orr WTP takes safety obligations in storing and using all chemicals, including ammonia as seriously as it takes care in providing safe drinking water.\n\nThe Alexander Orr WTP chlorine handling process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule.  This rule requires submission of a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  An integral part of the RMP is a summary of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility, including a description of the possible consequences in case of an accident and the actions, which will be taken, by the facility in an event of an emergency.\n\n - The following information is specifically required tin the RMP Executive Summary:\n\n - Accidental release prevention and emergency response polices.\n\n - General Facility and regulated substance information.\n\n - Offsite consequence analysis re"

All applicable procedures of the EPA's Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.\n\nThe MDWASD emergency response policy involves the preparation of emergency response plans for hazardous materials which are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program Requirements.  Alexander Orr WTP has prepared an Emergency Response Plan for the treatment plant facilities to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\n\nThe MDWASD Alexander Orr WTP is located at 6800 SW 87th Avenue (Galloway Rd.) in the center of Miami, Florida.  The plant is bounded by SW 64th Street (Hardee Drive).  To the North and by SW 72nd Street (Sunset Dr.) to the South, Alexander Orr WTP covers 68 acres.  The facility stores chlorine wich is a regulated toxic substances under RMP rule.\n\nAlexander Orr WTP has two chlorine facilities designated as the Old Plant  and the New Plant 2.  Chlorine is delivered in 90-ton rail cars to chlorine car enclosure.  The 90-ton rail cars contain liquid chlorine under pressure.

The maximum quantity of  chlorine present at the Alexander Orr WTP at any given time exceeds the listed threshold quantity in the EPA rule.  It also exceeds the listed treshold quantity in Standard. \n\nThe pressure from the rail car forces the liquid chlorine through the tubing and into the feed line.  Downstream of each tubing/feed line connection, there is a pneumatically actuated shut-off valve.  Pushing one of he shut-off switches manually closes the shut-off valves.  The liquid chlorine flows through the shut-off valves to the evaporators in each of the chlorine rooms.  At the evaporators the liquid chlorine is converted into chlorine gas.  The gas then flows from the evaporator through another automatic shut-off valve, a strainer, a pressure regulating valve, a temperature actuated control valve, and a vacuum regulator, to the chlorinators.   The chlorinators are used to control the feed rate of the chlorine gas.  The chlorinators are equipped with a gas rotameter and v-notched orifice for controlling the feed rate.  Injection of the chlorine into the plant water produces the concentrated chlorine solution that flows to the various injection points in the treatment process.\n\nThe Alexander Orr WTP chlorine system is also provided with a number of safety features to protect the employees and the surrounding community.  The two important safety features are (1) shut-off valves, and (2) chlorine leak detection and alarm system.\n\nThe shut-off valves are located immediately downstream of the chlorine rail cars and in the chlorinator room. Therefore if a leak occurs anywhere in the system the chlorine source can be isolated and the flow of chlorine can be stopped.  The shut-off valves are operated manually by pressing one of the emergency shut-off switches.  Emergency  shut-off switches.  Emergency shut-off switches are located outside the chlorine car enclosure and outside the chlorinator rooms.\n\nThe leak detection and alarm s"

Details such as maximum intended inventory; safe upper and lower temperatures; safe upper and lower pressures; and codes and standards used to design, build, and operate the processes are on file at the facility. \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nIn 1997, detailed Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) were conducted for the chlorine systems equipment and procedures to further assess the integrity of the chlorine systems for the preparation of this RMP, checklists were used to assess the overall general condition of the chlorine  systems operation and maintenance, including human factors that affect personnel performance and system integrity.  The PHA(s) was updated again on June 11,  2004.\n\nOperating procedures \n\nMDWASD Alexander Orr WRP has prepared written operating procedures that provide clean instruction or steps for safely conduction activities relating to the chlorination processes.  They are consistent with the chlorine Process Safety Information.  Written operating procedures include:  initial startup, normal operation, emergency shutdown, Normal shutdown, and start up after emergency shutdown.  In addition, Alexander Orr WTP developed Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for the following steps in the chlorination processes: receipt of chlorine delivery, chlorine car connection and disconnection, transferring car from standby to in-service, chlorine release/spill response.  Operating procedures will be developed and put in place prior to any new process equipment coming on "

The Alexander Orr WTP uses a permitting program to ensure that hot work is conducted safey on or near a process involving chlorine. \n\nInternal Compliance Audits\n\nInternal compliance audits will be conducted every 3 years to verify compliance with the programs and procedures contained in the RPM.  The Alexander Orr WTP will assemble an oudit team that will include personnel knowledgeable in the Risk Management Program rule and in the process.  This team will evaluate whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the Risk Management Program rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process.  The results of the audit will be documented, recommendations resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program will be implemented.\n\nIncident investigation\n\nThe Alexander Orr WTP investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release (serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment) so that similar accidents can be prevented. And investigation team is assembled and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.

      "SummaryText": "story Summary\n\nThere has been one accidental release involving chlorine. The release occurred on March 26, 2004. the amount of the chlorine \nreleased was between ten and twenty pounds. The release was caused by a small leak in the flex hose connecting the rail car\nto the facility's hard piping. The release caused no injuries. There was no off-site impact from the incident. As a result of this accident, WASD is switching to the longer flex hose and assigning personnel to man the Operations telophone.\n\nEmergency Response Program Summary\n\nThe Alexander Orr WTP is a first responder, plant employees respond to chlorine and ammonia accidental releases.  Depending on the severity of the accidental release, external resources such as he Metro-Dade Fire Department may be solicited to aid in handling chlorine or ammonia release.  As part of the emergency response program, the Alexander Orr WTP has developed and implemented an emergency action plan for the purpose of protecting public health and the environment.\n\nThe emergency response plan has been coordinated with local response agencies (Metro-Dade Fire Department).  The main elements of the emergency response plan are: (1) chlorine response flow chart, responsibilities of various personnel at the facility, duties of on-scene incident commander, site response team, and site safety representative, (2) details of emergency recognition and prevention at the facility, (3) procedures for planning and coordination wth off-site emergency response organizations, and (4) details of the training program for all employees involved with the chlorination and ammoniation processes.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety \n\nNumerous changes to improve safety (recommended actions) were previously identified for the chlorine process in 1997 for chlorination system equipment and procedures, when Process Safety Management (PSM) Plans were prepared.  All of these recommended actions have been evaluated for implementation as required."
