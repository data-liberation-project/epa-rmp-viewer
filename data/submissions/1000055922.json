No other accident history information had appeared in the previous version of the RMP as no other accidents had occurred in the past five years.  The Chemours Wurtland Plant is a facility reporting under Program 3 and the RMP has also been revised to include the incident investigation information in section 7.  Specifically, the date of investigation and the expected date of completion of changes to reflect actions taken as a result of the accident have been revised.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\n\n\nChemours Wurtland Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Wurtland Plant manufactures and processes sulfuric acid in Greenup County Kentucky.  Raw material, intermediate and process storage tanks are in use at the site.\n\n\n\nThe Wurtland Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Based on process knowledge, Chemours identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site. The facility uses three regulated substances in the sulfuric acid process, oleum, sulfur trioxide, and anhydrous hydrogen chloride (Process 1).

The teams have members from all areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Wurtland Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For the sulfuric acid process area, Wurtland  has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature level, composition) in a Standard Conditions Manual.  The plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using state-of-the-art process controls and monitoring instruments, emergency relief systems with flare, redundant power supply and safety systems, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nThe plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure the adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nWurtland  primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, Wurtland  periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\n\n\nThis information is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Wurtland  has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, Wurtland  evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs) \n\n\n\nWurtland  conducts a PSSR for any facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.

In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\n\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\n\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.

Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\n\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\n\n\nWurtland  has safety features on units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered process:\n\n\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n\n\nAutomatic shut-off devices and relief valves\n\nCurbing or diking to contain liquid releases\n\nRedundant equipment and instrumentation (e."

The #2 Oleum Reboiler condensate line leaked when acidic condensate corroded a steam condensate exit elbow below the steam chest releasing fuming acid into the atmosphere at 2:35 PM on 10/11/04.  The condensate turned acidic due to a leak in the steam heating tube bundle.  The resulting sulfuric acid mist traveled across an industrial park and reached US Highway 23.  Operators immediately shut off flows to the reboiler, began external water and foam application, and began clearing the reboiler.  At about 2:50 PM the local emergency response agency, state agencies, and the National Response Center were contacted.  Off-site fuming stopped at about 3:25 PM.  Highway 23 was barricaded by local authorities and a precautionary shelter-in-place was requested for the local community and nearby industrial neighbors primarily to keep people off the barricaded road.  Small wisps of fumes continued to be released intermittently on site in the direct vicinity of the #2 oleum reboiler until the mechanics removed the damaged condensate elbow and blind flanged the condensate nozzle to isolate the #2 oleum reboiler between 4:30 P. M. and 5:00 P. M.  All clear was sounded at 5:42 PM, the highway was re-opened and the precautionary shelterA?inA?place lifted.  Based on best current information, approximately 60 to 65 persons reported to three local hospitals over a two day period complaining of skin, eye, or breathing"

      "SummaryText": " irritation.  To the best of our knowledge, there was one admission for diagnostic testing.  All others were evaluated and released.  The plant has also been provided information that approximately 110 person have presented prescriptions to local pharmicies claiming exposure to the released material.  We do not have sufficient information to verify these claims, although many of the claimants were not near the vicinity of the release or did not seek medical evaluation until days after the release.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program Information\n\n\n\nWurtland  maintains a written incident response plan, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment during an emergency.  The plan consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The incident response plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to plant processes.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for Wurtland is coordinated with the Wurtland Fire Department.  This coordination includes periodic meetings of  the Wurtland Plant personnel and the Wurtland Fire Chief to discuss needs and concerns in the event of an incident at the plant.   Wurtland has around-the-clock communications capability with the Fire Department who have the ability to communicate to all state, federal and county agencies as to neede"

This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic meetings with the Fire Chief,  Wurtland conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the Fire Department and emergency response organizations, and the plant provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the plant.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nWurtland has several elements of the management system of the accident prevention program in place to improve safety throughout the facility.  These elements are part of an overall ongoing safety improvement process."
