      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary for the Cherokee Nitrogen Company Facility\n\n1.0\tAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\nWe at Cherokee Nitrogen are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n2.0\tCherokee Nitrogen Company and Regulated Substances \n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the manufacture of ammonia and related processes. Ammonia is a natural part of the life process.  It is produced internally by all humans and mammals to process essential proteins. Ammonia is one of the most widely used industrial chemicals in the world, and is commonly used to purify water and refrigerate foods.\n\nThe company is a supplier to the fertilizer, explosives, and commercial industries by manufacturing ammonium nitrate, ammonium nitrate solutions, and other products.  Cherokee Nitrogen markets its fertilizers to distributors, dealers, national farm retail chains, regional farm cooperatives, and other fertilizer producers for ultimate sale and delivery to farmers. \n\nWe have four regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include anhydrous ammonia, aqueous ammonia, chlorine, and sulfur dioxide. Anhydrous ammonia is used to manufacture nitric acid (<80 percent).  Aqueous ammonia is contained within the urea and ammonium nitrate solutions. Chlorine is used to treat the incoming process water prior to use by the facility. Sulfur dioxide is used to treat the outgoing process water prior to discharge from the facility. \n\nTypically, the facility manufactures two types of ammonium nitrate solutions: industrial-grade (83 weight percent) ammonium nitrate solution, and a high pressure solution co"

The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  To ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nColbert County LEPC is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\n\n7.0\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nCherokee Nitrogen Company continually strives to improve and upgrade operating procedures, replace or maintain equipment, and develop and implement safety improvement projects.  Several developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program. Some of the major steps taken to improve safety at our facility include: installation of security/safety cables on all overhead chain operated valves; American Red Cross CPR and AED training; semi-annual third party safety inspections and audits with corrective action and follow up; establishing safety goals; plant wide monthly safety awareness meetings which focus on safety needs and input from all employees, and\nincrease in site security measures.\n\nThese activities are implemented and reflect current practices established at Cherokee Nitrogen."
