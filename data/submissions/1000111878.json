The procedure establishes the minimum guidelines and activities of the incident investigation program in order to reduce the likelihood of repetitive occurrences of events which could reasonably lead to catastrophic releases. Investigations will be undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent a similar release in the future.\n\nCompliance Audits\nThe facility conducts audits of the provisions of RMP to verify that procedures and practices developed under the standard are adequate and are being followed. The audits include a review of documentation and process safety information, inspection of the physical facilities, and interviews with all levels of plant personnel.\n\n4. Accident History\nThe facility has not had any accidents reportable under RMP.  This RMP submittal is for initial start-up of the facility.\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\nEquilon maintains a written emergency response program in its emergency action plan. The purpose of the emergency action plan is to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The emergency action plan addresses aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. In addition, Equilon has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. We work with the local fire department and emergency responders to"

The facility has developed and implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in facility operations.\n\nContractors\nThe contractor safety procedures establish minimum guidelines and activities in order to assure that the contractor's employees follow safe work practices and procedures. The procedure includes a contractor screening process and hazard awareness, safety and emergency procedures training.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews\nEquilon conducts a pre-startup safety review (PSSR) for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nThe facility's mechanical integrity program includes written procedures, training, and regular inspections and equipment testing procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief systems, pumps, emergency shutdown systems, and controls in a safe operating condition.\n\nManagement of Change\nThe facility's management of change (MOC) program reviews all proposed changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures, materials, and design conditions prior to implementation of the change. Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by a process ch"

Facility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\nThe Equilon facility operations use a fiber conversion technology that converts lignocellulosic biomass, into enhanced-protein animal feeds, distillers corn oil and cellulosic ethanol. Regulated substances stored at the facility include sulfur dioxide and acetaldehyde.\n\n3. Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nEquilon has programs in place to address accidental release prevention measures required by EPA, process safety management (PSM) requirements from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and notification requirements of EPA's Emergency Response and Community Right-to-Know regulations. The facility complies with PSM for the management of sulfur dioxide and acetaldehyde.\n\nEmployee Participation\nEquilon has developed an employee participation program. All process safety information, process hazard analysis (PHA) results, recommendations, and action items, incident investigations, compliance audits, operating procedures, emergency response plan, and records of management of change are available to the operating personnel.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis and Process Safety Information\nThe facility utilizes the HAZOP PHA methodology. The PHA identified the following potential major hazards: toxic release, fire, explosion, runaway reaction, over pressurization, corrosion, overfilling, contamination, equipment failure and the loss of cooling, heating, electricity, instrument air. The facility utilizes process controls such as vents, relief valves, check valves, scrubbers, manual and automatic shutoffs, alarms and procedures and grounding equipment to prevent or limit releases.\n\nEquilon keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the fa"

This summary is presented in response to the requirements of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 (40 CFR 68) and Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act. The Equilon facility is subject to the RMP rule due to the storage of sulfur dioxide a regulated toxic substance and acetaldehyde, a regulated flammable substance, above threshold quantities. This RMP submittal is for initial start-up of the facility.\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nEquilon is committed to protecting the environment and operating facilities in a manner that promotes the safety of employees and the general public. Management has adopted and implemented policies that adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations. The design and construction of the facility has incorporated physical and operational safeguards to prevent accidental releases. Through the proper design, installation, operation and maintenance of the equipment, and the training of our personnel, Equilon has minimized the hazard to human health and the environment from fires, explosions, or any unplanned sudden or non-sudden release of hazardous materials.\n\nThe facility relies on outside services, LEPC, Fire, and Police to respond to major release events. In the event that a release does occur, the facility's emergency response is described in its emergency action plan. The emergency action plan includes procedures to provide information to and coordinate response actions with local emergency response personnel (i.e., law enforcement, fire, and rescue departments, emergency medical services, hospital and government personnel, etc.) as well as any potentially affected"
