If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Maquoketa Fire Department,  \nJackson Co. Local Emergency Planning Committee or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and environment.\n\n2.\t   The stationary source and the regulated substance handled.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility, which is located at, Maquoketa, Iowa is the storage and blending of fertilizer for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The storage and handling system consists storage tank, loading risers associated plumbing and nurse tanks.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors. \n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 250,000 pounds, this includes the amount of anhydrous ammonia that could be stored in nurse tanks.\n\n3.\t  The worst-case scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\nThis facility has developed a worst-case and alternative-case scenario, however, since this is security-sensitive information it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as required by EPA regulations.\n\n4.\t   The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA\u00bfs Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility has implemented the provisions of \u00bfSafety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\u00bf, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U. S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR1910.111."
