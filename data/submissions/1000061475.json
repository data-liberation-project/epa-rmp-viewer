This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system.  \n\n\n\nLineage Logistics - Bandini, Vernon Facility's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substance.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nLineage Logistics - Bandini, Vernon Facility is located at at 4100 Bandini Boulevard in Vernon, California, and is situated approximately 0.9 miles west of the 710 freeway and 1.2 miles south of the I-5 freeway.  The immediate area surrounding the facility is primarily commercial and residential. The facility was constructed and began operations in 2001. \n\nThe regulated substance handled at the facility is anhydrous ammonia. The facility's primary activities revolve around large-scale public storage of food products. All of the ammonia inventory is used as refrigerant.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAs part of the implementation of this CalARP Program, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by Lineage Logistics - Bandini, Vernon Facility to manage process safety issues associated with the use of anhydrous ammonia.  Furthermore, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are"
