In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Lindsay-Strathmore Irrigation District's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\nLindsay-Strathmore Irrigation District has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Lindsay-Strathmore Irrigation District has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\nFor the future, Lindsay-Strathmore Irrigation District now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a living document. It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Lindsay-Strathmore Irrigation District employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement.

The chlorine, when added to water, yields both hydrochloric (HCl) and hypochlorous (HOCl) acid (see chemical equation below) in aqueous solution. This combination is effective in killing bacteria, viruses, pathogens and other micro-organisms. Note that the equation below is easily reversible which results in \u201coff-gassing\u201d of chlorine gas from water that contains high concentrations of the acids.\n\nCl2 + H2O \u2192 HOCl + HCl\n\nThe chlorination process begins with the chlorine gas being drawn from the ton container through a pressure reducing valve, reduced to vacuum at a vacuum regulator valve mounted inside the chlorinator, metered through a manually-adjusted rate valve, and finally injected into water.\n\nProcess Classification\n\nThe chlorine system at Lindsay-Strathmore Irrigation District consists of ton containers and cylinders which are co-located relative to each other.
