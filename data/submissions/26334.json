A technical team consisting of six local area Chemical Manufacturers Association member \r\ncompanies selected the basis for the scenarios. The team has been in existence since 1994. The teams \r\nfindings were communicated in public meetings in October of '95 and again in May of '99 in an effort \r\nknown as the Victoria/Calhoun County Communications \u00bfLiving Safely With Chemicals\u00bf. The following \r\nparagraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\r\n\r\nToxics\r\n\r\nWorst Case Release Scenario:\r\n\r\nThe worst case submitted involves a catastrophic release from a full Crude (Off-Spec) atmospheric storage \r\ntank containing 8.1% Hydrocyanic Acid in the Acrylonitrile manufacturing process. This is conservative \r\ndue to the Hydrocyanic Acid being calculated as a pure component.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is \r\nreleased into a dike, which vaporizes and moves downwind. Under worst case weather conditions **, this \r\nscenario has offsite impacts corresponding to the endpoint indicated in the EPA Tables. For this scenario \r\nthe planned emergency response would be to have water sprays and foam the diked area to minimize \r\ndownwind effects and fire and explosion potential. The material would then be routed to a recycle sump.   \r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenario- Hydrocyanic Acid:\r\n\r\nThis case involves a release from the Crude atmospheric storage tank containing off-spec material with \r\n8.1% Hydrocyanic Acid in the Acrylonitrile manufacturing  process. A vessel leak was assumed, with a 60 \r\nminute duration. This is conservative due to the Hydrocyanic Acid being calculated as a pure component.  \r\nUnder neutral weather conditions *, this scenario has offsite impacts corresponding to the endpoint \r\nindicated in the EPA Tables.

      "SummaryText": ".  The Green Lake plant has around-the-\r\nclock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations \r\n(e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as \r\nfacilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Green Lake plant \r\nconducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and the \r\nplant provides training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the \r\nplant. \r\n  \r\n2.17\tCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nPSM/RMP compliance audits are conducted at least every three years to verify that the PSM/RMP \r\nprocedures and practices are adequate and are being followed.  The compliance audits are conducted by at \r\nleast one person knowledgeable in the process.  Compliance audit reports are prepared.  Responses to the \r\naudits are managed, and deficiency corrections are documented.  The two most recent audit reports are \r\nretained.\r\n\r\nThe Process Safety Management  and the Risk Management Program Coordinator is assigned to ensure \r\nPSM Compliance Audits are conducted in accordance with requirements.\r\n\r\n3.0\tCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe process at the Green Lake plant has hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  \r\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to the EPA RMP covered process at \r\nthe Green Lake plant.  The prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that \r\ncould be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, the Green Lake plant has safety features on all \r\nunits to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of \r\n(mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in various processes: \r\n\r\nRelease Detection\r\n\r\n1. Detectors with alarm."

      "SummaryText": "Release Containment/Control\r\n\r\n1. Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases.\r\n2. Scrubber to neutralize chemical releases.\r\n3. Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\r\n4. Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (i.e. high level, high temperature)\r\n5. Vessel to permit partial removal of the process inventory in the event of a release (i.e. dump tank)\r\n6. Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\r\n7. Redundant equipment and instrumentation (i.e. uninterruptible power supply for process control \r\n\tsystem, backup firewater pump)\r\n8. Atmospheric relief devices\r\n\r\nRelease Mitigation\r\n\r\n1. Fire suppression and extinguishing systems \r\n2. Deluge systems for specific equipment\r\n3. Trained emergency response personnel\r\n4. Personal protective equipment (e.g., protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus)\r\n5. Mobile fire fighting equipment\r\n6. Blast-resistant buildings to help protect control systems and personnel\r\n\r\n4.0\tRMPlan Communication\r\n\r\nThe PSM/RMP Coordinator has the responsibility of providing RMPlan information (other than the \r\nrequired EPA submission) to employees and the public as required under Section 68.210 of the RMP rule. \r\nThese communications have been coordinated with local community cooperation and have been \r\ncommunicated in open forums in October of 1995 and again in May of 1999.\r\n\r\n5.0\tPlanned changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nBP Chemicals no longer uses large quantities of Formaldehyde and has eliminated the use of a storage \r\ntank for formaldehyde.\r\n\r\n6.0\tRecent Changes\r\n\r\nThe SO2 cylinders were replaced by a storage tank to reduce the number of connections therefore \r\nreducing the likelihood of employee and offsite exposure."
