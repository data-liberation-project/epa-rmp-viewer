BP management strongly supports \n\nProcess Safety Management  and the Risk Management Program and recognizes it as a good business \n\npractice as well as a good approach to protecting workers and the public from industrial operation hazards.  \n\nBP Chemicals Green Lake applies the basic principles of Process Safety Management  and the Risk \n\nManagement Program to all applicable processes. BP Chemicals is an OSHA VPP Star site. The facility is \n\nalso ISO 9002 certified. The facility received ISO 14001 certification in October '01. The facility has been \n\nawarded \"Best In Texas\" from the Texas Chemical Council for the years '89, '91, '92, '95, '96, '97,'98, '00,\n\nand '01; The facility has also been awarded the following; NPRA Gold Award  & Award for Achievement - '95,\n\n'97,'98, '99, '01. Governor's Award for Environmental Excellence-'93, US EPA Environmental Excellence \n\nAwards-1993 Underground Injection, 1994 NPDES, Waste Water Outfall, 1995 UIC and NPDES. The facility has \n\nalso successfully achieved its clean industries 2000 goal of 50% reduction in TRI and hazardous waste. \n\nThe facility has also won the TCC Caring for Texas award for '00 and '01.\n\n\n\nRegulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nBP Chemicals Green Lake plant produces, ships, or uses as a raw material the following chemicals:\n\n\n\n    Acrylonitrile            Ammonia            \n\n    Butane                Propylene        \n\n    Propane                Chlorine                        \n\n    Sulfur Dioxide            Hydrogen Cyanide\n\n    \n\nWorst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s). \n\n\n\nMethodology given in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance by the EPA using equations \n\n(RMPComp version"

A technical team consisting of six local area Chemical Manufacturers Association member \n\ncompanies selected the basis for the scenarios. The team has been in existence since 1994. The teams \n\nfindings were communicated in public meetings in October of '95 and again in May of '99 in an effort \n\nknown as the Victoria/Calhoun County Communications ?Living Safely With Chemicals?. The following \n\nparagraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\n\n\nToxics\n\n\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario:\n\n\n\nThe worst case submitted involves a catastrophic release from a full Crude (Off-Spec) atmospheric storage \n\ntank containing 8.1% Hydrocyanic Acid in the Acrylonitrile manufacturing process. This is conservative \n\ndue to the Hydrocyanic Acid being calculated as a pure component.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is \n\nreleased into a dike, which vaporizes and moves downwind. Under worst case weather conditions **, this \n\nscenario has offsite impacts corresponding to the endpoint indicated in the EPA Tables. For this scenario \n\nthe planned emergency response would be to have water sprays and foam the diked area to minimize \n\ndownwind effects and fire and explosion potential. The material would then be routed to a recycle sump.   \n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario- Hydrocyanic Acid:\n\n\n\nThis case involves a release from the Crude atmospheric storage tank containing off-spec material with \n\n8.1% Hydrocyanic Acid in the Acrylonitrile manufacturing  process. A vessel leak was assumed, with a 60 \n\nminute duration. This is conservative due to the Hydrocyanic Acid being calculated as a pure component.  \n\nUnder neutral weather conditions *, this scenario has offsite impacts corresponding to the endpoint \n\nindicated in the EPA Tables.

      "SummaryText": ".  The Green Lake plant has around-the-\n\nclock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations \n\n(e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as \n\nfacilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Green Lake plant \n\nconducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and the \n\nplant provides training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the \n\nplant. \n\n  \n\n2.17    Compliance Audits\n\n\n\nPSM/RMP compliance audits are conducted at least every three years to verify that the PSM/RMP \n\nprocedures and practices are adequate and are being followed.  The compliance audits are conducted by at \n\nleast one person knowledgeable in the process.  Compliance audit reports are prepared.  Responses to the \n\naudits are managed, and deficiency corrections are documented.  The two most recent audit reports are \n\nretained.\n\n\n\nThe Process Safety Management  and the Risk Management Program Coordinator is assigned to ensure \n\nPSM Compliance Audits are conducted in accordance with requirements.\n\n\n\n3.0    CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe process at the Green Lake plant has hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  \n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to the EPA RMP covered process at \n\nthe Green Lake plant.  The prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that \n\ncould be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, the Green Lake plant has safety features on all \n\nunits to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of \n\n(mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in various processes: \n\n\n\nRelease Detection\n\n\n\n1. Detectors with alarm.\n\n\n\n"
