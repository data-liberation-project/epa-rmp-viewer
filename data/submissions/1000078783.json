WESTCO was founded in 1942 and the Oshkosh Anhydrous Ammonia Plant was built at the present location in 1994.  WESTCO has not had a reportable release or any accidents since the inception of this plant.\n\nFacility Policy:\n\nThe owner, management, and employees operating this facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of hazardous chemicals transported or stored at the facility. In the event that an accidental release should occur, we are prepared to work with our local fire departments, response personnel, and other appropriate authorities deemed applicable depending on the specific incident, to best mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nFacility Regulated Substance Information:\n\nThe primary activity of our company is retail sales to farm producers. The Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application by farmers in our area to farm fields. This product is subject to the EPA Risk Management Program and is the subject of this plan. Only the facility used for this product will be included in this report.\n\nAccidental Release Program:\n\nFor Anhydrous Ammonia, our accidental release program is based on guidelines found in the American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) standard K-61.1 Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard 29CFR 1910.111 for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia. WESTCO requires our employees to be trained in the handling of Anhydrous Ammonia prior to working with the product. We conduct annual employee training on the safe handling, transportation, and distribution of Anhydrous Ammonia. This is done by classroom work, demonstration, and actual hands on training while being closely supervised.\n\nIns"

Employees are required to wear goggles and gloves while transferring Anhydrous Ammonia and this facility has two full-face respirators available in the case of an emergency.\n\nAnnually WESTCO inspects all of our Anhydrous Ammonia plants for the following:\n\n. Pop-off valves that protect against over filling \n. Excess flow valves that protect against a line break.  \n. Paint condition and signage on tank and lines.\n. Transfer hose condition and expiration dates.\n\nEach of our locations has an Emergency Coordinator who is responsible for the safety of our employees and deciding if an emergency requires the assistance of Emergency Professionals such as our local fire department.  Our facilities are included in the community emergency response plans and coordinated through the Local Emergency Planning Commission. We maintain routine contact with our local fire department and emergency response personnel.\n\nWorst-Case Scenario:\n\nThe worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of our largest Anhydrous Ammonia tank.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario:\n\nAs we have not had an actual release of Anhydrous Ammonia during the past five years at the facility, we believe the most likely release would be caused by a failure in a transfer hose. Transfer hoses are protected by manual, self-closing excess flow, and pull away valves. The alternative release scenario is based on the loss of contents from the largest hose used for off loading transportation equipment.\n\nThe worst case and alternative release scenarios were calculated using the EPA's RMP*Comp program and LandView 6 Census 2000 Population Estimator Software.\n\nFive-Year Accident History:\n\nWe have not had a release of Anhydrous Ammonia within the past five years that ha"

We also include these materials in our own Emergency Action Plan in accordance with OSHA Standard 29CFR 1910.38. We provide State and Local authorities all Community Right-to-Know information requested as well as that required under SARA Title III (EPCRA). Our written employee safety programs include pre-emergency planning and employee training in accordance with OSHA standards, and are offered for review at any time by our LEPC to ensure that they conform to the community plans. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nSafety improvement, employee training, operating procedures, and equipment preventative maintenance are on-going processes at our facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess all aspects of this process. Current recommendations are to build more barriers around storage tanks before the end of summer 2009 and immediately purchase wheel chocks. There are no additional specific recommendations or changes in equipment, technology, or organizational structure scheduled for implementation at this time.\n\nSpecial Note Regarding Reporting Quantities:\nReporting quantities have increased from previous RMP submission due to the change in the way we were advised to report and calculate the quantities from our Regional EPA Agent. There has not been an actual physical increase in quantities. The 2009 RMP submission quantity under Section 1.17.c. includes bulk storage tanks plus portable nurse tanks whereas the 2004 RMP quantity for this section was only bulk storage.
