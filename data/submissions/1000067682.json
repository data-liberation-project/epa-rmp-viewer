The facility is staffed year-round and also employs a large seasonal workforce during the spring and summer months. The plant produces fresh and frozen processed seafood products.  The facility uses Anhydrous Ammonia in a closed system as the refrigerant for freezers and cold storage.  Ammonia is the safest refrigerant available and has excellent warning properties; it is extremely pungent at levels far below dangerous concentrations. Machine Rooms 1 & 3 are both within the same building structure. In calculating worst-case and alternative scenarios, efforts were made in all cases to overestimate rather than underestimate the effects of a release. The plant has been operating safely since 1962.\r\n\r\nRelease Prevention Program\r\nAlaska Pacific Seafoods has a prevention program in place to comply with the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and EPA Risk Management Program, which is designed to prevent accidental releases of ammonia.  The PSM program addresses all required elements including employee participation, process safety information and system drawings, operating procedures, hot work permits, management of change, mechanical integrity, training, pre-startup review, compliance audits, process hazard analysis, contractor safely, incident investigation and emergency response.  The system itself has many safety features built in including high and low level controls and alarms, pressure relief valves, automatic and manually controlled valves and shutoffs, and check valves.  Plant personnel responsible for the system have had extensive trainin"

There has been one such accident at this facility in the past five years. This was a vapor release to water that did not effect any person, but for a short time shutdown the sewage treatment facility.\r\n\r\nEmergency Action Plan\r\nAlaska Pacific Seafoods maintains a written emergency action plan as part of the PSM plan to facilitate action to accidental ammonia releases. The facility as procedures for both evacuation and shelter-in-place. The plan identifies personnel designated and trained to conduct the necessary duties during an incident. Responsibilities include notification of and communication with local responders and authorities, coordinating with local responders, as well as maintenance of emergency equipment and trained personnel. To continue to improve safety the facility continues to coordinate its emergency action plan with local authorities and responders and conducts drills annually."
