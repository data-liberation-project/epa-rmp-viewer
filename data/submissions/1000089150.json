The facility's primary activity is acrolein packaging, encompassing receiving and transfer of acrolein, a chemical used in oilfield and agricultural applications, into bulk storage containers and shipping/dispenser containers.  We also rework and service the containers.  The acrolein is used as a pesticide and algaecide for crop protection and a sulfide scavenger, biocide, and corrosion inhibitor in oil field applications.\n\n\n\nProcesses at the facility are subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program (RMP) for Accidental Release [40 CFR 68] for Acrolein production, storage and loading processes containing more than the threshold quantities of acrolein (CAS No. 107-02-8). Acrolein is a toxic and flammable substance which is a liquid at ambient temperatures.  \n\n\n\nThe packaging process includes a truck rack for unloading incoming loads of acrolein in the packaging area.  ISO-containers of acrolein are received on flatbed truck trailers and unloaded into the railcar mounted ISO-containers for storage and packaging.  Although multiple ISO-containers on trailers can be held in storage at the plant, the process only allows for unloading of one at a time.\n\n\n\nIf the incoming product spec-grade fails to meet specification partial amount of material is transferred in one of three 1,000 gallon process tanks for adjustment. Ultimately transferred into dedicated ISO-containers on flatbed railcars for storage prior to repackaging.\n\n\n\nThe process storage can have up to 30,000 lbs of acrolein present in a single ISO-container and a total of twelve (12) ISO - containers on the rail siding and up to ten (10) ISO-containers on truck chassis for temporary/overflow storage (36,000lbs/each).  \n\n\n\nIn the packaging area, the facility is capable of holdi"

Approximately 130,000 lbs of acrolein is packaged per month, with variable daily rates of fill depending upon existing inventory and customer demand.\n\n\n\n\n\nBaker Hughes and Taft Manufacturing Company are committed to the ongoing safety and sustainability of our operations.  To ensure the protection of our employees, our neighbors, and the environment, we have implemented a HSE management system that utilizes standard operating procedures, training, administrative and engineering controls, and other safety practices to assure that acrolein is handled in a safe manner. Details of the facility's prevention program are summarized in the following sections.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nTaft Manufacturing has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA as well as the requirements of Ca. Code of Regulations , Title 19, Public Safety, Div. 2, Off. Of Emergence Service, Chapter 4.5 Ca. Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program. A number of processes at our facility are also subject to the OSHA/CalOSHA PSM standards under 29 CFR 1910.119/8 CCR 5189.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information- A detailed record of safety information that describes chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes is maintained at the facility and accessible to all employees at all times.  Regular review of the process safety information is conducted to verify it is current and accurate.  The information is consulted when making decisions about possible equipment and procedural changes, when conducting hazard reviews, and when training, among other uses.  The current set of process safety information is always consulted prior to conducting any PHA for the process.\n\n\n\nP"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is scaled to fit the complexity of the process, and may be HAZOP, WHAT-IF, or CHECKLIST methods.  Non-management employees are always included in the study, and involved in making suggestions to improve the safety and environmental operation of their work environment.  Any employee not directly participating in the PHA is informed of the recommendations in a company meeting, and given access to the tracking program to see the progress towards completion of the recommendations.  All recommendations are completed within 2.5 years of the PHA, with the majority being completed within a year of the study.  All past studies are maintained for the life of the process and available to any employee upon request.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures - Any activity conducted at the facility that is associated with the control of the regulated substances has been standardized and captured in a written operating procedure.  The procedures address normal operations, startup, shutdown, emergency operations, temporary operations, and recovery from emergency/post-emergency restarting.  The procedures include critical process operating limits and the description and function of the associate safety and control systems.  Taft Manufacturing uses the procedures for the training of new employees, and involves the employees in the annual review and update process to ensure that ground-level employees have direct impact on the safety systems and the facility body of knowledge.  The information is reviewed and annually certified to be current and accurate.  Procedures are readily accessible to any operator involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining - "

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of the intended change, allowed to provide input to the intended change, and provided training to deal with the modification. \n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Review - Pre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at the facility.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.  \n\n\n\nCompliance Audits - At least once every three years the PSM/RMP program is audited for effectiveness and implementation by a team from Baker Hughes corporate office.  The team follows known audit protocol and identifies any corrective actions required to ensure the integrity of the management system.  Actions resulting from audits are tracked in a database accessible to all employees, and are closed in a timely manner, typically within a year of the receipt of the audit report.  Audit findings are shared with all employees in a company meeting and updates on progress in completing recommendations are likewise shared.  The two most recent audit reports are kept in the facility file and are accessible to any employee who wishes to view them.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation - Taft Manufacturing Company promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could have reasonably resulted in, a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. "

To ensure this knowledge, prior to working in any covered process, an employee is trained in the operation of the process and equipment, and certified competent by a knowledgeable operator trainer.  Refresher training is conducted no less frequently than once every three years, and certifications are maintained in the company records.  If an incident occurs which indicates a gap in training or knowledge, the operators is immediately retrained and recertified.  Management is committed to only using trained and qualified operators and maintains a list of currently trained operators for each associated task. \n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity - Protection of people and the environment requires that equipment holding and handling hazardous materials be properly maintained and regularly inspected.  To ensure the mechanical integrity of our operating equipment, Taft Manufacturing carries out maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Frequency of inspection and the procedures followed are set based upon manufacturer's recommendations for the equipment.  In the absence of manufacturer's equipment, Recognized and Generally Accepted Good Engineering Practices (RAGAGEP) are used to determine an appropriate frequency.  To assist the maintenance teams in tracking maintenance activities, the facility uses the CMMS program Maximo.
