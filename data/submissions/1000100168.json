Once the cylinder or container has been rendered harmless, we will arrange to remove it from our site so that our repackage can inspect it at their facility. \r\n\r\nIn the case of a catastrophic release where the entire contents of a ton container are lost in a ten minute period as indicated by the worst-case scenario, our best hope would be immediate evacuation through contact with the local emergency response authority followed by the appropriate cleanup of the site after the evacuation of the contents from the container.  \r\n\r\nIn the case of a fire, or temperatures above 165 degrees F for chlorine, the cylinders and containers are designed to release their contents via the melting of a fusible plug which prevents catastrophic releases due to overpressure within the cylinders or containers. In this case, after we contact the local emergency response authorities, it will be established whether it is possible to remove the affected cylinder or container from the area that caused the release, and then affect the emergency repair upon the cylinder or container once it has cooled, or is cooled by external means (if available) to stop the leak. The alternative release scenarios reflect the type of leak one might expect if the fusible plug was faulty or melted.\r\n\r\nIn summary, we are pleased with our safety record. Still, we look forward to coordinating effectively with all of the regulatory agencies and demonstrating a willingness to share information with the public. We feel prepared and trained to handle emergencies and have experience dealing with cylinder leaks at our customer's locations. These leaks though rare, are almost invariably due to user error yet constitute an opportunity for us to keep our skills sharp in response to an event.

We store the products in such a way that accidental movement of the cylinders or containers is not possible, and cylinders are stored so that liquid release is virtually impossible, barring a catastrophic release.    \r\n\r\nWe limit access to the cylinders and containers by unauthorized individuals by using our safety program, which requires anyone who enters our facility to have a badge indicating that they are authorized to be at the facility for a specific purpose. Anyone who does not have this authority will be immediately scrutinized and removed from the facility if they have no reasonable cause to be present. We have installed two areas with additional safety features. These contain Chemicals of Interest to the Department of Homeland Security. Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide reside in one of these areas, which have a locked redundant fence at all times when the facility is closed. These areas are also under constant monitoring through the use of IP cameras. This system incorporates motion alarms to contact several employees via cell phone and e-mail if motion alerts occur during non-working hours.\r\n\r\nIn the event of an accidental release, our employees will identify the product initially by smell at the greatest safe distance and then contact our Emergency Response Coordinator (ERC) (Jamie Ball, Vice President of Operations) for further assistance. At that time, the ERC will contact the local emergency response authorities to coordinate action for response to the situation. In our discussions with the local emergency response authorities, they plan to establish a perimeter in the case of an accidental release and then coordinate with our ERC to set the next best course of action. We agree that we will take advantage of standard equipment to deal with an accidental release of any of these gases.

Any cylinder or container deemed unacceptable will be refused at the time of receipt and returned to the source by the source's shipper (generally company-owned trucks).
