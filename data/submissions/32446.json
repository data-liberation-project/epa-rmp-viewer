Many of our employees are members of the Local Emergency Planning Committees, area volunteer fire departments, and local emergency response units.  Our facilities have written emergency preparedness plans that are updated regularly.\n\nAshland facilities typically host open houses every 3 to 5 years as an opportunity for neighbors to learn about our commitment to safety.  Ashland makes every effort to support our communities through sponsorship of local activities and participation in local organizations.\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:  \n\nThis facility produces maleic anhydride by the oxidation of butane and air in the presence of a catalyst.  Butane is the single regulated substance handled above the regulatory threshold quantity.  The facility receives truck deliveries of butane into three (3) storage tanks.  Butane is also supplied on supplemental basis via pipe line from the Catlettsburg Refinery.\n\nFor more information, visit our web site at www.ashspec.com or contact the Plant Manager.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThis facility is operated in strict accordance with the USEPA prevention program requirements.
