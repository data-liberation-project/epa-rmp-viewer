This commitment is demonstrated by our accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our water treatment facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nChlorine is the only regulated substance present at our facility.  Chlorine is used for disinfection purposes in the treatment of potable water.  Chlorine is stored as a liquefied gas under pressure.  The vapor pressure of stored chlorine is 6.8 atmospheres (99.89 psi \u00bf pounds per square inch).  Chlorine gas is non-flammable, but it is a strong oxidizer that can support combustion of other materials.  Chlorine is a toxic gas that is considered by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) to be immediately dangerous to life and health at concentrations exceeding 10 parts per million (ppm).\nThe maximum inventory of chlorine at our facility is 64,000 lbs. (pounds) or thirty-two 2,000-lb. cylinders.  The largest single vessel of chlorine at our facility is a 2,000-lb. cylinder.  A maximum of eight (8) cylinders are hooked up at any one time (4 in-service and 4 on standby).  The chlorine cylinders are equipped with a fusible plug that is designed to fail if the temperature of the cylinder reaches approximately 158\u00b0F (Fahrenheit).  The purpose of the fusible plug is to prevent cylinder failure in the event of an extended, hot fire by allowing a controlled release of the cylinder contents.  All of the chlorine cylinders in our facility are located in the chlorine room, which is of fireproof co"

These models evaluate the Distance to Toxic Endpoint based on the Emergency Response Planning Guideline 2 (ERPG-2).  These guidelines were developed by the American Industrial Hygiene Association to represent the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms that could impair an individual\u00bfs ability to take protective action.  The ERPG-2 toxic endpoint for chlorine is 0.0087 mg/L.  We performed the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility using the EPA\u00bfs RMP-Comp Model, which is an electronic version of the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance. The release scenario modeling was performed using the EPA RMP-Comp computer program.  This program calculates the distance to the toxic endpoint for chlorine depending upon the effects of variable factors.  The wind speed and air stability class, presence of partial enclosures and general topographic types are all factors that affect the model calculations.  The type of release and release rates are also evaluated by the model.\nBecause the chlorine storage area/chlorination process equipment is located in a semi-enclosed area the RMP-Comp model modified the release entered into the model.  This takes into account the passive mitigation provided by the presence of the structure.  As an example,"

This data is designed to provide general information about the population in a given area, however the data is provided by geographic block groups and the local accuracy of the data can be variable.  The public and environmental receptor data represents a combination of United States Census Bureau data, information obtained from United States Geological Survey 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle maps and field observations.   \nThe following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\nThe worst-case release scenario was estimated to involve the total release of one 2,000-lb. cylinder of chlorine.  This is consistent with the regulation definition of a worst-case scenario as the release of the greatest quantity contained in the single largest vessel.  The use of check valves and other release prevention mitigative measures cannot be considered for the worst-case scenario.  The entire contents of the vessels were assumed to be released as a gas over a 10-minute period.  This type of catastrophe is extremely unlikely and would possibly require the complete failure of the cylinder to occur.  A simple puncture, valve failure or line failure would not be likely to result in a ten-minute release of the contents from the cylinder.  The EPA\u00bfs RMP-Comp model was used assuming an \u00bfUrban\u00bf topography setting due to the buildings and very hilly topography on and near the plant site (note \u00bf the RMP-Comp model uses a \u00bfrural\u00bf setting for flat, open topography and an \u00bfurban\u00bf setting for areas with many buildings, trees or rough and broken topography.

The population within this area is approximately 96 people, according to the 1990 census data.  Public receptors were identified within the radial distance to the worst-case endpoint, including residences and recreational areas.  \nAlternative-Case Release Scenarios\nTwo alternative-case scenarios were modeled to represent circumstances that were estimated to be more likely to occur at the facility.  One alternative-case release scenario was estimated to involve the release of chlorine from a broken 3/4-inch valve fitting over a ten-minute period (i.e., 120 pounds/minute).  This scenario assumed that the release detection system/automatic shutoffs malfunctioned and the cylinders had to be closed manually by facility personnel.  In this scenario, 1,200 lbs. of chlorine was assumed to have been released as a gas over a ten-minute period.  As with the worst-case scenario, the EPA\u00bfs RMP-Comp model was used assuming an \u00bfUrban\u00bf topography setting.  The wind speed was assumed to be 6.7 miles/hour with a stability class of \u00bfD\u00bf, according to EPA guidelines.

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a shutdown.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\nTraining\nThe water treatment facility has a training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least annually and more frequently as needed.\nMechanical Integrity\nThe water treatment facility carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.
