              "Description": "Ben E. Keith Foods is a cold storage/warehousing facility.  This facility falls under the NAICS Cods 424410.  Our safety information was last reviewed on 10/16/2009(safety meetings are also conducted every month).  We are subject to the codes of the National Fire Protection Association and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.  These standards have been implemented.  Last Hazard review was 1/4/2007.  Nothing has changed since then.  There were no major hazards identified during the review.  To aid in the prevention of releases, this facility uses standard operating and maintenance procedures for the refrigeration system, vents, relief valves, check valves, manual shutoffs, alarms and procedures, emergency air supply, and grounding equipment.  The operating and training procedures were last reviewed and updated was 10/16/2009.  The refrigeration technicians of Ben E. Keith Foods are trained in the classroom and by on-the-job training.  This training is completed by demonstration and observation of working knowledge of the system.  The training programs were last conducted on 1/22/2009.  Dennis Davis and Adalberto Rodriguez completed their Certified Refrigeration Technicians Course  January 26, 2002 and have benn recertified annually.  Process Compliance Inc. reviewed other training information during a visit on 10/16/2009.    \nEmployees who are trained in the proper operating procedures of the ammonia refrigeration system are knowledgeable in the Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Manual provided by the manufacturer.  The last review of maintenance procedures was completed on 1/2/2009.  However, employees perform daily and weekly visual inspections to check for abnormal operating conditions, which may cause the release of ammonia from the system.    Different components of the refrigeration system are checked on a daily basis to ensure performance.  Compressors, accumulators, condensers, receivers, cold rooms, alarms, and purgers of the system are checked by use of a list.  This list has several different aspect of each component of the system.  For instance, the Compressors are checked for Suction Pressure, Suction Temperature, Discharge Pressure, Discharge Temperature, Oil Pressure, Oil Temperature, etc.  If any items noted on the checklist are not within the recommended operating zones, the maintenance personnel determine the cause and correct the problem, with the assistance of the O&M Manual.  Also, maintenance personnel conduct preventative maintenance on the system yearly with the aid of RC&E Refrigeration to help prevent releases of anhydrous ammonia due to equipment failure.    Any work such as changing valves, seals, etc. are performed as needed.  Certified refrigeration technicians (Dennis Davis and Adalberto Rodriguez) help to oversee the any maintenance conducted on the system.  RC&E Refrigeration is an outside contractor who also helps to ensure the proper installation of system components if needed.\n\nBen E. Keith Foods has contracted Process Compliance Inc. to assist us in manageing our safety information, operating and maintenance procedures and training.  Ben E. Keith Foods is a Level 3 Prevention Program Facility, and is implementing Process Safety Management at this location to help in the prevention of accidental releases from this facility.",

Keith Foods), we handle anhydrous ammonia which is considered hazardous by the EPA, OSHA, etc.  The same properties that makes anhydrous ammonia valuable as a cold storage chemical, also makes it necessary to observe certain precautions in handling anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration purposes.  Overall, the prevention of unnecessary human exposures, reducing the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and reducing the threat to nearby members of the community is the main goal of incorporating this Risk Management Plan into our daily operations.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle and use anhydrous ammonia combined in coordination with the operations and maintenance procedures provided by the manufacturer of the ammonia refrigeration system, as well ass the training of our employees.\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is cold storage/warehousing by refrigerating storage room via ammonia system.  The refrigeration system supplies cooling and freezer areas throughout the facility.  Anhydrous ammonia is mostly a gas, but is also liquefied under pressure in the storage vessel, which is located on the roof of the motor room.  This liquid ammonia is condensed and cooled through the utilization of the refrigeration system.  The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia in the system at any one time is 35,000 pounds.\n\nOur employee (maintenance) conduct proper start-up procedures as listed in the manufacturer's Operation & Maintenance manual for the refrigeration system.  These personnel also review the operating procedures and maintenance tasks when needed to insure the proper and safe use of the ammonia in the refrigeration system to aid in the prevention of accidental releases of ammonia.  The maintenance tasks performed are visual inspections conducted daily; visual inspections conducted weekly, preventative mainten"

The mechanical integrity of the system is completed by keeping a listing of parts recommended by the manufacturer for change-out if and when needed.  RC&E Refrigeration is the local refrigeration contractor who helps to insure that all maintenance and system change-out is completed properly.  The refrigeration technicians on staff assists in the mechanical integrity and general maintenance up-keep of the system.  The facility has a Process Safety Management Plan, which is being incorporated into the daily routine to comply with the Level 3 Prevention Program Requirements.  They also have a Lock-out/Tag-out program, Hazard Communication program, Confined Space Program (if needed), and an Emergency Action Plan to aid in the prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  These programs, along with the Process Safety Management Program comprise a huge portion of Ben E. Keith Foods prevention portion.\n\nThe emergency response program was developed with the assistance of Process Compliance, Inc.  Spill Response Solutions HAZMAT Crew, Fort Worth Fire Department and the Fort Worth Emergency Management Office (LEPC) will be requested to assist Ben E. Keith Foods if a release occurs from this location.  If an anhydrous ammonia release occurs at the 7650 Will Rogers Blvd location, employees will notify Refrigerations Technician (Dennis Davis) of a release, and personnel will get organized for an emergency action/response and possible evacuation of the facility and surrounding affected areas. The emergency response/action plan consists of HAZMAT Trained Spill Response Solutions and Ben E.

This facility utilizes an employee electronic key card system to ensure that personnel working at this location are accounted for if evacuation is necessary.  The 911 calls should have been made by this time to notify other emergency response agencies (Fort Worth Fire Dept., and Fort Worth Emergency Management Office - LEPC) to assist in the mitigation and evacuation procedures.\n\nThe worst-case scenario is a hole/failure in the largest storage vessel for Anhydrous Ammonia, in the refrigeration system.  This would be a release of 8,000 pounds of ammonia gas/vapor into the atmosphere.  Active mitigation was considered for this release, however, in a worst-case scenario, all efforts and devices would fail.  This release would result in a distance to endpoint of 0.66 miles.  The worst-case scenario would impact approximately 761 persons.  This information was determined by the use of RMP Comp, and Landview 6 software.\n\nAn alternate release scenario was completed for this facility based on an estimated release that could occur.  This release would be a transfer line failure (anhydrous transfer line from tanker truck to recharge the facility).  This would be a 1 inch anhydrous line located outside the wall adjacent to the ammonia system compressor room.  The line leak would be located outside the building in a parking lot area.  Because of automatic line shut off devices, the release would last for 2 minutes and release a total of 161 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia.  This release of ammonia would have a distance to endpoint of approximately 0.5 miles.  This relatively short distance to endpoint would impact approximately 23 people located in commercial facilities near the release facility.\n\nIt is Ben E.
