Femrite Drive Facility complies with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations. All employees are informed of hazards in the workplace. Employees who work with potentially hazardous substances receive proper training in the handling of those substances. This facility has procedures in place to safely remove employees from areas in the unlikely event that a hazardous substance release were to occur, and to put in place emergency notification and action procedures.\n\n\n\n2.    Facility and Regulated Substances\n\nCertco Inc, Femrite Drive Facility is a grocery distribution center.  The facility utilizes Anhydrous Ammonia as a refrigerant to maintain the proper temperatures for storage of product.  Ammonia, a gas at normal atmospheric temperature and pressure, is used in an anhydrous form liquefied under pressure in a two stage process.  The refrigeration system consists of a High Pressure Receiver, Evaporators, Compressors, Condensers, Vessels, Piping and numerous types of Valves.  Certco Inc, Femrite Drive Facility has an integrated safety management program to prevent ammonia releases and mitigate the consequences of a release, should one occur.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.    Worst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios\n\nOff Site Consequence (OCA) data is available for review onsite at the Certco Inc. Femrite Drive Facility.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.    General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Ammonia Specific Prevention\n\nThe Certco Inc, Madison, WI - Femrite Drive Facility has an emergency plan that addresses the actions necessary in the event of a release of ammonia from the refrigeration system. Because of the pungent odor of ammonia, any leak is easily detected. The compressor rooms are provided with ammonia detectors and visual alarms. The refrigeration system is designed so that major components can be isolated by closing selected valves. Further, refrigeration system operators and contr"
