Facility Policy.\n        \n        The owners, management and employees of Ramsdell F&M, Ltd. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Moody County LEPC, and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2.     Facility Information.\n\n        The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed as a nutrient for crop production.  The maximum quantity stored would be 52000 pounds in storage tanks.\n\n3.     Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\na.     The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as gas over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 26,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and administrative controls.  The distance to the end point was determined using The Fertilizer Institute ? DEGADIS model format.\n\nb.     The alternate release scenario:  a 2-inch pipe is used as an alternate scenario followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shut-down valve/valves intervenes or remote manual shut-off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia.  The maximum quantity released would be 12,000 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint was determined using The Fertilizer Institute ? DEGADIS model format.\n\n4.     Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n        The facility is in compliance with the provisions of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".  The OSHA standard is ref"

Five-Year Accident History.\n\n         There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, has there been any accidental releases resulting in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.       Emergency Action Plan.\n\n          The facility has:\n\n             a.     A written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb.     Provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to- know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\nc. If a large release of anhydrous ammonia takes place at the facility, the required response    action is to evacuate the area of the spill and call 911 and all applicable emergency response numbers.  \n\n1. With-in 15 minutes of determining the amount of the release would be over 100 pounds, the Emergency Coordinator will notify:\n\n The National Emergency Response Center @ 800-424-8802\n\n2. Immediately after determining the amoujnt of release, the Emergency Coordinator will \nNotify:\n\nThe Department of Environmental and Natural Resources @ 605-773-3296 (day phone) \nor  605-773-3231 (after hours phone).        \n          \n7.       Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\n          Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the conditions of the facility.  There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
