Therefore, based on this, the Management Team is\ncommitted to complying with applicable regulations.  As part of the Risk Management\nPlan and the National Association of Chemical Distributors' (NACD) Responsible\nDistribution Process, a full and detailed Emergency Response plan is being redesigned \nand will be implemented within a reasonable amount of time.\n\n*Your Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nWarsaw Chemical Co., Inc. is a chemical manufacturing facility with over 100,000 square\nfeet under roof.  We blend raw materials (chemicals) into finished goods.  Our product\nline is broken into three major sections - maintenance, carwash and industrial products.  \n\nIn effort to handle and store our flammable liquids in a safe manner, we built a specially\ndesign Bulk Plant with many safety features.  All tanks are above ground and diked.  The\ntanker off-loading pad is also diked and lined.  The entire building is sprinkled.  Inside\nsprinkler systems uses foam, while to tanker off-loading area is equipped with a water\ncurtain system. This building does not contain any substances regulated under this rule at\nor above the threshold quantities.\n\nThe main building houses our production, warehouse and shipping and receiving\nfacilities.  Our product lines are further divided into powders and liquids.  \n\nWhether it liquid or powder, raw materials a blend together using different techniques\nand the packaged into appropriate containers.  Containers sizes range from 1 pint bottle to\n375 gallon totes.\n\nWarsaw Chemical Co., Inc. uses several regulated substances under this, but only one at\nor above threshold quantities, Chlorine.  The processes involving chlorine are simple. \nWe handle chlori"

      "SummaryText": "ne in two different forms, one is a gas in cylinders and the other as a\ncomponent in sodium hypochlorite.\n\nBoth are used for water treatment, whether it is for pools or drinking water purification.\n\nSodium hypochlorite contains 12.5%  chlorine in solution.  Throughout the summer time,\nWarsaw Chemical Co., Inc. packages over a 1/2 million pounds of sodium hypochlorite. \nKeep in mind that only 12.5% is chlorine.\n\nThe chlorine gas is stored in cylinders in a separate building from the rest of the plant. \nMaximum inventory for these does not exceed 90 cylinders at any given time.  Inventory\nreduction is a method used to minimized potential exposures.  Chlorine gas is not used in\nproduction.\n\n*The Worst-Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s)\n\nThe sodium hypochlorite is stored outside in a diked 5000 gallon tank.  The diked area is\nsufficient to hold the entire contents of the tank. However, as a precaution, the tank is not\nfilled to capacity.  If the tank should rupture or be overfilled, the contents will be\ncontained in the dike for recovery and disposal.  All piping is also diked to prevent\nproduct loss in the event of leakage or rupture.\n\nSince the chlorine is in solution and tank is diked, off-site impact should be minimal.  If\nthe dike should leak, the solution is likely to reach storm sewer on-site and disinfect it in\nthe process.  Any free chlorine will dissipate quickly.\n\nThe cylinders of chlorine gas are stored upright in safety cages in an separate building. \nCylinders are protected from the elements and stored out of direct sunlight.  The cylinders\nare equipped with fusible plugs that are designed to melt at given temperatures to slowly\nrelease excessive vapor pressure.  Each full cylinder contains 150# of chlorine gas.\n\nA cylinder leaking liquid poses a larger problem than a cylinder leaking gas.  Liquid will\nrelease 460 times the volume of gas.  Though the cylinders are stored indoors, if gas\nshould escape in sufficient quantities"

We are involved in NACDs Responsible Distribution Process.  This\nprocess is designed to help chemical distributors to fully comply with all applicable\nhealth and safety standards and pass it through  on to end users.\n\nMajor compliance issues for Warsaw Chemical Co., Inc. includes this Rule, OSHA\nProcess Safety Management, Hazard Communication, Personal Protective Equipment,\nClean Air Act and so forth.\n\nThe first step in the prevention of accidental release of hazardous chemical is the\nelimination of hazardous chemical where possible.  If the hazardous chemical is essential\nthen inventory is kept to a minimum to prevent excess build up of hazardous materials.\n\nSince the presence of hazardous chemical is inevitable, proper storage, handling and\ntraining is mandatory.  Employees must go through training prior to handling any\nhazardous chemicals, with period retraining throughout their employment.\n\nStorage vessels are selected to properly store the hazardous materials and are maintained\nin safe conditions.\n\nWarsaw Chemical Co., Inc. is always trying to improve our training efforts in order to\nminimize or prevent the release of any chemical.\n\n*The Five Year Accident History\n\nWarsaw Chemical Co., Inc. has experienced only one incident involving the regulated\nsubstance chlorine within the past 5 years.  \n\nA tiny pin hole developed in the sidewall of the cylinder, thus, allowing chlorine in a\nliquid form to be released.
