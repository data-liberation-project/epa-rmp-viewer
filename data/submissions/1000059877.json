At the\n\nfacility, railcars are stored on the property until marketing can find a suitable market for the liquids.\n\nPropane (odorized) is the only substance regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP)\n\nthat is present at the Bennington Branch facility in amounts above threshold quantity. The\n\nfacility is classified as Program Level 2 under the regulation.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part\n\nof the high standards striven for by Plains. These high standards include:\n\n?    Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations.\n\n?    Operating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\n\n?    Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal\n\n?    operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent pos"

However, they do operate under the requirements of\n\nProgram Level 2 in the RMP regulations. Analysis of the potential hazards of the process, training of\n\nemployees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents since\n\noperations began. Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid\n\npotential accidental chemical releases.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nNo incident resulting in onsite injuries, death or property damage or offsite impacts from a propane\n\nrelease has occurred at the Bennington Branch Facility within the last five years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe facility has developed an emergency response plan, which will be coordinated with local\n\nemergency response groups such as the Bennington Fire Department. Also involved in emergency\n\nresponse for the facility would be the County Regional Planning Commission. The facility operator is\n\nresponsible for coordinating the notifications required to initiate an emergency response. The\n\nEmergency Response Plan provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the\n\npublic, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program coupled with the environmental, health and safety\n\nmanagement systems, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement. Some of the key\n\ncomponents of the safety program are:\n\n?
