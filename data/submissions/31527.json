This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release where to occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\nTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the manufacturing of oil-field chemicals. We have eight regulated substances present at our facility that are over the threshold amount. Toxic substances include Anhydrous Ammonia, Aqueous Ammonia, Ethylene Oxide, Formaldehyde 50% solution, and Propylene Oxide. Flammable substances include 1-Butene, Isopentane, and Isopropylamine.\n\nThe regulated substances are used in various processes at the facility.  Ammonia and isopropylamine are used in acid neutralization reactions. Ethylene Oxide and Propylene Oxide are used in alkyloxylation reactions. Formaldehyde solution is used in the production of resins. 1-Butene and Isopentane are used in the production of a pipeline drag reducing agent.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. A number of processes at our facility are subject to OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements. The following sections briefly describe the elements for the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFO"
