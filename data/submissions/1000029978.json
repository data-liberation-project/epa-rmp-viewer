      "SummaryText": "The Accidental Release Prevention Risk Management Program rule (40CFR Part 68) is similar to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management Program, which is designed to protect workers from the accidental release of hazardous substances.  The Risk Management Program Rule addresses over 100 chemical substances, 77 of which are acutely toxic and 63 are flammable gases, and the accidental release of these substances.  The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) estimates that over  100,000 sources are covered by the rule, including chemical manufacturers and wholesalers, certain retailers, potable water treatment systems, wastewater treatment plants, ammonia refrigeration systems, and federal facilities.\n\nThe Rio Grande City Water Treatment Plant (WTP) falls under this regulation because of the on-site storage of chlorine.  The amount of chlorine stored is above the threshold limit specified by the USEPA thereby making the facility subject to compliance with the regulation.  Rio Grande City personnel have complied with the USEPA Risk Management Program rule and have completed an Accidental Release Program Plan (ARPP) that contains the following required information.\n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\nA hazards assessment that establishes the worst case and alternate release scenarios and their impact on the population and the environment (40 CFR Subpart B)\n\nA prevention program that includes safety information, a hazards review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits and incident investigation (40 CFR Subpart C)\n\nAn mergency response plan (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart E)\n\nThe following subsections discuss details of the plan that has been implemented at the Rio Grande City WTP.\n\nRELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe WTP facility in Rio Grande City, Texas has an excellent record in preventing and minimizing releases of chlorine.\n\nThe emergency response policies at this facility ensure that there is emerg"

There are also adequate provisions for coordination with outside agencies, such as the Rio Grande City Fire Department in the event of an emergency.  In the event of a release, plant staff will contact the Rio Grande City Fire Department, relaying information regarding the release prior to implementing plant evacuation to a location outside the plant gates, awaiting the fire department to inform its personnel of all information about the release and to provide assurance that the plant has been totally evacuated.\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe WTP uses chlorine as a disinfectant in the water treatment process.  The plant regularly has a storage maximum quantity of 2 one-ton cylinders of chlorine at its facility that is stored outside.  This is above the the threshold limit of 2,500 pounds set by the EPA.\n\nPROCESS DESCRIPTION\n\nThree raw water pumps on the bank of the Rio Grande River discharge through two aerators to supply two terminal reservoirs located at the WTP.  From there, three raw water pumps convey water from the terminal reservoirs into a rapid mix chamber, two flocculation basins, three sedimentation basins and six mixed media filters.  The water then goes into a clearwell.  Three transfer pumps take suction from the clearwell to supply two ground storage tanks.  Six high service pumps supply the distribution.\n\nChlorine dioxide, liquid alum, caustic soda, gas chlorine and liquid ammonium sulfate are added in the rapid mix chamber.  Post chlorination with gas chlorine is applied at the clearwell.  Two backwash pumps take suction from the ground storage tanks to backwash the filters.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Rio Grande City WTP accident history was reviewed from December 2004 to December 2009.  During this period, no accidental releases of chlorine had occurred.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThis facility has developed an Emergency Response Program involving the immediate plant evacuation once the C"

Plant operators are required to make rounds for inspection and monitoring of the plants processes every hour.  Accordingly, plant staff will detect any releases of chlorine and the Fire Department is trained to resond to this situation.\n\nThe Emergency Response Plant includes:  (1) procedures to follow in the event of a chlorine emergency, (2) information about the plant's evacuation plan and (3) a detailed description for the emergency responders plan for handling such as an emergency.\n\nThe Rio Grande City Fire Department has been designated to provide emergency responders and equipment, and will assume Incident Command upon arrival to the plant's emergency.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe WTP will continue to train plant personnel in chlorine safety procedures by attending classes and safety meetings.  The use of safety equipment (self-contained breathing apparatus, gloves, clothing) shall be emphad."
