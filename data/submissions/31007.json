Human error\n?  Vandalism/sabotage\n?  Mechanical / electrical failure\n?  Physical damage\n?  Natural disaster\n?  Fire / explosion.\n\nThe USEPA recommended Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) is the release of ammonia at the storage tank through a ? inch orifice.  The quantities of ammonia associated with this ARS are expected to extend beyond the property boundaries given the ARS meteorological conditions recommended in the USEPA Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration.\nUse of the RMP*COMP Ver. 1.07 provided by the USEPA for the recommended Alternative Release-Scenari"

The quantities of ammonia associated with this ARS are NOT expected to extend beyond the property boundaries.\n\n4.0  General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThis facility is in compliance with the OSHA PSM and USEPA RMP rules.
