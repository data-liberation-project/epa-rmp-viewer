The RMP has been prepared in accordance with the Federal Clean Air Act (Section 112( r ) and associated regulations in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68.  The facility supplies frozen foods to all Wegmans stores.  In order to keep the food frozen, an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system is used.  This type of system is commonly used at many refrigerated and frozen foods facilities as it is safe, economical, and reliable.\n\nThe Frozen Foods Distribution Center refrigeration system has 15,010 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  Following are the required seven elements of the executive summary for the Frozen Foods Distribution Center (68 CFR 168.155):\n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies- \n\nThe Frozen Foods Distribution Center complies with all Federal, state, and local requirements for ammonia refrigeration facilities.  The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with applicable industry standards and codes.  The facility is monitored by ammonia sensors which are wired directly to Wegmans Corporate Security Control Station and the Gates Fire Department.  In the event of an ammonia release, Gates Fire Department will respond and contact the Monroe County Hazmat team, if necessary.  The facility has a written set of emergency response procedures.\n\nStationary source and regulated substances handled -\n\nThe facility is a frozen food warehouse and central shipping point for supplying all Wegmans stores.  The frozen food facility uses 15,010 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  Note that the adjacent fresh food facility uses less than the threshold amount of ammonia (10,000 pounds), and therefore is not regulated by the RMP regulations.\n\nWorst case release scenario and alternative release scenario including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distanc"

      "SummaryText": "e for each reported scenario-\n\nFor purposes of this RMP, the worst case release scenario has been determined to be a failure of the high pressure receiver which is the largest vessel in the system.  A release from this receiver and attached piping would include 5,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The release would be a liquid spilled onto the floor in the equipment room.  The equipment room doors and windows are kept closed which will help mitigate the release.   The liquid will vaporize and form a vapor cloud.  The cloud will be exhausted from the building, over a period of time, by the ventilation system in the equipment room.   The alternate release scenario would consist of a release from a high pressure relief valve on one of the compressors  that would last for 60 minutes at 57.7 pounds per minute (total amount = 3,462 pounds).  The release would be to a common relief header (pipe) that is located on the roof.  For both the worst case and alternate release scenarios, ammonia detectors are in place that will detect the release and notify Wegmans security personnel at the security office which is staffed 24 hours per day, seven days per week.  Wegmans security will in turn follow written procedures for notification of emergency response personnel.\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps.\n\nThe facility complies with EPA's Risk Management Program requirements and all applicable state and local codes and standards in effect at the time the facility was constructed.\n\nFive year accident history-\nThere have not been any releases from this facility in the past 5 years.\n\nEmergency response program-\nIn the event of an ammonia release emergency, the facility will contact the Gates Fire Department and request that they respond to the facility.  The facility's alarm system is directly linked to the Gates Fire Department.  Several members of the Wegmans team have appropriate training on the use of personal protective equipment an"

These recommendations are scheduled to be implemented by June 2000."
