The EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) has many elements including hazard assessment, prevention programs, and emergency response programs. An RMP is required when facilities use EPA specified chemicals at quantities within the defined criteria. The RMP substances handled at the facility are formaldehyde, methyl formate, titanium tetrachloride and chlorine.\n\n\n\nTicona Polymers, Inc., Bishop facility has two on-site partners, OXEA BISHOP LLC and BASF.  OXEA owns and operates the assets located at the Bishop facility and prepares and submits its own RMP.  As of January 1, 2017, BASF also owns and operates all its assets located at the Bishop facility.  Prior to this date, Ticona employees operated and managed the BASF facility and had previously incorporated RMP substances for BASF under the Ticona RMP.  This change in management and operation necessitated the removal of all BASF-related information from the Ticona RMP.\n\n\n\nThe information submitted in the RMP includes accident prevention and safety programs, emergency preparedness and response programs, chemical descriptions, five year accidental history (which is now returned to zero with the removal of the BASF chemicals), alternate release scenario and the worst case scenario. The RMP requires covered facilities to develop a worst case scenario for a release of covered chemicals from a site, as well as a more realistic release scenario (alternate release scenarios). The sharing of this type of information is a means to improve community awareness, prevention and emergency response planning, not a prediction of the probability that ei"

These scenarios are estimates required by EPA and are used to illustrate the importance of risk reduction, safety, prevention and emergency preparedness and response.\n\n\n\nThe Bishop plant is committed to Environmental Health and Safety Excellence. The Plant has historically maintained OSHA's Certification on its Voluntary Protection Program (VPP), and is consistently recognized for its safety and process safety performance by various organizations and trade associations.  Process Safety Management responsibility it shared amongst various leaders across the site.  An on-site Emergency response team is well-trained and well-equipped to respond to nearly any emergency.  \n\n\n\nThe Bishop facility has an excellent safety record and is recognized as the Best in the State of Texas in Safety by the Texas Chemical Council. Our OHSA incident injury rate is consistently less than 0.5 and is significantly better than the national average for our industry. Our 5 year accidental release history has not resulted in any RMP incidents (with the removal of one incident associated with BASF operations).\n\n\n\nBrief History  \n\n\n\nThe Bishop plant started operating in 1945 to produce chemicals needed to support the U.S. in World War II. Covering approximately 1400 acres in southwest Nueces County, the plant produces engineering plastics, organic chemicals, and pharmaceuticals products. The plant operates around the clock, seven days a week.. Approximately 330 full-time employees and around 300 contract employees work at the Bishop Facility.\n\n\n\nLocal Expenditures\n\n\n\n-Annual payroll is more than $ 50 million\n\n-Annual purchases, many made within 50 miles, exceed $ 12 million\n\n-Annual school and property taxes is more than $ 6 million\n\n\n\nPrimary Business Activity\n\n\n\nThe Bishop Plant produces over a billion pounds of finished products every year, which are used in the final manufacture of many consumer goods, such as:\n\n\n\nPaints and va"
