It is located 716 Firetower Road east of the City of Jacksonville. The chlorine safety record at the city's old Wastewater Treatment plant site was excellent. This performance has continued at the new facility. There has been only one chlorine incident or accident in the most recent Five-Year history period. On October 5, 2011, a defective valve on a 1-ton chlorine cylinder caused the release of less than 25 lbs. of chlorine gas. The Emergency Response Plan was followed and HazMat capped the cylinder and contained the leak.  The emergency scrubber ooperated as designed, and no gas escaped into the atmosphere.  There were no injuries or casualties during the event.\r\n\r\nThe Process Safety Management (PSM) that was completed in 1997 for the Land Treatment Plant has been maintained current for the past five years. The PSM compliance also demonstrates our compliance with the Risk Management Program (RMP) Prevention Program. Key activities have included:\r\n\r\no\tAn annual review of procedures\r\no\tThree Year Refresher training in May 2014\r\no\tA Process Hazards Analysis conducted in April 2014\r\no\tSelf Audits every three years\r\no\tA comprehensive Mechanical Integrity program\r\no\tAn annual review and update of the Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nIn addition to PSM compliance, the plant maintains a number of systems to improve the safe handling of chlorine.\r\n\r\no\tThe chlorine delivery system is a vacuum process. This process has proven to greatly reduced chlorine leaks by reducing the amount of equipment that is exposed to pressurized chlorine.\r\no\tA chlorine gas scrubber using a sodium hydroxide solution as the scrubbing agent has been installed. This system is capable of neutralizing 2,000 pounds of chlorine.\r\no\tEmergency chlorine cylinder cutoff valves activity by the chlorine gas dete"
