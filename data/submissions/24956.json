ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nAt Pinnacle Foods Corp., we utilize anhydrous ammonia which is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The properties which make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also necessitate certain safety precautions.  Pinnacle Foods Corp. strives to protect all its valuable resources and assets - both personnel and property.  We live and have families in this community.  We want to prevent exposure to all our personnel as well as nearby members of our community, existing natural resources, and the surrounding environment.  It is our policy to comply with Federal, State, and Local regulations.  Through continual, accurate training and various safety devices and procedures, we work to minimize potential releases.\n\nOur emergency response program has specific procedures for accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia as well as other emergencies.  We work in conjunction with the Omaha Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee to prepare for necessary notification of all affected neighbors.\n\n\n2.  THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe primary purpose of our facility is the production of frozen foods.  We utilize anhydrous ammonia as the primary means for refrigeration, cooling and freezing.  A nationally recognized, reputable and professional ammonia delivery company is used to fill our main receiver tanks.  Steel piping then carries the ammonia to the needed refrigeration, cooling or freezing units.  Access to the site is restricted to facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nThe regulated substance used at our facility is anhydrous ammonia.  Our ammonia refrigeration system has a 191,208 pound capacity but our policy limits that storage and operating charge to 95,604 pounds, i.e., 50% of total capacity. \n\n\n3.  THE WORST CASE"

      "SummaryText": "RELEASE SCENARIO(S) AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO(S), INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS AND MITIGATION MEASURES TO LIMIT THE DISTANCES FOR EACH REPORTED SCENARIO\n\nWorst Case Scenario\nThe worst case scenario would be failure of one of our four high pressure receivers. Pinnacle Foods Corp. policy restricts the maximum capacity of these 47,802 pound tank to 50% of capacity.  The maximum amount stored in any one of these tanks is 23,901 pounds.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released as a two phase flow (gas and aerosol-ALOHA).\nDistance to endpoint: 1.6 miles\n\nAlternative Scenario\nThe alternative scenario would be the release of ammonia due to the failure of a pressure safety relief valve.  In the event that a safety relief valve should open, only a portion of the ammonia will likely be released from the system at any one time.  Under normal circumstances, it will be detected by nearby ammonia detectors, routine engineering systems checks and/or by workers in the area because of ammonia's low odor threshold.  Upon detection, personnel would manually shut the valve.  The maximum time of the release would be 60 minutes and maximum quantity released would be approximately 3,314 pounds of ammonia.  \nDistance to endpoint:  .098 miles (or 174 yards)\n\n\n4.  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nTo date, this Pinnacle Foods Corp. facility has had no reportable release.  \n\n\n5.  THE RMP MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\n\nThe management of the RMP program will be handled by Mike Plouzek, Reliability Manager.  Mr. Plouzek will administrate in conjunction with the Pinnacle Foods Corp. management and personnel.  Other entities or organizations that will be coordinated with include the Omaha Fire Department and HAZMAT team.\n\nIn the event the Reliability Manager is unavailable, the following personnel will have the authority to execute the Emergency Response Program elements:  Manager of Engineering/Maintenance; Supervisor of Boiler/Refrigeration.\n\n\n6.

      "SummaryText": "TION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system design and construction is based upon accepted and proven engineering design practices for a safe operating refrigeration plant.  The system was designed and constructed to meet the Uniform Building Code, Uniform Mechanical Code, Uniform Fire Code, SHARAE Standard 15 and the National Electrical Code.  Shut-off valves are strategically located throughout the refrigeration system to allow emergency shut-off, periodic maintenance and repair.  Depending on location and use in the system, pressure vessels are ASME rated and fitted with either a single or dual safety relief valve as required by ASME.\n\nThis Pinnacle Foods Corp. facility complies with applicable Federal, State and Local regulations including the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule.  Our personnel are trained about this during our Hazard Communications Training and through access to our Written Programs.  Our Refrigeration Maintenance Operators receive On-The-Job (OTJ) training.  They are observed by senior staff personnel and are able to demonstrate proper job skills and knowledge.\n\n\n7.  THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nWe work very closely with the Omaha Fire Department and HAZMAT team on emergency preparedness.  We meet periodically with representatives of each to address any changes in the facility or any new concerns.\n\n\n8.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nCurrently, Pinnacle Foods Corp. trains and tests all refrigeration technicians.  Our preventative maintenance program is above standard and our total ammonia Process Safety Program is reviewed annually and updated periodically.  Our program is improved continuously through annual updating of our written program and annual training of our technicians.  We also take advantage of new technologies when safer and more economical alternatives are available.\n\n\n9.
