Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Hampshire Chemical Corporation (HCC) Deer Park, Texas are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of all substances.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled                        HCC - Deer Park primary activities encompass Chemical Manufacturing.  We have 4 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Ammonia (anhydrous), Ethylenediamine  [1,2-Ethanediamine], Formaldehyde (44.5 % solution) and Hydrocyanic Acid.  The primary businesses are the manufacturing of a surfactant called DAXAD, Glycine, and Chelating agents. The DAXAD manufacturing process regulated raw material is Formaldehyde.  The Glycine manufacturing process regulated raw materials are Anhydrous Ammonia, Formaldehyde, and Hydrocyanic Acid.  The Chelant process utilizes Ethylenediamine, Formaldehyde, and Hydrocyanic Acid.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Formaldehyde (44.5 % solution) at our facility is 408,276 lb. while Ammonia (anhydrous), Hydrocyanic Acid, and Ethylenediamine [1,2-Ethanediamine] are present at our facility in quantities of 284,438 lb., 262,219 lb., and 205230 lb. respectively.\n\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario su"

In this scenario 106140 lb. of Hydrocyanic Acid is released from a railcar.  The toxic gas is assumed to be released within 10 minutes. The released quantity is 100 % of the maximum capacity of the source.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 15 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.011 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Hydrocyanic Acid involves a release from Hydrocyanic Acid Storage System.  The scenario involves the release of 5487 lb. of Hydrocyanic Acid.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by an emergency shutdown system and water monitor.  These active mitigation systems have the effect of reducing the liquid release and vapor suppression.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.011 mg/L of Hydrocyanic Acid is 1.4 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Formaldehyde (44.5 % solution) involves a release from the Formaldehyde Storage System.  The scenario involves the release of 19180 lb. of 44.5 % Formaldehyde solution.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 1918 minutes.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by  an emergency shutdown system and water monitor.  These active mitigation systems have the effect of reducing the liquid release and vapor suppression.

Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.49 mg/L of Ethylenediamine  [1,2-Ethanediamine] is 0.19 miles.\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with industry accepted design practices and engineering standards.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nHampshire Chemical Corporation maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.  For example, this information can be found in our Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS), process design files, equipment specification files and process safety information "

The methodologies used to carry out these analyses are  What If, Checklist, Hazop Dow Fire and Explosion Index, Dow Exposure Index and Dow Reactive Chemical Process Hazard Analysis.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated every 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 03/01/1999.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Hampshire Chemical Corporation maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nHampshire Chemical Corporation has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every year and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nHampshire Chemical Corporation carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.
