              "Description": "The owner/operator of the facility has addressed the facility?s responsibilities for implementing prevention measures designed to reduce the risk of an accidental release and mitigate the consequences of releases to prevent chemical exposure to employees and public receptors in the Facility?s Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP). The chlorine building is designed to contain a worst-case release and is equipped with chlorine gas detectors, an emergency scrubber, and automatic chlorine supply shutdown controls and capability.\n\n\n\nRisk Management Plan (RMP) update frequencies are addressed in Environmental Health and Safety Compliance Procedure (ECP)-602, Monitoring EHS Compliance Deadlines. Program information is accessible through the Information Access System (IAS). The Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) and (ECP) are accessible through the EHSS application, which is a subsystem of the IAS. The RMP Program is covered in the ECPs and the PSM/RMP Program elements are addressed in the ICP Manual. \n\n\n\nEmployee participation is addressed in the ICP.  Employees representing O&M, engineering, and EHS compliance participate in the PHA revalidations.\n\n \n\nThe facility has adopted the Chlorine Institute Pamphlets as Recognized and Generally Accepted Good Engineering Practice (RAGAGEP). Piping and component materials of construction and connection types adopted for chlorine service are addressed in the Chlorine Handling and Management Standardization Policy. PSI is compiled in a variety of manners at the facility. \n\n\n\nPHA revalidations are scheduled every 5-years pursuant to ECP-602, Monitoring EHS Compliance Deadlines.\n\n\n\nOperating procedures are reviewed and updated on an annual basis.\n\n\n\nChlorine awareness and emergency training is addressed in the ICP. Hazard Communication training and site-specific emergency response training is provided upon initial assignment to all O&M Techs, Utility Operators, and variations of these positions that perform these functions, and to affected contractors before working on or around the covered chlorine process. An introductory class on EHS Awareness is conducted for O&M Techs and Utility Operators and Advanced EHS Regs and Policy training addressing chlorine safety is conducted annually. Chlorine Maintenance Training is an initial 8-day maintenance training class and on-the-job (OTJ) training is conducted on an annual basis for all WSD employees who work on the chlorine system. \n\n \n\nA Professional/Contractual Services Qualifying Checklist is required for all bid packages. The Water Facilities Supervisor (WFS) determines which contractors are ?affected? under the program.\n\n \n\nPre-startup safety review (PSSR) is addressed in the ICP and PSSRs are required for all MOCs on the covered chlorine process. \n\n\n\nEquipment inspections and preventative maintenance is managed through a Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS). Maintenance standards addressing inspection intervals (and the basis) for chlorine equipment inspection and service are addressed in the Chlorine Handling and Management Standardization Policy. Inspection protocols and frequencies are based on RAGAGEP (Chlorine Institute), OEM guidance, and operating history. Work orders, based on established frequency, are automatically generated through the CMMS.\n\n\n\nA Hot Work Permit is required in areas covered by a Risk Management Plan. Hot Work training is addressed during LOTO and Confined Space training.\n\n \n\nManagement of Change (MOC) requires submittal of an EHS Impact Checklist addressing the change. If the Project Manager, WFS, or Service Facilities Supervision identifies the need for EHS Review, an EHS Review Checklist is completed and routed for review by the Environmental Services Division, the Safety and Training Division, the facility WFS and the division superintendent. \n\n\n\nThe Water Services Division (WSD) has a Spill Management System for reporting all chemical spills, and tracking corrective actions. The ICP addresses incident investigation and outlines the incident review process for emergency responses.\n\n \n\nThe facility has implemented an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP), which is the Emergency Response Plan (ERP). Chlorine alarm set points and action levels have been standardized for consistency across all WSD chlorine facilities. Electronic O&M Manuals, ERPs, and ICPs are reviewed and updated by the WFS as changes occur, but not less than annually. \n\n\n\nEmployees that would be involved in a response to a chlorine emergency are trained to the hazmat technician and on scene incident commander level under HAZWOPER. A division training matrix identifying emergency response training requirements is provided on the Safety and Training Division SharePoint site. Chlorine drills are required to be conducted quarterly and a full facility emergency evacuation drill is required annually. The facility maintains an Emergency Kit \"B\" for use by emergency responders to containing major leaks on the tonners; this kit contains devices and tools to contain leaks in and around the ton container valves and in the side wall of ton containers.\n\n \n\nPSM/RMP program compliance audits are scheduled every 3-years pursuant to ECP-602, Monitoring EHS Compliance Deadlines.\n\n",

Deer Valley Road in Phoenix, Arizona is a conventional water treatment plant that treats water to potable use. The facility is operated by the City of Phoenix, Water Services Division (WSD).  The facility contains a covered process subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Standard (PSM), 29 CFR 1910.119, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule (RMP), 40 CFR 68. \n\n\n\nThe covered process contains chlorine (CAS# 7782-50-5), which is injected into the finished water for disinfection; the chlorine system is designed to provide continuous chlorine residual for disinfection. Chlorine storage and supply (chlorine feed system) are located within a dedicated building designed to seal and contain a chlorine release. The chlorine disinfection system is supplied by one-ton chlorine containers (tonners) interconnected in \"banks\" of containers; when in operation, there is an \"on-line\" bank and two \"stand-by\" banks.\n\n \n\nThe chlorine building contains up to 72,000 pounds of chlorine (containers in storage and in-use). The chlorine feed system consists of 4 one-ton containers (tonners) \"on-line\" and 2 banks of 4 tonners on \"stand-by\" (with automatic change over upon depletion of the on-line supply). Up to 24 tonners may be in storage awaiting transfer to the stand-by bank or depleted tonners awaiting return to the chlorine supplier. The tonners connected to the feed system are equipped with motorized control valves and the chlorine feed system can be remotely shutdown in an emergency. The facility may also have 150-pound chlorine cylinders in storage. \n\n\n\nThe chlorine building is an enclosed building designed to contain a worst-case chlorine gas release and the building is connected to an emergency scrubber that is automatically activated upon chlorine gas leak detection (or manually operated).

Chlorine gas detection systems within the building activate local alarm strobes and horns, and activate the emergency scrubber for the chlorine building. The emergency scrubber and ventilation system will shut off upon detection of chlorine at the scrubber discharge at 5.0 ppm.  The chlorine building is a secured zone within a secured site, and all access doors to the chlorine building are secured with access controls. A two-person rule applies for entry into the chlorine building.\n\n\n\nThe owner/operator of the facility has implemented an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) to prevent an accidental release and mitigate the consequences of a chlorine release if it were to occur. The ICP follows the fourteen elements of the PSM standard and the RMP elements. The process hazard analysis (PHA) of the covered process was revalidated in December 2018 and the PSM/RMP program was most recently audited in June 2017; both of these activities were led by a qualified third-party PSM consultant and recommendations resulting from those activities are actively managed by the facility with oversight from the Water Services Division Environmental Services Department.\n\n\n\nThe facility is staffed 24 hours/day by a licensed Water Treatment Operator. The Operator controls the chlorine system from the Operator Control Room within a separate building at the facility. \n\n\n\nThe owner/operator of the facility has implemented an Emergency Response Plan, and personnel who respond to chlorine emergencies are trained accordingly; regular chlorine drills are conducted at the facility.  In the event of a chlorine emergency, an alarm on the chlorine gas detection system will automatically notify and dispatch the Fire Department. \n\n"
