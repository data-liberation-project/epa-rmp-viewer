Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nIn this distribution facility, we store chlorine, sulfur dioxide, and hydrofluoric acid solutions which are considered hazardous by the EPA.  The same properties that make chlorine, sulfur dioxide, and hydrofluoric acid solutions valuable as commodity chemicals also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as that of our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine and sulfur dioxide, and the training of our personnel.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon The Chlorine Institute?s Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of our immediate neighbors.\n\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\nOne of the purposes of this facility is to store chlorine, sulfur dioxide, and hydrofluoric acid solutions for distribution to our customers which include water treatment facilities and general industry.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are received in Department of Transportation (DOT) approved 150 pound cylinders and ton containers and are shipped in the same packages.  Hydrofluoric Acid solutions are received in 550 pound drums and are shipped in the same packages.  Chlorine, sulfur dioxide, and hydrofluoric acid solutions are not used, manufactured, or repackaged at this facility.  Access to the site is restricted to Harcros employees, and authorized contractors and visitors.  The maximum total inventory of chlorine at this facility is 100,000 pounds.  The maximum total inventory of sulfur dioxide stored at this facility is 55,000 pounds.  The max"

The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps\n\nThis distribution facility complies with EPA?s Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility is operated in accordance with recommendations from The Chlorine Institute and with the Responsible Distribution Process of the National Association of Chemical Distributors.\n\n\n4. Five year accident history\n\nWithin the past 5 years, this facility has had one accidental release which requires reporting in this section.  An operator using a truck mounted crane to lift a chlorine ton container onto a flatbed truck tore out one of the fusible plugs on the container.  We immediately evacuated the site and notified the Fire Department.  The Fire Department evacuated employees at other nearby businesses (about 30) and blocked roads to prevent other people from entering the area.  Trained Harcros response personnel with assistance from the Shreveport Fire Department plugged the leak about 4 hours after the leak began.  We estimated about a total of 1,000 pounds of chlorine was released, most of which was released in the first few minutes of the incident.  There were no injuries or property damage as a result of this release.  However, there was damage to grass, shrubs, and trees.  Almost all of this environmental damage was confined to Harcros property.\n\nAs a result of this incident, we have modified the crane to make it virtually impossible for the ends of the crane hooks to contact the fusible plugs while lifting a ton container.  A contributing factor to this incident was the fusible plug was not threaded far enough into the container.  We reviewed the proper procedure with the applicable personnel at the off-site facility which filled the container.\n\n\n5. The emergency response program\n\nThis facility?s emergency "

This plan is reviewed annually and updated when required.  All response team members attend annual refresher training including the use of response equipment and personal protective equipment on simulated leaks.  We work closely with our suppliers, customers, public responders, and The Chlorine Institute to continuously improve our emergency response capabilities.\n\nOur response program is for chlorine and sulfur dioxide leaks only.  We will not respond to hydrofluoric acid emergencies but will assist trained public and private emergency response personnel if required.\n\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety\n\nThis distribution facility was constructed in 1970.  We continue to participate in The Chlorine Institute and the National Association of Chemical Distributor programs, and to continue to improve our operations in accordance with Responsible Distribution Guidelines.  \n\nIn 2003, we developed a new security plan to help guard against intentional misuse of hazardous chemicals.  We are continuing to evaluate and implement new security measures by sharing knowledge with other Harcros facilities and general industry."
