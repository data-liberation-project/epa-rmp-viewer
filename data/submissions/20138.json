Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at P & W AG in Decatur are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental\nsafety. \nThis commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release prevention program\nthat covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee\ntraining associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate\ncontrols to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our\ntrained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the\nrelease. \nWe also coordinate our response efforts with the Decatur Fire Department, which provides\nadditional\nemergency response expertise.\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have\nanhydrous\nammonia stored in a 26,000- and two 11,000-gallon interconnected tanks at our facility in\nDecatur\n(Figure 1, ammonia).  The maximum amount stored is 40,800 gallons (209,957 pounds) at the\nmaximum fill capacity of 85%.\n\nWe also have propane stored in a 18,000-gallon tank  located at our facility in Decatur (Figure 1,\npropane).  The maximum amount stored is 15,300 gallons (64,612 pounds) at the maximum fill\ncapacity of 85%.\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\nWe utilized RMP PRO for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite\nconsequence analysis for our ammonia and propane facility.  The following details these\nscenarios.\n\n            3.1     Ammonia\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the\ninterconnected anhydrous a"

At Class F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, and urban topography, the\nmaximum distance to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L is 6.8 miles (Figure 2).  The estimated\npopulation within a 6.8-mile radius of this facility is 900.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a release from an anhydrous ammonia product line. \nThe\nscenario involves the release of 11,873.12 pounds of ammonia in a gaseous form over a period of\n30 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of\n0.14\nmg/L of ammonia is 0.31 mile (Figure 3).  The estimated population within a 0.31-mile radius of\nthe\nfacility is 300.\n\n            3.2     Propane\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the\npropane\nstorage tank (64,612 pounds) in gaseous form over a 10-minute period.  At Class F atmospheric\nstability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is\n0.32\nmiles (Figure 2).  This amount of overpressure can cause partial demolition of houses and can\nresult\nin serious injury to people within this distance.  The estimated population within a 0.32-mile\nradius\nof this facility is 300.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a 30-minute release of propane from a product line that\ncontacts an ignition source and detonates, resulting in a vapor cloud fire.  Under neutral weather\nconditions, the maximum distance to a lower flammability endpoint of 35 mg/L at a release rate\nof\n7,500 pounds per minute is less than 0.06 mile (Figure 3).  The estimated population within a \n0.06-\nmile radius of this facility is 100.\n\n  4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release\nprevention\nrequirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements\nof the release prevention program that"
