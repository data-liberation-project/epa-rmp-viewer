In addition, the Plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties, and participate in annual plant emergency drills to ensure emergency shutdown system (ESD) integrity and reinforce proper employee response. The ERP is updated when necessary based on modifications made to gas plant process or other ONEOK Rockies Midstream facilities. The ERP program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes. The overall emergency response plan for the Demicks Lake Gas Plant is coordinated with the McKenzie County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) which is responsible for preparing the community emergency response plan. The local responders for plant emergencies are the Watford Fire Department and the McKenzie County Sheriffs Department. The Demicks Lake Gas Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department, sheriffs office). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\r\n \r\n\r\n8.0\tPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe Demicks Lake Gas Plant will resolve all findings from PHAs.

Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\r\n\r\nSpecialized Safety Features\r\n\r\nThe Demicks Lake Gas Plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\r\n\r\n   \u00bf\tRelease Detection, \r\n   \u00bf\tDaily Operator Inspection, \r\n   \u00bf\tValve, Seal, and Flange Inspections, \r\n   \u00bf\tRelease Containment/Control, \r\n   \u00bf\tProcess Relief Valves that prevent vessel over pressurization, \r\n   \u00bf\tValves to Permit Isolation of the Process (manual or automated), \r\n   \u00bf\tAutomated Shutdown Systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature), \r\n   \u00bf\tCurbing or Diking to contain liquid releases, \r\n   \u00bf\tRedundant Equipment and Instrumentation (e.g., emergency power supply, backup pumps, etc.), and\r\n   \u00bf\tPersonal protective equipment (e.g., hard hat, safety glasses, protective clothing, FR clothing, etc.).\r\n\r\n\r\n6.0\tFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe Demicks Lake Gas Plant is a new facility.

The plan consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address or reference all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local"

(ORM)\r\nDEMICKS LAKE GAS PLANT\r\n\r\n\r\n1.0\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nThe Demicks Lake Gas Plant (Facility/Plant) has a commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, gas plant trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. ONEOK Rockies Midstream (ORM) believes in maintaining a safe working environment for all employees. Our equipment and personnel reflect this belief, and our prime objective is to ensure the personal safety of every employee on the job-site and to safe guard company property through preventative measures. Employees of ORM are expected to be familiar with all company safety policies. Through continuing education, in-house training and management support, we will provide a safe and professional working environment for our employees as well as those whose lives and safety have been entrusted to us.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.0\tDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Demicks Lake Gas Plant, located is near Keene, North Dakota is a two train (Train 1 and Train 2) 400 MMscfd gas processing plant using mechanical refrigeration, cryogenic extraction and fractionation to process wellhead gas into marketable natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL).  As a result of this operation, several EPA regulated flammable substances are processed, recovered, and stored at the facility (e.g., methane, ethane, propane, butane, pentane, and gas condensate).  There are twelve (12) 24,000 gallon inlet condensate vessels (slug catchers), eight (8) 45,000 gallon condensate product storage tanks, and two (2) 90,000 gallon NGL product surge tanks.

Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for administrative controls, or active/passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS was determined by RMP*Comp at 0.60 miles.  There were no public or environmental receptors identified within the 0.60 mile WCS radius.\r\n\r\nThe most likely alternate release scenario (ARS) for a flammable substance includes transfer hose failures, valve/flange failures, vessel overfilling, and seal leaks.  The ARS assumed a 15,000 pound release of propane liquid/vapor over a period of 10 minutes, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion (VCE).  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this event was determined by RMP*Comp at 0.30 mile.  No pubic or environmental receptors were identified within the 0.30 mile ARS radius.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.0\tGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Demicks Lake Gas Plant is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program regulation and also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) standard.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.0\tCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe processes at the Demicks Lake Gas Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.
