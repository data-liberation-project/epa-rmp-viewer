This summary is presented in response to the requirements of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 (40 CFR 68) and Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act. NuGen is subject to the RMP rule due to the onsite storage of natural gasoline (denaturant), a regulated flammable mixture, above the threshold quantity. NuGen previously stored anhydrous ammonia onsite above threshold levels, however, the storage tank has been de-inventoried and all anhydrous ammonia was removed from the process.\r\n\r\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nNuGen is committed to protecting the environment and operating the facility in a manner that promotes the safety of employees and the general public. Management has adopted and implemented policies that adhere to applicable federal and state rules and regulations, and as such, the design and construction of NuGen has incorporated physical and operational safeguards to prevent accidental releases. Through the proper design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the equipment and the training of personnel, NuGen has minimized the hazard to human health and the environment from fires, explosions, or any unplanned sudden or non-sudden release of hazardous materials.\r\n\r\nIn the event of a release, the NuGen's emergency response is described in its Emergency Response Action Plan (ERAP) and Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP), which consists of a Facility Response Plan (FRP) and Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures (SPCC) Plan. The ICP and ERAP consist of procedures for responding to releases, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is acci"

In addition, NuGen has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions on the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training on performing their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to NuGen processes or emergency response procedures.\r\n\r\n2.\tFacility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nNuGen is a corn-based denatured ethanol fuel production plant which operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Ethanol is produced through the conversion of corn starch to sugars and then conversion of the sugars to ethanol (i.e., grain alcohol) through a batch fermentation and continuous distillation process.\r\n\r\nThe RMP regulated material stored at NuGen is natural gasoline which is used as a denaturant in the ethanol fuel product.\r\n\r\n3.\tAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nNuGen has programs in place to address accidental release prevention measures required by EPA, Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and notification requirements of EPA's Emergency Response and Community Right-to-Know (EPCRA) regulations. NuGen complies with the RMP for the management of regulated substances onsite such as denaturant (natural gasoline).\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nNuGen encourages employees to participate in safety management and accident prevention.

The PSSR also confirms that the safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and adequate training for each involved employee has been completed. A PSSR includes field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention measures are properly implemented.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices\r\n\r\nNuGen has safe work practices in place to ensure worker and process safety. These safety standards control entry into work areas and confined spaces, specify procedures to follow for isolating energy sources by lockout/tag-out, and describe the permitting process for completing work at NuGen. Safety standards and work procedures are reviewed annually.\r\n \r\nHot Work Permit\r\n\r\nNuGen has a hot work permit program that details areas which require a permit and those areas for which a permit is not required. A hot work permit is required in process areas for cutting, welding, spark-producing equipment, etc., except in designated areas. The procedure includes accountability and responsibility for authorizing and issuing the hot work permit, display of the permit at the site of the hot work until the work is completed, site inspection, designation of appropriate precautions to be taken with the hot work, and assignment of a fire watch where appropriate.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\r\nNuGen's MOC program reviews proposed changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures, materials, and design conditions prior to implementation of the change.

The procedure establishes the minimum guidelines and activities of the incident investigation program in order to reduce the likelihood of repetitive occurrences of events which could reasonably lead to catastrophic releases. Investigations will be undertaken by a team to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent a similar release in the future. Corrective actions are tracked until they are completed. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five years.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nNuGen regularly conducts audits of the provisions of RMP and PSM to verify that procedures and practices developed under the standard are adequate and are being followed. A compliance audit of each program is conducted every three years. The audits include but are not limited to a review of documentation and process safety information, inspection of the physical facilities, and interviews with all levels of plant personnel. The audit team develops findings that are included in an audit report and forwarded to facility management for resolution. Findings and corrective actions taken in response to each finding are tracked until completion.\r\n\r\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe processes at NuGen include hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The RMP Program elements, that were previously summarized, apply to the denaturant processes. Collectively, these program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors. In addition to RMP, the facility has instrumentation and equipment to detect, contain, and reduce the consequences of a release, including:\r\n\r\nRelease Detection \r\n\r\n-\tMonitoring equipment to detect flow and tank liquid level changes\r\n-\tVideo cameras are used to monitor the facility, including the storage tank area\r\n-\tFacility personnel conduct routine rounds through storage tank areas\r\n\r\n Release Containment/Contr"
