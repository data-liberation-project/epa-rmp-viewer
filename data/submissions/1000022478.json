It is the policy of the company to insure that all ammonia releases are promptly reported to plant management for immediate and effective response actions.\n    Plant management's oversight of ammonia operations is designed to provide all employees a safe working environment and protect any residents in the area of the plant.  This priority will be accomplished through: (1) maintenance of plant equipment in proper operating condition, (2) training plant personal assigned to ammonia equipment to properly operate the equipment and respond to equipment malfunctions, (3) providing safety gear to personnel responding to equipment malfunctions, and (4) comply with regulatory requirements applicable to the use of ammonia.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF OPERATIONS    -\n    The Ekuk Plant processes fish products in large freezer compartments using anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant fluid.  The 21,000 pounds of ammonia used in the plant refrigeration systems is contained in sealed systems where it is continuously recycled as either a liquid or a gas through compressing, condensing and expansion (cooling coils) equipment.  The maximum working pressure of the system is approximately 150 pounds per square inch above atmospheric pressure.  \n    Ammonia is an alkaline gas that can be suffocating and extremely irritating to the eyes, throat and respiratory tract.  High gas concentrations can cause burning and blistering of the skin.  The normal control response for ammonia released to the atmosphere is dilution by dispersion and absorption in water.\n\nACCIDENT SCENARIOS:\n    Worst Case -This RMP assumes release of a substantial portion of the plant ammonia inventory over a ten minute period.  A scenario such as this is considered possible only if the entire r"

      "SummaryText": "efrigeration system is destroyed by a major catastrophe such as an earthquake.  A release of this magnitude would cause an off-site impact potentially effecting 420 people in nearby residences.  Guidance documents prepared by the Science Applications International Corporation of Reston, Virginia were used to estimate the off-site impact area.\n    Alternative Scenario - The leakage of ammonia through the equivalent of a one-quarter inch diameter orifice has been used in this RMP as descriptive of a more likely event.  This amount of leakage could be caused by a gasket rupture or pump seal failure.  A release of this magnitude possibly could cause an off-site impact and was also analyzed using guidance documents prepared by the Science Applications International Corporation of Reston, Virginia.\n    Accident History - In the last five years the plant has had no reportable ammonia leaks.\n\nRESPONSE PROGRAM -\nUsage of Ammonia at the Ekuk Fisheries Facility is regulated under OSHA Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals standard and EPA's Risk Management Plan Program Rule.  An initial Process Hazard Analysis using \"What-if\" methodology and checklists was conducted in June,2006.  A re-validation of the PHA was conducted on March 23, 2011.  A facility emergency prevention program and emergency response program have both been integrated into plant operations.  Annual on-site HAZWOPER and other safety training is conducted on an annual basis.  Ekuk Fisheries personnel partner with consultants to develop and implement emergency prevention and response programs in a continual improvement process.  "
