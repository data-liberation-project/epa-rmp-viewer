ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nCytec is a leader among chemical manufacturers in its safety, health and environmental programs.  Our commitment to protect our employees and the communities that are home to our operations is an integral part of Cytec's way of doing business.  Cytec has established safety, health, emergency response and environmental policies and standards to meet or exceed all regulatory requirements.  As a member of the Chemical Manufacturers' Association (CMA), Cytec subscribes to the codes established for Responsible Care ?.\n\n\n(b.) THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nCytec's Kalamazoo, Michigan facility has 2 processes that involve regulated substances.\n\nThe Methylated Resins process makes a product that is a key ingredient in the formulation of coatings for the automotive and other industries; and, adhesives for rubber tire manufacturing.  The regulated substance involved with this process is formaldehyde.\n\nThe Polyamines process makes products that are used to manufacture water treatment chemicals for the paper, mining and food processing industry.  The regulated substances involved with this process are epichlorohydrin and a flammable mixture of dimethylamine in water.\n\n\n(c.) THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nCytec's general accidental release prevention program includes compliance with:\n\n -  EPA 40 CFR 68 - Risk Management Plans\n -  OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 - Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals \n -  OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120 - Hazardous Waste Operations & Emergency Response\n -  MI-OSHA Part 91, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals\n -  Other EPA, OSHA, DOT and State regulations\n -  Generally recognized and accepted engineering codes and standards, and\n -  Cytec Safety, Health, Environmental and Engineering standards\n\nThe following engineering and administr"

EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Cytec Kalamazoo facility Emergency Response Plan incorporates OSHA's Incident Command System, as defined in 29 CFR 1910.120 (q).  In the event of an emergency requiring assistance from outside agencies, our personnel will make the necessary notifications and will be able to interact effectively with outside emergency response personnel, since we are trained to operate under the same system.  Working with Cytec Kalamazoo facility Emergency Preparedness Team leaders, the Kalamazoo Department of Public Safety (KDPS) and the Kalamazoo County Office of Emergency Management would make any decisions concerning how best to protect the neighboring community.  \n\nIn the event of a release of one of the three regulated substances, or other hazardous material, our facility Emergency Preparedness Team would use chemical-specific response plans and procedures to address the emergency at the earliest stage possible so as to prevent escalation of the incident.\n\nWe regularly participate in the activities of the Kalamazoo County Local Emergency Planning Commit"

We work with the KDPS, which provides all fire-fighting services within the jurisdiction that includes this facility, to conduct facility tours for any personnel who may one day have to respond, required facility inspections, and training exercises.\n\nContracted professional technicians test our fire protection system, which includes signals, alarms and sprinkler protection of all processing areas, on a monthly basis.  Similarly, contract service technicians perform monthly inspections and service on our respiratory protection equipment, and annual inspections on all fire extinguishers.\n\nFacility personnel test our two fire pumps weekly, and safety showers and eyewash stations are checked monthly.  \n\nFacility personnel who are members of the Emergency Preparedness Team are provided training on emergency response procedures and use of protective and response equipment, and participate in training exercises at least annually.  Among these team members, we currently have 16 members trained to the HAZMAT Technician or Specialist levels.  Emergency Preparedness Team members maintain the chemical protective clothing and response equipment.\n\n\n(f.) PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nCYTEC Industries is constantly striving to upgrade its processes, control technology, employee training, inspection, repair and maintenance of process equipment in order to improve safety."
