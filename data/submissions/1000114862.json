For example, the department' s hazard review of the WPS #1 chlorination system is built on the safety information compiled in this report; utilizing the results of the hazard review to\nrevise and update operating and maintenance procedures and training in these procedures.\n\nIn addition, an Emergency Response Plan has been developed for the site. This plan, which has been submitted to the Kalamazoo County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), contains measures that Water System staff can take to alert employees to a release, personal protective equipment, how to distinguish between an incidental release and a significant release, and many other elements. WPS #1 is included in the Kalamazoo County Emergency Hazmat Response Plan and identified as Facility ID 12521. The staff receives emergency response training in response to an on-site release and for incident command practices. In addition, staff, along with outside agencies and consultants, has conducted two tabletop exercises to discuss area-wide emergency response procedures should a catastrophic release of chlorine occur.\n\nFinally, the following occurrences will result in the revision and submittal of a revised RMP on a more frequent basis than the regulatory requirement of every 5 years:\n\u00bf\tInformation on reportable chemical accidents within six months\n\u00bf\tChanges to the emergency contact information"

Therefore, by default, the operation of WPS#1 falls under Part 68 Program 2 requirements that imposes streamlined prevention program requirements, as well as additional hazard assessment, management, and emergency response requirements.\n\n\nThe Kalamazoo Department of Public Services has a management structure to oversee responsibility for the development, implementation and integration of the risk management program elements and have provided documentation in this plan of the names of people or positions and have defined the lines of authority through an organizational chart.\n\nSince the WPS #1 chlorination system is a Program 2 process, this RMP includes a worst-case release analysis (catastrophic release from a one one-ton cylinder) and an alternative release scenario analysis (3/16 gasket failure in a one-ton cylinder). This information will be used to coordinate emergency response activities with local first responders in case either of these scenarios should occur.\n\nIn the past five years, there have been no accidental releases of chlorine at WPS #1 that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nHowever, in order to prepare for a possible release of chlorine gas from WPS #1, the emergency response activities have been coordinated with the City of Kalamazoo Public Safety Departm"

The rules promulgating the list of regulated substances (published January 31, 1994) and the Risk Management Program provisions (published June 20. 1996) are found at 40 CFR Part 68. The Risk Management Program contains three elements: a hazard assessment, a prevention program and an emergency response program. The entire program is to be described and documented in a Risk Management Plan (RMP), which is submitted to EPA.\n\nThe RMP for the Kalamazoo Water System Pumping Station # 1 (WPS# l) includes the following main topics that fulfill the information requirements for the EPA Risk Management Plan.\n\nExecutive Summary\nGeneral Applicability to 40 CFR Part 68;\nManagement System\nHazard Assessment;\nPrevention Program;\nEmergency Response\nRisk Management Plan Registration; and\nAppendices with miscellaneous related information.\n\nA Risk Management Plan is required for WPS #1 because it is a stationary source (a facility) with more than a threshold quantity (2500 lbs) of a regulated substance (chlorine) in a process (chlorine vacuum educator feed system), as determined under section 68.115. In compliance with the regulations, the plan was first submitted in June 18, 1999 and, again, pursuant to EPA regulations was updated in June 16, 2004, in June 2009, June 2014 and June 2019. This report represents the June 20224 update.\n\nThe Risk Management Program regulations also define the activities that the City of Kalamazoo must undertake to identify and minimize the risks posed by chlorine in covered processes. Specifically, EPA defined three program levels to ensure that individual chemical processes are subject to appropriate requirements based on the size of the process and the associated risks.\n\nWPS #1 falls under the Program 2 requirements because the operation is not eligible for Program 1 due to the location of the facility in proximity t"
