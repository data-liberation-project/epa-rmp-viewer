      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nThe Toledo Refining Company, hereafter referred to as the Toledo Refinery, has a long-standing commitment\r\nto worker, contractor, and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in\r\naccident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation,\r\nand maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable\r\nreleases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to\r\ncontrol and contain the release.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Toledo Refinery operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g. gasoline, fuel oil, propane, butane) from raw crude oil.  The refinery has several regulated flammables, such as propane, butane, etc.  The refinery does not have any of the listed regulated toxic chemicals above the threshold quantity for reporting.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Toledo Refinery.  Because processes at the Toledo Refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\r\n\r\nThe Toledo Refinery encourages employees to participate in all elements of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation include employees serving as members on Process Hazard Analysis teams as well as incident investigation teams.  Employees also serve as trainers and procedure writers in addition to serving as plant safety representatives who perform monthly safety equipment audits.

Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the Toledo Refinery and addresses each accident prevention program element.\r\n\r\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\r\n\r\nThe Toledo Refinery keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the Toledo Refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  \r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations are provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the Toledo Refinery has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature , level, pressure) via the Process Hazard Analysis process and the Safe Operating Limits/Consequence of Deviation procedures for each plant.  The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\n\r\nThe Toledo Refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel provides a basis for establishing inspection and maint"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nThe Toledo Refinery uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique, What-if/Checklist and the What-if technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques, the What-if technique allows for more brainstorming and team participation, and the What-if/Checklist method uses a more structured checklist of general question to initiate the desired brainstorming for a what-if style review.  The analyses are conducted using a multi-disciplined team with experience backgrounds across the organization.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Toledo Refinery peri"

The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\r\n\r\nThe Toledo Refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) initial startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) emergency operation (6) normal shutdown, and (7) startup following a turnaround, or after an emergency shutdown.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  These written operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n\r\nCONTRACTORS\r\n\r\nThe Toledo Refinery uses contractors to supplement its work force during running maintenance and construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the Toledo Refinery has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform refinery personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.

Refinery personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\r\nPRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEW (PSSR)\r\n\r\nThe Toledo Refinery conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction.\r\n\r\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\r\n\r\nThe Toledo Refinery has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include:  (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\r\n\r\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) safety and health hazards, (2) applicable maintenance procedures, (3) emergency response plans, and (4) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner.

If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or key personnel will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\r\n\r\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is positive material identification (PMI).  The Toledo Refinery incorporates PMI measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\r\n\r\nTRAINING\r\n\r\nTo complement the operating procedures, the Toledo Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees are required to complete a 36 month Apprenticeship Training Program.  This program has been certified by the United States Department of Labor and the State of Ohio Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training.  This program includes (1) formal in-unit training, (2) classroom training, (3) on the job training, (4) self study training, and (5) testing.\r\n\r\nDuring the three year apprenticeship, each apprentice must successfully complete all\r\nfacets of the program which include: (1) basic industry training, (2) off the job related studies, (3) training, (4) testing (written & skill demonstration), (5) qualifying on a set number of jobs at the assigned unit, and (6) obtain a State of Ohio Stationary Engineers License.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective and/or preventative actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to refinery management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\r\n\r\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS \r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Toledo Refinery periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.

      "SummaryText": "of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the Toledo Refinery has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to refinery processes or other refinery facilities.  Affected personnel are trained on the changes to the emergency response program.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response program for the Toledo Refinery is coordinated with the Lucas County (State of Ohio) Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which include local emergency officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Toledo Refinery has around the clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire departments).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Toledo Refinery conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and the Toledo Refinery provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the refinery.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE"
