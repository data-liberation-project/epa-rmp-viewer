      "SummaryText": "Deltech Resin Company's management is committed to operating a safe manufacturing facility.  The employees receive periodic refresher training and participate in annual emergency response exercises.\n\nDeltech Resin Company manufactures synthetic resin at the facility.  It uses Toluene Diisocyanate (unspecified isomer ? CAS# 26471-62-5) for manufacturing urethanes.  Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI) is a regulated substance under the ?Accidental Release Prevention? regulation, under the Clean Air Act, Section 112 (r) (7).  Deltech procures, stores and handles TDI only in 55 gallon drums to minimize any potential release of TDI.  \n\nThe maximum quantity of TDI stored at the site is 110,000 pounds.  However, the typical quantity of TDI stored at the facility is at least half the maximum quantity.  The maximum quantity of TDI used in a production batch is 6,000 pounds, which is below the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds for TDI under the Accidental Release Prevention regulation.  Therefore, storage is the only process covered under the regulation.  \n\nThe distance to toxic endpoint for the worst-case release scenario of spill of two drums of TDI, estimated using EPA?s Offsite Consequences Analysis (OCA), is approximately 0.06 miles.  The release rate for these scenarios is approximately 0.003 lb/min.  However, the value reported is 0.2, since the software does not allow a value less than 0.2 to be entered.  \n\nThe former owner of the facility, Adco Chemical Company developed a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for TDI under the New Jersey Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act (NJ-TCPA) regulation.  The TCPA program was approved by the NJDEP on September 5, 1988.  Adco discontinued use of TDI on or about July 2005.  New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) approved temporary discontinuance of usage of TDI at the facility in October 2005.  Deltech acquired the facility on September 16, 2005.  Deltech is bringing TDI back into operation in December 2007.  \n\nThere has not been"

      "SummaryText": " any accidental release of TDI since Deltech acquired the facility in 2005.  \n\nThe preventative steps taken at the facility to minimize accidental release of TDI and any consequences of a release include:\n\n1.    The facility does not handle TDI in bulk.  TDI is only handled in 55-gallon drums.  \n\n2.    TDI is stored in a separate room in the warehouse.  The room is separated from the flammable material in the warehouse with a fire door and fire wall.  \n\n3.    The TDI room is provided with a sprinkler system.  \n\n4.    The TDI room is equipped with a TDI monitor with alarm to detect any spills of TDI in the room. \n\nDeltech Resin Company has a Combined Emergency Response Plan (Plant Operation #59) to respond to any emergency at the facility.  A copy of the plan has been distributed to all local emergency responders and plant emergency response members.  All new employees are provided with initial orientation training.  Annual refresher training is provided to all employees.  In addition, the emergency response team participates in annual emergency response exercises.  \n\nThe facility has been implementing a number of items since entering into the NJ-TCPA program for TDI in 1988.  These items have included the procuring TDI monitors, minimizing the TDI inventory, having a separate room for TDI storage with fire doors and walls, obtaining a sprinkler system and a TDI monitor for the TDI storage room, installing alarms for the processes using TDI and training employees in safe operation and emergency response.  We believe that as a result of these items, TDI operations at the facility are safe."
