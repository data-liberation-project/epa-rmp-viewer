Records of attendance are in the main office. \"Ammonia Leak' response training occurs at company safety department meetings when meetings occur, typically on a 12 times a year schedule. Yearly local community hazards response training is made available to all refrigeration on an assigned basis, work shifts and specific operations dictate actual attendance. Air Pak Training (self-contained breathing apparatus), updated fit tests, and medical qualifications are done yearly; records are maintained in the main office\r\n\r\n\u00b7 Refrigerating Engineers & Technicians Association (RETA) certified personnel are trained in safe operating practices of the basic engine rooms and refrigeration systems. Certificate of Achievement copies are maintained in employee files.\r\n\r\n1. Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\r\nGrowers Ice Company will maintain a release prevention program to eliminate or minimize any releases. The program will include regular inspections, monitoring equipment and logging conditions, scheduled maintenance, and operator training. There is a program to analyze releases for ways to prevent a similar future release, see Incident Investigation Forms.

They are also trained in emergency response procedures in the event of an ammonia release. There are emergency shut off switches for shutting down the system. Personnel will automatically be notified if any detector exceeds set point. Monitoring is 24 hours a day. An emergency control box and diffusion tank allows system pressure to be relieved manually. Relief valves at the 1140 Meeks St. facility are tied to an ammonia diffusion tank to prevent high pressure releases to ambient.\r\n\r\nOn-site personnel provide initial emergency response. On-site personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide first response. First response may include emergency equipment shutdown, system isolation, or controlled operation such as pump down to prevent or reduce an offsite release. \r\n\r\nNo emergency operations will be performed that are beyond the capabilities of the operators or other on-site personnel and for releases above an ammonia concentration of 300 ppm.\r\n\r\nLocal fire and police departments with mutual aid response will provide emergency response for a major release event. The refrigeration contractors would also be on-call to provide emergency response.\r\n\r\nEmergency response training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required for new employees. Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years.\r\n\r\n2.

Written in English, the GHS-SDS details the chemical properties, health hazards and exposure limits of anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\nAcutely Hazardous Material Uses\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the cooling systems. The cooling system consists of a single-stage ammonia refrigeration system with a central plant and a piping loop distributing refrigerant throughout the site.\r\n\r\nThe system contains approximately 140,000 lb. of ammonia. This is an engineering estimate based on calculations of the system volume. The exact ammonia volume is not known due to the system's age and the fact that the ammonia was not measured into the system. The TPQ for ammonia is 500 lbs.\r\n\r\nThe main engine room is located at 1040 Growers Street. The main condensers and receivers and the main liquid shutoff valve (King Valve) are located at 1140 Meeks Street.

Emergency Response Policies\r\nEmergency Response policies are specifically noted in the RMP, with respect to a general overview; on-site personnel provide initial response. On-site personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide first response (Growers Ice Company personnel are trained in response). First response may include emergency shut down of equipment, system isolation, controlled operations, such as pump down to prevent or reduce an off-site release.\r\n\r\nLocal fire and police departments will provide emergency response for a major release event with mutual aid from Growers Ice Company response employees.\r\nEmergency Response notification phone numbers are found in detail in the RMP, reporting Procedures. Detailed phone numbers are updated yearly. Phone Numbers are located in all the\r\nRMP binders and on the face of the Business Response Plan (which contains GIC Emergency response information), Evacuation maps are provided, and windsocks are strategically located on the property to aid in determining prevailing wind and escape routes.\r\n\r\nAmmonia detection systems consist of detectors located throughout the property. These detectors are monitored by a computerized monitoring system. An automatic dialing system notifies Growers Ice Company personnel and supervisors depending on the severity of the leak.\r\nA complete location of leak detectors is found in the RMP with appropriate maps and location detail. Ammonia Detector and maps are located in Section II.A - Executive Summary in the map Section.\r\n\r\n9. Emergency Response Program\r\nThe Growers Ice Company facility has implemented the state and county mandated \"Emergency\r\nResponse Plan\" (a.k.a. \"Business Response Plan\").

Planned Changes to Improve System Safety\r\nContinued response training, safety policy reviews and safety procedure reviews provide \"reinforced\" safe work practices. Employee's participation through on hands training ultimately makes the workplace and the community a safe place to be.\r\n\r\nBeing aware of potential problems and responding to a problem prior to emergency status is the preferred method of safety planning. Pro-active mechanical maintenance of the \"system\"\r\nInclude a five-year relief valve change-out program, yearly compressor inspections, bearing Replacements, paint and cleaning of equipment, and general house cleaning.\r\nThe \"System\" is also monitored by a computerized operating system. The system safeties and alarms are recognized and responded to in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nAmmonia detectors (strategically placed) are being used in conjunction with automatic paging to key personnel. The \"Operator on Duty\", received the page, the alarm is noted and responded to, emergency shut down buttons (switches) are strategically located to safely stop the engine room and related equipment. A third party (Sentry Alarm) monitors two-thirds of the main property 24 hours a day seven days a week. In the event of a release of ammonia, ammonia detectors located at several locations will activate and automatic call to the fire department and to responding parties at Growers Ice Company. The remaining Growers Ice Company Main\r\nProperty will eventually be monitored as well.\r\n\r\nGrowers Ice Company has added a diffusion tank piped to an Emergency Control Box. In the event of a dangerous over-pressure situation, this new system will give the operators and fire department the ability to manually relieve pressure into the diffusion tank before ammonia goes into the atmosphere via the pressure relief valves.
