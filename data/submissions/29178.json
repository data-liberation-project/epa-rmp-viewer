      "SummaryText": "PORT ARTHUR:   TERMINAL DOCK\nRMP EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nChevron Phillips Chemical Company LP, operates a synthetic organic chemical manufacturing plant in Port Arthur, Texas.  Port Arthur is a wholly owned subsidiary of Chevron Phillips Chemical LLC.  The two members of Chevron Phillips Chemical LLC are ChevronTexaco Corporation and ConocoPhillips Petroleum Company.   Both ChevronTexaco and ConocoPhillips are international petroleum and chemical companies.\n\nOne of the feedstocks to the Chevron Phillips manufacturing plant is a propylene/propane mixture and is received by barge and stored in bullets.  The unloading facility and bullets are remotely located from the manufacturing plant.  The feedstock is transferred via pipeline from the bullets to the manufacturing plant.  This RMP only covers the unloading & storage facility for the propylene/propane mixture.  There are no RMP regulated toxic material above threshold quantities at the dock unloading facility.  \n\nThe Port Arthur Terminal employs approximately 4 full time equivalent employees.  This facility is managed by Mr. Richard Cuneo, Plant Manager.   Mr. Bill Andes, Compliance Manager, is responsible for RMP implementation for this site.  \n\nJefferson County Local Emergency Planning Committee (409-722-4371) is the primary organization responsible for coordinating emergency response operations for this area.  Chevron Phillips Chemical is an active member of this organization.  Chevron Phillips Chemical is also a member of Sabine Neches Chiefs Association, a mutual assistance emergency response organization dedicated to providing fire protection and safety management resources to the petrochemical industry of Jefferson County.  In the event of a major release of any hazardous substance or a fire, Chevron Phillips Chemical would coordinate emergency response with these groups as well as the appropriate governmental agencies.     \n\nIn accordance with EPA's guidelines for analyzing accidental releases, Chevron Phillips h"

      "SummaryText": "as performed a hazard assessment for the flammable regulated substance.  The worst case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of a regulated flammable substances in a Program 3 process is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of a barge.  Based on the EPA program, RMP*Comp, this scenario results in the 1.0 psi blast overpressure having off-site impact.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS.  \n\nFor the Alternate Release Scenario, we modeled a release of flammable material from ?\" hole in the storage bullet, that continues for 30 minutes before a flash fire occurs.  This flash fire is estimated to have off-site impact.  No credit for any mitigation methods was taken.  Our plant has many preventive and mitigation measures that would greatly reduce the likelihood or severity of a release of flammable materials or a resulting fire.  These measures are detailed in the Prevention Program section of the RMP Plan.  All calculations for flammable  releases were performed using EPA's RMP*Comp software.  \n\nThis facility is covered by OSHA Process Safety Management regulations.  We are in substantial compliance with the PSM regulations.  This facility is also covered by numerous EPA and Texas Commission on Environmental Quality regulatory requirements designed to limit the impact on the environment, we are also in compliance with these regulations.  \n\nWe have had no RMP reportable accidents for any RMP regulated substances in the past 5 years at the Port ArthurTerminal Dock.  \n\nChevron Phillips Chemical is constantly reviewing our plant's physical facilities and operations to maintain a safe place for our employees to work and minimize environmental impacts.  Although we have adopted a program of continuous improvement, we currently have no plans to implement any major changes in our plant design, operating proce"
