Transportation fuel products include gasoline, jet fuel, and diesel fuel. The refinery also produces lubricating oils, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), and wax products. Several byproducts are produced as part of this process, including sulfur and anhydrous ammonia, which are recovered from sulfur and nitrogen contained in the crude oil. The substances regulated by RMP at the Chevron Richmond Refinery include flammable hydrocarbons, anhydrous ammonia, and aqueous ammonia.\n\n\nE.3    Hazard Assessment \n\nAs part of the RMP requirements, the Chevron Richmond Refinery is required to conduct a hazard assessment, which includes a Worst Case Scenario (WCS) analysis and an Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) analysis. The assumptions required by U.S. EPA for use in the WCS analysis are very conservative (and in many cases, unrealistic) and provide results that are unlikely to occur. One reason for this is the fact that the WCS does not take into account the systems and controls the refinery has in place to prevent a catastrophic failure. Consequently, U.S. EPA has stated that the distance to endpoint estimated under worst case conditions should not be considered a zone in which the public is in danger"

      "SummaryText": "; rather, the worst case scenario is intended to encourage communication between a facility and the maximum possible residential population.\n \nThe ARS, by definition, are more likely than the worst case scenarios; however, they are still very unlikely given the refinery's prevention program. The ARS are used primarily as tools for developing emergency response plans internally and in conjunction with outside emergency response organizations\n\nThe RMP rule requires facilities to develop one WCS for regulated toxic substances and one WCS for regulated flammable substances. Additional WCS are required if different public receptors would be affected, and WCS are also required for any Program 1 process (to demonstrate that there are no impacts in a worst-case release).  For the WCS, distances were calculated using U.S. EPA's RMP*Comp computer program, which is based on the Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance issued by U.S. EPA. Worst case weather conditions (F stability and 1.5 meter per second wind speed) were assumed in the WCS analysis. \n\nIn addition, one ARS is required for each regulated toxic substance, and one ARS is required for flammable substances as a class. For the ARS, Chevron used a consequence analysis computer program, Canary 3.1 by Quest Consultants, Inc., to provide more refined modeling results. Typical weather conditions (D stability and 3 meters per second wind speed) were assumed in the ARS analysis.\n\nE.3.1    Worst Case Scenarios\n\nThe WCS for regulated toxic substances at the Chevron Richmond Refinery involves the release of the entire inventory of an anhydrous ammonia storage vessel over a ten-minute period. Written procedures limit the quantity in the vessel to 220,000 lbs. (45% of vessel volume). This scenario is extremely unlikely given the safety systems in place at the refinery. Further, although there are numerous control measures that, in an actual event, would mitigate the release, no active mitigation systems can be considered in the WCS an"

      "SummaryText": "alysis according to the regulations. The WCS analysis shows that the plume of anhydrous ammonia could travel offsite and impact public receptors before dispersing enough to no longer pose an acute health hazard. \n\nThe WCS associated with regulated flammable substances is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the largest LPG storage sphere, which contains butane. The entire inventory of 3.7 million pounds is assumed to release, vaporize, and ignite. Written procedures that limit the liquid quantity to 92% of the vessel volume were taken into account. None of the existing active mitigation systems were considered in the analysis. The WCS analysis shows that the explosion endpoint could reach offsite and impact public receptors.\n\nAn additional WCS for flammable substances involves a VCE of a pentane rail car. This scenario is included because it impacts different public receptors than the LPG storage sphere scenario. The full inventory of 160,000 lbs. is assumed to release, vaporize, and ignite. The WCS analysis shows that the explosion could reach offsite and impact public receptors.\n\nIn addition, a WCS analysis was performed for twenty Program 1 processes. These scenarios involved the release of the entire contents of the vessel containing the largest quantity of regulated substances in each process. No administrative or passive controls were taken into account. None of these scenarios were predicted to have RMP endpoints that reach public receptors.\n\nE.3.2    Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe ARS for anhydrous ammonia was selected to be a large leak (3/4-inch hole) from a liquid line on the ammonia storage vessel. The refinery has water fog sprays surrounding the NH3 storage area to disperse the vapor cloud in the event of an accidental release. This active mitigation was estimated to reduce the release rate of ammonia by 56% by absorbing and dispersing the released vapor.

Dispersion modeling predicts that the ammonia could travel offsite before dispersing enough to no longer pose an acute health hazard; however, this scenario does not reach public receptors. If the water spray mitigation is not accounted for, the scenario still does not reach public receptors.\n\nThe ARS for aqueous ammonia was selected to be a bleeder break (3/4-inch hole) from an aqueous ammonia storage tank. A 30-minute release duration was used assuming that manual shutoff would be required. No active or passive mitigation was accounted for. Dispersion modeling predicts that the ammonia would neither travel offsite nor reach a public receptor before dispersing enough to no longer pose an acute health hazard. No scenario that is more likely than the worst case scenario was identified as having offsite impacts.\n\nThe ARS for regulated flammable substances was selected to be a large leak (3/4-inch hole) in a propane rail car that ignites and results in a flash fire (also known as vapor cloud fire). This scenario was chosen as the most appropriate ARS based on its proximity to the public and the ability to respond to a leak near the railcars before a fire occurs. A propane rail car was chosen over a pentane car (which was used as the WCS) because it had a greater dispersion distance for the same release scenario. A 30-minute release duration was used based on the estimated time to detect and isolate the leak. No administrative controls or mitigation measures were assumed. The ARS analysis predicts that the vapor cloud and resulting fire could extend offsite and reach public receptors. \n\n\nE.4    Five-Year Accident History\n\nThe RMP regulations require facilities to provide information on any accidents in the last five years involving RMP-regulated substances that meet certain criteria.

A 1997 release of hydrogen sulfide from the HNC process resulted in the activation of the Community Alert Network. Significant onsite property damage, a shelter-in-place order, and one onsite and possible offsite injuries occurred during the Isomax fire in 1999. No offsite deaths, evacuations, or environmental damage has occurred. \n\n\nE.5    General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nA key component of the refinery's prevention program is the Process Safety Management (PSM) program. The Chevron Richmond Refinery applies PSM to the entire refinery, not just to processes that are required by Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to implement a PSM program. The refinery's PSM program is documented in Refinery Instruction (RI)-360, \"Richmond Refinery PSM Policy\". Refinery Instructions are available on the Refinery Information Server, the internal web page for the Chevron Richmond Refinery, which provides pertinent information accessible to all employees. \n\n\nE.6    Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe processes at the Chevron Richmond Refinery involve hazards that must be carefully managed to ensure safe operation. In addition to the general accident prevention program, the Chevron Richmond Refinery has numerous safety features to quickly detect a release and/or reduce the consequences of a release. Chemical-specific safeguards for RMP regulated substances are described below.\n\nFlammable Hydrocarbons\n\nThe LPG Storage area has been designed to minimize the risk of releasing LPG to the atmosphere by providing high equipment reliability, minimizing the number of connections, avoiding unnecessary equipment, and protecting against inadvertent damage or failure. Some of the specific prevention and mitigation safeguards are described below:\n\n* The LPG storage spheres are located away from the refinery perimeter to minimize the effect on the public in the even"

      "SummaryText": "se Program\n\nOverall safety is a function of a facility's prevention program as well as its accident mitigation program, i.e., the ability to minimize the consequences of an accident if one occurs. The Chevron Richmond Refinery maintains an emergency response program designed to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. As part of the emergency response program, there is a written Emergency Response Plan for responding to accidental chemical releases, including procedures for notifying the public and local emergency response agencies. The program also includes the maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment. In addition, the Chevron Richmond Refinery Fire Department, the largest refinery fire department in the country, works closely with local emergency responders in preparing for emergencies. \n\nThe Emergency Response Plan addresses all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release does occur, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. The Plan is documented in a series of Refinery Instructions (RIs), which are maintained on the Refinery Information Server and are available to all employees. Hardcopies of the plan are also maintained throughout the Refinery. The Emergency Response Plan is reviewed and updated to ensure that it remains accurate and current. Every employee receives training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. \n\nThe emergency response program has procedures in place for notifying employees, on-site and outside emergency responders, government agencies, and the community in the event of a release. Upon the first detection of a release or other emergency situation, an employee would call the refinery emergency phone number, which initiates the emergency re"

For hazardous material releases with potential offsite impacts (or meeting other reporting criteria), Contra Costa Health Services (CCHS), the Richmond Fire Department, and other agencies are notified immediately. If appropriate, the CCHS will activate the Community Warning System (CWS) to alert the community. The Chevron Richmond Refinery worked closely with CCHS to establish the CWS and was a major contributor to the CWS project. The CWS consists of several components as follows:\n\n* Sirens. Five sirens can currently be activated to provide a loud audible signal throughout the cities of Richmond and San Pablo. Seventeen additional sirens are expected to be in service by July 1999. Upon hearing the sirens, residents should proceed indoors to shelter-in-place and turn on their TV or radio to obtain further instructions or more information about the incident.\n\n* Community Alert Network (CAN). The CAN system is a telephone ring-down system that would automatically call households in the area of a release to provide notification and instructions.\n\n* Emergency Alert Receivers. In the near future, these small radio devices will be available, which would provide the community with an additional means of notification in the event of a chemical emergency.\n\n* Media. An initial warning, updates, instructions, and an \"all-clear\" would be distributed to the community through radio, television, and cable by CCHS.\n\nThe Fire Department at the Chevron Richmond Refinery has the largest emergency response organization of any refinery in the country; it consists of 30 full-time and 75 volunteer men and women dedicated to providing all aspects of emergency services for the refinery.

This includes conducting emergency drills in which an offsite responding agency (Richmond Fire Department and/or CCHS), the Chevron Fire Department, and non-responding employees work together to resolve a given scenario. The Chevron Richmond Refinery also works closely with CCHS for any necessary response to hazardous material releases (such as downwind air monitoring) and to alert the public in case of accidental releases, fires, or explosions. \n\nThe Chevron Fire Department also provides mutual aid to the City of Richmond Fire Department and responds outside of the refinery within the City of Richmond whenever asked to do so by the city fire department. The Chevron Fire Department also belongs to an industrial mutual aid organization, Petrochemical Mutual Aid Organization (PMAO), and has responded to other oil companies and chemical plants during emergencies. Likewise, the emergency response resources of the other companies in PMAO are available for an emergency at Chevron if needed. \n\n\nE.8    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety has been a part of the working culture at the Chevron Richmond Refinery for many years.
