              "Description": "Hercules has fully implemented a PSM program for all applicable units at the Jefferson Plant.  This includes all resin production units.  The PSM program assures compliance to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard, Process Safety Management (29 CFR 1910.119).  This is a proactive system to identify, evaluate, and minimize or prevent unwanted releases of chemicals that could occur as a result of failures in processes, procedures, or equipment.  It is intended to minimize the potential of an incident which could have a major impact on employees, contractors, the community, or lead to a significant business interruption.\n\nThe Process Safety Management standard applies to processes that involve chemicals at or above threshold quantities specified in Appendix A of the 29 CFR 1910.119 and processes that involve flammable liquids or gases on-site in one location, in quantities of 10,000 pounds or more.  The management program provides the organization structure for the program to include the roles and responsibilities of the PSM Steering Team, Planning Teams, Safety Department, Process Engineering Department, and the Human Resources Department.  Employee attend and participate in monthly safety meetings where they are informed of changes in plant policies and procedures, and basic safety principles are reviewed.  Employees are involved in any formal incident investigation team.  Wageroll employees are involved in every HAZOP analysis.  Audit of safety procedures is accomplished by Job Safety Observations (JSOs), usually involving at least one wageroll employee and one supervisor.\n\nJefferson Plant Process Safety information is up-to-date and readily available through several databases including MSDS and Mechanical Equipment specifications and preventative maintenance records.  Information pertaining to the technology of the process including block flow diagrams, process chemistry, maximum inventories, safe operating limits (Engineering Department), and evaluation of the consequence of process upsets are documented in the HAZOP reviews (Engineering Department) is documented in the PSM database. Information pertaining to the equipment in the process: materials of construction, piping and instrument diagrams (These drawings are updated after implementation of a capital project, Management of Change notification, or HAZOP review.), and area electrical classifications is maintained in the Engineering Department.  Relief system design is specified by Engineering; Hercules standards, API code, and ASME standards are used to establish the appropriate design basis for each relief system.  The design basis information is filed in the Vendor Print File project folder with the associated equipment specification.  Ventilation system design is based on applicable codes and standards. The Engineering Department maintains the material and energy balances for each process.\n\nSafety systems, including interlocks, detection, and suppression systems are employed. The Plant has a supervised central alarm system that is activated from the pull stations located throughout the plant.  The coded alarm signals the area and sub-area that has the fire.  The fire horns sound the alarm as well as signal on all plant radios.  Specific Plant Fire Protection and Suppression systems include: C5 process building - Deluge Sprinkler System, Isobutylene storage tank - Fire Monitor System, Ammonia storage tank - Fire Monitor System, C5 Poly Oil, JRAF, and toluene storage tanks - Foam System, Piperylene storage tank - Foam System, BF3 storage area - Deluge Sprinkler System, WW Poly process building - Halon Sprinkler System, MP Poly process building - Deluge Sprinkler System, Pure Monomer storage tanks - Foam System, RO-80 storage tanks -Foam system, Naptha (VM&P) storage tank - Foam system, Turpentine (SDWT) storage tank - Foam System, Thermal Poly process building - Deluge Sprinkler System, Hydrogenation process building - Wet Pipe Sprinkler/Deluge System, Hydrogen storage cylinders - Fire Monitors.\n\nProcess Safety Interlocks, both hardware and software, are included in each unit.  These interlocks are documented in the HAZOP documentation as they relate to specific process upsets and avoidance of undesired consequences.  The BF3 Trailer area is equipped with detectors to immediately initiate the deluge system and sound the alarm should a release occur.  Excess flow valves prevent high rate releases from occurring outside the storage areas for BF3, 2-Methylpropene (Isobutylene), and Ammonia.\n\nHAZOP analyses are conducted on a schedule to ensure that every aspect of the manufacturing process is evaluated every five years.  The results of these analyses are kept on file in the Engineering Department.\n\nOperating procedures and practices are documented as Jefferson Work Instructions located on the LAN system.  These include safety specific instructions (such as Confined Space Entry and the Lockout Procedure).  Work instructions and procedures on the LAN are available to all employees.   Job Safety Observations (JSOs) and ISO audits are used to verify that the procedures are current and applicable to the operation.\n\nEmployee training is conducted initially and on an on-going schedule consistent with each job classification's requirements.\n\nThe Jefferson Plant Contractor Safety Work Rules Work Instruction can be found on the LAN.  This procedure is reviewed with each contractor before they can begin work on the plant.  In addition to reviewing the work instruction, the contractor watches a safety video about the plant and receives a card detailing specific safety requirements.  All other applicable plant safety procedures (such as confined space entry or hot work) are also reviewed before the contractor can start work on the plant.  This review is updated with each contractor annually, verified by written documentation in the safety department and a green safety orientation sticker on the individual contractor's hard hat.\n\nThe Jefferson Plant PSM Mechanical Integrity Plan outlines the requirements to comply with paragraph (j), Mechanical Integrity of OSHA PSM 1910.119.  This regulation applies to the following process equipment: Pressure vessels & storage tanks, Piping systems, Relief & vent systems and devices, Emergency shutdown systems, Controls, and Pumps.  It requires Written Procedures, Training on Process Maintenance Activities, Testing & Inspection, correction of Equipment Deficiencies, and Quality Assurance that both the installation of new equipment and the repairs/installation of existing equipment are suitable for the process application.\n\nThe Jefferson Plant Hot Work Permit Procedure can be found on the LAN.\n\nThe OSHA Process Safety Management rule requires that all changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures, and facilities related to covered processes are managed.  This management process must include documentation of the technical basis of the change, the impact on health and safety (including risk assessment), modifications to procedures, time period (if not permanent), authorization requirements (approval of the change), and communication of changes to affected employees.  This includes changes to process chemicals, operating procedures, maintenance procedures, equipment, process specifications, control strategy, and facility. All process changes are documented in the Management of Change database or in capital project papers.\n \nIncidents and near-misses on the Jefferson Plant are reported to the shift supervisor.  These are discussed with the person reporting the incident and documented on an incident investigation form.  The form is routed to the responsible supervisor to investigate.",

Raw materials, primarily hydrocarbon liquids, are polymerized in any of five units:  Thermal Poly, C-5 Process, MP-Poly, WW-Poly, Solution Poly, and Suspension Poly.  Most polymerizations result in an intermediate product or resin solution which consists of the product resin dissolved in a petroleum liquid.  The intermediates are distilled, emulsified, and hydrognated modified to produce the hydrocarbon resin packaged for consumption by various industries.  Final products are shipped as flakes, pastilles, or beads in bags, as solids in drums, and as liquids in drums, rail cars or tank trucks.\n\nBackground of the Risk Management Program\n\nThe US EPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency) under the Clean Air Act, section 112(r), developed a Risk Management Plan (RMP) rule which requires Corporations to assess risk within their plants and plant communities.  The Risk Management Plan rule requires that facilities that use certain chemicals develop and manage a Risk Management Plan.  This plan requires that we identify, assess, and document important information about chemical processes at our plant.  The regulation requires us to maintain safety and emergency response systems to prevent and prepare for chemical accidents.  The rule is also designed to inform the public (in an understandable language) about the regulated risks and the emergency prevention, safety and response programs implemented at our plant.\n\nThis law was passed in reaction to public concerns about plant accidents involving chemicals.  To minimize the consequences of such releases, the legislation wanted to focus on preventative measures on the chemicals that pose the greatest risk.  Again, managing the risk such as deciding to wear a seat belt.  The rule applies to manufacturing plants, as well as non-manufacturing sites, that produce, process, handle, "

Facilities must communicate the results of these analyses to the EPA, Allegheny County Health Department, and the local emergency planning committee (LEPC).\n\n\"Worst case\" scenario is the term used in the regulation to describe a hypothetical accidental release for emergency planning.  In the \"worst case\" model, emergency planners assume all of the safety systems fail on the facility's largest storage container or interconnected pipe system, containing an EPA listed chemical, and that the entire contents leak to the environment in 10 minutes.  Obviously, this scenario would have a great impact on the plant and the local community.  The definition of the worst case scenario severely limits the degree to which a realistic scenario can be selected.  The intention of the worst case scenario is not in fact to be realistic, but to define the upper bound impact of a release that is virtually impossible.  This exercise challenges the emergency planners to prepare for this kind of emergency.\n\nThe Jefferson Plant takes many steps to make sure that these \"worst case scenarios\" don't happen.  The EPA acknowledges that the likelihood of a worst case scenario ever occurring is extremely small.  For this reason, the EPA also allows for facilities to provide an alternative or more likely scenario.  The alternative scenario represents a potential release that is more probable than the worst case scenario and therefore more relevant to emergency planning efforts.  The Jefferson Plant will include an alternative scenario in our plan so that the emergency management agencies"

As the RMP program continues, we will learn more about these systems and the alternative scenario.\n\nWorst Case Release (Toxic)\n\nThe worst case scenario is defined as that scenario that is predicted to have the greatest distance to the applicable endpoint.  These chemical concentration endpoints are labeled toxic and flammable endpoints.  These endpoints are set by the regulations at a level considerably less than the Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health (IDLH) level as defined by the National Institute if Occupational Safety and Health.  The objective of the scenario modeling for each release scenario is to determine the downwind distance to the endpoint.  In the case of toxic substances, Ammonia and BF3, the endpoint is the concentration of the chemical in the air that is believed to be protective of the public for one-hour exposure periods.  This level of exposure would not cause any long-term health consequences.  The level would not impair the individual's ability to take protective action.\n\nThe Jefferson Plant program included dispersion modeling to analyze the scenarios.  Hercules utilized several dispersion models.  All of the seven (7) models are publicly available and referenced in the EPA guidance document.  Each model has different strengths so several models were applied to each scenario.  Certain input parameters were common to all models including meteorological data, chemical data, and release characteristics.\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario for the Jefferson Plant involves the chemical Anhydrous Ammonia.  Anhydrous Ammonia is received by the Plant in a tank truck that is unloaded into a 45,000-pound storage tank.   The ammonia is used in the resin process as a neutralizing agent.\n\nThe catastrophic release of ammonia would occur over 10 minutes due to a rupture in the storage tank.

The health hazards would be irritated eyes, nose and throats.  Most individuals could be exposed to the concentration level represented by the toxic endpoint for up to one hour without having irreversible or serious health effects or symptoms.  The DEGADIS model was most applicable for this release.  The model indicates that the distance to the toxic endpoint (concentration of the chemical in the air that is believed to be protective of the public for one hour exposure periods with no long term health concerns or impair the persons ability to take protective cover) is 1.35 miles.  The closest off-site receptor is 0.16 miles from the probable point of release.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario (Flammable)\n\nThe flammable endpoint is based on pressure and not on chemical concentration.  This endpoint is 1 psi overpressure, which has the force that could break windows in a house.\n\nThe worst case flammable release would be the entire 7,300,000 pound contents of the Piperylene Storage Tank released to the containment dike.  The RMP regulations specify that 10% of the energy contained in the resulting vapor cloud participates in an explosion.  The dispersion model predicts that the regulatory endpoint overpressure of 1 psi may be felt up to 1.6 miles from the tank. The closest off-site receptors are within 0.3 miles.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios (Toxic)\n\nAlternative scenarios are required for each RMP regulated toxic substance; Hercules has two: Anhydrous Ammonia and  Boron Trifluoride (BF3).\n\nThe Alternative or Most Likely Scenario for BF3 involves the connection of the delivery truck to the plant piping.

The storage conditions are at 1600 psig and ambient temperature.  The entire contents will be released into the atmosphere.  The release of the BF3 would form a dense white cloud due to the reaction with water vapor.  The BF3 trailers are surrounded by a water deluge system.  This active mitigation system has a total of 27 water spray nozzles that deliver approximately 17 gpm (gallons per minute) per nozzle for a total flow rate of 450 gpm.  The water deluge system was designed to knock down any BF3 vapors that are accidentally releases from the tube trailers.  The toxic endpoint for BF3 is 10 PPM.  The IDLH value is 25 PPM.  The DEGADIS model indicates the distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.73 miles.  The closest off-site receptor is 0.10 miles from the site from the probable point of release.\n\nThe Alternative or Most Likely Scenario for Ammonia involves a small (= inch) hole in the 45000 pound storage tank or its local appurtenances which might result from corrosion and result in an uncontrollable release.  This release would occur over a period of 100 minutes; allowing time for a response.  Manual direction of a water stream from a fire monitor would be utilized to mitigate the actual release.

This primarily on-site program is discussed in detail in section 7 of this report.\n\nChemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nThis report addresses 5 chemicals used in the resin manufacturing process, listed under RMP, and present in quantities exceeding the threshold for regulation.  Here we point out some of the specific considerations Hercules has made in developing a prevention program.\n\nBoth BF3 and Ammonia are stored under pressure.  The BF3 remains in the delivery cylinders while the Ammonia is transferred to a permanent supply tank upon delivery.  Both systems are equipped with excess flow check valves to prevent a major release outside the immediate area of the storage vessels.  The Anhydrous Ammonia is stored in an insulated standard design tank equipped with all standard safety devices.  The BF3 is a unique material stored at up to 2500 psi.  The extraordinary pressure combined with its corrosive nature requires extraordinary measures to prevent both minor and major releases.  Here we have utilized the vendors failsafe header cut-off to allow immediate remote shut-off should the transfer piping fail.  The trailer is located in a shed equipped with a deluge system to absorb released gas and/or prevent overheating of the cylinder in case of adjacent fire.  Automatic detectors will sound an alarm and activate the deluge system should a release occur.\n\nHydrogen is stored both as a cryogenic liquid and as a pressurized gas at the south end of the plant.  Nitrogen snuffers allow any hydrogen vent fires to be extinguished before overheating equipment.  Local sources of ignition have been minimized.\n\nPiperylene is a light petroleum product stored in a large tank equ"

It has properties similar to butane lighter fluid and will vaporize when open to the atmosphere.  The rapid evaporation potentially results in a very cold pool of liquid.  Excess flow valves are installed on all of the bottom nozzles to prevent major releases outside the immediate tank area.
