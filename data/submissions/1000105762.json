This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated process. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible accidental releases of regulated substances as they are identified. However, if such an accidental release does occur, we are coordinated with the Deer Park Fire Department and the Harris County Local Emergency Planning Committee for emergency response support.\n\n\n- The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nPresently Anhydrous Ammonia is the only RMP regulated substance present at this facility above a threshold quantity.  Ammonia is utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-loop refrigeration systems. The system's purpose is to provide refrigeration and cold storage capabilities for SFC Global Supply Chain, Inc. operations.  Due to the size and characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration systems, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, SFC Global Supply Chain, Inc. is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\n\n- Offsite Consequence Analysis \n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario have been completed as stated in Sections 2 and 3 of the RMP*eSubmit document.\n\nTo evaluate both the worst case, and alternative release off site consequence analysis, EPA's RMP Comp Hazardous Release software was utilized exclusively. As specified in the RMP Guidance, the worst case and alternate case release scenarios have been calculated and the results of the calculations are documented in"

Public and environmental receptors that could possibly be affected by the release scenarios were determined through the use of data from the  US Census Bureau in MARPLOT mapping system software.\n\n- General Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\nSFC Global Supply Chain, Inc. has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68.  To meet these necessary requirements SFC Global Supply Chain, Inc. has implemented their Process Safety Management program through the written guidelines stated in the OSHA PSM Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119. \n\nAdditionally Schwan's Deer Park facility has a PSM specialist, and a PSM Specialist on staff. Corporate PSM support is available. \n\nThe PSM / RMP Team meets monthly, more often if necessary. The team is comprised of System Operators, Operational leadership, Corporate PSM support, Corporate PSM support, Maintenance, Maintenance Planning / Scheduling, PSM, EHS, and Refrigeration. Additional support is available. Every operator is included in meeting agenda and meeting result distribution.\n\nThe program incorporates IIAR standards. Our PSSR program incorporates pre-charging as well as pre-startup safety reviews. Our Management of Change Process includes de-commissioning,  Pre-construction Engineering Review, and Safety and Health Review. Our review of needs incorporates not only PSI updates, but all potential document changes needed as a result of system changes. \n\n- Accident History\n\nIn 2021 we experienced a reportable incident.  \n \n\n- Emergency Action/Response Plan\n\nSFC Global Supply Chain, Inc. current Emergency Response Plan focuses on evacuation and response of the facility (in concentrations below 300 PPM) In the event of an ammonia emergency.  SFC Global Supply Chain, Inc.  coordinates with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and Deer Park Fire Department"

Standard Operating Procedures are reviewed annually.\n\n- Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nSFC Global Supply Chain, Inc. continuously looks for ways to improve the safety and efficiency of the system. The processes will be subjected to periodic process hazard analysis reviews for the purpose of identifying potential hazards and implementing solutions. The SFC Global Supply Chain, Inc. personnel will also periodically review all potential opportunities to improve the safety of our personnel, the surrounding community, and the ammonia refrigeration processes. \n\n-Changes being considered are:\n\nExpansion of the Standard Operating Procedures to begin to include more detailed troubleshooting guides, not as a safety addition, but as an increased operator efficiency improvement.\n\nModification to the Management of change process to increase the breadth of the Engineering Reviews and Safety and Health Reviews to include more operational efficiency opportunities.\n\nAdditional process training for corporate engineering support personnel is scheduled."
