Hill Brothers Chemical Company staff is well trained and utilizes modern equipment to monitor its facilities to provide safeguards, while effectively employing these chemicals.  \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nHill Brothers Chemical Company has an emergency response plan in effect to handle potential emergency situations at this facility.  This plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n \nHill Brothers Chemical Company policy is to conduct all operations in a safe and conscientious manner to prevent accidental releases of any hazardous material, including substances regulated through the Federal Accidental Release Prevention Program and CalARP.  Hill Brothers Chemical Company trains its employees at this facility to properly handle and store hazardous materials to minimize the possibility of adversely affecting its worker's health, the workplace, the public, and the environment.  Hill Brothers Chemical Company Accidental Release Prevention policy is implemented through the management system contained in its RMP.\n\nHill Brothers Chemical Company emergency response policy is contained in its current written Hazardous Materials Business Plan.

All employees are trained in their appropriate role in emergency response and proper procedures for awareness level response.  The Los Angeles Facility maintains a cooperative relationship with the Fire Department to ensure a full understanding of normal storage practices and emergency response and evacuation procedures related to regulated substances.  \n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nAnhydrous ammonia and aqueous ammonia are the two regulated substances managed at this plant and covered by the Federal Accidental Release Prevention Program and CalARP.  The Los Angeles Facility uses commercial grade anhydrous ammonia to manufacture aqueous ammonia (ammonium hydroxide) in grades ranging from 20% and 30% for distribution to customers.  Hill Brothers Chemical Company has identified a single covered process at this plant because all tanks are interconnected.  Tankers off-loading raw materials or manufactured product are also interconnected with this process during off-loading activities.  Anhydrous ammonia is a gas, liquefied under pressure and stored at ambient temperature at the Los Angeles Facility.  Aqueous ammonia is stored as a liquid at ambient pressure and temperature.  \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nHill Brothers Chemical Company has a PSM program in place to manage the handling of regulated substances, which complies with Federal RMP, CalARP and PSM requirements.  The program includes strict requirements for written operating procedures, personnel training, contractor safety, equipment maintenance, incident investigation, process hazard analysis, management of change and periodic review or audit of program elements.

Process Safety Management also requires a pre-startup safety review to ensure that the system is properly reviewed before it is put back into service after a major change.   \n\nHill Brothers Chemical Company prevention program emphasizes risk management through the use of equipment rated for ammonia service, training for its employees in hazard communication, proper operating procedures for the repackaging of anhydrous ammonia; level, pressure and temperature limits for process equipment and storage tanks; implementation of programs to maintain the mechanical integrity of equipment, internal auditing and inspection programs, procedures to address change within the parameters of this RMP, and awareness level emergency response.  \n\nHill Brothers Chemical Company standard operating procedures include routine observation of equipment condition during daily start-up procedures, production procedures, and daily shutdown procedures.  Two trained operators are always present during bulk transfer to ensure safe operation and movement of trucks on the property and the integrity of hoses used for filling.  Operators are always present during repackaging operations to observe pressure and temperature gauges on tanks and pipes and to be alert for any releases of pressure relief valves installed on tanks or hydrostats on piping systems.  Hill Brothers Chemical Company trains their operators carefully before allowing them to take the lead in repackaging operations.  A key training method for process operations involves on-the-job supervision over extended time periods, using repeated demonstration of correct process steps in accordance with written procedures. \n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThe five-year accident history (June 1999 to June 2004) for the Hill Brothers Chemical Company Los Angeles Facility reveals that there were no reportable accidents during this period.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nHill"
