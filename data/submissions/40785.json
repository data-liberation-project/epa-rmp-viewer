              "Description": "Liquid fertilizer is manufactured by combining anhydrous ammonia, super phosphoric acid, and water in a converter reactor.  The super phosphoric acid\n is delivered in insulated rail tank cars.  The super phoshoric acid is transferred to the reactor via flexible hose to the reactor tank.  The anhydrous ammonia is delivered and stored in high pressure rail tank cars during this manufacturing process.\n                                                                                                     Liquid anhydrous ammonia is pumped from the rail car, through a meter and then through a heat exchanger,where the anhydrous ammonia is vaproized.  After the heat exchanger, the anhydrous ammonia vapor is mixed with the water and phosphoric acid, which is pumped from the phosphoric acid rail car to the reactor.  The anhydrous ammonia and phosphoric acid react to form ammonium phosphates and heat.  The ammonium phosphates exit the reactor and enter a holding pool where they mix with water to form an ammonium phosphate solution (i.e., 10-34-0).\n                                                                                                                   Situated above the holding pool is a cooling tower with a fan that pulls air up the tower off of the holding pool.  The ammonium phosphate solution is pumped to the top of the cooling tower where it flows down packing (i.e., Pall Rings) back down to the holding pool.  While falling down the packing, the water evaporates and cools the solution.\n.                                                                                                            Some of the ammonium phosphate solution in the holding pool is pumped out to the anhydrous ammonia heat exchanger.  The warm ammonium phosphate solutionis used to vaporize the anhydrous ammonia liquid from the anhydrous ammonia tank.  The ammonium phosphate solution, which is cooled by the anhydrous ammonia vaporization, flows back to the holding pool and some of the solution flows to a storage tank.\n\nThe 18,000 gallon anhydrous ammonia tank that was reported in the initial RMP was removed during the summer of 2004.",

The facility is a farm cooperative.  The primary activity at this fertilizer facility is the storage, handling and mixing of fertilizers for distribution to local farmers. The 18,000 gallon storage tank that was reported in the initial RMP was dismantled and removed during the spring of 2004.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored,  and used for manufacturing of 10-34-0 and starter grades liquid fertilizer.  The maximum stored quantity of anhydrous ammonia is 130,000 pounds stored in one 30,000 gallon rail car.  The maximum fill level of each tank is 85% of the total tank capacity.\n                                                                                                                                                                                     Liquid fertilizer  is manufactured by combining anhydrous ammonia, super phosphoric acid, and water in a converter reactor.
