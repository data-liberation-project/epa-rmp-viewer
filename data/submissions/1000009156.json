All applicable prevention procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program will be adhered to. The City of Newport Department of Utilities Water Division emergency response policy involves the preparation of evacuation and notification procedures and coordination of emergency response procedures with the Local Emergency Response Committee (LEPC) and the local fire department.\n                                                            \nThe Station #1 Water Treatment Plant, installed in 1992, serves the Newport, Rhode Island community by disinfecting drinking water. The water treatment plant is located at 110 Bliss Mine Road. The water treatment plant contains a storage room that contains liquid chlorine ton-cylinders; a chlorinator room which mixes the chlorine with water and regulates the flow of chlorine to various stages of the treatment process; an instrument room that contains flow recorders and other electronic panels; and various safety equipment. Within the storage room, one (1) ton-cylinder is on line, one cylinder is in reserve, and three (3) ton-cylinders are in storage. The facility operates on three (3) shifts with a minimum of three (3) operators per shift. The chlorine storage area and the chlorinator room are monitored with chlorine detectors.\nAt the Station #1 Water Treatment Plant, gaseous chlorine is taken from the one-ton cylinders under pressure to vacuum regulators. The gaseous chlorine is under pressure for a short distance within the chlorine storage room. From the vacuum regulators located within the chlorine storage room, the gaseous chlorine travels under vacuum to the chlorinators and then onto the treatment of water. As the chlorine is under vacuum any failure or leak of the piping system within the chlorinator room"

      "SummaryText": " will break the vacuum and will stop the flow of chlorine gas.\n\nThe water treatment plant's offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two release scenarios involving chlorine.  These scenarios are identified as the \"worst case\" and \"alternative\".  EPA states that for the worst case scenario \"the owner or operator shall assume the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released over 10 minutes'.  The worst case scenario is to result from an unspecified failure. EPA defines the alternative scenario as one that is \"more likely to occur that the worst case scenario\".\n\nThe purpose of the release scenarios is to determine the distance to \"toxic endpoint\" which is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association as the \"maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action\". Additionally, the residential population within a circle, which is made using the distance to toxic endpoint as its radius, has to be defined as an estimate of the population potentially affected.  For purpose of determining worst case and alternative release scenario distance to toxic endpoint, the water treatment plant utilized EPA's RMP Comp software.\n\nThe worst case release scenario at the Station #1 Water Treatment Plant involves a failure of one ton-cylinder. The distance to toxic endpoint was determined to be 1.3 miles and an estimate of the residential population potentially affected of 18,960 was obtained.\n\nThe water treatment plant used, as an alternative release scenario, a leak during a hook up of a ton -ylinder. The leak came from the 3/8\" whip, which carries the gaseous chlorine from the ton-cylinder to a one-inch gas rated steel pipe.

The distance to toxic endpoint for the alternative scenario was determined to be 0.1 miles and an estimate of the residential population potentially affected of 113 was obtained.\n\nThe general City of Newport Department of Utilities Water Division's accidental release prevention program is based on training of operators; implementation of preventative maintenance; auditing and inspection programs; continual review and upgrade of process and safety equipment; use of accurate and effective operating procedures (developed with the participation of the operators); and the execution of periodic reviews of equipment and procedures.\n\nNo accidental releases of chlorine have occurred at the Station #1 Water Treatment plant in the past five years.\n\nThe water treatment plant has coordinated its emergency response procedures with the City of Newport Fire Dept and the District 7 Local Emergency Response Committee (LEPC). Procedures have been developed for the effective and timely notification of response personnel and the community and for the safe evacuation of employees."
