Honeywell Muskegon's storage and use of chloroform and ethyl ether exceeds the specified thresholds of 20,000 lbs. and 10,000 lbs. respectively, as defined by the EPA\u00c2\u00bfs RMP Rule.  \n\nIn accordance with the requirements of the RMP Rule, a description of the following six elements is provided for Honeywell Muskegon: \n\n1)\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies: \n\nIt is the policy of Honeywell Muskegon to operate a safe and environmentally sound facility by identifying and controlling health, safety, or environmental risks related to its operations; by designing its processes to protect people, property and the environment; by conducting and continually reviewing and improving programs for safety, health and environmental excellence; and by establishing processes to ensure that all laws and regulations applicable to its operations and products are known and observed. The accidental release prevention and emergency response policy associated specifically with the plant's use of chloroform and ethyl ether involves the integration of safety devices and technologies inherent in the design of the processes, safe operational procedures and management practices, operator training, emergency response plans, maintenance of emergency response equipment, coordination with local emergency response services, and communicating with the community. \n\n2)\tDescription of the Facility and the Regulated Substance Handled: \n\nHoneywell Muskego"

The Plan has been coordinated with the Muskegon Fire Department who would direct all community response activities in conjunction with the site\u00c2\u00bfs Incident Commander.  During an emergency company personnel would serve as technical resources to public emergency responders as well as coordinate safe evacuation of onsite personnel, recovery and start-up operations.

The purpose of these systematic safety reviews, is to identify opportunities to improve upon the existing safeguards of the covered source and to further reduce the potential for accidental release.
