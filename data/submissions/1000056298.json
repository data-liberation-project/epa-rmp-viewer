The policy mandates ANSI\n\nK61.1, Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia. This standard closely\n\nresembles the required regulation under OSHA 1910.111. Company policy also requires the implementation\n\nof specific engineering and administrative controls to prevent releases as well as a complete Safety & Health\n\nProgram. Airgas Specialty Products does not respond to releases but maintains an Emergency Action Plan\n\nthat is coordinated with local responders.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored and distributed from this location. Ammonia is stored in ASME coded pressure\n\nvessels and maintained in totally enclosed systems from railcar to distribution vessels, minimizing transfer\n\nlosses and accidental release potential.\n\nAirgas Specialty Products has developed and implemented procedures specific to storage and distribution of\n\nanhydrous ammonia to meet the requirements of a prevention program as outlined in the regulation. Process\n\nsafety information was gathered specific to the process and a process hazard analysis was conducted and\n\noperating procedures were written based upon the process safety information and process hazard analysis.\n\nTraining was developed and provided to all employees. All other elements of the prevention program has\n\nbeen addressed and followed per the RMP and PSM regulations.\n\nThis Airgas Specialty Products location has not had any RMP defined accidental releases in the past five years.\n\nAirgas Specialty Products has a written Emergency Action Plan to deal with accidental releases of anhydrous\n\nammonia. The plan includes procedures for informing all on-site personnel as well as the required\n\nnotification of emergency response personnel (local fire department, state and federal agencies).\n\nThis ASP facility has been scrutinized and closely follows the standards and regulations and has continued\n\nsuch without major incident or release for many year"
