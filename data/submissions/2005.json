OUR FACILITY STORES FOR RETAIL ANHYDROUS AMMONIA WHICH IS USED AS A FERTILIZER.  THE FACILITY IS USED IN THE SPRING FROM APRIL TO JUNE AND IN THE FALL FROM OCTOBER TO FREEZE UP, NORMALLY IN NOVEMBER.\n  THE WORST CASE SCENARIO COULD AFFECT APPROXIMATELY 190 PEOPLE.  THIS SCENARIO IS VERY UNLIKELY BECAUSE OF SAFETY EQUIPMENT INSTALLED AT THE FACILITY AND THE COMPANIES COMMITTMENT TO SAFETY TRAINING AND MAINTANENCE OF THIS EQUIPMENT.\n  THE ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO WOULD AFFECT COMPANY PROPERTY AND APPROXIMATELY 50 PEOPLE.  (EMPLOYEE'S AND RESIDENTS OF ESMOND.)\n  WE HAVE NOT HAD ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IN THE PAST 5 YEARS.  THROUGH INSPECTIONS, MAINTANENCE AND SAFETY TRAINING FOR EMPLOYEE'S. SAFETY TRAINING IS OFFERED TO CUSTOMERS.\n  EVERY YEAR THE FIRE DEPARTMENT IS INVITED TO TOUR OUR FACILITY.  EMERGENCY SHUT-OFFS, POWER AND PLUMBING CODES ARE LOOKED AT.  AT THIS TIME WE DISCUSS OUR EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM AND HOW THE EMERGENCY SERVICES FIT INTO OUR PROGRAM.\n  IN THE FUTURE WE WILL CONTIUE TO PROVIDE TRAINING ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND CONTINUE TO WORK WITH EMERGENCY SERVICES.  IN THE FUTURE WE PLAN TO SETUP A MOCK ACCIDENT WITH EMERGENCY SERVICES.\n  OUR GOAL IS TO REMAIN ACCIDENT FREE AND PROVIDE A SAFE ENVIRONMENT."
