Given the quantity handled, anhydrous ammonia is considered a hazardous substance by EPA.  Many of the properties that make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also requires that precautions and procedures be in place to protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical emergency.  It is the policy of APS Seafoods to be in compliance with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.    \n\n\n\nSafety at our facility is inherent on the manner in which anhydrous ammonia is handled.  While the design of the facility incorporates a multitude of safety devices, safe handling procedures combined with appropriate training of our personnel are key aspects to maintaining safety at our facility.\n\n\n\nWe have a written Process Safety Management (PSM) plan that complies with the regulations stipulated by OAR 1910.119.  A crucial component of this plan is the Emergency Action Plan, developed in compliance with the emergency planning provisions of OAR 437-002-0042. This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events.  \n\n\n\n1.20    Facility Description And Substances Handled\n\n\n\n?    APS Seafood is a manufacturing facility that packages and freezes seafood.  Production requires the use of a refrigeration system to preserve the integrity of the fish.  This refrigeration process uses ammonia as a refrigerant.  Access to the facility is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, and contractors.\n\n?    The regulated substance handled at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.\n\n?    The ammonia refrigeration system maximum inventory is 20,300 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  There is no standby make-up inventory kept on-site.\n\n\n\n1.30    The worst-case release scenario("

Offsite receptors were defined using ESRI ArcMap 10.1.  This system estimates residential population within the circle defined by the endpoint of the worst-case and alternative release scenarios.  In addition, it lists whether certain types of public receptors and environmental receptors are within the circles.\n\n\n\n1.40    General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nAPS Seafoods complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  The design and construction of this facility was in accordance with published standards, tests or recommended methods of trade, industry or governmental organizations.  \n\n\n\nAPS Seafoods' written PSM plan incorporates many policies and procedures to ensure safe operation and maintenance of this facility.  Plan elements essential to safe operation of the refrigeration system include employee participation, process hazard information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, contractor safety, pre-startup safety review, mechanical integrity, management of change, hot-work permits, incident investigation, emergency response and planning, and compliance audits.  This plan will be reviewed periodically and updated as necessary by the APS Seafoods Plant Engineer. \n\n\n\nTraining is provided to ensure that each employee involved in operating a process has been trained in an overview of the process, the operating procedures, and safety considerations.  This training uses guidelines developed by the Refrigeration Engineers Technology Association (RETA).  Only qualified maintenance personnel operate and interact with the refrigerat"

Startup, shutdown, and any onstream adjustments are handled by these qualified persons.  \n\n\n\n1.50    Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere has been no significant release of ammonia at APS Seafoods in the past five years.\n\n\n\n1.60    Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nAPS Seafoods has a written Emergency Action Plan to ensure that precautions and procedures are in place to protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical emergency.  It complies with the provisions of OR-OSHA Emergency Planning regulations, OAR 437-002-0042.  This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events.  This plan has been reviewed with the Astoria Fire Department.\n\n\n\nThe approach in the development of this plan has been to identify the ammonia emergencies most likely to occur at APS Seafoods and establish precautions and procedures to protect life safety and health during an emergency.  The refrigeration process has back-up prevention systems to keep processing malfunctions from becoming ammonia release emergencies.  If an emergency does occur, the following response personnel, facilities, and equipment are in place:\n\n\n\n?    Emergency Alarm and Communication System\n\n?    Safe Rooms, Evacuation Plans, and Assembly Points\n\n?    Personal Protective Equipment\n\n\n\nThe role and procedures for obtaining external emergency assistance have been formally established with the Astoria Fire Department.  \n\n\n\nAll APS Seafoods personnel will be trained to fulfill their designated responsibilities in an emergency.  \n\n\n\nThis plan will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary by the APS Seafoods Plant Engineer.\n\n\n\n1.70    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nAny upgrades or extensive maintenance work performed in the future will be in compliance with those standards applicable at that time.  \n\n\n\nA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) has been comple"
