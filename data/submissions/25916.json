      "SummaryText": "1.1    Process Description\nMonrovia Nursery Company is a commercial plant nursery located in Azusa, California.  The nursery uses large quantities of water to irrigate their plants and therefore operates an irrigation water treatment plant on-site.  The irrigation water treatment plant uses chlorine gas in two separate systems to kill bacteria and pathogens in the water and aqueous ammonia to regulate the pH of the water in the water treatment process.  The two chlorination systems are: the main chlorination system, which uses three one-ton containers, and the potting shed chlorination system, which uses smaller 135 lb cylinders of chlorine.  Monrovia also uses methyl bromide gas at the facility to fumigate soil to kill pathogens and bacteria in the soil before it is used in the plant potting mix.  Because Monrovia stores more than the threshold quantities of chlorine gas, aqueous ammonia, and methyl bromide gas specified in California Code of Regulations Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, Table 1, the facility is subject to California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program Risk Management Program (RMP) requirements for chlorine gas, aqueous ammonia, and methyl bromide.  The maximum storage quantities of regulated chemicals at Monrovia Nursery are the following: chlorine gas - 6,000 pounds in one-ton containers and 1,350 pounds in 135-pound cylinders; methyl bromide gas - 1,000 pounds; aqueous ammonia - 9,500 gallons.  In addition, Monrovia is subject to Federal ?Process Safety Management? (PSM) (29 CFR 1910.119) for chlorine gas.  The facility is not subject to federal PSM for methyl bromide gas because Monrovia stores less than the threshold quantity (TQ) of 2,500 pounds onsite.  The facility is also not subject to federal PSM for ammonia because the aqueous ammonia solution employed at Monrovia contains less than 44% ammonia.  \n\nBecause the worst-case release scenarios for the CalARP chemicals will impact offsite receptors, a Program 2 RMP at minimum would b"

A CalARP Program 3 is required for the processes handling chlorine because the facility is subject to federal PSM for this substance.  According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) General Guidance for Risk Management Programs (EPA 550-B-00-008 page 16, May 2000), if a facility has processes subject to different program levels, it may choose to adopt the most stringent applicable level requirements for all covered processes.  Because the only differences between Program 2 and 3 are facility-wide programmatic elements , Monrovia is effectively performing a Program 3 RMP for all three chemicals.  Program 3 RMPs require more extensive development of facility prevention program procedures and supporting documents.  Monrovia?s accidental release and emergency response policies are discussed in sections 1.3 and 1.4, Per H&SC ? 2745.3(a).\n\n1.2    Summary of Major Hazards\nThe primary hazards associated with the irrigation water treatment systems at Monrovia are potential releases of chlorine gas and aqueous ammonia vapors.  The primary hazard associated with the soil fumigation system is a potential release of methyl bromide gas.  The possible causes of releases include damage to the gas cylinders or the liquid storage tank, failure of valves or instruments, failure of piping or tubing, pump failure, storage tank leakage, or failure of equipment used for storage tank filling.  \n\n1.3    Release Prevention Program\nMonrovia Nursery Company?s RMP/PSM program contains a Prevention Program that focuses on prevention of releases.  The Prevention Program includes the use of appropriate equipment design standards, safety valves and instruments, written operating procedures, employee and contractor training, regular equipment inspection and maintenance, and periodic program auditing to reduce the likelihood of regulated material releases.  \n\nThe Monrovia Nursery water chlorination systems all employ educto"

This eliminates the potential for a chlorine gas release due to line rupture or leakage because once the vacuum is broken, the flow of chlorine gas stops.  \n\nThe soil fumigation process is attended at all times during methyl bromide gas application to the soil by two Monrovia personnel each equipped with a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA).  In the event that a leak should occur, the attending personnel can shut off the cylinder to mitigate the release.\n\nThe aqueous ammonia storage tank is equipped with a pressure relief valve and an overflow line that drains to an overflow collection system.  The storage tank inlet pipeline is equipped with a quick-release CAM-lock valve to reduce the chance of an aqueous ammonia spill during filling of the tank.  \n\nThe facility has implemented administrative controls and procedures to aid in the prevention of releases from the operation of the water chlorination systems and the soil fumigation system.  Personnel operating and maintaining these systems undergo regular training.  Written operating procedures are used to standardize the procedures for startup, normal operation, normal shutdown, and emergency shutdown.  Cylinder delivery and liquid storage tank loading are conducted by contract truck drivers who are monitored by trained Monrovia Nursery personnel.  The facility conducts regular planned inspection and preventative maintenance of all equipment handling regulated substances. \n\n1.4    Release Detection and Emergency Response\nReleases that may occur in the water chlorination stations near the Fresh Canal Water Reservoir are detected through a system of three (3) chlorine gas detectors located in close proximity to the chlorination stations.  These detectors set off alarms when a chlorine release is detected, prompting Monrovia personnel to contact the Los Angeles County Fire Department.  There "

As a result of the preliminary review and improvement of safety systems at the facility, capital improvements will be made to the aqueous ammonia storage tank area, including bolting the storage tank to the concrete slab upon which it is installed.  Improvements will also be made in the delivery of chlorine cylinders to the potting shed water chlorination shed by constructing a new cylinder transportation rack to improve the stability of the cylinders during transport from the storage area to the chlorination shed.\n \n1.6    Consequences of Failure to Control the Hazards\nThe consequences of failure to control the hazards presented by the regulated materials present at the facility have been evaluated under a worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario.  \nFor the main water chlorination system, the worst-case release scenario assumes that the entire contents of one one-ton container are released within 10 minutes, per USEPA guidance (USEPA General Guidance for Risk Management Programs, EPA 550-B-00-008, May 2000).

In addition, the chlorine is liquefied by pressure and it is highly unlikely that the entire contents would be able to evaporate in 10 minutes unless in the event of a severe fire directly in contact with the wall of the container.  An alternative release scenario has been analyzed which assumes that a transfer line develops a leak at the same time as the chlorine regulator fails.  The chlorine regulator is designed to only deliver chlorine under vacuum and once that vacuum is broken, no release would occur through a leak in the transfer line.  It is conservatively assumed for the alternate scenario that this release would go undetected for approximately 1 hour.  Under this alternative release scenario, the chlorine release would result in an exposure to chlorine at concentrations above 0.0087 milligrams per liter for all receptors within 0.3 miles from the release point.  This alternate scenario of both the regulator and the transfer line failing at the same time is also highly unlikely.  For the potting shed water chlorination system, the worst-case release scenario assumes that the entire contents of one cylinder are released within 10 minutes, per USEPA guidance (USEPA General Guidance for Risk Management Programs, EPA 550-B-00-008, May 2000).

Under this alternative release scenario, the chlorine release would result in an exposure to chlorine at concentrations above 0.0087 milligrams per liter for all receptors within 0.2 miles from the release point.\n\nTo prevent accidental release of chlorine gas from the main water chlorination system, the potting shed water chlorination system, and to limit the reported distances for each release scenario, administrative controls and mitigation measures have been applied to these systems.  The chlorine supply pipelines run from the tanks and cylinders to the pumps or water supply.  The venturi action of the water movement creates a vacuum, allowing the chlorine to move from the tank into the pipelines.  Any leaks in the line will break the vacuum, thus stopping the flow of chlorine.  The regulator at the tank is another potential source for a leak, however, since the tanks are located outdoors and away from any combustion sources that could cause fires and resulting overpressure, there is no immediate danger.  In addition, each chlorine-assigned area has a monitor/alarm to indicate any leaks.  Employees are trained to visually recognize the chlorine clouds from a potential release.  All these measures are helpful to prevent severe release accidents.\n\nFor the methyl bromide soil fumigation system, the worst-case release scenario assumes that the entire contents of one cylinder are released within 10 minutes, per USEPA guidance (USEPA General Guidance for Risk Management Programs, EPA 550-B-00-008, May 2000).

In addition to the isolated location of the tank and the measures to prevent pressure buildup, there is a drainage channel leading to a sedimentation basin.  The released aqueous ammonia will flow into the drainage during larger releases, which will limit the affected area. \n\nThe Monrovia Nursery facility in Azusa, California has developed a Program 3 Prevention Program for the RMP.
