      "SummaryText": "vironmental Protection Agency (EPA).  Under EPA guidelines, facilities that handle certain quantities of regulated chemicals must submit plans that show the consequences of hypothetical chemical releases.  Facilities must also outline their measures to reduce the risk of releases and minimize their effects.\n\nSeveral processes at the site are regulated by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements listed in 29 CFR Part 1910.119.  PSM and RMP complement each other in that PSM is concerned about the employee and RMP is concerned about the public and the environment.  The LANXESS Bushy Park site is in full compliance with the PSM requirements.  \n\nIII. RMP REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nTwo LANXESS process areas in compliance with PSM requirements must meet the requirements for the Risk Management Program listed in 40 CFR Part 68.  This plan includes LANXESS's ammonia refrigeration system and the cyclohexylamine storage.   Ammonia is liquefied gas under pressure and cyclohexylamine is a liquid.  Each is regulated as a toxic substance.  The LANXESS site does not have any flammables that require inclusion in the Risk Management Plan.\n\nLANXESS uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in the plant-wide refrigeration system.  Ammonia is a colorless gas with a strong pungent odor.  Exposure to ammonia can irritate the eyes, nose and throat.  Exposure to extremely high levels can result in a buildup of fluid in the lungs and can be life threatening.\n\nLANXESS uses cyclohexylamine primarily to manufacture an additive used in the rubber industry.  A small amount is also used for water treatment in the plant boilers.  Cyclohexylamine is a colorless liquid with an ammonia-like odor.  Exposure to cyclohexylamine can cause irritation of the respiratory system.  Exposure to extremely high levels can result in a buildup of fluid in the lungs and can be life threatening.\n\nIV.

Some examples of our preparation and training include:\n\n+ Written procedures to handle all types of emergencies.\n+ Regularly scheduled safety training for operators and maintenance personnel responsible for the regulated substance system.\n+ Trained and experienced on-site emergency response teams ( Fire & Rescue, EMT's, and Hazmat ).\n+ Emergency planning with the local fire department and county emergency preparedness personnel.\n+ Planning and training with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and participation in annual drills.\n+ Routine testing of plant emergency response, alerting, and communications systems.\n+ Fully equipped emergency response vehicles (fire truck, ambulance, and hazmat truck).\n+ Emergency response personnel trained annually at nationally recognized schools.\n+ Certified Hazmat Team to respond to off-site transportation and distribution incidents.\n\nVII.

IMPROVING SAFETY PERFORMANCE\n\nLANXESS has a continuing commitment to improving safety performance in all areas of concern."

The release impact distance is the distance down wind to the ERPG2-LOC concentration.  The ERPG2-LOC for ammonia is 200 parts per  million (ppm). \n\nThe Extremely Hazardous Substance Level Of Concern (EHS-LOC) is the airborne concentration 10 times safer than the concentration (estimated from toxicity data) that is immediately dangerous to life and health.  The release impact distance is the distance down wind to the EHS-LOC concentration.  The EHS-LOC for cyclohexylamine is 39 parts per million (ppm).\n\nAll scenarios evaluated used EPA's published model, RMPComp, to provide toxic end-point determinations based on an EPA published level of concern (LOC).  Other models did not provide satisfactory estimates for use in evaluating the maximum end-point distance.  Public and environmental protection requires conservative results.  Both substances were evaluated for the alternate scenario and the information is included in the plan.  \n\nMore-Likely Scenarios\n\nThe alternative scenario is a hypothetical release that is more realistic than the worst-case scenario.  In this scenario, safety and emergency systems operate as expected, and plant personnel respond to take action to control and stop the release\n\nAmmonia scenario assumptions:\n\n+ Partial failure of the piping system containing ammonia liquid under pressure. \n+ Detection of ammonia by instruments or personnel in the area, shutdown of the ammonia supply equipment by remote control, and closure of valves by site personnel to stop the leak.\n+ Release du"

FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nDuring the past five years, LANXESS has not experienced any release of ammonia or cyclohexylamine that requires listing in the RMP information we are submitting.  \n\nVI. EMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\nIncident and Emergency Guidelines\n\nLANXESS has multiple safeguards in place to ensure safe handling of ammonia and cyclohexylamine to prevent releases of these substances.  Our facility is prepared to handle emergencies such as hurricanes and tornadoes as well as chemical releases.  In the unlikely event a release occurs, we work to contain the release quickly and to minimize its impact on plant personnel and neighbors.  If a release occurs:\n\n+ Equipment that supplies the regulated substance would be shut down quickly by remote control.\n+ The plant alarm would be sounded and the emergency communicated to plant personnel over the emergency alert system.\n+ Trained on-site emergency response teams would be activated and take prompt action to control and stop the release. \n+ Emergency response personnel would evaluate the extent and impact of the release\n+ If the release would have potential off-site impact, or outside assistance needed, local and county emergency response personnel would be notified and activated.\n+ Neighbors in the immediate area that might be affected would be notified and advised to take appropriate action.\n+ If necessary, LANXESS specialists would be activated to perform computer modeling to estimate the area affected by the release. \n+ If needed, the site has immediate access to emergency resources an"
