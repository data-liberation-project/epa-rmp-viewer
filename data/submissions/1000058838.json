The plan also designates the type and frequency of training that employees are required to have depending on their responsibilities. Furthermore, the plan commits the company's management team to devote the necessary resources to prepare, implement and audit the ERP.\r\n\r\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\r\nRigorous training, drills, audits, cooperati"
