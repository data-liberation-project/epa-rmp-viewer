ACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION & EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:  We at Ulrich Chemical, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety and protection.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance and employee training associated with the processes at this facility.  It is our goal and objective to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If an accidental release were to occur, Ulrich has coordinated emergency response activities with the Marion County Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Warren Township Fire Department.\n\n2.  THE STATIONARY SOURCE & THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:  Ulrich?s primary activities encompass chemical repackaging, warehousing and distribution.  Currently, there are eight regulated substances present at this facility that exceed the Threshold Quantity (TQ) as defined within 40 CFR 68.130 and three regulated substances that have the potential to exceed the established (TQ's). \n\n3.  THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:  Our facility has taken necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements as set forth under 40 CFR Part 68.  In addition, all eleven regulated substances are also subject to OSHA?s Process Safety Management regulation as set forth under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of our release prevention program that are currently in place at this facility.\n\na).  Process Safety Information:  Ulrich Chemical, Inc. maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all regulated processes.\n\nb).

The PHA's are completed by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations.  PHA's are reviewed prior to the implementation of any process change that involves the regulated substance; immediately following an accidental release or if an incident has occurred that could have resulted in an accidental release.  At a minimum, PHA's are revalidation every five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  \n\nc).  Operating Procedures:  For the purpose of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Ulrich Chemical, Inc. maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdowns, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup following a turnaround.  Operating procedures are regularly evaluated and are accessible to all applicable employees involved within each regulated process.\n\nd).  Training:  Ulrich Chemical Inc. has a comprehensive training program to ensure that employees are competent in the operating and safety procedures associated with the each regulated process. New employees receive basic training in process operations and safety procedures, followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided whenever there has been a change in the process or at a minimum once every 2 years.\n\ne).  Mechanical Integrity:  Ulrich Chemical Inc. conducts inspections and maintenance on process equipment to ensure on-going equipment integrity.  Qualified personnel receive specialized training to ensure that process equipment is properly inspected and maintained.  Any equipment deficiencies are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nf).

These reviews are conducted to verify that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup of the process.\n\nh).  Compliance Audits:  Ulrich Chemical Inc. conducts compliance audits to determine whether the provisions, as set forth under the RMP regulation, are being adhered to at this facility.  These audits are conducted at least every three years as required per this regulation.  Corrective action, resulting from the audit, will be implemented in a safe and prompt manner.\n\ni).  Incident Investigation:  Ulrich Chemical Inc. will investigate any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the mitigating circumstances surrounding the incident, as well as, to identify any corrective actions that need implemented to prevent such incident from reoccurring.  All incident investigations are retained for a minimum of five years as required per this regulation.\n\nj).

In the last five years, Ulrich has had only one minor release involving an RMP regulated chemical.\n\n5.  Emergency Response Plan:  Ulrich Chemical, Inc. has developed a written emergency response plan to address the potential for accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including spill response and cleanup, first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public.  This plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes that have taken place within our facility.  Our emergency response plan has been coordinated and verified with the Marion County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Warren Township Fire Department. \n\n6.
