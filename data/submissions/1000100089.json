This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our employees are trained to follow the Emergency Response Plan and to evacuate the facility as necessary. We are also coordinated with the Barron County LEPC which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\n2.  FACILITY INFORMATION & REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Saputo  - Almena facility is located at 1052 6TH ST Almena Wisconsin. The plant's primary products Blue Cheese and Hard Cheese products. The facility employs approximately 200 full-time employees. There is one RMP-regulated substance, anhydrous ammonia, used in the plant's refrigeration system to provide refrigeration for processing and cold storage of cheese products. There is a total of 12,999 lbs. of ammonia in the system.\n\n\n\n3.  GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE & CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION\n\nThe Saputo  - Almena Plant follows the 14 elements of the OSHA Process Safety Management program as a release prevention program for RMP. In addition, Saputo Corporate  - Department of Refrigeration Services works with the plant confirming regulatory and corporate standards are being followed, providing guidance and standardization on the RMP and OSHA PSM programs and acting as a resource for the plant on the RMP, PSM and other environmental programs.\n\n\n\n4.  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nSaputo - Almena has had a good record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years.  Due to our release prevention policies, no incidents, as defined by the RMP rule, have occurred in the past five years"

      "SummaryText": ".\n\n\n\n5.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nSaputo - Almena   developed an Emergency Response Plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials as well as other emergency events that might occur at the plant. The purpose of Saputo's Emergency Response Plan is to ensure employees know and understand what to do in the event of an emergency to minimize injuries and property damage. The plan includes various aspects of an emergency including adequate first aid, evacuations, and notification of local emergency response agencies. Specific employees are trained and certified as medical responders. Employees are trained in evacuation, hazard communication, and chemical safety. In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect pertinent changes.\n\n\n\n6.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program. Recommendations resulting from the PHA, compliance audits and mechanical integrity inspections will be addressed in a timely manner. In addition, regular interaction with Saputo Corporate - Department of Refrigeration Services, Health & Safety, Risk Group and Department of Environmental affairs will improve compliance and overall plant safety.\n\n"
