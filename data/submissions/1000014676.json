      "SummaryText": "Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990 mandated the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to promulgate regulations to minimize the risk of accidental chemical releases.  EPA responded by publishing its Risk Management Program (RMP) rule on June 20, 1996.  The rule, codified at 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68, requires subject facilities to formulate and implement measures to reduce the risk of an accidental chemical release.  Facilities are subject to the RMP rule if they have processes utilizing greater than a specified threshold quantity (TQ) of at least one of 77 air toxic or 63 flammable chemicals.\n\nSubject facilities are required to develop and implement a RMP and submit a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) to regulatory authorities. The RMPlan serves as a summary document of the RMP for all covered processes at the facility, and information submitted in the RMPlan will be made available for public viewing.  In accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 68.190(b), this document is a resubmission of the previous RMPlan submitted to EPA in 2009.\n\nFort Bragg is known primarily as the Home of the Airborne and Special Operations Forces and is home to the 82nd Airborne Division, the XVIII Airborne Corps, and Special Operations Command.  Fort Bragg is located in the southeast portion of North Carolina in Cumberland, Hoke, Harnett, Moore, Richland, and Scotland Counties.  The XVIII Airborne Corps and Fort Bragg has one process that utilizes chemicals in excess of its specified TQ.  This process involves chlorine storage, handling, and use at the Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP).  The Water Treatment Plant (WTP), previously subject to RMP requirements, was closed on March 31, 2010 and is no longer subject to the RMP requirements.\n\nBased on criteria outlined at 40 CFR 68.10, Fort Bragg has developed and implemented a Program Level 3 RMP compliant with EPA requirements for this process.  In the fall of 2006, American Water Services,"

However, the XVIII Airborne Corps and Fort Bragg have retained ownership of the plants and associated equipment.  The RMP for the WTP and WWTP was adopted by American Water Services on December 28, 2006.  The WTP is no longer subject to RMP requirements; however, the WWTP still has a process that utilizes chemicals in excess of its specified TQ and is still subject to RMP requirements.\n\nA worst-case release analysis and an alternative release analysis were performed using RMPComp, Version 1.07.  Results of the worst-case analyses indicate that the area of concern would be a 1.3 mile radius emanating from the WTP and WWTP, potentially impacting 2,900 and 4,800 people, respectively.  Results of the alternative release scenarios indicate that the area of concern would be a 0.2 mile radius emanating from the WTP and WWTP, potentially impacting 20 and 8 people, respectively.\n\nAs part of the Hazard Assessment, the five-year history of all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage, must be included.  Interviews with personnel at the WTP, WWTP, Environmental Compliance Branch, and Fire Department indicate that there have been four incidents in the past five years that occurred at the WTP.  These incidents occurred on 16 March 2005, 13 February 2007, 14 February 2007, and 6 April 2007, and did not result in any significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths or injuries.  As the WTP is no longer subject to RMP requirements, effective March 31, 2010, these incidents have been removed from the RMP.  The WWTP is still subject to RMP requirements; however, there have been no incidents at this facility within the past 5 years. \n\nThe Risk Management Program at Fort Bragg has developed and implemented a comprehen"
