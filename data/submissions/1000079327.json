The properties that make anhydrous ammonia a valuable fertilizer source also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling it.  It is the policy of the Cooperative and its employees to adhere to all of the Federal and state rules and regulations, so as to prevent unnecessary human exposure and to reduce the threat to the community.  Safety depends upon the competent training of our personnel, the manner in which we handle anhydrous ammonia and the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility.\r\n\r\nThe stationary source and regulated substance handled: Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application to the soil as a crop production nutrient.\r\n\r\nThe worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenarios: This facility has developed a worst-case and alternative-case scenario however it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as security-sensitive information as requested by EPA.\r\n\r\nThe general accidental release prevention program:  This facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, with OSHA's requirements and with other applicable Federal and state codes, standards and regulations.  The facility design and construction are in accordance with the ANSI/CGA G-2.1 and the OSHA 1910.111 standards.  It is formally inspected a minimum of once a year for compliance to all applicable standards by an out-of-house person.  Corrective and routine maintenance is performed at the facility to maintain compliance with the appropriate standards.  Employees of the fertilizer department at the cooperative receive training to meet Federal and state requirements to handle hazardous materials along with additional training using industry training programs and schools.\r\n\r\nFive-year accident history:  This site has not experienced"

Emergency response preplanning is conducted with the local fire department and Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  Emergency planning and community right-to-know information is provided to the state emergency response commission, local emergency planning committee and local fire department as required by SARA Title III of EPCRA.\r\nAn Emergency Action Plan is in place for the facility and employees are also familiar with the North American Emergency Response Guidebook.  \r\n\r\nPlanned changes to improve safety:  This facility utilizes ANSI/CGA G-2.1-2014 and OSHA standards as guidelines for the safe storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  At this time there are no further plans to modify or change the facility."
