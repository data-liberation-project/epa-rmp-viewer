      "SummaryText": "\n\nSynopsis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios:\n\nThe hazard assessment element of the RMP rule requires the evaluation of potential off-site effects of ?worst-case? and ? alternative? release scenarios of regulated substances.\n\nThe EPA has defined a ?worst-case? scenario as the release of the largest quantity of a listed chemical from a vessel or process line failure, taking into account passive mitigation and administrative controls.  The impact of these potential releases must be quantified in accordance with release criteria dictated in the rule.  The projected impact distance is determined using EPA-defined atmospheric conditions and is intended to provide a conservative estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected.  According to the EPA, the ?worst-case? scenario is intended to ensure that no potential risks to public health are overlooked, but the distance to an endpoint estimated under ?worst-case? should not be considered a ?public danger zone?.  Possible causes or the extreme improbability that such releases may occur are not considered.\n\nThe alternative release scenario definition is a release that is more likely to occur than the ?worst-case? release; however, as with the ?worst-case?, the alternative release improbability is not taken into consideration.\n\nWorst-Case Toxic Release ? Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nAmmonia is a colorless gas with a strong pungent odor and is one of the most widely used industrial chemicals.  It is prepared industrially from natural gas, steam and air.  Some of this ammonia is used for direct injection into croplands as a fertilizer.  A large amount of industrial ammonia is reacted with carbon dioxide to make urea fertilizer, or reacted to make ammonium nitrate fertilizer.  Ammonia is also frequently used as a refrigerant for the storage of perishable foods.\n\nAmmonia vapors can be irritating to the nose, throat, eyes and skin.  Direct liquid contact to the skin can cause severe burns.\n\nKNC has considered pote"

As required by the rule, the ?worst-case? release assumes that this entire quantity is released as a result of a catastrophic failure of the tank and subsequently evaporates from the diked pool.  This unlikely event was modeled with a publicly available model (DEGADIS) and the resulting end point distance is expected to be conservative.  The impact of this release scenario is predicted to extend beyond the facility boundary and impact public receptors.  \n\nWe believe this scenario is a hypothetical ?worst-case? event dictated by the rule and extremely unlikely to occur for many reasons.  In addition to the stringent design controls for this type of storage vessel, facility maintenance and inspection programs address the integrity of process and storage vessels, including this one, and largely preclude such massive and unlikely failures.\n\nAlternative Toxic Release ? Ammonia\n\nMore likely release events than the hypothetical ?worst-case? tend to concentrate in areas where the ammonia product is handled, such as loading, refrigeration area and other transport activities. Generally, significantly lower quantities are involved due to numerous shutdown safeguards present throughout the terminal.  Operator intervention tends to mitigate and limit the consequences of failures.\n\nThe hypothetical ammonia alternative release scenario considered for this process is release of ammonia due to the failure of a liquid relief valve on the product heater.  The valve is assumed to fail and release ammonia for 1 minute before employee intervention stops the release.  The impact of such a release was modeled with a publicly available model (DEGADIS), which shows that the impact of the release would extend off-site under typical a"

As a result, changes relevant to safety occur continuously as needs are identified through these procedures and policies."
