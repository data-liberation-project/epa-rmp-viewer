In addition, the plant stores a large variety of refrigerated food and drink products for distribution to consumer outlets along with the products produced at the plant.\n\nThe facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant to maintain the proper temperature of dairy and other refrigerated food and beverage products.  Anhydrous ammonia is an effective refrigerant that has been used for many years by most food processing facilities.  Ammonia is normally a gas at ambient temperatures but is handled as a gas liquefied under pressure.  The refrigeration system consists of a high-pressure receiver, evaporators, compressors, accumulators, condensers, piping, and valves.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies: Dean Food Company of Indiana is committed to promoting safety for the plant, its employees and the surrounding area.  The facility is complying with OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management Standard (PSM), Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations, (CFR) 1910.119, and EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Program Regulations (RMP), Title 40 CFR Part 68.  The purpose of these programs is to ensure that the refrigeration system is operated safely in order to prevent releases of ammonia from the system.  In addition, these programs serve to develop procedures to minimize releases in the event that they do occur and to outline appropriate emergency response steps to take in the event of a release.\n\nAccidental Releases Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps: As a part of its PSM Program, Dean Foods Company of Indiana, Inc. has established numerous programs that serve to prevent accidental releases of ammonia.  These programs include:\n\nProcess safety information\nOperating procedures\nTraining (both system operators and general employees)\nMechanical integrity\nManagement of change pro"

The purpose of the Plan is to develop a course of action for all employees in the event of an emergency.  The Plan applies to all Dean Foods Company of Indiana, Inc. Rochester Plant employees and all vendors, visitors and contractors who have access to the facility.  The primary responsibility for the development, implementation and maintenance of the emergency response program belongs to the Environmental Health and Safety Coordinator.  The plant runs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, requiring a total of seven primary or assistant Emergency Response Coordinators who would be responsible for initiating action in the event of an emergency.\n\nThe plan does not allow site personnel to respond to a major ammonia or other chemical release or fire.  The Rochester Fire Department will respond to all fires and cleaning chemical releases and would be responsible for any emergency rescue operations.  For major ammonia releases, Certified Services, Inc.; phone number 877-306-8600 based in Winamac Indiana will be contacted.  They will be responsible for any entry attempts and controlling the scene.\n\nFive Year Accident History: Dean Foods Company of Indiana, Inc. has had no reportable accidents in the past five years.\n\nSteps to Improve Safety: Dean Foods Company of Indiana, Inc. is committed to continuous improvement of our policies, procedures, and facility.  Specifically, the ammonia system is continually being reviewed during daily inspections, Standard Operating Procedure review, Mechanical Integrity Inspection, Compliance Audits and the Process Hazard Analysis program.  All potential issues discovered during these reviews are investigated and improvements made as warranted.  New technology, new training topics and techniques, and u"
