There are an additional 4 to 6 150 lb cylinders present as emergency backup.  The process operation room, equipment, fittings and meters are checked each morning, and monitored several times over the course of the day.  Operators are routinely trained on proper use procedures associated with the chlorine delivery system, and on emergency response procedures.  Local agencies, including Fire and Police, have participated in periodic reviews of operations, and response requirements and procedures.  The potential need for public evacuation has been discussed and planned for."
