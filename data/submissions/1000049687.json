      "SummaryText": "Southern Power Company's Plant Franklin consists of three combined cycle units, each equipped with a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system for control of NOx emissions. As part of the system, vaporous ammonia is injected into the flue gas that aids in the chemical reaction to convert NOx to Nitrogen and water vapor.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored on the plant site for use in the SCR system. The ammonia is stored in three identical but not connected tanks, one for each SCR system.   The storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia is the process at Plant Franklin that is subject to RMP regulations.\r\n\r\nThe main hazard associated with the anhydrous ammonia system at Plant Franklin is a toxic hazard.  Based on EPA guidelines, the worst case scenario is the catastrophic failure of one of the three 15,300 gallon (80,325 lbs) ammonia storage tanks.  Such a release would result in ammonia gas traveling approximately 3.3 miles before reaching its endpoint.  However, this type of failure is extremely unlikely due to the safeguards described in the prevention program. \r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario is considered to be due to a failure in a drain valve leading to a release.  In this scenario, ammonia gas would travel approximately 0.2 miles before reaching its endpoint. There are numerous mechanical and procedural safeguards at the plant to prevent this from occuring.  \r\n\r\nPlant Franklin has in place an emergency action plan that includes procedures to be followed in the event of an accidental release of ammonia.  The procedures cover the following:  evacuation plan; recognizing emergencies; emergency action procedures; coordinating personnel; first aid procedures; notifying the public and local emergency response agencies; emergency response contacts; emergency response equipment; reportable release quantities and documenting releases; emergency alarm system; training; and pre-emergency coordination with local first responders. In addition, an outside emergency response"
