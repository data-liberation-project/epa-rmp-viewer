The Miami-Dade Water and Sewer Department (MDWASD) North District Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) also uses chlorine (for chlorination) for disinfecting treated wastewater to provide safe water discharges to the environment.  Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations.  The North District WWTP takes safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as it takes care in providing the environment safe disinfected water.\n\nThe North District WWTP chlorine handling process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule.  This regulation requires submission of a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  An integral part of the RMP is a summary of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility, including a description of the possible consequences in case of an accident and the actions, which will be taken, by the facility in an event of an emergency.\n\nThe following information is specifically required in the RMP Executive Summary:\n\n          -  Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\n          - General facility and regulated substances information.\n\n          - Summary of the accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n\n          - Five-year accident history summary.\n\n          - Emergency response program summary.\n\n          - Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nThe above information for the North District WWTP chlorination system is provided below.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe MDWASD accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, trains staff in operation and maintenance practices, and uses tested and proven management system practices.

North District WWTP has prepared an Emergency Response Plan for Hazardous Materials to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\n\nThe MDWASD North District WWTP is located at 2575 NE 151 Street, in North Miami, Florida.  North District WWTP is bounded by Sunny Isles Boulevard on the north, the Oleta River on the east, North East 151 Street to the south, and Route 1 to the west.  The treatment plant has a rated capacity of 112 million gallons per day (mgd).  The facility currently stores and uses chlorine, a regulated toxic substance under the EPA rule.  Chlorine is delivered in one-ton containers to the North District WWTP chlorine building.  The chlorine building is divided into a storage room and chlorinator room.  The one-ton containers contain liquid chlorine under pressure.  The chlorine building is equipped to store up to 16 (containers) tons of chlorine.  An estimated 6,400 pounds of chlorine is used per day depending on the season of the year.  The maximum quantity of chlorine present at the North District WWTP at any given time exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the EPA rules.  It also exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standards.\n\nThe pressure from the container forces liquid chlorine through the tubing and into the manifold system.  Downstream of the manifold system, there is a pneumatically actuated automatic shut-off valve.  The valve will also close automatica"

At the evaporators, the liquid chlorine is heated and converted into chlorine gas.  The gas then flows from the evaporator through the temperature actuated control valve and the vacuum regulator to the chlorinator.  The chlorinators are used to control the feed rate of the chlorine gas.  The chlorinators are equipped with a gas rotameter and a v-notched orifice for controlling the feed rate.  Injection of the chlorine into the plant water produces the concentrated solution that flows through piping to various injections points in the treatment process.\n\nThe North District WWTP is also provided with a number of safety features to protect the employees and the surrounding community.  The three important safety features are (1) automatic shut-off valves, (2) chlorine leak detection and alarm system, and (3) emergency chlorine gas scrubber system.  The automatic shut-off valves are located immediately downstream of the chlorine containers.  Therefore, if a leak occurs anywhere in the system, (other than in the pigtail or the container itself) the chlorine source can be isolated and the flow of chlorine can be stopped.  The automatic shut-off valves are operated (closed) either automatically due to the detection of chlorine leak by the chlorine sensors or manually by pushing a switch.  Emergency shut-off switches are located inside the chlorine storage room and in the chlorinator room.\n\nThe leak detection system consists of chlorine gas sensors located in both the chlorinator room and the storage room.  The leak detection system is set to activate the alarms and safety processes when a chlorine concentration of 0.5 ppm or higher is detected.  When the leak detection system detects a leak, audible and visual alarms (both local and in the control room) are activated and the automatic shut-off valves closed.  The tripped chlorine ala"

In the event of a leak, the scrubber will continue operating until manually turned off. The scrubber is designed to recirculate the air and chlorine gas until the chlorine has been neutralized.\n\nPerimeter fence and security gates surround the North District WWTP.  The plant operates three shifts with employees onsite 34 hours per day, 365 days per year.\n\nThe North District WWTP is provided with a backup emergency power generator that supplies power for the entire facility.\n\nSummary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nNorth District WWTP is in compliance with Federal and State Process Safety Management requirements.

This information includes chlorine background information and MSDS sheets.\n\nEquipment safety information was meticulously compiled on the chlorine process.  Specifications for chlorine process are collected and provided in one place for easy reference.  Details such as maximum intended inventory; safe upper and lower temperatures; safe upper and lower pressures; and codes and standards used to design, build, and operate the processes are on file at the facility.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nIn 1997, detailed Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was conducted for the chlorination system equipment and procedures.  To further assess the integrity of the chlorine system operation for the preparation of this RMP, a chlorine system checklist was used to assess the overall general condition of the chlorine system operation and maintenance, including human factors that affect personnel performance and system integrity.  The PHA was updated in 2004 and a list of recommended actions were developed to further improve the chlorine safety and staff is currently evaluating these recommendations.  Staff will document the completion of recommended actions.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nMDWASD North District WWTP has prepared written operating procedures that provide clear instructions or steps for safely conducting activities relating to the chlorination process.
