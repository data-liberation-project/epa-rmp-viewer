WESTCO was founded in 1942 and the Mirage Flats Anhydrous Ammonia Plant was built at the present location in 1977.\n\nFacility Policy:\n\nThe owner, management, and employees operating this facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of hazardous chemicals transported or stored at the facility. In the event that an accidental release should occur, we are prepared to work with our local fire departments, response personnel, and other appropriate authorities deemed applicable depending on the specific incident, to best mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nFacility Regulated Substance Information:\n\nThe primary activity of our company is retail sales to farm producers. The Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application by area farmers to farm fields. This product is subject to the EPA Risk Management Program and is the subject of this plan. \n\nAccidental Release Program:\n\nFor Anhydrous Ammonia, our accidental release program is based on guidelines found in the American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) standard K-61.1 Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard 29CFR 1910.111 for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia. WESTCO requires our employees to be trained in the handling of Anhydrous Ammonia prior to working with the product. We conduct annual employee training on the safe handling, transportation, and distribution of Anhydrous Ammonia. Training is done by classroom work, demonstration, and actual hands on training while being closely supervised.\n\nInstalled safety equipment includes but is not limited to: excess flow valves, break-away couplers at risers, barriers to avoid damage by trucks or other vehicles, an"

Employees are required to wear goggles and gloves while transferring Anhydrous Ammonia and each location also has two full-face respirators available in the case of an emergency.\n\nAnnually WESTCO inspects all of our Anhydrous Ammonia plants for the following:\n\n. Pop-off valves that protect against over filling \n. Excess flow valves that protect against a line break.  \n. Paint condition and signage on tank and lines.\n. Transfer hose condition and expiration dates.\n\nEach of our locations has an Emergency Coordinator who is responsible for the safety of our employees and deciding if an emergency requires the assistance of Emergency Professionals such as our local fire department.  Our facilities are included in the community emergency response plans and coordinated through the Local Emergency Planning Commission. We maintain routine contact with our local fire department and emergency response personnel.\n\nWorst-Case Scenario:\n\nThe worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of our largest Anhydrous Ammonia tank.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario:\n\nAs WESTCO has not had an actual release of Anhydrous Ammonia since the inception of this plant or accidents, we believe the most likely release would be caused by a failure in a transfer hose. Transfer hoses are protected by manual and self-closing excess flow valves. The alternative release scenario is based on the loss of contents from the largest hose used for off loading transportation equipment.\n\nThe worst case and alternative release scenarios were calculated using the EPA's RMP*Comp program and LandView 6 Census 2000 Population Estimator Software.\n\nFive-Year Accident History:\n\nWe have not had a release of Anhydrous Ammonia or accidents since the inception of this plant that has caused any death, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge have resulted in offside deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in p"

WESTCO has not had an actual release of Anhydrous Ammonia since the inception of this plant or accidents.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nThis facility is included in the written Community Emergency Response Plan as prepared by the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). We also include these materials in our own Emergency Action Plan in accordance with OSHA Standard 29CFR 1910.38. We provide State and Local authorities all Community Right-to-Know information requested as well as that required under SARA Title III (EPCRA). Our written employee safety programs include pre-emergency planning and employee training in accordance with OSHA standards, and are offered for review at any time by our LEPC to ensure that they conform to the community plans. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nSafety improvement, employee training, operating procedures, and equipment preventative maintenance are on-going processes at our facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess all aspects of this process. The only recommendation for this facility following the most recent Hazard Review is to consider building barracades around all Anhydrous Ammonia storage tanks before the end of the 2009 summer. There are no specific recommendations or changes in equipment, technology, or organizational structure scheduled for implementation at this time.\n\nSpecial Note Regarding Reporting Quantities:\nReporting quantities have increased from previous RMP submission due to the change in the way we were advised to report and calculate the quantities from our Regional EPA Agent. There has not been an actual physical increase in quantities. The 2009 RMP submission quantity under Section 1.17.c. includes bulk storage tanks plus portable nurse tanks whereas the 2004 RMP quantity for this section was only bulk storage. In addition, we were advised the correct conversion rate to use for NH3 is 4.6638 which takes into account an 85% fill level. With these"
