Fareva is dedicated to providing the resources necessary to assure, so far as possible, that every employee has a safe and healthful workplace.  Fareva also expects that all employees, contract employees and visitors commit to safety and follow all safety rules.\n\n\n\nIt is Fareva policy to ensure that adequate emergency response capabilities exist to handle an on-site emergency involving RMP-chemicals.  Fareva has developed an Emergency Response Plan for all emergency scenarios at the site that addresses how to respond in the event of a chemical release.  Fareva strives for prevention of chemical releases through employee training, equipment maintenance, and coordination with local emergency response agencies.\n\n&#8195;\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nFareva is located at 2248 Darbytown Road in Henrico, Virginia and operates a contract manufacturing facility for over-the-counter pharmaceuticals, health care products, and cosmetics.  Fareva has constructed a new operation for the manufacture of propellant-based health care products (aerosols).  As part of this manufacturing process, Fareva will be storing and utilizing flammable gases (i.e. propane, butane, isobutane, and other mixed gases associated with the aerosol propellants) that are subject to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions detailed at Section 112(r) of the 1990 Clean Air Act (RMP Regulations) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Regulations at 29 CFR 1910.119 (PSM regulations).\n\n\n\nAs part of the propellant-based health care products manufacturing process, Fareva manages several flammable gases subject to the RMP regulations and the OSHA PSM Regulations at 29 CFR 1910.119.

The processes include:\n\n\n\n(1) Flammable Gas Filling Operations including Flammable Gas Storage and Transfer (Storage & Use of Flammable Gases for manufacture of propellant-based health care products), and \n\n\n\n(2) Finished Product Goods Storage (Storage of aerosol cans containing flammable gases). \n\n \n\nThe RMP regulated chemicals associated with both processes are Flammable Gases (propane, butane, isobutane, and other mixed flammable gases associated with aerosol propellants).\n\n\n\nFlammable Gas Filling Operations including Flammable Gas Storage and Transfer:\n\n\n\nPropellants, including propane, butane, isobutane, and other flammable gas mixtures, are stored in four above-ground pressurized vessels ranging in size from 6,500 gallons (one tank) to 30,000 gallons (three tanks).  These tanks are stored outside of the aerosol manufacturing building, but are interconnected to the aerosol can gas-houses (filling stations).  Therefore, the propellant storage tanks and aerosol gas houses are considered a single process for purposes of RMP applicability.\n\n\n\nThe aerosol can filling operations include three can manufacturing lines: one bag-on-valve line, one rotary fill line, and one indexing fill line.  Each line generally consists of the following steps:  liquid content filling, can capping, propellant filling, actuator insertion, and packaging.  The liquid contents are filled into the cans within the aerosol can manufacturing operations building.  The cans are then capped and transferred via conveyor to the gas houses, which are located exterior to the manufacturing building.  Once in the gas houses, flammable (and non-flammable) propellants (transferred via hard piping from the propellant storage tanks) are filled into the cans and actuat"

The cans are then returned to the building where they are packaged for distribution.\n\n\n\nThe liquid contents of the cans contain no regulated RMP constituents.  In addition, the packaging lines within the building do not manage cans in sufficient quantity to exceed any regulatory thresholds for flammable gases and therefore, the aerosol packaging line is not considered part of an RMP processes.\n\n\n\nFinished Product Goods Storage:\n\n\n\nOnce the aerosol cans are packaged, they are palletized and transferred into the facility's warehouse area.  The warehouse area can store a maximum of 234 pallets of cans, containing 2,400 cans each.  Based on the maximum amount of propellant stored in each can, Fareva has determined that the Finished Product Goods Storage area is a regulated RMP process.  \n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nFareva's Flammable Gas Storage and Filling Operation is subject to the Program Level 3 requirements of RMP.  A main component of the RMP Program 3 requirements is the implementation of a Program 3 \"Prevention Program.\"  However, the RMP Program 3 Prevention Program requirements mirror the OSHA PSM requirements detailed at 29 CFR 1910.119.  Fareva has developed a PSM Policy Manual to implement the PSM requirements.  Therefore, the PSM Policy Manual includes all elements required under the RMP Program Level 3 Prevention Program detailed at Part 68, Subpart D (Sections 68.65 through 68.87).  The following paragraphs provide a listing of PSM Policies that are incorporated by reference to comply with the RMP Program 3 Prevention Program for the Flammable Gas Storage and Filling Operation.    The Finished Product Goods Storage area is subject to the Program Level 1 requirements of RMP and therefore, not required to comply with the Program 3 \"Prevention Program\" requirements.  However, the Storage area is subject to OSHA PSM"

PSI relating to chemical hazards is included in Safety Data Sheets (SDSs) that are maintained in readily-accessible locations for all employees.  PSI relating to process technology is indicated on process diagrams and is referenced in Operating Procedures and the Process Hazard Analysis.  PSI related to process equipment is located in process diagrams and equipment files maintained by the Engineering Department. \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nProcess Hazard Analyses (PHAs) have been conducted on the two regulated processes and will be conducted on each covered process every five years, or when a change in the process occurs.  The PHA for both of Fareva's covered processes was last conducted in February 2015.  PHAs are conducted by a team of knowledgeable individuals representing, at a minimum, operations, maintenance, engineering, and safety.  PHAs address the following items: (1) the hazards of the processes; (2) any previous events that had a likely potential for catastrophic release, (3) engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards, (4) consequences of failure of those controls, (5) facility siting, (6) human factors, and (7) a qualitative evaluation of the possible safety and health effects on employees.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nWritten operating procedures for each part of the covered processes are maintained by the Engineering Department.  Operating procedures are required to provide step-by-step instructions for each part of the covered processes during: (1) initial startup, (2) normal operation, (3) temporary operation, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) emergency operation, (6) normal shutdown, and (7) start-up following turnaround or emergency shutdown.

Copies of the procedures are reviewed regularly by operations personnel, and are readily available on Fareva's computer network.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nFareva provides classroom and on-the-job training to employees responsible for operating the covered process areas.  Each employee must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the supervisor that they possess the skills and knowledge to perform the required duties prior to being assigned the responsibilities.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nFareva maintains written procedures to maintain the integrity and reliability of process equipment.  These procedures include instructions for the inspection and testing of pressure vessels and storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems and devices, emergency shutdown systems, controls, including sensors, alarms, and interlocks, and pumps that are part of the PSM-covered processes.  Inspection and testing procedures are performed using recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.  The frequency that inspections and testing occur is in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations and good engineering practices and will be performed more frequently if test data indicates it is warranted.  Maintenance procedures and inspection and testing reports are documented in the PSM Cabinet and/or on the Fareva SharePoint network.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nFareva maintains a Management of Change policy and guidance procedures to implement a review process when any component of the PSM system is modified, replaced, or upgraded (beyond \"replacements in kind\").  This process ensures that all modifications other than replacement in kind are identified and are reviewed by qualified personnel prior to their implementation.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Review\n\nFareva has a policy indicating the necessity to perform a pre-startup safety review (PSSR) prior to the start of a new PSM-covered system and prior to implementing a change"

The Fareva PSSR process confirms that 1) Construction and equipment is in accordance with design specifications, 2) Safety, operating, maintenance and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate, and 3) For new stationary sources, a PHA has been performed and recommendations have been resolved or implemented, and modified sources meet the requirements of the facility's management of change program.  Documentation is in place to indicate that a pre-startup safety review was completed prior to the startup of the modified process.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nCompliance audits of PSM-covered processes will be conducted at least every three years as required.  The audits will consist of a records review and an evaluation of on-site conditions and will be conducted by at least one person knowledgeable in the processes.  Audits and corresponding findings and corrective actions will be documented.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nIncident evaluations will be conducted for incidents that result in, or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release of a covered chemical.  Investigation teams will be comprised of pertinent representatives and will be conducted within 48 hours of the incident.  Investigation reports will contain, at a minimum, the date of the incident, the date the invitation began, a description of the incident, the factors that contributed to the incident, and any recommended corrective actions.  Corrective actions are promptly addressed and reports are reviewed with all affected personnel.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nFareva encourages employee participation in the development, implementation, and maintenance of the PSM Program.  This is achieved through participation in policy and SOP development as well as through the facility's RMP/PSM Training Program.\n\n\n\nHot Work Permit\n\nFareva maintains a Hot Work Permit program in which a permit system has be"
