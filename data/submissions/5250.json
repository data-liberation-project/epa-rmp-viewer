On call personnel will work with the fire department personnel and the local emergency personnel to alert down wind residents , which are located in the down wind quadrant using the program designed by the Kitsap County Public Works personnel. State Patrol and the fire department personnel will monitor roads and control traffic in the area. Areas affected mainly would be residential and the Hiway 305 corridor. \nWorst case scenarios for the Lemolo Chlorine station gas release are reduced by the checking of the chlorine tanks, gas piping, detectors and radio telemetry twice a week. The chlorine and telemetry equipment is on a database monitored by a periodic maintenance program. Personnel use this program which takes the manufacturers' maintenance recommendations for a piece of equipment and use the information to perform maintenance in a timely fashion. The chlorine Supply Company checks the chlorine cylinders on a regular basis.\n\n* The alternative scenario for the Lemolo Chlorine station.\nThere is a chlorine leak at the Lemolo Chlorine station. This would be a gas release after midnight, when there is no one at the station. The chlorine leak detector senses a chlorine leak and the radio telemetry sends in a chlorine leak alarm to the Central Kitsap Tr. Plant dialer. The auto dialer calls out the on call personnel. The chlorine station emergency blower comes on and starts to vent the chlorine gas from inside the Lemolo Chlorine station to an engineered piping system  which mixes the chlorine gas with the waste water flow. No chlorine gas escapes from the Lemolo Chlorine station during the time it takes for the on call personnel to arrive at the station. This time frame is from 10 to 20 minutes.
