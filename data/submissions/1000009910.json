The City has demonstrated its  commitment to safety by upgrading the chemical feed process at the Water Treatment Plant (WTP) in early 1999 from a gas pressure system to a vacuum system mounted directly on a chlorine cylinder, which decreases system maintenance dramatically and therefore reduces the potential for chlorine leaks.\n\nFacility and Regulated Substance\nThe City's WTP is located northwest of the City at 3152 North COunty Road 29. Chlorine is used at the facility to provide disinfection of the public water supply.  Chlorine is stored in one-ton cylinders, and no more than eight cylinders of chlorine (16,000 pounds) are stored at the WTP.\n\nWorst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios\nPer Chapter 2, page 26 of the RMP Submit 2004 User's Manual \"A summary of the off-site consequence analysis (OCA) for the worse-case and alternative case release scenarios(s) is no longer required to be included in the executive summary\" and therefore are not included.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nThe accidental release prevention program complies with the requirements for  Program Level 2 processes.  The prevention program includes an employee training program based on the written operating procedures for the WTP, as well as an aggressive\nmaintenance, inspection, and testing program for equipment utilized within the covered process.  These programs all serve to prevent or minimize unintended releases of chlorine.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nThe WTP has NOT had an accidental release of chlorine within the last five years. \n\nEmergency Response Program\nThe WTP is included within a written community emergency response plan, and the primary responder to the WTP is the City of Loveland Fire Department.  WTP employees handle incidental releases of chlorine and are trained and equipped to d"
