      "SummaryText": "The Price River Water Improvement District manages an in house Emergency Response Program, and Employees that are trained as First Responders in the unlikely possibility of a chlorine gas escape or leak.  Coordination will be with the Carbon County Dispatch, Helper City fire department, Thatcher Chemical Company.\n    The Culinary water plant is located, 4.5 miles north of Helper, Utah  on Rt. 6, we use chlorine one ton cylinders to supply gaseous chlorine to disinfect the public water supply.  There are 2 one ton cylinders stored at the PRWID Culinary Water Plant.  The chlorination system works on a Vacuum type system, which if damaged will not allow leakage into the plant atmosphere.  Three very remote possibilities exist that could cause a chlorine leak into the air.  The first is a fire, Second is an extreme operator error, Third a major natural disaster such as earthquake, Flood, or Landslide.  Even if there was a major leak the employees are trained, and practiced with a class B one ton chlorine cylinder repair kit.  The employees are also trained and practiced in the use of Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (air packs).   There are chlorine detection alarm sensors that are tested and calibrated monthly. In the event of a chlorine leak the plant that will sound an alarm-notifying employees of the danger present. The Superintendent and lead operator have cellular phones, and pagers in the possible event of emergencies.  Emergency dispatch has a list of phone # (updated yearly) to call in the event of emergencies.\n    The possible down hill (elevation) receptors of a chlorine leak are the Price City Water Plant (.1 miles),  Cyprus Plateau Coal mine (1.1 miles) , and the Utah Power and Light Carbon Power Plant ( 1.8 miles).   These Companies will be notified immediately if there is a chlorine gas leak occurrence.  Emergency procedures are reviewed every three months, and updated as needed."
