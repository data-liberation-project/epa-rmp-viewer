      "SummaryText": "Facility Description\n\nThe Praxair Distribution facility at Okeechobee, Florida is an industrial and specialty gas plant that produces, transfills and stores acetylene gas.  Typically, acetylene gas is transfilled into industrial type gas cylinders, for customer use, from trailers transported to the site.  Acetylene gas can also be produced on-site by reacting calcium carbide and water.\n\n\nRegulated Substances\n\nThis facility uses, manufactures, or stores a chemical listed in part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, beyond a threshold quantity, as established by the EPA; \n\n\u00b7 Acetylene gas; as a transfill operation, compressed for cylinder filling, typically from transport trailers.  Gas may be manufactured on site as an alternative to trailer supply.  \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Policy\n\nPraxair is dedicated to being the best performing industrial gas company in all aspects of our business, including safety, health, and environmental affairs. Our safety, health, and environmental policy call for a commitment to protecting the health and safety of our employees, neighbors, and the surrounding environment. This policy is the basis for engineering and construction programs that produce equipment and process systems that minimize the possibility of accidental chemical releases and operational safety programs that ensure safe operation of our facilities. Praxair is committed to the continuous improvement of these programs.\n\nPraxair is an active member of the American Chemistry Council and subscribes to the council\u00bfs program of Responsible Care\u00ae Employee Health and Safety Code of Management Practices.\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nIn accordance with OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management standard and EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Program rule, the Okeechobee Florida facility has a comprehensive accident prevention program in place. This program is built around process safety concepts such as:\n- Technical documentation of Process Safety Information, describing the physical prope"

Following is a description of some of these safety features.\n- A deluge system  prevents fire from spreading off the property \n- An automatic shutdown system will shutdown the process in the event it reaches critical operating parameters.\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nThe Okeechobee Florida facility accident history indicates continuous safe operation of our covered chemical process over the last five years. There were no covered process releases that resulted in an EPA RMP recordable accident.\n\n\nEmergency Response Programs \n\nPraxair has an emergency response program in place to minimize the effects of accidental release of regulated substances on employees, the public, and the environment. The Okeechobee, Florida  location will be a \u00bfnon-responding facility\u00bf as defined in section 8.1 of the CEPPO General Gui"
