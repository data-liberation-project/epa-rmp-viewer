All staff receive RMP/PSM awareness training that instruct them on how the RMP/PSM requirements may impact their jobs. Staff who operate and maintain the RMP/PSM processes are trained in how to safely maintain and operate the processes.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe RMP/PSM regulations require that information concerning process chemicals, technology, and equipment be compiled as part of the RMP program. Emergency response planners can use such information to develop training programs and procedures, or as a general resource. The information is also supplied to contractors who will work in the chlorine process area as part of the requirements outlined in the contractors element of this program. All the required process safety information was compiled as stated in the RMP regulations. The information meets and in many cases exceeds the minimum required by the regulations.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nA process hazard analysis (PHA) was conducted systematically to evaluate potential causes and consequences of accidental releases. Empire Plant staff used this information to improve safety and reduce the likelihood and potential consequences of an accidental release. Equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions, and external factors that might affect the process were the focus of the PHAs that were performed for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes.\n\nAn interdisciplinary team of plant staff familiar with process operation and maintenance conducted the chlorine and sulfur dioxide PHAs. The PHA was done using a combination of What-If' and Checklist methods. Based on the results of the PHAs, numerous changes in operating, maintenance, and other process safety management"

In addition, plant staff must make contractors aware of the applicable elements of the emergency response plan. The plant staff and MCES Support Services project manager must also evaluate contractors' safety programs and select only those that can perform work on or adjacent to the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes without compromising the safety and health of employees at the facility or the surrounding public.\n\nBefore allowing a contractor to work on or adjacent to the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes, the project manager and plant staff must obtain and evaluate information regarding the contractor's safety performance and programs. When a contract involving work on or adjacent to the chlorine or the sulfur dioxide process is to be bid, the bidding procedures must ensure that contractor safety management requirements are met. If a contractor is to work in or adjacent to any hazardous chemical, a safety briefing to make the contractor aware of the plant's RMP/PSM plan requirements must be conducted before work begins.\n\nPre-startup Review\n\nA pre-startup safety review must be conducted for any new process that uses a regulated substance under RMP, or for significant modifications to the existing chlorine or sulfur dioxide processes that necessitate a change in the process safety information. No new or significantly modified process will start up and no acutely hazardous chemicals will be introduced into such a process prior to the pre-startup safety review.

They are transported on roads, water, and railways. The Metropolitan Council's Empire Wastewater Treatment Plant (Empire Plant) stores chemicals that it uses in its daily treatment operations. The facility currently uses chlorine for disinfection of the treated wastewater prior to discharge into the Vermillion River.  The facility stores up to five 1-ton containers and up to four 150-lb cylinders of chlorine and sulfur dioxide on site storage is two 1-ton cylinders and four 150-lb cylinders.  Chlorine is used to disinfect the treated wastewater prior to discharge into the river. In order to protect aquatic life from the aquatic toxicity of chlorine, sulfur dioxide is added to the effluent for dechlorination. \n\nChlorine and sulfur dioxide are non-explosive and non-flammable. However, both can support combustion under some circumstances. Both gases are respiratory irritants, and if accidentally released into the environment, exposure through inhalation or through eye or skin contact can pose a health risk. As a precaution, the Empire Plant has special safety systems that are an integral part of the chlorination and dechlorination systems. \n\nThe Metropolitan Council takes its safety obligations in storing and using chemicals as seriously as we do providing the environment with safe disinfected water. The following document describes the steps taken every day to ensure a safely operating plant, what could happen if there was an accidental release of a chemical stored on site, and what to do in event of an emergency.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThis document complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program under Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990 and codified in Title"

The Risk Management Program requires facilities that use certain substances above specific quantity thresholds to develop a plan to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release of the substances to the atmosphere and reduce the likelihood of serious harm to the public and the environment. This plan is referred to as the Risk Management Plan (RMP).\n\nChlorine and sulfur dioxide are stored at the Empire Plant in quantities above the regulatory thresholds at which an RMP is required. This RMP document summarizes the existing safety systems, policies, procedures, and on-going actions that are designed to prevent or minimize impacts of accidental releases of chlorine to the environment. The Empire Plant has a detailed and comprehensive emergency response plan to handle any potential accidental releases. To date, the plant has had an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring. No chlorine or sulfur dioxide releases causing a safety or health hazard affecting the surrounding community have occurred at the Empire Plant since the use of chlorine began.\n\n\nUnderstanding the Chemicals Used at the Empire Plant\n\nThe Empire Plant is located at 2540 West 197th Street in Empire Township, Dakota County, and Minnesota. Wastewater from the cities of Farmington, Apple Valley, and Lakeville is treated at the plant and discharged into the Vermillion River. The wastewater treatment process includes preliminary screening, primary settling and treatment, advanced secondary treatment, final clarification, and chlorination and dechlorination before final discharge. The Empire Plant treats approximately 9.5 million gallons of wastewater per day. \n\nThe Empire Plant has a chlorination system that uses chlorine gas fed from 1-ton chlorine containers and a dechlorination system that uses sulfur dioxide gas fed from 1-ton sulfur dioxide.\n\nThe chemical vendor delivers 1-ton chl"

Similarly, gaseous sulfur dioxide is withdrawn from the 1-ton containers and delivered to the wastewater dechlorination process. The Empire Plant uses state-of-the-art process equipment to maximize the safety for plant staff and the community at large. Some of the specific features are as follows. Chlorine and sulfur dioxide leak detectors continuously monitor for leaks in the bulk storage areas and in the chlorination and dechlorination rooms. Leak alarms activate an audible alarm throughout the plant as well as a red flashing warning light on the storage building. The alarms also sound at the central and local control panels. The leak alarms are tested weekly.\n\nOther system alarms include low vacuum at the chlorinator or sulfonator, and low injector water pressure,and switchover. These alarms sound at the chlorine and-sulfur dioxide central and local control panels. Vacuum regulators are used on the gas piping so that chlorine and sulfur dioxide gas is delivered under vacuum. If a leak were to occur on this piping, outside air would be drawn into the piping rather than chlorine or sulfur dioxide gas being forced out of the piping.\n\nThe chlorination and dechlorination rooms are enclosed in a building. The rooms are equipped with an automatic ventilation system that operates when either the chlorine or sulfur dioxide leak detector detects chlorine or sulfur dioxide in the room. Emergency showers and eye wash stations are provided at the building along with smoke alarms.\n\nThe Empire Plant's water discharge permit issued by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) only requires disinfection from April 1 through October 31. During the rest of the year chlorine usage is significantly reduced, all sulfur dioxide is removed from the plant, and a complete preventative maintenance program is administere"

The Hazard Assessment is done to determine the potential effects that a release of a regulated substance could have on the public surrounding the facility. The second part is a Prevention Program that consists of 12 elements designed to improve the system safety and decrease the likelihood of a \nrelease. The third part is the Emergency Response Program, which develops a plan for dealing with a release in the unlikely event that one would occur. Because the regulations are very similar, the Prevention Program and the Emergency Response Program also serve as the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) plan, and this document is therefore is referred to as the RMP/PSM plan.\n\nHazard Assessment/Release Scenarios\n\nA Hazard Assessment was performed to determine the effects a release would have on the public surrounding the facility. For chlorine and sulfur dioxide, the distance a set endpoint concentration of the gas would travel must be determined. In addition, an estimate of the population that could be affected by a release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide was determined and sensitive receptors such as hospitals, schools, and nursing homes were identified. The Hazard Assessment considers two release scenarios- a worst case and an alternative case. As required by the rules, the two scenarios were used to determine the possible affected area from chlorine or sulfur dioxide release incidents at the plant.\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Prevention Program consists of 12 elements designed to improve the system safety and decrease the likelihood of a release.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe participation of the Empire Plant staff in preparing the RMP/PSM program was critical to the program's successful implementation.
