This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system.  It is Lineage Logistics policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  \r\nThe Program 3 at Lineage Logistics - Bandini is a facility run program with continuous support from Lineage Logistics - Safety and Compliance Department that includes Process Safety Management (PSM) Compliance and Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) Compliance.   \r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\r\nLineage Logistics - Bandini is located at 4100 Bandini Boulevard, Vernon. California 90058 is situated approximately 0.9 miles west of the 710 freeway and 1.2 miles south of the I-5 freeway. The immediate area surrounding the facility is primarily commercial and residential. \r\nThe regulated substance handled at the facility is anhydrous ammonia.  \r\nThe facility's primary activities revolve around large-scale public storage of food products.  All the ammonia inventory is used as refrigerant.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nAs part of the implementation of the RMP Program, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by Lineage Logistics - Bandini, which also serve to manage process safety issues associated with the use of anhydrous ammonia.  Furthermore, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  The regulated substance is over the 10,000-lbs. federal threshold for EPA RMP and OSHA PSM.   As a result, the anhydrous ammonia covered process (ammonia refrigeration system) is subject to OSHA"
