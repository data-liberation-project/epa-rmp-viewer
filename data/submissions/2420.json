Facility Accidental Release Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Planters Ginning Co., Brawley Gin facility (herein referred to as the Facility) at 1295 East Hwy. 78, Brawley, Ca., 92227 are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n2.     Facility Information\n\n       *  The primary activity at the Facility is the storage, and sale of fertiliezer to farmers.\n\n       *  Anhydrous ammonia is received and stored, for the crop production nutrients.\n\n       *  Anhyrous ammonia is received by truck and stored in 2 above ground tanks at     \n          the site.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handles is 126,000 \n          pounds.\n\n3.     The Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\n        a.  Anhydrous Ammonia Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n        The worst-case release scenario is failure of the largest storage tank when \n        filled to the greatest amount would release 84,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia\n        which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited\n        by regulations. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.32\n        miles.  The alternative release scenario, based on the five-year accident history  \n        (or the most"

Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n        Anhydrous Ammonia:  The Facility has implemented the provisions of the \"Safety \n        Requirements for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published\n        by the American National Standards Institute, Inc.;  California Code of Regulations, \n        Title 8, Subchapter 1, \"Unfired Pressure Vessel Safety Orders\"; and the standards of \n        the U.S. Occuational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \n        \"Storange and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\"  \n\n5.     Five-year Accident History\n   \n        *  There have been no accidental releases or near misses of anhydrous ammonia, \n            in the past five years that:\n\n            ___ have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility;\n                   nor\n\n            ___ have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property\n                   damage, or enviromental damage.\n\n6.     The Emergency Response Program\n\n        The facility's emergency reponse program was written in accordance with the following\n         regulations:\n\n        *  OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n        *  OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120; and\n\n        *  Section 25503, Division 6.95 of the California Health and Safety Code\n\n7.     Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n        Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed\n       to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific planned changes to \n       the anhydrous ammonia process at the facility."
