Facility Accidental Release Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Planters Ginning Co., Brawley Gin facility (herein referred to as the Facility) at 1295 East Hwy. 78, Brawley, Ca., 92227 are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n2.     Facility Information\n\n       *  The primary activity at the Facility is the storage, and sale of fertiliezer to farmers.\n\n       *  Anhydrous ammonia is received and stored, for the crop production nutrients.\n\n       *  Anhyrous ammonia is received by truck and stored in 2 above ground tanks at     \n          the site.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handles is 126,000 \n          pounds.\n\n3.     The Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\n        a.  Anhydrous Ammonia Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n        The worst-case release scenario is failure of the largest storage tank when \n        filled to the greatest amount would release 84,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia\n        which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited\n        by regulations. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.32\n        miles.  The alternative release scenario, based on the five-year accident history  \n        (or the most"
