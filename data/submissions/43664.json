This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our equipment and processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nThe Worland gas plant, located 9 miles north of Worland, Wyoming, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (i.e.  natural gas, propane, butane and condensates) from wet (i.e. contains hydrocarbon liquids) natural gas. The Worland gas plant produces several regulated flammables, such as propane and butane.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Worland gas plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that existing and potential hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Worland gas plant primarily uses the \u00bfwhat if\u00bf analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a multi-disciplined team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nAll approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviat"

      "SummaryText": "e significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe Worland gas plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Worland gas plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety, health, environment"

Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels, relief valve testing).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency.  If is considered to be a major potential safety problem before placing the equipment back into service, or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Worland gas plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Worland gas plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before and during entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and other), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nSpecialized Saf"

The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\nRelease Detection\n\n1.  Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms in the process building.\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n1.  Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to incinerate episodic releases;\n2.  Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated);\n3.  Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high/low temperature,       pressure and volume);\n4.  Redundant equipment and instrumentation (i.e., backup firewater pump);\n5.  Atmospheric relief valves.\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n1.  Fire suppression and extinguishing systems;\n2.  Trained emergency response personnel;\n3.  Personal protective equipment (e.g., fire retardant clothing).\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Worland gas plant resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.  The following types of changes are planned of the next few years in response to PHA, safety audit, and Incident Investigation findings:\n\n- Upgrade process control system to use distributed computerized control system."
