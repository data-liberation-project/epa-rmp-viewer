              "Description": "The Keyera Energy, West Vancouver terminal is located at 5701 N.W. Old Lower River Rd., Vancouver, WA.  This facility provides  for the transfer of liquefied propane under pressure from stationary (detached from locomotive) pressure tank/rail cars to stationary above ground storage tanks.  Product is moved to storage tanks using a fixed rail car unloading system via pressure differential, and pumped from storage tanks to transport trucks and trailers using liquid transfer pumps.  A Process Safety Management program has been prepared and implemented at the terminal.  This program uses a systematic approach to evaluate the whole process.  Each process has been evaluated as a separate entity.  Various emergency shutdown and backup lines of defense have been incorporated int the design and operation of the process to prevent or mitigate the release of propane.  The facility is new as of February 2011 and was built with new systems.  Every five years or sooner if warranted, processes will be evaluated and strengthened where required to assure their effectiveness.  Keyera Energy has developed standard operating procedures that provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in each covered process consistent with the process safety information.  Operating procedures for designated processes will be reviewed by the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) team, engineering staff, and operating personnel to ensure that they are accurate and provide practical instructions on how to actually carry out job duties safely.  Keyera Energy has developed and implemented an emergency action plan to facilitate the prompt response, notification and evacuation of employees due to an unwanted release of propane.  The site emergency planning and response procedures describe the actions to be taken by all responding personnel to potential emergency situations at the Keyera Energy West Vancouver terminal.",

Its accidental release policy is an integrated approach, involving employee participation, management practices, written procedures, and training. Keyera has developed a comprehensive propane accident prevention program considering all aspects of process operation and maintenance. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the City of Vancouver\n\nFire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. We also maintain incipient stage fire fighting equipment on site. Additionally the facility has been equipped with fire suppression cannon nozzles along the facility perimeter. This facility complies with NFPA-58 requirements for LP-Gas storage, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws. The facility came online new in 2011 and is annually inspected for compliance by the City of Vancouver. \n\nA description of our facility and the regulated substances handled: \n\nThis facility is a bulk terminal storing LPG for resale to retail propane dealers. The facility consists of two 80,000-gallon tanks holding approximately 285,600 pounds each of liquid propane. There is also the capacity for sixteen 33,000-gallon rail cars onsite and capacity for another six 33,000-gallon rail cars adjacent to the facility on leased property. There are both manual and automatic emergency shutdown systems on all LPG equipment at the site.\n\nThe worst-case and alternative release scenarios:\n\nOur worst-case scenario is failure of both of the 80,000-gallon storage tanks or the connecting piping when each of the storage tanks are filled to the greatest amount allowed (88% at 60F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. It assumes all the propane is released and ignited. No passive mitigation system is considered. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite to 0.7 miles, "

      "SummaryText": "and public receptors (one residence, one prison, and the Port of Vancouver Industrial Park) are within the distance to the endpoint. Keyera has multiple safeguards in place which make this scenario very unlikely. Our alternative release scenario involves a propane release from a multi-port 2.5 inch relief valve over a 5-minute period at a rate of 819 pounds per minute. An excess flow check valve is the active mitigation system considered in this scenario. A total of 6,890 pounds of propane is ignited, resulting is a vapor cloud explosion. This would generate a pressure wave with a minimum 1 psi overpressure extending 0.1 miles. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite. The only public receptors within the distance to the endpoint is the industrial park. \n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule, the OSHA PSM standard, and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. The propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law.\n\nFive-year accident history:\n\nThe terminal facility is new in February 2011. There has not been an accident involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in-place. \n\nThe emergency response program:\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our propane system, it is our policy to notify the City of Vancouver Fire Department and request that they help respond to the emergency. Keyera also has trained employees in incipient stage fire fighting. We have coordinated our response plans with the fire department; members of the fire department have been provided the opportunity to visit our facility and inspect our propane storage system.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nKeyera Energy, Inc. will continually strive for safety improvement. Periodic process safety inspections and Process Hazard Anayses will be conducted f"
