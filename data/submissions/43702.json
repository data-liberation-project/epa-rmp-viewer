      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nIntroduction\nThe Risk Management Program at  HMC Cold Storage complies with US EPA and Cal ARP requirements. April 2004 changes to RMP data elements are included in this update. International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration's (IIAR) RMP and PSM Guidelines have been implemented at this facility. This facility prepares agricultural crops for processing consistent with SIC Code 0723.\n\nThere are 2 Ammonia Refrigeration facilities at this site. The existing or Facility #1 was completed in 1988. A new storage facility and independent NH3 refrigeration system was completed in June 2000 located 500\u00bf south of the existing cold storage. Since they are totally separate facilities with no interconnection of refrigeration systems they are treated as separate processes. Facility #1 is a larger system with NH3 operating capacity of 25,287 lbs.. Facility #2 has a capacity of 12,900 lbs.. Facility #1 is used for the Worst Case scenario and the Alternate release scenario typical of a compressor shaft seal failure would apply to either system.\n\nA conversion of storage room 2 into a pre-cooler in 2003 added additional refrigeration equipment and NH3 inventory. Equipment added included 1-compressor, 1-evaporative condenser, 1-HPR, 2-pre-cooler coils and miscellaneous associated piping. This Hazard Analysis revision accounts for the associated changes. \n\nRevisions to the original hazard analysis were required since changes to the High Pressure Receiver capacity made it possible to contain all of the NH3 in the high pressure receivers during the off season. Previously management controls and physical storage limitations prevented filling the HPR with the total charge. Worst Case distance to toxic endpoints decreased, even with increased inventory, since mitigation factors for release in an enclosed space and urban designation due to the adjacent orchards were both considered. Population estimates are using 2000 Census data. \n\n\nPublication or sharing of OCA portions"
