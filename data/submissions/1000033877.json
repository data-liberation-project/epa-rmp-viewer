J. Minor factory of the NestlA&copy; Professional Division, located at 2621 West 25th Avenue in Cleveland, Ohio uses two ammonia refrigeration systems to preserve and protect raw materials, intermediates and products.\n\nEvery effort has been made to limit the amount of anhydrous ammonia contained within this system so as to minimize the potential impact of catastrophic failures.  Facility process expansions, however, has resulted in present inventory levels.\n\n\n\nAmmonia is the only chemical handled at the facility which is covered by the EPA's Risk Management Program.\n\nL.

Where appropriate, periodic preventive maintenance is performed to ensure the ongoing reliability of all process equipment; Reviews any new processes or additions to the existing ammonia refrigeration system to ensure that they can be started up and operated safely; Manages changes to the ammonia refrigeration system to ensure that they are implemented in a manner that minimizes the potential for unwanted releases of anhydrous ammonia; Investigates all incidents associated with the ammonia refrigeration system so as to learn how they can be avoided in the future; Ensures that all employees, contractors, visitors and outside emergency service personnel know what to do in the event of an emergency so as to minimize potential injuries as well as off-site consequences; And, periodically audits PSM activities so as to ensure that PSM programs undergo continuous improvement.\n\n\n\nOver the last 15 years of ammonia refrige"

An Emergency Response Plan has been prepared to handle release scenarios that have potential impact on the surrounding community. A community notification plan would be activated if the release could affect the surrounding neighborhood. This plan was prepared in cooperation with our local fire, police and medical officials. \n\nIf the release expands into the surrounding community, a shelter-in-place plan would go into effect. \n\n\n\nAll plant emergency response personnel are identified within the written Emergency Response Plan and receive periodic training to ensure that they know and understand the hazards and how they can be avoided.
