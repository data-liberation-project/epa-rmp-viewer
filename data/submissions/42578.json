This facility processes natural gas, natural gas liquids (NGL), and oil from a producing well. High pressure gas from the well is sent to a high pressure separator and subsequently routed to the inlet of the gas plant.  The gas plant strips out NGL liquids which are stored in a single 30,000 gallon pressurized bullet tank operating at approximately 170 psig.  The NGL is removed from the facility by transfers to tank trucks.  Liquids from the high pressure separator are routed to lower pressure separation vessels and the oil product is stored in three bulk atmospheric storage tanks (400 barrels each) and removed from the site via transfers to tank trucks.  \n\nThe facility is subject to the RMP requirements since it is a natural gas processing plant producing NGL and contains threshold quantities of regulated substances.  The facility has approximately 156,000 pounds of NGL and 277,200 pounds of condensate on site.  The NGL and oil products are a mixture of hydrocarbons consisting of methane, ethane, butane, isobutane, isopentane and pentane.  For purposes of determining the largest weight on site, the highest density substance was used (butane for NGL and pentane for condensate).\n\nSince this facility is a Program 1, a documented prevention program is not required.  The operator is aware of the General Duty Clause in the Louisiana regulations (see Section 1.4 of the \"Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance Program\" document) and accidental release prevention is a policy adopted by the operator.\n\nAs documented in Section 4.0 of the Risk Management Plan, the facility has not experienced a release as defined in t"
