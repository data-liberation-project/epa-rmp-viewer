It is designed as a wine grape processing and wine production facility. All process and operations conducted at the facility are integral parts of the winemaking and distribution.\n\nCanandaigua Wine maintains a commitment to worker and public safety as evidenced by the resources invested in accident prevention and in the consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the Mission Bell Winery.  Canandaigua Wine maintains a proactive stance, as a labor intensive agricultural based industry, Canandaigua Wine is dedicated to the protection of natural and human resources.\n\nCOVERED PROCESSES\n\n1.550 REFRIGERATION SYSTEM\n\nThe Refrigeration system is a Risk Management Program 3 (RMP). This process is a centralized ammonia compression refrigeration system consisting of four (4) 700 hp screw compressors, high pressure receiver, and one (1) low pressure liquid ammonia recirculation system. There are fourteen (14) shell & tube heat exchangers used for direct cooling of wine. The low pressure recirculator serves the cooling jackets on fourteen (14) storage and fermenting tanks.\n\n2.NEUTRALIZATION AND ION EXCHANGE STORAGE SYSTEM\n\nThe Neutralization and Ion Exchange Storage system is a RMP Program 3. Both the Neutralization and Ion Exchange systems utilize the anhydrous ammonia stored in a 11,897 gallon ASME Code Pressure Vessel. The Neutralization system uses anhydrous ammonia to neutralize sulfur dioxide emissions in an evaporative cooling water tower.  The evaporative cooling water tower concentrates juice for processing. The cooling tower water is continuously monitored by an in line pH analyzer.  This analyzer signals a control valve that meters an appropriate amount of ammonia into the water to correct the pH. The Ion Exchange system neutralizes the effect of sulfuric acid in the cation/anion d"

The cation/anion demineralization system is used to purify water utilized within the plant operations.  \n\n3.SULFUR DIOXIDE SYSTEM\n\nThe Sulfur Dioxide system is a RMP program 3. This process is the simple transfer of liquid anhydrous sulfur dioxide from a one-ton cylinder into smaller gauging cylinders. This process uses gravity assisted by inert gas counterpressure to provide the motive force. The smaller cylinders are used for injecting and circulating sulfur dioxide into the wine to inhibit, and stop the fermentation process.\n\n\n4.RED WINE REFRIGERATION SYSTEM\n\nThe Refrigeration Expansion system is a RMP program 3. This process is a centralized ammonia compression refrigeration system consisting of one (1) 450 hp FES rotary screw compressors, and one (1) low pressure liquid ammonia recirculation systems. There are eight (8) shell & tube heat exchangers used for direct cooling of wine. The low pressure recirculator serves the cooling jackets on eight (8) storage and fermenting tanks.\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN/PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT\n\nIn addition to being regulated by 40 CFR Part 68 Risk Management Plan (RMP) and 19 CCR 2735 California Accidental Release Prevention Program, the Mission Bell Winery is regulated by Title 8 CCR 5189 Process Safety Management of Acutely Hazardous Materials (PSM).  A RMP/PSM program has been implemented at the Mission Bell Winery.\n\nThe Mission Bell Winery RMP/PSM Prevention Program has multiple elements to ensure the safety of employees and the public.  The main elements of the program are discussed in the following paragraphs.\n\nEmployee Participation includes involvement in the process hazard analysis, development and review of operating procedures, process safety information, and mechanical integrity inspections.  \n\nA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) has been conducted on the existing systems. The PHA methodologies used are What If/Checklists based on the Uniform Mechanical Code, ANSI/IIAR 2 1999, IIAR Bulletin 110, Co"

An ongoing commitment to joint participation exercises with local emergency responders is a key element of the program.\n\nFor emergency releases of hazardous materials, employees have been instructed to evacuate the area and notify their supervisor. The supervisor will assess the situation, and notify the local fire department to respond, if warranted. Employees are notified to evacuate by (1) winery siren, (2) verbal instructions, and/or (3) two-way radio communication.\n\nThe Winery Manager is responsible to make the proper notifications in case of an emergency release.
