      "SummaryText": "ty employs approximately 40 people engaged in the production\nof motor oil and lubricating oil additives.\n\nThe processes involving the chemicals subject to the Risk\nManagement Program are the Sulfonation process and the Ammonia\nNeutralization process. In Sulfonation, alkylate (alphaolefin\nalkylbenzene) is mixed with oleum (20 percent fuming sulfuric\nacid) in an in-line static mixer where the alkylate is reacted\nwith sulfur trioxide to form sulfonic acid. Unreacted oleum is\nseparated from the sulfonic acid in settlers and returned to the\noleum producer for regeneration.\n\nIn Ammonia Neutralization, after the spent acid has been removed,\nthe sulfonic acid is treated (neutralized) with ammonia using an\nin-line static mixer to produce ammonium sulfonate. The ammonium\nsulfonate is a raw material in the petroleum additives production.\n\n\n4.0  Regulated Substances Present\n\nAs discussed in the previous section, there are two substances\nused at the facility that are subject to the Risk Management\nProgram regulations. Oleum is stored and used at the facility with\na maximum inventory of 436,800 pounds. Ammonia is stored and used\nat the facility with a maximum inventory of 51,000 pounds.\n\n\n5.0  Release Scenarios\n\nAs required by the Risk Management Program regulations, Ethyl\nPetroleum Additives determined the offsite impact of an accidental\nrelease for four release scenarios-a worst case release for each\nchemical and an alternate release scenario for each chemical.\n\nThe regulations define the worst case release for each chemical as\nthe loss of the entire maximum inventory over a 10-minute period.\nThe regulations require that the offsite impact of the worst case\nrelease be calculated using very conservative, worst case, weather\nconditions. Specifically, a wind speed of 1.5 meters/second and an\nF atmospheric stability class. USEPA has published reference\ntables to be used in calculating the distance offsite that an\naccidental release would travel. These tables employ very\nconservativ"

Ethyl Petroleum Additives used the USEPA reference tables\nto calculate a worst-case offsite impact radius of 0.43 miles for\noleum and 7.50 miles for ammonia. It is estimated that no\nresidential receptors would reside within the 0.43-mile radius of\nthe oleum release.\n\nEthyl Petroleum Additives also calculated offsite impact distances\nfor alternate, more realistic accidental release scenarios. These\nrelease scenarios took into consideration safety systems and\ncontrols in place to reduce the severity of an accidental release\nand considered a more realistic release rate of the hazardous\nchemicals. For oleum, overfilling the storage vessel was\ndetermined to be the most likely accidental release scenario even\nthough no serious accidental oleum releases have occurred at the\nfacility during the five-year accident history period. An oleum\noffsite impact radius of 0.19 miles was calculated using the USEPA\nreference tables and a quantity of 9,828 pounds released over a 10-\nminute period. It is estimated that no residential receptors would\nreside within the 0.19-mile radius of the oleum release.\n\nFor ammonia, a rupture disk or relief valve failure was the most\nlikely accidental release scenario even though no serious\naccidental ammonia releases have ever occurred at the facility. An\nammonia offsite impact radius of 0.31 miles was calculated using\nthe USEPA reference tables and a quantity of 500 pounds released\nover a 5-minute period. It is estimated that no residential\nreceptors would reside within the 0.31-mile radius of the ammonia\nrelease.\n\n\n6.0  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility's accident prevention program includes each of the\nelements required by the Risk Management Program regulations.\nSince the facility is also subject to OSHA's PSM Program\nrequirements, most of the prevention program elements were in\nplace prior to the developme"
