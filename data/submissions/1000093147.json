Other response practices include utilizing wind socks to determine wind direction, the SAFER System for air dispersion modeling of a toxic gas release, sampling on-site and off-site by HAZMAT response personnel, the phosgene detection monitoring system in occupied buildings, water deluge systems for fire and toxic air release suppression, equipment and operating unit shutdown systems and waste handling procedures.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nRubicon's current philosophy on major safety improvements is to evaluate the use of pipelines in place of tank trucks or rail cars for transportation of chemicals. Utilizing pipelines allows Rubicon to reduce storage of these chemicals and it promotes less handling of these chemicals due to less loading and unloading.  Pipelines also benefit the public because there is less vehicular transportation of these chemicals through their neighborhoods thus lowering the possibility of accidents. \r\n\r\nRubicon conducts business safely and effectively which is demonstrated by our outstanding safety record.  Rubicon has, for the last 55 years, effectively managed our systems to minimize risk to our employees, our neighbors and our community.  Rubicon is committed to maintaining this high standard of performance and plans to experience many more safe, productive years in this area.  Rubicon is committed to improving the safety at our facility for our employees, our near neighbors, and our community."

Some practices at Rubicon for preventing situations that could possibly lead to an emergency incident are the use of good engineering design and nationally accepted standards, conducting process hazard analyses, safety procedures, the management of change system, unit operating policies and procedures, continuous process control and monitoring, inspection and testing of equipment and preventative maintenance of equipment.  The second and third elements of Rubicon's emergency response program are preparation and response.  Preparing for emergency situations at Rubicon includes exercises and drills for the training of the internal emergency response units.  The internal emergency response units are the Fire Brigade, HAZMAT personnel with equipped van, medical first responders with equipped ambulance and a first aid station with nurse, and teams specializing in vertical and confined space rescues.  Formal written fire and release preplans have been developed to assist training and drill scenarios.  A plant-wide evacuation drill for all employees is performed at least once per year.\r\n\r\nAnother important aspect of preparation for an emergency is communication.  Rubicon has the following internal communication systems: 888 emergency notification telephone system, two way radios, public announcement system in the units, fire alarms, gas alarms, telephones, cellular telephones and faxes.  External communication systems include the Community Awareness Emergency Response (CAER) radio, the telephone system with backup switch and power, cellular telephones, and the use of 911.  Upon using the CAER radio or 911, Rubicon coordinates with the Ascension Parish Sheriff's Office (APSO) the activation of all or part of the CAER emergency sirens that are designed to be heard within an approximate radius of 2.5 miles of each plant in the area where the CA"
