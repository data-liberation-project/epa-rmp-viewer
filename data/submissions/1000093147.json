Specifically, Rubicon is located on Highway 75 about 1 mile south of the intersection of Highway 75 and Highway 73.  Rubicon employs over 600 people including contract workers and manufactures chemicals that produce three main products: 1. Polyurethanes, 2. Antioxidant Additives, and 3. Maleic Anhydride.  These products have a wide variety of commercial uses including automotive, marine, building materials, appliances, footwear, and sporting goods.\n\nRubicon handles six regulated chemicals above the Risk Management Program (RMP) threshold in its chemical manufacturing processes.  These chemicals are ammonia, chlorine, ethylene oxide, formaldehyde, phosgene, and propylene oxide.\n\n\n\nThe 24 hour emergency contact listed in Section 1.8 of the RMP Plan is the Polyols Unit Shift Foreman which is an on-site shift foreman position that is manned at all times.   Darren Jackson, Marc Powell, and Brian Tureau currently fill this position.\n\n \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nRubicon's philosophy is that it is the responsibility of management and all other employees to operate safe, clean and efficient facilities in an environmentally and socially responsible manner.  This is achieved by striving for continuous improvement through the implementation of programs such as Responsible Care and the OSHA Voluntary Protection Program (VPP).  Rubicon has achieved the Star among Stars Qualifier designation under VPP .  Other elements of this philosophy include ensuring that all employees have received adequate training on their Environmental Health & Safety (EHS) responsibilities and that all employees are held accountable for their EHS performance.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nRubicon is subject to several EPA and OSHA regulations includi"

Rubicon has management systems in place that provide for the assessment of risks associated with the manufacturing and handling of chemicals and for the continuous improvement of associated processes.  Rubicon's philosophy is prevention first, through the use of good engineering design and nationally accepted standards.  In addition, Rubicon conducts process hazard analyses, establishes EHS and unit operating policies and procedures, utilizes continuous process control and monitoring, and performs inspection and testing of equipment.\n\n  \n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nRubicon has had one incident within the last five years:\n\n\n\nOn April 21, 2016, a release occurred from a bleed valve in the MDI 2 unit while clearing a pump for planned maintenance the following day.  A liquid mixture of chlorobenzene, methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI), phosgene and hydrochloric acid (HCl) was released.  0.62 pounds of phosgene and 0.1 pounds of chlorobenzene were released to the air from the spill pool.  The rest of the liquid mixture was contained within the unit.  Two Production Technicians were exposed to the liquid mixture.  Both Production Technicians were transported St. Elizabeth Hospital and were treated for phosgene exposure.  One Production Technician was also treated for burns.  As a precautionary measure, the Production Technicians were transported to Louisiana State University Health Science Center (LSU HSC) in Shreveport, LA for further monitoring.  Both Production Technicians were released from LSU HSC and were cleared to return to work on April 22, 2016.  The Ascension Parish Sheriff's Office was notified of a site alert that was not expected to impact off site receptors.  The Ascension Parish Sheriff's Office, the Louisiana State Police and the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality were notified when the Production Technicians were transported to the hospital.\n\n\n\nEm"

Some practices at Rubicon for preventing situations that could possibly lead to an emergency incident are the use of good engineering design and nationally accepted standards, conducting process hazard analyses, safety procedures, the management of change system, unit operating policies and procedures, continuous process control and monitoring, inspection and testing of equipment and preventative maintenance of equipment.  The second and third elements of Rubicon's emergency response program are preparation and response.  Preparing for emergency situations at Rubicon includes exercises and drills for the training of the internal emergency response units.  The internal emergency response units are the Fire Brigade, HAZMAT personnel with equipped van, medical first responders with equipped ambulance and a first aid station with nurse, and teams specializing in vertical and confined space rescues.  Formal written fire and release preplans have been developed to assist training and drill scenarios.  A plant-wide evacuation drill for all employees is performed at least once per year.\n\n\n\nAnother important aspect of preparation for an emergency is communication.  Rubicon has the following internal communication systems: 888 emergency notification telephone system, two way radios, public announcement system in the units, fire alarms, gas alarms, telephones, cellular telephones and faxes.  External communication systems include the Community Awareness Emergency Response (CAER) radio, the telephone system with backup switch and power, cellular telephones, and the use of 911.  Upon using the CAER radio or 911, Rubicon coordinates with the Ascension Parish Sheriff's Office (APSO) the activation of all or part of the CAER emergency sirens that are designed to be heard within an approximate radius of 2.5 miles of each plant in the area where the CA"

This coordination can also activate the computerized Emergency Telephone Alerting System provided by the Community Alert Network (CAN) and the Emergency Broadcast System (television and/or radio) for Ascension Parish.  These external communication systems inform and coordinate efforts with neighboring chemical plants, the Ascension Parish Sheriff Department, Ascension Parish Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, the Louisiana State Police and/or the general public.\n\n\n\nRubicon works closely with outside authorities and other neighboring companies to coordinate emergency response.  These authorities are Louisiana State Police, Ascension Parish Sheriff Department, Ascension Parish Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, Geismar Fire Department, Prairieville Fire Department, Red Cross, Our Lady of the Lake Ascension Hospital (Gonzales), Our Lady of the Lake Regional Hospital (Baton Rouge), Baton Rouge General Medical Center (Baton Rouge), Ochsner Medical Center (Baton Rouge) and the Industrial Mutual Aid Group (IMAG).  The Ascension Parish Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness has the ability to facilitate the activation of the National Guard Civil Support Team to respond to an on-site emergency.  IMAG also has reciprocal agreements for equipment exchange with the St. James Mutual Aid and Baton Rouge Area Mutual Aid Systems.  Rubicon performs annual training with most of these organizations or provides information necessary for coordinated emergency response.\n\nRubicon has also developed formal emergency action plans such as the SPC/SPCC Plan, RCRA Contingency Plan, and the One Plan for emergency situations.

Other response practices include utilizing wind socks to determine wind direction, the SAFER System for air dispersion modeling of a toxic gas release, sampling on-site and off-site by HAZMAT response personnel, the phosgene detection monitoring system in occupied buildings, water deluge systems for fire and toxic air release suppression, equipment and operating unit shutdown systems and waste handling procedures.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nRubicon's current philosophy on major safety improvements is to evaluate the use of pipelines in place of tank trucks or rail cars for transportation of chemicals. Utilizing pipelines allows Rubicon to reduce storage of these chemicals and it promotes less handling of these chemicals due to less loading and unloading.  Pipelines also benefit the public because there is less vehicular transportation of these chemicals through their neighborhoods thus lowering the possibility of accidents. \n\n\n\nRubicon conducts business safely and effectively which is demonstrated by our outstanding safety record.  Rubicon has, for the last 55 years, effectively managed our systems to minimize risk to our employees, our neighbors and our community.  Rubicon is committed to maintaining this high standard of performance and plans to experience many more safe, productive years in this area.  Rubicon is committed to improving the safety at our facility for our employees, our near neighbors, and our community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
