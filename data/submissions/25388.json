THIS COMPANY IS A FULL SERVICE FARM SUPPLY COMPANY WITH THE GREATEST RISK OF RELEASE COMING FROM OUR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA STORAGE TANKS. WE ARE COMMITTED TO THE PREVENTION OF ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA. IF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT, OR OTHER AUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACTS OF THE RELEASE TO PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT. THIS LOCATION HAS 2 BULK TANKS AND 18 NURSE TANKS. THIS FACILITY HAS THE CAPACITY TO STORE 236,000 POUNDS OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA. THE STORAGE TANKS ARE LOCATED ON THE SOUTH EDGE OF THE TOWN OF LACONA. THEY ARE THE 2 WEST TANKS AND THE VALVES ARE LOCATED ON EAST END OF THE TANKS. THE NURSE TANK FILL STATION IS LOCATED ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE TANKS. THE WORST CASE SCENARIO WOULD BE THE RELEASE IN THE AMOUNT OF 79,000 POUNDS. THE RELEASE WOULD BE 7900 POUNDS PER MINUTE FOR 10 MINUTES. ASSUMING A 1.5 M/SEC. WIND SPEED, THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT WOULD BE 3.6 MI. AFFECTING 564 PEOPLE. THE ALTERNATE WOST CASE SCENARIO WOULD BE A TRANSFER HOSE FAILURE. THE QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 11,908 POUNDS AT A RATE OF 5954 POUNDS PER MINUTE. THE RELEASE DURATION WOULD BE 2 MINUTES. ASSUMING A 3 M/SEC. WIND SPEED THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT WOULD BE .5 MI. AFFECTING 15 PEOPLE. WE HAVE AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM IN EFFECT. THE FACILITY HAS BEEN REVIEWED FOR GENERAL COMPLIANCE WITH PROVISIONS OF \"SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA, K-61.1\", PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARDS INSTITUTE, INC. (ANSI), AND THE STANDARDS OF THE U.S. OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA\". THE OSHA STANDARD IS REFERENCD IN THE REGISTRATION FORM SECTION 8.3b. ADDITIONAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION MEASURES WE UTILIZE RANGE FROM EMPLOYEE TRAINING TO EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE. W"

WE INSPECT OUR PLANT ON A REGULAR BASIS AND WE REVIEW OUR SAFETY POLICIES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF INSTALLING CONCRETE BARRIERS TO HELP PREVENT VEHICULAR DAMAGE. WE HAVE NOT HAD AN ACCIDENT WITHIN THE LAST 5 YEARS. OUR EMERGENCY RESPNONSE PROGRAM CONSISTS OF A WRITTEN EMERGENGY ACTION PLAN IN ACCORDANCE WITH OSHA STANDARD 29 CFR 1910.38. WE ALSO FOLLOW THE IOWA FERTILIZER RULE STANDARDS AND PROVIDE STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES WITH THE EMERGENCY PLANNING AND COMMUNITY RIGHT TO KNOW INFORMATION AS REQUIRED UNDER SARA TITLE III (EPCRA). WE WILL NOTIFY THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES AS WELL AS THE LEPC IF A RELEASE OCCURS. THE NUMBERS TO CALL ARE 911 AND (515)961-6386 RESPECTIVELY.
