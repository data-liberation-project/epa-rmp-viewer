This operation continues to supply aqueous ammonia to the end user for agricultural fertilization.  Aqueous ammonia is loaded at the facility and delivered to the field for application.  All personal information, addresses, and telephone numbers were rechecked for applicability.\nFive Year Accident History\nThere have been no reportable spills or releases in the last five years, and no injuries or illnesses that were caused by ammonia products.\nEmergency Response and Accident Prevention Program\nThe facility continues to be committed to following all applicable safety and reporting regulations for the storage and transport of ammonia products.  There is an emergency plan in place covering response to releases, and it is presented in annual emergency response training for all involved personnel.  \nWorst and Alternate Case Scenarios\nBoth scenarios were evaluated and remodeled using RMP comp.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nPlans to improve safety at the facility were developed based on the results of the process hazard analysis (PHA) and a Risk Management Plan (RMP) site evaluation facilitated by an independent contractor. To improve the safety of all aspects of operations, including ammonia systems, Wilbur-Ellis has implemented a comprehensive, risk-based safety management process to help guide employees to improved safety performance. The safety management process, branded Guiding People to Safety (GPS), is designed to build strong safety programs and positive safety culture. GPS addresses all aspects of general safety in addition to process safety for our ammonia systems.\n\nSince the last RMP Submission, Wilbur-Ellis has implemented a Safety Data management System using the Enablon platform. This system, branded \u0093Navigator\u0094, is significantly improving our ability to track events and corrective actions, communicate key learnings, It also includes a detailed"
