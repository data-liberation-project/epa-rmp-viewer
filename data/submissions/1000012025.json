The worst-case release scenario selected involved the complete loss of 10,000 pounds of Ammonia to the air. The 10,000 pounds worst-case release quantity selected represents the greatest quantity stored at Tex-Mex Cold Storage, Inc. at any given time, although the tank has a maximum capacity of 20,000 pounds of Ammonia. \n\nThe RMP*Comp32 results indicate that the maximum distance needed for the concentration of Ammonia to reach the toxic endpoint (0.14 mg/L) as a result of a 10-minute release of 10,000 pounds of Ammonia is 1.5 miles. The total potentially affected population within the area of the circle (with a radius of 1.2 miles) is 12,470 persons as given by the LandView Population Census Estimator.\n\nOne alternative scenario was selected for the offsite consequence anal"

The RMP*Comp32 dispersion modeling results indicate that 0.2 miles is the maximum distance for the concentration of ammonia to reach the toxic endpoint (0.14 mg/L) as a result of a 30 minute release of 334 pounds of Ammonia per minute. The LandView Population Census Estimator indicates that there is no potentially affected population within the area of the circle (with a radius of 0.1 miles). \n\nA search of U.S. Geological Survey and Google maps did not identify any offsite impacts of environmental receptors within the endpoint. Environmental receptors include natural areas such as national or state parks, forests, or monuments officially designated wildlife sanctuaries, preserves, refuges, and federal wilderness areas.\n\nNo accidental Ammonia releases have occurred at this facility. \n\nThe Tex-Mex Cold Storage, Inc., Accidental Release Prevention Policy involves an approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices in compliance with all applicable EPA Prevention Program 3 requirements and OSHA Process Safety Management requirements. \n\nChemical-specific prevention steps include availability of Self-Contained-Breathing-Apparatuses (SCBA) and staff awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of ammonia. Tex-Mex Cold Storage, Inc. personnel employed the What If technique to conduct a Process Hazard Analysis. Employees discussed each question and recorded their answers. After answering the questions, they discussed the adequacy of the existing safeguards and recommendations for additional safeguards. The staff finished the Process Hazard Analysis with an equipment inspection. All equipment was inspected during the Process Hazard Analysis. The Process Hazard Analysis will be updated at least once every five years.  \n\nTex-Mex Cold Storage, Inc. ensures that each employee "
