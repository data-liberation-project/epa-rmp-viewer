The plant's products are used to make a variety of different types and styles of nylon carpeting.  The one material used by the facility which is on the RMP Rule's list of regulated substances is cyclohexylamine.  The Shaw Industries Plant 8S's storage and use of cyclohexylamine exceeds the specified threshold as defined by the EPA's RMP Rule.  The Shaw Industries Columbia Plant 8S is committed to managing health, safety and the environment as a core business value and operates under an established HS&E Management System based on the ISO 14001 and OHS&S 18001 Standards. The Plant also integrates health, safety and environmental management into all aspects of its operations as a competitive advantage in achieving profitable growth and accelerated productivity.  \n\n\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of the RMP Rule, a description of the following six elements is provided for the Shaw Industries Group, Inc., Plant 8S, Columbia, S.C.: \n\n\n\n1)  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies: \n\n\n\nIt is the policy of the Shaw Industries, Columbia S.C.

The accidental release prevention and emergency response policy associated specifically with the plant's use of cyclohexylamine involves the integration of safety devices and technologies inherent in the design of the process, safe operational procedures and management practices, operator training, the preparation and testing of site emergency response plans, the maintenance of onsite emergency response equipment and a professionally trained Emergency Response Team, coordinating our efforts and resources with local emergency response services, and communicating with the community. \n\n\n\n2)  Description of the Facility and the Regulated Substance Handled:  \n\n\n\nThe Shaw Industries, Columbia, S.C. Plant 8S uses cyclohexylamine as an additive in the manufacturing of nylon.  It is stored and handled in quantities that exceed the threshold quantity specified in the RMP Rule.  The Plant's stationary source of cyclohexylamine consists of bulk storage and process distribution equipment located as part of the Polymerization Department on the eastern side of the Plant site.  Cyclohexylamine is purchased from an outside vendor and is delivered to the Plant via tank truck on an \"as needed\" basis.  The tanker's contents are unloaded by Plant operators into an above ground bulk storage tank identified as VT-993 which is located in an isolated outdoor area. Cyclohexylamine is pumped from the bulk storage tank through an enclosed piping system into the production area where it is fed into the nylon polymerization process unit.  \n\n\n\n3) The General Accidental "

Chemical-specific prevention steps include:  a) developing an understanding among the operators for the hazardous properties of cyclohexylamine along with the process chemistry and safe operational process limits such as temperatures, pressures, and flows;  b) understanding the benefits of safe chemical handling and the consequences of process deviations and inadvertent mixing of incompatible chemicals;  c) having knowledge of the requirements, capabilities and limitations of both personal protective and emergency response equipment and maintaining easily accessible inventories of e"

Plant 8S in the past 5 years.   \n\n\n\n5) The Emergency Response Plan:  \n\n\n\nThe Shaw Industries Columbia,S.C. Plant 8S has an emergency preparedness planning and response program designed to deal with accidental releases and other unplanned events associated with the facility's stationary source involving cyclohexylamine.  The Plant has a written Emergency Response Plan that addresses various types of contingencies including specific actions for responding to an accidental release of cyclohexylamine.  The Plan provides for both internal Plant and external community emergency alerting and notification with established call trees with multiple means of communication.  The Plan addresses emergency health care, in-place sheltering, evacuation, and implementation of an Incident Command System to direct and coordinate the Plant's response activities.  The Plan has been coordinated with the LEPC and with the local Fire Department who would direct offsite community response activities.  Members of the local Fire Department typically visit the Plant annually to receive training on the Site's RMP Program, the source location, the hazards of cyclohexylamine, the Site Emergency Response Plan and emergency response resources, and are taken on a tour of the facility.  The last RMP Emergency Response cross training with the local Fire Department was held at the Columbia Plant 8S in May 2009.  The Fire Department's station house is physically located adjacent to the Columbia Plant 8S on adjoining property.  The Shaw Industries Columbia Plant 8S maintains it"

The Plant 8S Emergency Response Team trains monthly and holds annual Plant emergency response drills and exercises.  Joint training exercises are conducted with members of the local Fire Department response group.  In-house testing and audits of the Plant's emergency response alarm and communication systems are performed weekly. \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:  \n\n\n\nEven though air dispersion modeling results for the worst case release scenario of cyclohexylamine from the facility's largest container showed that the distance the vapors would travel to reach the toxic endpoint concentration would not exceed the Plant's property line, the Columbia, S.C. Plant 8S in August of 2005 relocated its largest storage container of cyclohexylamine approximately 700 feet further back from its original location in a direction away from the Plant's property line and the Plant's predominant employee population and process control operational areas.  The relocation of this bulk container increased the distance of the toxic endpoint to the Plant's nearest offsite property line by several hundred feet as calculated in the worst case release modeling.  The relocated cyclohexylamine tank storage and process distribution system became active on March 1, 2006.  Training with the local Fire Department has continued annually through the years and will be conducted again in 2011.
