These changes include:\n\n-  Deleting Vinyl Acetate Monomer (VAM) and mono-Isopropylamine (MIPA) from our RMP.  These covered chemicals are no longer stored/handled at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal above threshold quantities.\n-  Revising the operating scenarios for Acrylonitrile and TDI as these two covered chemicals are currently stored in different storage vessels than those represented in previous RMP submissions to the EPA.\n-  Reducing the current on-site volume of Epichlorohydrin as this covered chemical is now stored in a tank with a maximum storage capacity of 1,220,075 pounds (approximately 25 percent of previously represented maximum on-site Epichlorohydrin storage capacity).\n-  Adding 2-Methyl-1-Butene (a RMP regulated flammable chemical), which is up 16 percent of an Isoamylene mixture, for intermodal transfers between rail cars and ISO containers to the facility's flammable release scenario.\n-  Adding Crude Piperzine (which contains up to 20 percent by weight of Ethylenediamine, a RMP regulated toxic substance) direct transfers from rail cars to moored marine vessels to the facility's toxic release scenarios.\n-  Removing the description of the off-site consequence analysis (OCA) from the Executive Summary of this RMP submission.\n-  Adding the e-mail address of the facility emergency contact.\n-  Updating the facility's 5-Year Accident History.\n-  Updating various facility contact information and other pertinent data.\n\n\n?68.155(a):  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nAt Stolthaven Houston Inc. we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes involved in chemical storage and distribut"

This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n- A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n- An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n- A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n- An overview of our emergency response program\n- An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, the environment, and company assets\n- The certification that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide\n- The detailed information (i.e. data elements) about our Risk Management Program\n\n\n?68.155(b):  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nOur facility currently stores Acrylonitrile, Epichlorohydrin, and Toluene-diisocyanate (TDI) in large above ground storage tanks.  These products are received into the Stolthaven Houston Terminal by various modes including tank truck, rail car, barge, and/or marine parcel tanker (ship), are stored for a period of time per customer request, and then are subsequently transferred off-site through one of more of the above-referenced transportation modes.  In addition to the three RMP chemicals currently stored on-site, Stolthaven Houston also performs intermodal (IMO) transfers between ISO Containers and rail cars (with no associated storage) of Isoamylene, which contains up to 16 percent of 2-Methyl-1-Butene, a RMP regulated flammable chemical.  Stolthaven Houston also performs direct transfers from rail cars to moored marine vessels of Crude Piperazine, which contains up to 20 percent of 1,2-Ethylened"

The following is a brief summary of the single accidental chemical release involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five (5) years at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal which resulted in injury:\n\nOn the morning of August 21, 2002 an employee of a construction contractor at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal was sprayed with Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI), a RMP covered chemical.  The incident occurred as the contract employee attempted to remove a blind flange located on a pump discharge line on the facility's TDI circulation system.  The construciton company's foreman was verbally instructed by Stolthaven Houston personnel to remove only the insulation from the exterior of the TDI circulation piping in two locations so that an electrical contractor could later terminate the system's heat tracing; the blind flange in question should never have been removed.  A communications error between Stolthaven Houston Inc., the construction contractor's foreman, and the contractor's employee under his supervision was determined to be the root cause of this incident.\n\nThe blind flange had TDI product behind it that was acidentally released as the contract employee attempted to remove the flange from the system.  The affected individual was taken to the Stolthaven Houston Terminal's safety building where he was decontaminated in a safety shower.  The patient was placed on high flow oxygen at 15 liters per minute and his vital signs were checked every 5 minutes until EMS arrived.  He was then transported to the East Houston Regional Medical Center via ambulance, where the patient was treated and later released and approved for return to work.\n\nAs a result of the incident investigation, safe work permits at the St"

      "SummaryText": "olthaven Houston Terminal are now issued with detailed written instructions describing the work to be performed.\n\nBetween 3 and 5 gallons of TDI was released during this incident.  Due to the small amount of TDI lqiuid released during the incident in question, and because TDI has an extremely low vapor pressure (0.0002 pound per square inch at 68? F) there were no off-site impacts from the referenced TDI release, and no environmental damage resulted from this incident as the release occurred in a contained area.\n\nAll incidents at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal are formally investigated as part of our facility's ISO Quality Management System to identify and correct the root cause(s) of the events and to implement appropriate corrective actions for continuous improvement.\n\n\n?68.155(e):  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting employees, the public, the environment, and company assets during emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the community emergency response plan and the local emergency planning committee (LEPC).\n\nAn Emergency Action Plan (EAP) is maintained which provides guidelines to respond to various emergencies such as fires, hazardous material spills, personal injuries, and property damage that may originate at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal.  \n\n\n?68.155(f):  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe following is a list of improvements that are implemented at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal to prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\n\n- PHA and adaptation of PHA recommendations\n- Continuous improvement through the facility's ISO 9002 Certified Quality Management System (QMS)\n- Employee Suggestion/Experience Feedback Program"
