      "SummaryText": "This executive summary is a brief overview of the Risk Management Program and the associated policies at the Public Service Company of Colorado (PSCo) Baxter Compressor Station.  The facility qualifies for Program Level 1 based on its offsite consequences analysis and that there have been no significant accidental releases of one or more of the regulated substances from a covered process in the five years prior to the submission of this RMP. PSCo management understands its duty to provide a safe working environment and to take measures to prevent accidents that may have an effect on the surrounding community. This understanding is reflected in procedures described and referenced in the RMP manual.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Baxter Compressor Station processes 2-6 mmscf/day of natural gas produced from the Dakota formation in western Colorado.  The station provides compression, dehydration, and recovery of liquid hydrocarbon compounds.  Most of the gas processed at the station is distributed for local residential use.\n\nOne of the two condensate tanks has a maximum intended inventory of 10,822 gallons (54,759 pounds), while the second condensate tank has a maximum intended inventory of 4530 gallons (22,922 pounds).  Filling of the tanks is administratively limited to 80% of the tank capacity by NFPA 58 requirements, as corrected for facility elevation.\n\nThe RMP-regulated portion of the facility starts at the bypass between the dehydrator and the J-T skid.  The RMP-regulated process includes the J-T skid, the dehydrator emission control condenser, and the condensate storage.  Since the BTEX (from the emission control process) and the condensate are co-mingled, the RMP process includes the piping from the condensate storage tanks back toward the BTEX emission control process.  The inclusion of the dehydrator BTEX emission control process stops at the check valve after the pump at the BTEX condenser.  The balance of the facility is regulated under t"

The program is described in detail in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the RMP compliance manual and meets the requirement of 40 CFR 68.95.  The goals of the program are to protect onsite employees from the hazardous effects of chemical releases and to minimize the effects of releases on the general public.  The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect personnel and regulatory changes.\n"
