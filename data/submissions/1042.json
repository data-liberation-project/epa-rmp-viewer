Various metal products are cleaned in acid baths to remove any oxides on the surface and rinsed in batches according to customer orders.  \n\nThe facility is located in an industrial area south of Gage Avenue and west of Alameda Street, in the Huntington Park area.  \n\nThe following AHM is handled at this facility in the maximum amount shown below.\n\nHydrofluoric Acid (70%)                                                      6,000 lb (12  55-gal drums)\n\nConcentrated hydrofluoric acid (70%) is delivered to the facility in 55-gal drums, approximately 12 drums every two weeks. Acid is pumped from the drum to the acid baths using a portable pump and flexible hose when needed.  All drums and baths are located inside a containment area.\n\nAll acid systems including acid baths are operated at room temperature.  Any acid fumes produced in the baths are drawn into a fume scrubber located nearby and scrubbed with dilute caustic solution.\n\nCHEMICAL SAFETY APPROACH AND POLICY\n\nAlloys Cleaning, Inc. is committed to conducting its operations in a manner that is safe both to its workers and to its neighbors.  In order to meet that commitment, the company maintains a number of programs to minimize the hazards presented by the materials noted above.  These programs include release prevention programs, emergency response programs, worker training programs, employee right-to-know programs, and public right-to-know programs.  This document, in part, satisfies the public right-to-know program.\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nUsing software provided by the EPA called RMP*Comp and following the OCA Guidance document, an Off-site consequence analysis was completed for this facility.  The reader will note that the only AHM of concern here is 70% hydrofluoric acid.  The largest container of this material is a 55-gallon drum and this is the basis used for the worst case "

Therefore, the release prevention program for this material is primarily in the training and procedures supplied to the affected employees.  Below is a brief description of the elements of the training system:\n\n1.  The personnel training program will ensure that the facility complies with all elements of hazardous materials and waste laws and regulations.\n2.  The training program will be directed by a person experienced in hazardous materials and waste management procedures, including contingency plan implementation.\n3.  Employees will receive instruction on hazardous materials, safe operating procedures, and waste management practices which relate to their duties at the facility.\n4.  The training program will be designed to ensure that employees will be able to respond effectively to emergencies at the facility.\n5.  Training will include instruction in emergency procedures, and the use of emergency equipment and emergency systems.\n6.  There will be procedures for using, inspecting, repairing and replacing emergency and monitoring equipment at the facility.\n7.  The training program will include:  1) instruction on the use of shutoff systems and communication or alarm systems; 2) response methods for fires or explosions: 3) response methods for releases to storm drains, sewers or surface waters; 4) procedures for operations shutdown; 5) procedures for the proper handling, storing, labeling and disposing of hazardous materials and wastes.\n8.  All employees will be required to complete their hazardous materials and waste training before they begin duties involving these materials.\n9.  Additional training will be provided to personnel when new materials or procedures are introduced and at yearly refresher sessions.\n10.

However, before discussing the procedures, a very important point must be made.  Should an emergency situation occur, \"DO NOT PANIC\"; a clear head is very important in handling any emergency.  The operator(s) on duty should assess the situation, decide on the course to follow and then carry out the plans in an orderly, controlled manner.  The information presented in the following section is designed to aid the operator in answering emergencies; however, it should be remembered that the operator(s) is the only one who can assess the situation as it occurs.  Therefore, should the operator feel that a change in procedure is justified due to the events as they happen, he should make the changes required.\n\nSAFETY\n\nAll personnel should be familiar with the Material Safety Data Sheets for the subject materials.\nHydrofluoric acid is nonflammable, but has a lower boiling point (1510F) and is highly reactive.  Both liquid and vapors of hydrofluoric acid can cause severe burns which may not be immediately painful or visible.  Hydrofluoric acid will penetrate skin and attack underlying tissues and bone.  Solutions as dilute as 2% or lower may cause burns.  Large burns may also cause hypocalcemia and other systemic effects which may be fatal.\n\nPersonal protect"

The minimum protection suggested for operating and maintenance personnel includes:  chemical safety goggles, hard hat, safety shoes, long-sleeved shirt and trousers of wool, DACRON\\ polyester, or ORLON\\ acrylic fiber.  A rubber apron and rubber gloves with gauntlets long enough to cover the forearm provide additional protection when there is a possibility of body contact.  A face shield in combination with chemical splash goggles can also be worn for additional protection.  This safety equipment is located near the chemical storage area.\n\nIn emergencies or in performing work where there is possibility of considerable exposure, a full rubber suit with hood should be worn.  Air should be supplied to the hood until absence of fumes in the work area has been established.  Standby respiratory equipment should be easily accessible in all areas where the subject materials are handled (unloading stations, storage areas, etc.).  \nEmergency eyewash/safety showers are located and operational at the acid area.  Water is supplied to the showers using a 2-inch line (minimum pressure 30 psig) through a quick-opening valve which stays open.  \n\nHANDLING AND CLEANUP OF LEAKS OR SPILLS\n\nCompany manuals include a spill clean-up procedure.  \n\nNOTIFICATION\n\nIn the event of a significant spill outside of the design containment area, the Operator or his designated representative shall make the notifications listed in the table below. \n\nEARTHQUAKE\n\nIn the event of an earthquake, there is nothing the operator can do while the quake is happening, save protect himself from injury.

All planned actions have been completed that were named in that underlying and original document.  It should be noted; however, that the manufacturing processes that utilize hydrofluoric acid are undergoing a major retooling, involving the construction of an entirely new facility that will radically affect safety for the better.  The expected completion is set for fall of 1999.  This RMP will have to be updated and revised at that time."
