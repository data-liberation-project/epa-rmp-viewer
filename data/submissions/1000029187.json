High pressure gas from the wells is sent to a high pressure separator with the gas being routed to a glycol contact tower for drying and is then routed to the inlet of the gas plant.  The gas plant strips out NGL liquids which are stored in two 48,000 gallon pressurized bullet tanks operating at approximately 200 psig.  Liquids from the high pressure separator are routed to lower pressure separation vessels and the oil product is stored in one 1,000 barrel skim tank and two 400 barrel bulk atmospheric storage tanks. The facility is subject to the RMP requirements since it is a natural gas processing plant producing NGL and contains threshold quantities of regulated substances The NGL and oil products are a mixture of hydrocarbons consisting of methane, ethane, butane, isobutane, propane, pentane, and isopentane. For purposes of determining the largest weight on site, the highest density substance was used (butane for NGL and pentane for condensate).\n\n\n\nSince this facility is a Program 2, a documented prevention program is required.  This program is discussed in a \"Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance Manual\" along with a Operations and Maintenance Manual prepared for the facility.  The prevention program does discuss both NGL and condensate which are the specific chemicals contained in an amount above the threshold quantity\n\n\n\nThe facility has not experienced a release as defined in the regulation within the past five years.\n\n\n\nSince this facility is a Program 1, a written prevention plan is not required.  Emergency response procedures have been developed and are contained at the front of this plan and these procedures will be implemented in the event of an "
