This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation,operation and maintenance of our LP Storage facility. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES \n\n\n\nThe LP Storage facility, located at 3051 North Ventura Ave in Ventura, California stores and transfers a flammable mixture mainly containing butane and propane which is produced at Aera Energys Gas Processing Plant (Plant 7)and is known as BP Mix. This facility unloads these products through a loading rack into Tanker Transports.  \n\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release incident at the NGL storage facility is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank of BP Mix.  The release amount would be 130,000 pounds, which is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a VCE.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.40 miles. Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at this facility is a vapor cloud fire due to a BP Mix connection line failure due to maintenance error, corrosion, external impact or vandalism. A release may occur of 970 pounds per minute for up to an hour when facility is unattended. The flammable cloud may t"

A sustained release may occur if the facility is unattended and the wind is blowing the vapors away from any gas detectors. \n\n\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the facility. Because processes at the Storage facility are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agencys (EPA) risk management program (RMP) regulation , they are also subject to Cal/OSHA's process safety management (PSM) standard. This summary addresses each of the PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention plan.\n\n\n\n\n\nManagement System for RMP and PSM\n\n\n\nAera Ventura Operations has developed a management system in order to define all elements required by the process safety standard and risk management program. The management system defines for each program element the following:\n\n1.Purpose and scope of element\n\n2.Specific procedures\n\n3.Responsible and accountable personnel using a RACI (responsible, accountable, consult, \n\n  and inform) chart, \n\n4.Verification and measurement metrics\n\n5.Feedback mechanism\n\n6.Document locations for applicable documents\n\n\n\nThe management system is available for review at either facility.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nAera Energy Ventura Operations encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information, to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as a part of the LP storage facility (Plant 6) and the Gas Processing plant (Plant 7) accident prevention program.  Specific ways that em"

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific personnel within the facilities are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the management system.\n\n\n\n\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations is provided in safety data sheets (SDS's). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g. pressure, tank levels, temperature) in a key process parameter document. The facility ensures that process is maintained within these limits using process controls, and monitoring instruments, trained personnel, automated shutdown systems.\n\n\n\nThe Storage facility maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate safeguards are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nAera's Ventura plants primarily use the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis in recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. A team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise conducts the analyses.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well accident prevention and mitigation measures.

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Aera's facilities have implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in plant operations if they not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g. through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify the operator understood the training.\n\n \n\nContractors\n\n\n\nAera Energy uses contractors to supplement its workforce for maintenance, inspection and construction activities.

This is accomplished by providing contractors with \n\n(1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, Aera evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Plant personnel periodically monitor and audit contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations through the internal safety and environmental auditing process.\n\n\n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews(PSSR's)\n\n\n\nBoth Aera facilities conduct a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for start up prior to placing equipment into service. The review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention programs are properly implemented.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity (MI)\n\n\n\nAera's facilities have established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems are in a safe operating condition.

Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g. adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a significant deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back in service, or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\n\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. Aera Ventura Operations incorporate quality assurance measures into the equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\n\n\nAera's safe work practices are in place to help ensure worker and process safety.

The following is a description of the existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\n\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-covered processes at Aera Ventura Operating Area. Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\n\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\n\n\nThe Ventura NGL Storage facility has safety features on many processes to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) to reduce the consequences of a release. The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\n\n\nRelease Detection\n\n\n\n1.Hydrocarbon (LEL) gas detectors provide alarms and subsequent actuation of shutdown valves(SDV's)\n\n\n\n2.Low pressure alarms and subsequent actuation of shutdown valves(SDV's) for loading rack and product pipelines\n\n\n\n3.High pressure alarms and subsequent act"

The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of fire or explosion.  The plans address response for credible events, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plan and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies, post incident clean up and decontamination. Primary public response agencies are Ventura County Fire Department and Ventura City Fire Department (by automatic aid). \n\n\n\nIn addition, both plants have scheduled proc"
