The comprehensive accidental release prevention program covers areas such as safety, hazard analysis, operating procedures, maintenance and employee training  associated with the processes at the facility.  The effective emergency response plan covers response procedures such as pre-emergency employee training, lines of authority, emergency recognition, evacuation routes and procedures and emergency medical treatment.  It is the Town of Kingstree's policy to implement appropriate measures to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\nThe Town of Kingstree Wastewater Treatment Plant has one (2) regulated substance at the facility above the threshold quantity.  The regulated substances are chlorine with a threshold quantity of 1,500 pounds, and Sulfur Dioxide with a threshold quantity of 1,000 pounds.  Chlorine is used in the wastewater treatment process at the facility, as is Sulfur Dioxide for the de-chlorination in the treatment process.  There are five (5) one ton cylinders and six (6) 150-pound cylinders of chlorine at the facility.  Therefore, the maximum amount of Chlorine handled is 10,900 pounds. There are two (2) one ton cylinders of Sulfur Dioxide at the facility. Hence, the maximum amount of Sulfur Dioxide handled is 4,000 pounds. The  Town of Kingstree is mandated to meet Program 3 requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION \r\nThe Town of Kingstree has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.
