The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe facility\u0092s systems and practices are designed to achieve compliance with EPA\u0092s RMP rule and OSHA\u0092s PSM standard. This facility was upgraded in 2018 and includes several safety features, as discussed below.\nThe butane unloading rack is equipped with break-away type hoses that instantly discharge and stop product flow in the event of a hose failure. Check valves are located downstream of transfer hose connections and upstream of the injection point in process piping to prevent reverse flow of butane back into the railcar and reverse flow of regular unleaded gasoline into the butane process piping, respectively. Procedures are in place to limit personnel and contractors accessing the unloading rack whenever butane is on-site and/or in process of transfer to the injection point, and detailed procedure training provides operators with the attitude, awareness, and competency required to safely transfer butane. Furthermore, the unloading area is equipped with a gas detection system that will detect, alarm, and allow for rapid and effective intervention to mitigate the combustible gas hazards. The detection system is interlocked to shutdown the process upon exceedance of gas sensor setpoints.\n\n4. Five-year Accident History\nThere have been no accidental releases in the past five years. Engineering controls and employee awareness have played a key role in the success of the facility\u0092s safety record.\n\n5. The Emergency Response Plan\nThe facility\u0092s ICP includes response actions for site personnel for multiple types of emergencies and complies with requirements of OSHA, EPA, United States Coast Guard (USCG), and Georgia Environmental Protection Division (EPD). The primary elements of the plan include emergency reporting"

      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\nColonial Terminals, Inc. owns and operates a bulk storage and warehousing facility in Savannah, Georgia which has EPA Systems Facility Identifier number 100000180074. The plant receives butane via railcar and injects it into gasoline to alter the Reid Vapor Pressure. The butane unloading process up to the injection point (i.e., Butane Injection System) is subject to EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations as well as OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulatory requirements. The facility\u0092s RMP has been reviewed/revised and is being resubmitted in accordance with the five-year update requirements per \u00a7 68.190.\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nColonial Terminals, Inc. is dedicated to providing a safe and healthy work environment for all its employees. The plant has developed and implemented a Process Safety/Risk Management Program for the Butane Injection System that consists of the following elements: Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), Operating Procedures, Training, Mechanical Integrity, Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Incident Investigation, Hot Work Permitting, Contractor Safety and Compliance Audits. A management team consisting of qualified management personnel located onsite is responsible for enforcement and oversight of the elements of the Process Safety/Risk Management Program.\nFurthermore, the facilities\u0092 Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) is designed to minimize potential hazards to human health and the environment from fires, explosions, or any unplanned release of hazardous material to air, soil, or surface water. \n\n2. The Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\nThe Butane Injection System is designed to alter the Reid Vapor Pressure of gasoline stored in atmospheric storage tanks at the site. This process involves unloading butane from railcars and transferring to the injection point through process piping. The injection point is cons"
