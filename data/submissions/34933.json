If an accidental release should occur, our facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n2.  FACILITY INFORMATION\n     The primary activity of our facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The maximum quantity stored would be 433,372           pounds in our 30,000 gallon storage tank, portable nurse tanks, and in rail cars.\n3.  A WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n     A.  The worst case release scenario would be the release of the entire contents of the storage tank over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity would be 131,300 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to toxic endpoint is 2.6 miles.\n     B.  The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to toxic endpoint is 0.46 mile.\n4.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n     Our facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K61.1\" published by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the Standard of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29CFR 1910.111 \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" as well as all applicable rules and regulations under the Iowa Fertilizer Law.\n5.  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n     There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that; have caused any deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property or environmental damage."

The facility has written action plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard CFR 1910.38 which is reviewed with all employees on an annual basis.\n     B.  A copy of the Emergency Planning and Right to Know information as required under Sara Title III (EPCRA) has been supplied to all state and local authorities.\n7.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n     Safety improvement is an on-going process at our facilities.  Periodic evaluations are performed to access the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
