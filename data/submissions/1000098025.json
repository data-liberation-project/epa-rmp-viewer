The following table lists the maximum Utah Olympic Park quantity on site, the EPA threshold quantities (TQ), and the OSHA TQ for ammonia:\r\n\r\nTable I: Utah Olympic Park Bobsled Track Quantities\r\nCAS No.\tCHEMICAL NAME\tEPA TQ (lb)\tOSHA TQ (lb)\tUtah Olympic Park (lb)\r\n7664-41-7\tAmmonia (Anhydrous)\t10,000\t10,000\t110,000\r\n\r\nAs shown in the table, ammonia is used by the Utah Olympic Park above the threshold quantities for the EPA and OSHA.  The total amount of ammonia is contained in two (2) ammonia storage containers and system piping. \r\n\r\nThe ammonia in the refrigeration system is composed of vapor and liquid under pressure. An accidental release could occur due to any of the following situations:\r\n\r\n1.\tMechanical damage due to forklift or other equipment malfunction\r\n2.\tPipe corrosion\r\n3.\tMaintenance oversight\r\n4.\tHigh pressure due to a sensor malfunction\r\nSeveral systems are already in place at the Utah Olympic Park to reduce the risk of an accidental release.  Isolation valves are located in strategic places around the \r\n\r\nIn the case of an accidental release, an emergency response program is in place to notify authorities and the public.  Even in the event of a worst case release of all the ammonia in the system, there will be limited effect on public receptors. The strong odor of ammonia will also aid in the quick notification of authorities in the event of an accidental release, further mitigating the risk. \r\n\r\nA PHA of the process was conducted in April 14, 2017 by L.A.
