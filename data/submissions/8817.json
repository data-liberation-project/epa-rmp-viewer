We are committed to the safety and well being of our employees, community and the environment.  Through regular safety training in areas such as hazard awareness, daily operating guidelines, and worker protection Country Star employees have minimized any potential risk of a hazardous release due to human error.  If an accident were to occur, our emergency response policies would take effect to ensure the proper calls were made and emergency response crews would respond in a timely manner.\n\nThe New Washington facility is located on the south side of New Washington.  The facility is equiped to handle fertilizer, crop protection products, retail fuel, and also has a grain facility.  Anhydrous Ammonia is a fertilizer used by area farmers as the most economical source of nitrogen used to grow crops.  The maximum quantity of Anhydrous stored at the facility is 25,500 gallons or 131,000 pounds in a single 30,000-gallon tank.\n\nThe worst-case scenario would be a total release of the entire tank filled to capacity.  The tank would rupture and the entire contents release in a matter of 10 minutes.  The total impact zone that the cloud would cover to an end point of 200ppm would be approximately 1.2 miles under certain weather conditions.  If this were to happen the entire town of New Washington including Buckeye Central High School and Junior High, St. Bernards school and church, St. Johns and New Washington Methodist Church could all be affected.  Several businesses in the area are also in the zone such as Cranberry Hills, Buckeye Steel Rule, Stump Distributing, Studer Obringer, Mansfield Brass, Ohio Foam, Harold Printing, CE White, Crest Bending, Farmers State Bank and 1st Federal Svaings and Loan.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for a tank of this use would be a release of Anhydrous through a transfe hose either due to a bad hose, connection"

The distance to end point is .78 mile.  Population affected by this scenario is 92 people or 33 households.  This will also affect Buckeye Central High school and Junior High, St. Bernards, St. Johns, and New Washington Methodist Church. Area Business includes Stump Distributing, Studer Obringer, Mansfield Brass, Ohio Foam, Harold Printing, CE White, Crest Bending, Farmers State Bank, and 1st Federal Savings and Loan.\n\nCountry Star Co-op has never had a release of Anhydrous from a storage tank that ever caused any deaths, injuries, or property damage to the facility or the environment.\n\nA written Emergency Response plan that complies with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38 has been implemented and is retrained annually.  New hires will receive training as part of their new employee orientation.  State and local authorities are provided with all pertinent information so that emergency planning and community right-to-know information can be obtained and used, this is known as SARA Title III.\n\nIt is the policy of Country Star to remain proactive in accident prevention and to minimize any potential loss in the event of a release.  Safety improvement is an ongoing process at the facility.  State and local agencies will continue to conduct yearly inspections and repair requirements.  Through regular maintenance, and routine inspections we will continue to run a safe business."
