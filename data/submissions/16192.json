The RMProgram includes modifications to the existing program that AVEK has in place for handling regulated chemicals at the Rosamond Water Treatment Plant.\n\nFacility Background\nThe Rosamond Water Treatment Plant is a unit of the AVEK water treatment and transmission system.  As part of the Agency's facilities, it performs the function of treating water supplied from the California Aqueduct.  The Rosamond Water Treatment Plant is located to the West of Freeway 14 within the community of Rosamond.  The water treatment plant is located on approximately 45 acres.  \nThe Rosamond Water Treatment Plant was commissioned in 1978.  It is designed to treat 14 million gallons of water per day.  The Rosamond Water Treatment Plant monitors raw water quality and provides treatment so that the treated water delivered to consumers meets or exceeds state water quality standards.\n\nChlorination and Storage\nChlorine is one of the regulated chemicals subject to the EPA's new Risk Management Program.  It is both stored and used at the Rosamond Water Treatment Plant site.  The chlorine is vital in the treatment of raw water, playing a number of different roles in water treatment processes, such as taste and odor control, color removal, and as an aid to filtration.  Its primary role is as a disinfectant, removing harmful bacteria and viruses from the water supply.\nChlorine in the form of liquid/gas is stored in 1-ton pressurized containers.  There is only one location on the plant site where chlorine is stored, the chlorine storage room.  The chlorine gas is transferred from the storage containers through 1-inch piping to a point where it is dissolved and diluted into a water stream in the chlorine feeder room.  This is accomplished with v"

      "SummaryText": "acuum operated regulators that keep the chlorine gas under vacuum until it is drawn into water to form chlorine solution.  From this point the chlorine solution leaves the chemical feed area and travels on to various injection points.\nThe chlorination system is installed within two separate rooms:  the chlorine storage room and the chlorination equipment room.  Up to six 1-ton containers can be stored within the chlorine storage room.  The chlorination equipment room contains the chlorine metering equipment.  The chlorine containers supply chlorine gas through a vacuum regulator valve located on the tank, a chlorinator (device for supplying a measured amount of chlorine), and injectors.  Typically, two or three chlorinators are connected in parallel upstream of the injectors.  The injectors are the primary functional components of the chlorination system.  As water flows through the injectors, it creates a vacuum that enables the chlorinators to meter chlorine gas through the system.  At each injector, the chlorine mixes and dissolves into the water to form a diluted chlorine solution.  These facilities are equipped with automatic switch over so that when a chlorine tank is emptied the standby tank vacuum valve will respond and continue chlorine feed to the system.  In this diluted state, the chlorine is no longer considered acutely hazardous.  The chlorine solution is piped out of the chlorine equipment room into the plant where it is used in the treatment process to provide a residual chlorine concentration in the treated water flow stream. \n\nOff-Site Consequence Analysis\nIn order to determine the safety issues surrounding the use of chlorine at the Rosamond Water Treatment Plant, an off-site consequence analysis (OCA) was performed for the facility.  The purpose of the OCA is to model both a worst-case and alternative release scenario that could occur at the facility and then determine the effects that these releases would have on the surrounding population and e"

      "SummaryText": "nvironment.\nThe release scenarios for the Rosamond Water Treatment Plant were based on the OCA models provided in the AWWA Compliance Guidance and Model Risk Management Program for Water Treatment Plants.  The covered chlorination process at the Rosamond Water Treatment Plant was analyzed for chemical inventory and facility layout in order to determine which Guidance model would best represent the potential release scenarios at the facility.  In order to be conservative, no active or passive mitigation measures were considered in the analysis of the release scenarios.  The distances to toxic endpoint provided in the Guidance are based on the ALOHA Modeling System.  According to the EPA Federal Register 40CFR, the toxic endpoint for chlorine is considered to be 0.0087 mg/L.\n7 Worst-Case Release Scenario:  For the Rosamond Water Treatment Plant, the worst-case scenario was considered to be the catastrophic failure of one 1-ton chlorine container as a result of faulty construction, impact, or corrosion.  The result of the failure is that the entire content of the container, 2000 pounds of chlorine, are emptied into the atmosphere over a period of ten minutes.  Due to the location of the facility in a populated area, the released chlorine gas would reach nearby off-site public receptors.\n7 Alternative Release Scenario:  For the Rosamond Water Treatment Plant, the alternative release scenario, which is considered to be more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario, was considered to be the failure of a 1-inch schedule 80 pipe that connects two 1-ton chlorine containers.  The result of the failure is that a portion of the gas content in each container empties through the 1-inch pipe.  Therefore, 634 pounds of chlorine are emptied into the atmosphere over a period of 27.1 minutes.  Due to the location of the facility in a populated area, the released chlorine gas would reach nearby off-site public receptors.\n\nPrevention Program\nIn order to reduce the risks associated w"
