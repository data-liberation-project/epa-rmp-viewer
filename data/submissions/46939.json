Due to our stringent release prevention policies, no accidental releases have occurred or were identified within the time period in question.  Since the facility has been in operation, no deaths or injuries have resulted from the accidental release, explosion, or fire involving this regulated substance.  Furthermore, no fish kills or other environmental impacts have resulted from an accident or spill incident at the Goose Creek, South Carolina facility.\n\nOff-site Consequence Analysis\n\nThe Berkeley County has calculated a worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario based on the EPA approved RMP*Comp modeling software.  Details for each chosen scenario have been provided in the following paragraphs.\n\nChlorine \nThe worst-case release scenario, as developed for the chlorination system, involves a catastrophic release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine from a single chlorine cylinder within the chlorine building.  It has been assumed that the entire quantity of chlorine is released as a gas over a 10 minute time frame as a result of a tank rupture.  Under worst-case weather conditions, the maximum distance of 2.2 miles corresponds to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/l.  Industrial facilities, a U.S. Naval Weapons Station, military barracks, residential subdivisions, creeks, rivers, and the Berkeley Reservation would be affected by such a release.\n\nAn alternative scenario may include the catastrophic release of chlorine gas during 3 m/s windspeeds, D Class atmospheric stability, and 77 degrees fahrenheit weather conditions. It has been assumed that a quantity of chlorine gas is released at a rate of 3.3 pounds per minute from the storage cylinders as a result of a pipe rupture within the chlorination building.  The facility's hazard response team would control the release by preventing flow through the pip"

This cooperative approach includes the following:\n\n1. Alert employees of the potential hazard and evacuate all employees from the area. \n2. Dial 911 to alert local response agencies of the event. \n3. Contact representatives at the U.S. Naval Weapons Station. \n4. Supervisors or management will ensure all employees exit the facility in a safe manner. \n5. The emergency response team shall evaluate the release event and repair any damage when possible. 6.

We are strongly committed to safety by maintaining comprehensive maintenance, prevention, and industrial safety programs that protect against any accidentla release or spill which may result in on-site or off-site consequences.\n\nIn the unlikely event of a mishap, an emergency response plan has been developed in cooperation with the Berkeley County Disaster Preparedness Agency, which serves to ensure the safety and well being of the community and the environment. Our emergency response program is based upon the recommendations by The Chlorine Institute, Inc. within the Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities.\n\nFacility Description\n\nChlorine is stored on-site for use in the disinfection process for the treatment of wastewater prior to final discharge. Six 2,000-pound pressurized chlorine cylinders are located within an enclosed building south of the treatment ponds for use in the treatment process.  An additional six to eight 150-pound chlorine cylinders are stored on-site prior to transport to other facilities.  The latest technology in process control systems are present in the chlorine storage area to minimize and prevent the impacts of any spillage, fire, explosion, or equipment failure.\n\nWithin the dechlorination process, four 2000-pound storage cylinders supply gaseous sulfur dioxide, that when mixed with the treated wastewater, facilitates the removal of any residual chlorine following the chlorination process.  An additional six to eight 150-pound cylinders are stored on-site prior to transport to other facilities.  The latest technology in process control systems are present in the chlorine storage area to minimize and prevent the impacts of any spillage, fire, explosion, or equipment"

It has been assumed that the entire quantity of sulfur dioxide is released as a gas over a 10 minute time frame as a vapor cloud resulting from the rupturing tank.  Under worst-case weather conditions, the maximum distance of 2.1 miles corresponds to the toxic endpoint of 0.0078 mg/l.  Within this 2.1 mile radius, public and environmental receptors including affected industrial facilities, a U.S. Naval Weapons Station, military barracks, residential subdivisions, creeks, rivers, and the Berkeley Reservation would be affected.\n\nThe alternative release scenario has been modeled as the catastrophic release of sulfur dioxide gas during 3 m/s windspeed.
