The Hazard Assessment was conducted as an initial screening procedure as part of determining into which Program Level (I, II, or III) the WTP falls.\r\nResidences lie within the EPA-defined endpoint concentrations of the WTP's Worst-Case releases. Therefore, the plant is ineligible for Program I. Because Texas public utilities are currently excluded from Program III, the WTP is included in Risk Management Program II. The Hazard Assessment is provided in Chapters 1 through 3.\r\n\r\nWorst Case Scenario\r\nThe Worst Case Scenario was defined as a ton container (2,000 pounds) of chlorine being released by a catastrophic event within a 10 minute duration. Mitigation factor of 0.55 was allowed for this process due to the enclosure covering it. This scenario was developed and modeled using the EPA approved dense gas dispersion model DEGADIS 2.1. The toxic endpoint for chlorine was determined to be 1.55 miles.\r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenario\r\nThe Alternative Release Scenario of chlorine was also modeled using DEGADIS. Source term estimation of approximately 175 pounds released was derived from a scenario of pressurized flexible tubing failure. The dispersion model estimated the 3 ppm chlorine footprint to extend to 0.26 miles.\r\n\r\n5 Year Accident History\r\nNo accidents have occurred at the plant involving either onsite or offsite consequences within the last five years.\r\n\r\nManagement Program\r\nThe Management Program consists of the Document Management System described below.\r\n\r\nDocument Management System\r\nA Document Management System was established to attribute responsibility for the development, implementation, and maintenance of the Risk Management Program.

The team consisted of facility management, process operating and maintenance experts, outside process design engineers, and consultants knowledgeable in the Hazard Review process itself. The Hazard Review technique used was a hybrid Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP), in the form of a What If analysis. The What If was developed from HAZOP experience at similar treatment facilities.\r\n\r\nRecommendations\r\nThe result of the Hazard Review is a set of recommendations for the plant to implement. The Rule under 40 CFR 68.50 requires the City of Cedar Park to ensure that problems identified are resolved in a timely manner. For those items that cannot be promptly resolved, it is recommended that a schedule be developed that addresses those issues, with personnel responsibility assigned for each.\r\nThe Plant recommendations were developed by the Hazard Review Team with a consensus from all team members. The results of the Hazard Review were tabulated and a summary of the recommendations is provided below. Recommendations made during subsequent meetings of City staff, as described in the following chapters, are also included.\r\n\r\nAdministrative and Operational Recommendations\r\nVendor audits were recommended to verify quality assurance and quality control on chlorine packaging. The City of Cedar Park should be interested in container hydrostatic testing and pre-shipment inspection. Look for inspection reports from appropriate oversight agencies. If at all possible, it was recommended to investigate contractual control over the vendor. In other words, use contract language and specifications to ensure the arrival of safe ton containers along with high-quality chlorine. Hold the supplier responsible for liability and monetary damages associated with defective ton c"

In addition, a lock box containing a treatment plant access card should be available at the front-gate for use by emergency responders. In case the lock box does not work, a key pad controlling door access should be installed for use by emergency responders at the front gate and treatment plant buildings.\r\n\r\n\r\nTraining Recommendations\r\nCertain hazards reviewed can be mitigated through training. Training is covered in detail in Chapter 8, but the following were highlighted during Hazard Review as particularly important to operating/maintenance personnel, and the community.\r\nThe first, and most general, is to verify training on plant operating and maintenance procedures. These procedures were developed in conjunction with the plant operating and maintenance staff and should incorporate all of the safety concerns that arose during the Hazard Review.\r\nEnsure operators understand the hazard associated with exposing oil, grease, petroleum products, or other combustibles to chlorine gas. Use only non-reactive, approved lubricants on the chlorination system. Use good housekeeping in the area, and store no combustibles around the chlorination equipment.\r\nFinally, ensure that the City's Emergency Response policy is implemented and the staff traine"

These studies should compare various configurations, as well as equipment manufacturers and models, with both economic and non-economic costs.\r\nEvaluate on-site chlorine generation. \r\nEvaluate overnight staffing levels.\r\n\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nChlorination System Operating Procedures have been amended for the WTP.

It is comprised of Safety Information, Hazard Review, Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Incident Investigation, and Compliance Audit procedures. Each has an entire chapter devoted to it in this RMP, and is described in more detail below.\r\n\r\nSafety Information\r\nSafety Information is divided between Chemical Safety Information, and Process Safety Information.  Each is described below.\r\n\r\nChemical Safety Information\r\nComprehensive chemical data is provided in this section to include regulatory reporting and action thresholds, health hazards and chemical exposure limitations, as well as detailed physical properties of each regulated substance. This information was compiled from numerous sources, and is intended to be a one-stop source for the reader seeking data on these substances. The physical data will provide useful information in the inevitable event the plant processes are modified, thereby requiring revisited dense gas dispersion modeling.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nProcess Safety Information was meticulously compiled on each system studied. Specifications are collocated in one place for easy reference. Details such as Maximum Intended Inventory, Safe Upper and Lower Temperatures, Safe Upper and Lower Pressures, and Codes and Standards Used to Design, Build and Operate the Process are provided in this section. Used as a training reference, together with the Process Schematics located in the Appendi"

      "SummaryText": "f any release involving either the chlorine system. The Incident Investigation Program outlines key milestones that must be accomplished within 24 hours of any covered incident, and the actions that must occur subsequently. Ultimately, it is desired that the plant learn from the incident and take action to prevent similar incidents in the future. Incident Investigation Report Forms are included, and must be maintained for a minimum of five years after each incident.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nInternal Compliance Audits must be conducted every three years to verify compliance with the programs and procedures contained in this document. The WTP Superintendent must certify that the Risk Management Program team has evaluated compliance with the provisions of the Program, and verify that the procedures and practices are adequate and are being followed. Audit Report Forms are provided, the two most recent of which must always be maintained. This means that in the year 2018, the Compliance Audit Report for the year 2012 may be discarded.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nThe Emergency Response Program is included as part of the Risk Management Program, in case a significant release ever occurs. As in all the above programs, it is important to review this program regularly. The Rule, 40 CFR 68.95 requires training for all employees in relevant procedures of the Emergency Response Program.\r\nIt is recommended that training on the specific plant procedures take place upon initial employment and every three years thereafter, as with most of the other RMP training programs. Other training recommendations, i.e., OSHA 8, 24, and 40 hour training are discussed in the Emergency Response Program as appropriate to the level of response.\r\n\r\nRisk Management Plan\r\nA copy of the Risk Management Plan is provided in the final section. As stated previously, this document is public information. Its purpose is submission to the EPA to be uploaded on a public-access database. No other portion of the"
