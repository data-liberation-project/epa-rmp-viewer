An outline of the RMP is provided in Figure ES-1.

The technical information herein may be used as a training reference in initial and recurring operator and maintenance training. Training on process fundamentals, operations, and maintenance, coupled with the recommended process modifications discussed below, will reduce the potential hazards to plant personnel and the surrounding community.\n\nAn Emergency Response Program and an Incident Investigation Program are included. These two programs should be an integral part of both initial and recurring training.\n\nA Risk Management Plan (Plan), as required by the EPA, is included at the end of the main body of this document. It consists of a summary of data elements that must be submitted to the EPA which will eventually be uploaded onto a public access data base. The Plan has an Executive Summary that follows a required EPA format, and is intended to inform the public of the WTP's proactive stance toward protection of the environment and the surrounding community.\n\n\n\nHazard Assessment\n\nThe Hazard Assessment is comprised of a Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenario each for the chlorine system, as "

The Hazard Assessment was conducted as an initial screening procedure as part of determining into which Program Level (I, II, or III) the WTP falls.\n\nResidences lie within the EPA-defined endpoint concentrations of the WTP's Worst-Case releases. Therefore, the plant is ineligible for Program I. Because Texas public utilities are currently excluded from Program III, the WTP is included in Risk Management Program II. The Hazard Assessment is provided in Chapters 1 through 3.\n\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario was defined as a ton container (2,000 pounds) of chlorine being released by a catastrophic event within a 10 minute duration. Mitigation factor of 0.55 was allowed for this process due to the enclosure covering it. This scenario was developed and modeled using the EPA approved dense gas dispersion model DEGADIS 2.1. The toxic endpoint for chlorine was determined to be 1.55 miles.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario of chlorine was also modeled using DEGADIS. Source term estimation of approximately 175 pounds released was derived from a scenario of pressurized flexible tubing failure. The dispersion model estimated the 3 ppm chlorine footprint to extend to 0.26 miles.\n\n\n\n5 Year Accident History\n\nNo accidents have occurred at the plant involving either onsite or offsite consequences within the last five years.\n\n\n\nManagement Program\n\nThe Management Program consists of the Document Management System described below.\n\n\n\nDocument Management System\n\nA Document Management System was established to attribute responsibility for the development, implementation, and maintenance of the Risk Management Program. The Program must be updated every three years, or any time a covered process undergoes a physical or administrative modification. The Document Management System is largely a function of the Risk Management Program Team, listed below in Table ES-2.\n\n\n\nRisk Management Program Team\n\n"

The team consisted of facility management, process operating and maintenance experts, outside process design engineers, and consultants knowledgeable in the Hazard Review process itself. The Hazard Review technique used was a hybrid Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP), in the form of a \"What If\" analysis. The \"What If\" was developed from HAZOP experience at similar treatment facilities.\n\n\n\nRecommendations\n\nThe result of the Hazard Review is a set of recommendations for the plant to implement. The Rule under 40 CFR 68.50 requires the City of Cedar Park to ensure that problems identified are \"resolved in a timely manner.\" For those items that cannot be promptly resolved, it is recommended that a schedule be developed that addresses those issues, with personnel responsibility assigned for each.\n\nThe Plant recommendations were developed by the Hazard Review Team with a consensus from all team members. The results of the Hazard Review were tabulated and a summary of the recommendations is provided below. Recommendations made during subsequent meetings of City staff, as described in the following chapters, are also included.\n\n\n\nAdministrative and Operational Recommendations\n\nVendor audits were recommended to verify quality assurance and quality control on chlorine packaging. The City of Cedar Park should be interested in container hydrostatic testing and pre-shipment inspection. Look for inspection reports from appropriate oversight agencies. If at all possible, it was recommended to investigate contractual control over the vendor. In other words, use contract language and specifications to ensure the arrival of safe ton containers along with high-quality chlorine. Hold the supplier responsible for liability and monetary damages associated with defective ton c"

In addition, a lock box containing a treatment plant access card should be available at the front-gate for use by emergency responders. In case the lock box does not work, a key pad controlling door access should be installed for use by emergency responders at the front gate and treatment plant buildings.\n\n\n\n\n\nTraining Recommendations\n\nCertain hazards reviewed can be mitigated through training. Training is covered in detail in Chapter 8, but the following were highlighted during Hazard Review as particularly important to operating/maintenance personnel, and the community.\n\nThe first, and most general, is to verify training on plant operating and maintenance procedures. These procedures were developed in conjunction with the plant operating and maintenance staff and should incorporate all of the safety concerns that arose during the Hazard Review.\n\nEnsure operators understand the hazard associated with exposing oil, grease, petroleum products, or other combustibles to chlorine gas. Use only non-reactive, approved lubricants on the chlorination system. Use good housekeeping in the area, and store no combustibles around the chlorination equipment.\n\nFinally, ensure that the City's Emergency Response policy is implemented and the staff traine"

Then, evacuate the plant proceeding to the predetermined staging area for roll call, decontamination, and medical treatment.\n\n\n\nRecommendations for Further Study\n\nThe following recommendations have been identified for further study. These studies should compare various configurations, as well as equipment manufacturers and models, with both economic and non-economic costs.\n\nEvaluate on-site chlorine generation. \n\nEvaluate overnight staffing levels.\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nChlorination System Operating Procedures have been amended for the WTP. They provide system descriptions, specifications, and operating procedures for the chlorine system.\n\nProcedures include Initial Startup; Normal, Temporary, Abnormal, Emergency Shutdowns and Operations; Startup Following a Shutdown or Major Change; and Consequences of Deviation. Also included are Troubleshooting Procedures.\n\n\n\nTraining \n\nTraining is required by EPA to be included in the Risk Management Program. A program has been developed with guidelines on how to conduct regular and structured plant training. Training Record Forms are included with the Program for the required training documentation. Additionally, a Training Record has been compiled and included for all affected personnel associated with the covered processes.\n\n\n\nMaintenance\n\nA Maintenance Program has been developed with associated documentation forms. Sound preventive maintenance will reduce potential hazards to personnel onsite, as well as to the off-site public.

Incident Investigation Report Forms are included, and must be maintained for a minimum of five years after each incident.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nInternal Compliance Audits must be conducted every three years to verify compliance with the programs and procedures contained in this document. The WTP Superintendent must certify that the Risk Management Program team has evaluated compliance with the provisions of the Program, and verify that the procedures and practices are adequate and are being followed.
