All chemicals in the Line 1 inventory were removed as of February 2003.  This resulted in the reduction of the total chemicals in Process 2, Polypropylene.  This reduction of chemicals included the elimination Hydrogen Chloride, which was a toxic alternative release.\n\n1. Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies: Huntsman Polymers Odessa is committed to providing a safe, healthy, and environmentally conscious work place for its employees and neighbors.  This is exemplified by Huntsman Odessa having earned OSHA VPP STAR status and ISO 14001 certification.  The Huntsman Odessa facility maintains a working PSM program, which implements a series of steps to prevent potential hazards associated with the process and assures a well-trained workforce.  The PSM program further implements its policies with onsite procedures and manuals.  Huntsman Polymers Odessa participates with community agencies to develop emergency response plans and participates in cooperative training with these agencies.  Since its certification in January 1993, the Odessa Site has been an active participant in the International Standards Organization (ISO) 9002 quality management program.\n\n2. Regulated Substances: Huntsman Polymers Odessa is located in Odessa, Texas.  The Odessa site operates five Program Level 3 processes.  These processes receive, handle, and store flammable hydrocarbon feedstocks for the production of olefins and specialty grade polymers.  End uses include medical and personal care products, electronic cable coatings, adhesives and sealants, as well as boat and vehicle trims.  Huntsman's Odessa site has large volumes of several regulated flammable substances, such as ethane, ethylene, propane, propylene, butane, and butene.  The Odessa site uses small volumes of toxic chemicals, which are consumed in the process.  The toxi"

Offsite Consequence Analysis: The RMP Rule requires offsite consequence analysis (OCA) to be performed to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.  This OCA includes the development of worst and alternantive release scenarios for the release of toxic and flammable substances.  The OCA allows for the consideration of administrative controls in estimating potential scenario impacts.  Distances for worst case and alternative release scenarios in this RMP have been calculated using the methods described in EPA's OCA Guidance Document.  The population within the circles defined by these distances have been calculated using the Landview III program.  For release scenarios where there are no public residences inside the circle, the reported population is zero.\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe worst case scenarios, based upon EPA required assumptions, are highly unlikely and have not occurred at this facility. \n\nThe worst case scenario associated with the release of flammable substances is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE), involving an underground hydrocarbon storage well.\n\nThe worst case scenario associated with the release of a toxic substance is a chlorine vapor release from a chlorine cylinder.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe alternative case scenarios used in this RMP do not take into account existing safety systems and process controls, thus making them extremely liberal.  The one active mitigation considered is the manual isolation of releases after 10 to 20 minutes.  \n\nThe alternantive case scenario for flammable substances is a complete seal failure on the LPG Pump (P-55C) in the Utilities Area.  \n\nThe alternative case scenario for chlorine is a vapor release from a failure of the 3/8 inch tubing off of a cylinder of chlorine.\n\nThe alternative case scenari"

General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps: Following is a brief summary of the elements that Huntsman's Odessa Site has implemented to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements outlined by EPA as well as with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nHuntsman's Odessa site maintains a compilation of current and accurate written safety information to identify and understand the hazards of the process.  This includes information pertaining to:\n- Hazards of regulated substances: For each regulated substance, there is a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS).\n- The technology of the process: Includes a discussion of process chemistry, safe upper and lower limits of temperature and pressure, and analysis of consequences of deviation.\n- Equipment in the process: Includes such information as materials of construction, diagrams of the piping and instrumentation, safety systems, and design codes.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\nHuntsman's Odessa site has performed a process hazard analysis on each process to identify potential hazards, adequacy of the engineering and administrative controls, and ways to minimize those hazards.  Huntsman Odessa utilizes the HAZOP  and What-if/Checklist methodologies, recognized and generally accepted methods for identifying and evalualting hazards in the process.  The Odessa site assigns associates to the HAZOP team who are knowledgeable in the HAZOP methodology and the specific process.  The HAZOP team develops recommendations to reduce the potential hazards which, if approved, are implemented within a reasonable period of time.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nHuntsman Odessa maintains written operating procedures that were developed with the operators to provide clear instruction for safely c"

The procedures are reviewed and revised periodically to ensure their accuracy and completeness.\n\nTRAINING\n\nHuntsman Odessa provides initial training as well as refresher training to associates to assure the required level of skills and knowledge are maintained.  The training emphasizes safety and health hazards, emergency operations, and safe work practices.  All operators receive refresher training at least annually.\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\nHuntsman Odessa has developed written procedures for maintaining the operating components of the process (including pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown system controls, and pumps) through the mechanical integrity program.  The program is comprised of well-trained personnel who follow maintenance, testing, and inspection procedures that ensure proper function of process equipment.\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\n\nHuntsman Odessa has established and implemented written procedures to manage changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures, and any changes to the facility that affect a covered process.  The procedures assure that prior to any change, the following issues are considered: the technical basis for the proposed change, its impact on safety, health, and the environment, any modifications to operating procedures, the necessary time period for the change, and any authorization requirements.  Associates involved in operating a process, as well as maintenance and contract associates whose job will be affected, are informed of and trained in the change.

If any hot work is performed near a covered process, a hot work permit is issued that documents fire prevention and protection requirements for the operation, dates and times authorized for the hot work, and object on which the work is to be performed.  Hot work permits are kept on file until the work is complete.  \n\nCONTRACTORS\n\nHuntsman Odessa has developed procedures and policies for selecting and ensuring contractors are competent,  knowledgeable and can safely perform their work.  Huntsman Odessa provides information to them about hazards associated with their work environment and has developed appropriate safe work practices.  Huntsman Odessa also evaluates the safety programs and performances of contractors as a part of their continued employement. \n\n5. Five Year Accident History: Huntsman Odessa has one accidental release to report for the five-year accident history.  On October 31, 2001, an ethylene/propane release resulted in one on-site injury.  There was no fire, explosion, or property damage.  There were no off-site consequences resulting in deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter-in-place warnings, property damage, or environmental impact. \n\n6. Emergency Response Program:  Huntsman Odessa has a written emergency response program that contains procedures to be followed in case of an accidental release.  These procedures include steps for informing local emergency response agencies and the public.
