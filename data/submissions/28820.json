      "SummaryText": "This is an amended executive summary.  It reflects changes from the closure of Huntsman Polymers Odessa's Line 1 in the Polypropylene Plant.  All chemicals in the Line 1 inventory were removed as of February 2003.  This resulted in the reduction of the total chemicals in Process 2, Polypropylene.  This reduction of chemicals included the elimination Hydrogen Chloride, which was a toxic alternative release.\n\n1. Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies: Huntsman Polymers Odessa is committed to providing a safe, healthy, and environmentally conscious work place for its employees and neighbors.  This is exemplified by Huntsman Odessa having earned OSHA VPP STAR status and ISO 14001 certification.  The Huntsman Odessa facility maintains a working PSM program, which implements a series of steps to prevent potential hazards associated with the process and assures a well-trained workforce.  The PSM program further implements its policies with onsite procedures and manuals.  Huntsman Polymers Odessa participates with community agencies to develop emergency response plans and participates in cooperative training with these agencies.  Since its certification in January 1993, the Odessa Site has been an active participant in the International Standards Organization (ISO) 9002 quality management program.\n\n2. Regulated Substances: Huntsman Polymers Odessa is located in Odessa, Texas.  The Odessa site operates five Program Level 3 processes.  These processes receive, handle, and store flammable hydrocarbon feedstocks for the production of olefins and specialty grade polymers.  End uses include medical and personal care products, electronic cable coatings, adhesives and sealants, as well as boat and vehicle trims.  Huntsman's Odessa site has large volumes of several regulated flammable substances, such as ethane, ethylene, propane, propylene, butane, and butene.  The Odessa site uses small volumes of toxic chemicals, which are consumed in the process.  The toxi"

Offsite Consequence Analysis: The RMP Rule requires offsite consequence analysis (OCA) to be performed to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.  This OCA includes the development of worst and alternantive release scenarios for the release of toxic and flammable substances.  The OCA allows for the consideration of administrative controls in estimating potential scenario impacts.  Distances for worst case and alternative release scenarios in this RMP have been calculated using the methods described in EPA's OCA Guidance Document.  The population within the circles defined by these distances have been calculated using the Landview III program.  For release scenarios where there are no public residences inside the circle, the reported population is zero.\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe worst case scenarios, based upon EPA required assumptions, are highly unlikely and have not occurred at this facility. \n\nThe worst case scenario associated with the release of flammable substances is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE), involving an underground hydrocarbon storage well.\n\nThe worst case scenario associated with the release of a toxic substance is a chlorine vapor release from a chlorine cylinder.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe alternative case scenarios used in this RMP do not take into account existing safety systems and process controls, thus making them extremely liberal.  The one active mitigation considered is the manual isolation of releases after 10 to 20 minutes.  \n\nThe alternantive case scenario for flammable substances is a complete seal failure on the LPG Pump (P-55C) in the Utilities Area.  \n\nThe alternative case scenario for chlorine is a vapor release from a failure of the 3/8 inch tubing off of a cylinder of chlorine.\n\nThe alternative case scenari"
