      "SummaryText": "A.4\t\tExecutive Summary\n\nThe Risk Management Program includes an Executive Summary as required by Section 2745.3 of Title 19, California Code of Regulations and the Federal RMP Guidance.  The Executive Summary provides a discussion of the various Risk Management Program elements as follows:\n\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n2.\tStationary Source Activities\n3.\tRegulated Substances Handled\n4.\tPrevention Program\n5.\tFive-Year Accident History\n6.\tEmergency Response Program\n7.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n8.\tSummary\n\n\nA.4.1\t\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIt is the SCWC policy to comply with all of the regulatory requirements of the California Accidental Release Prevention Program (Cal-ARP).  The Holabird Plant has developed a RMP and Cal-ARP Manual that documents the SCWC policies pertaining to the prevention of accidental releases and emergency response.  Included in the RMP/Cal-ARP Manual is the Management System that includes the applicable operating, maintenance and response procedures, and technical studies such as the Process Hazards Analysis and Offsite Consequence Analysis.\n\n\nA.4.2\t\tStationary Source Activities\n\nThe Holabird Plant is located at 631 S. Sorensen (Highway 111) in Calipatria\n\nChlorine gas is used in the process for disinfection of drinking water.\n\n\nA.4.3\t\tRegulated Substances Handled\n\nThe purpose of chlorination is to disinfect water that is used by the general public (water facilities).  Disinfection involves the addition of chlorine gas to the water to destroy bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens that may cause harm to the public health.\n\nThe chlorine gas system at the SCWC facility uses a vacuum regulator installed at the container to reduce the gas to a vacuum.  The vacuum is produced by an injector placed in the water flow that draws in the gas.  If the vacuum is interrupted, the vacuum regulator will automatically close, thereby greatly enhancing the inherent safety of the sys"

      "SummaryText": "tem.\n\n\nChlorine is delivered by a truck from the vendor and is offloaded from the truck to the chlorine area.  The chlorine containers are stored inside the chlorine building.\n\nThe process consists of the following major equipment and facilities:\n\n\u00bfUp to four chlorine containers (2,000 lbs chlorine each)\n\u00bfVacuum valves\n\u00bfChlorinators\n\u00bfInjectors\n\nAll chlorine equipment is located within the chlorine building.  Plastic tubing delivers the chlorine vapor to the chlorinators.  The injector injects the chlorine gas at three locations; one for the water to effluent and two to the pond.  A piping and instrument diagram is attached at the end of the PHA (Section C).\n\nThe chlorine building is equipped with a chlorine detector made by Capital Controls.  The chlorine detector alarms in the control room and dials out to the service center, which would then page or call the superintendent and/or the operator on call.  Operator rounds are also made twice a day.\n\nThe operator monitors the following variables:\n\n\u00bf Chlorine flow\n\u00bf Status of chlorinators\n\u00bf Status of chlorine detectors\n\u00bf Chlorine scales\n\nOn a weekly basis, operators inspect the following:\n\u00bf Chlorine process equipment\n\u00bf Chlorine handling equipment, including hoist, chain and rail.\n\n\nA.4.4 Prevention Program Summary\n\nImplementation of the Holabird Plant Prevention Program is another important consideration that helps to prevent a release or to minimize the impacts of a release that does occur.  Some of the key elements that are incorporated into the Holabird Plant RMP/Cal-ARP Prevention Program are summarized below.  The prevention program is described in more detail in the Holabird Plant RMP/Cal-ARP Manual Prevention Program section.\n\nProcess Safety Information.  A comprehensive set of process safety information has been compiled for the chlorine system.  The PSI includes data on the chemicals, the equipment and the technology of the process.\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis.  A PHA study was conducted on the chlorine system to"

All safety recommendations are currently being implemented and records are being kept.\n\nOperating Procedures.  An Operations and Maintenance Manual provides detailed written operating procedures for the chlorine system.  Additional procedures are written for unloading chlorine.\n\nTraining.  Training is provided to each operator and maintenance person before they are certified to operate the system.\n\nMaintenance.  All chlorine systems are included in the Holabird Plant maintenance program.  Equipment inspections, testing and preventive maintenance activities are performed following a structured schedule.\n\nCompliance Audits.  A compliance audit procedure was developed for the Cal-ARP program.  It will be used every three years to verify compliance with Cal-ARP regulations.\n\nIncident Investigation.  SCWC routinely investigates any incident or accident that occurs at the Holabird Plant.  The Holabird Plant has an Illness and Injury Prevention Program in place which defines how accidents and incidents are prevented at the Holabird Plant.  The program addresses roles and responsibilities, safety inspections and audits, and safety training programs.\n\nExternal Events Analysis.  External events were considered in the Process Hazard Analysis.  Each external event with the potential to initiate a release was investigated in detail.  A separate seismic study was also conducted and is included in the Cal-ARP Manual.\n\n\nA.4.5 Five-Year Accident History Summary\n\nThe chlorine systems are 15 years old.  During the past five years, there have been no accidents related to the chlorine system.\n\n\nA.4.6 Emergency Response Program Summary\n\nThe Holabird Plant emergency response program is described in the Emergency Response Plan for hazardous materials.  The plan uses a systematic approach for the response based on the following two incident/emergency le"

      "SummaryText": "vels:\n\nIncidental Release \u00bf A minor leak which occurs during normal operation and maintenance activities.\nSuch leaks can occur from a faulty gasket setting, a container valve packing gland problem, or a valve that is not seated properly.  With this level of incident an operator or maintenance technician would be on hand to attend to the leak.  Incidental releases are those that can be stopped quickly with routine O&M actions such as closing a valve or tightening a connection.  For this reason, incidental releases are called \u00bfcontrolled releases.\u00bf\n\nEmergency Release \u00bf An uncontrolled leak that occurs within the chlorine system.\nAn emergency release is an \u00bfuncontrolled release\u00bf that occurs within the chlorine system.  This may occur when no staff is in the building, or perhaps when a leak gets out of control.  If an operator is present, the appropriate action would be to leave the area and initiate the emergency response plan notifications.\n\nThis plan includes procedures for evacuations, notifying response agencies and adjacent businesses, emergency equipment list with maintenance schedule, and also for responding to each release level.  The plan also includes first aid procedures for exposure to chlorine.\n\n\nA.4.7 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nNearly all PHA recommendations are currently being implemented prior to submission of this RMP.  It is Holabird Plant policy to review operating, maintenance and emergency response procedures on a routine basis to ensure applicability.  This continuous review process will generate further recommendations for improved safety during the course of operating the chlorine systems.\n\n\nA.4.8 Summary\n\nThe design of the Holabird Plant chlorine facilities and the implementation of the Federal RMP and California Accidental Release Prevention Program provide a high level of assurance that the hazards and risks associated with the use of chlorine at the Holabird Plant are being managed in an appropriate manner.
