RMP EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nALDI, located at 1171 North SR7, Royal Palm Beach, FL, is a cold storage food warehouse and distribution center.\n\nAt this facility, anhydrous ammonia (cas #7664-41-7) is used as a refrigerant to cool the cooler storage rooms and freezer and ice cream freezer. The refrigeration system is designed as a closed loop, two-stage compression system. Liquid ammonia is pumped from the +20F Pump Receiver to the cooler room evaporators and is pumped to the freezer evaporators from the -19F Pump Receiver. Ammonia vapor and liquid from the cooler evaporators returns to the +20 Pump Receiver and to the -19F Pump Receiver from the -10 Freezer and to the -30F Suction Accumulator from ice cream freezer. The vessels are located in the engine room. Ammonia vapor from the -19F Pump Receiver and -30F Suction Accumulator is removed by the first-stage or booster compressors and discharged into the +20 Pump Receiver. This vapor, plus the vapor that returns from the cooler room evaporators, is compressed by the high-stage compressors and discharged to the evaporative condensers located on the roof. The condensers remove the heat from the ammonia vapor causing it to condense back into a liquid so that it can be circulated back out to the evaporators. The normal high-side operating pressure ranges from 120 to 170 psig. The maximum allowable working pressure is 250 psig. The quantity of ammonia used in the system to maintain the required refrigeration is 17,000 lbs.\n\n\n\nAs part of the PSM program, ALDI, Inc. has completed a process hazard analysis, developed written operating procedures, trained employees on awareness and system operation, established procedures to conduct management of change procedures and pre-startup safety reviews, and developed a mechanical integrity program for ammonia refrigeration equipment. In addition to the daily monitoring of the refrigeration process, ALDI implement"

The PSM program developed and implemented at the ALDI facility includes the following steps:\n\n\n\nWritten plans for implementing employee participation in PSM.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information: information pertaining to the hazards of ammonia, the technology of the process and the equipment in the process. \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA): A PHA review of the ammonia refrigeration process was conducted to identify hazards and safeguards pertaining to the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nOperating procedures were developed and implemented for the safe operation of the refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nSafe work practices were developed and implemented for lockout/tagout, confined space and opening equipment and piping. \n\n\n\nA Mechanical Integrity program is being implemented to maintain the on-going integrity and safety of the refrigeration system, including application of the following industry codes and standards: \n\n\n\nASME Boiler & Pressure Valve Codes\n\nANSI B31.3 Piping Code\n\nANSI/IIAR 2-2008 American National Standard for Equipment, Design, and Installation of Closed-Circuit Ammonia Mechanical Refrigerating Systems\n\nANSI/ASHRAE Standard 15\n\nNFPA guidelines for fire protection equipment\n\n\n\nA Management of Change (MOC) program and procedures were developed to address all proposed changes to the refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Review (PSSR) procedures were developed.\n\n\n\nA detailed compliance audit checklist is used to evaluate compliance with the Process Safety Management and Risk Management programs every three years"

An Emergency Action Plan (EAP) has been developed that includes coordination with local response agencies, procedures for employees to follow in the event of an accidental release of ammonia and a list of emergency phone numbers. \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThrough the accidental release prevention program, ALDI regularly evaluates the need for any changes to improve safety. Currently, there are no changes planned for the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n"
