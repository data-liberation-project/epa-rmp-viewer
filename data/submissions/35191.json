The plant?s products are used to make sputter targets for the electronics industry and powder metallurgical parts.  \n\nOne of the materials used by the facility is Titanium Tetrachloride, which is on the RMP Rule's list of regulated substances.  The Honeywell Salt Lake City plant's storage and use of Titanium Tetrachloride exceeds the specified threshold 2,500 lbs., as defined by the EPA?s RMP Rule.  \n\nIn accordance with the requirements of the RMP Rule, a description of the following six elements is provided for the Honeywell Salt Lake City plant: \n\n1) Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies: \nIt is the policy of the Honeywell Salt Lake City plant to operate a safe and environmentally sound facility by identifying and controlling health, safety, and environmental risks related to its operations; by designing its processes to protect people, property and the environment; by conducting and continually reviewing and improving programs for safety, health and environmental excellence; and by establishing processes to assure that all laws and regulations applicable to its operations and products are known and observed.  The accidental release prevention and emergency response policy associated specifically with the plant's use of Titanium Tetrachloride involves the integration of safety devices and technologies inherent in the design of the process, safe operational procedures and management practices, operator training, the preparation and testing of site emergency response plans, the maintenance of onsite emergency response equipment and coordinating our efforts and resources with local emergency response services, and communicating with the community. \n\n2) Description of the Facility and the Regulated Substance Handled: \nThe Salt Lake City plant manufactures high purity titanium. The manufacturing process includes the utilization of Titanium Tetrachloride (TTC). Titanium is produced by the reduction of TT"

Further processing includes crushing, leaching, rinsing, drying and product sizing. \n\n\n3) The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:  \nThe TTC systems were built in accordance with the design code and specification as recommended by a supplier. The supplier has over 20 years experience in the storage and handling of TTC.  The systems include many built in safety devices including level alarms, high level cutouts, safety vents, spare vessels for holding material and pressure relief devices. A foam spray system is installed at the offloading and bulk storage to mitigate fume emission in the event of a release.\n\nStandard operating procedures and checklists are in place and are updated as needed. Operators performing TTC operations must be certified. Certification is in accordance with established ISO 9000 procedures and includes classroom training, on the job training, a written test, and a demonstration of ability (practical test) \n\nA preventative maintenance program is used for testing and replacing components of the system as needed. Safety critical devices and the foam spray system are tested periodically to verify that they function correctly. Certain components are scheduled for periodic replacement, as appropriate. A schedule is used for physical inspection on the tanks and transfer lines as part of the mechanical integrity program.\n\n4) The Five Year Accident History:  \nThere have been no accidental releases involving Titanium Tetrachloride in the last five (5) years.\n\n5) The Emergency Response Plan:  \nThe Honeywell Salt Lake City plant has agreed with the local emergency response provider that the provider will perform emergency response for the facility. The plant is incorporated into the local fire department?s emergency response program, and the plant has provided the fire department with a copy of the plant emergency response plan.\n\nA close working relationship has been established with the loca"

Alarms to detect any release are also to be installed. This information will be relayed to a new control room, which will also be provided with the means to activate the emergency shutdown procedures in the event of a release."
