The changes slightly increased the quantity of anhydrous ammonia in the system.\n\n\n\nThe PHA review found that the existing PHA (prior to the process changes) remains valid after the changes.  No new hazards were determined as a result of the changes to the process.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the Worst Case and Alternate Case release scenarios remain valid after the process changes were made.\n\n\n\nThe previous executive summary for the previous RMP submittal is included in the following paragraphs.\n\n\n\nA.   Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nGrocers Supply Company recognizes management's responsibility in protecting its employees, the public, the environment, equipment, and property.  The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the Houston facility.\n\n\n\nTo accomplish the company's goal in preventing accidents, the facility has established a Plant Safety Program.  The objectives of the Plant Safety Program are to: maximize safety performance, eliminate human suffering resulting from injuries and accidents and reduce losses associated"

Overall, these programs help prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses, environmental impacts and physical property damage.\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs help prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\n\n\n\n\nB.   Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe Grocers Supply Company facility in Houston, Texas is a refrigerated warehouse for grocery storage.  It operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling capabilities.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in the system is in excess of 10,000 pounds.  The maximum inventory in the system is approximately 28,935 pounds, revised to reflect the current inventory due to the new freezer and dock addition in 2005).  Since ammonia releases from the system could pose a risk of offsite public and/or environmental impact and the system is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of th"

Summary of Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario at the Grocers Supply Company facility involves the release of ammonia due to the unlikely failure of the ammonia High Pressure Receiver.   Under worst-case weather conditions, ammonia could travel 0.9 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public. This distance has been calculated based on the method provided in EPA's Risk Management Program (40 CFR Part 68) Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration assuming the building around the High Pressure Receiver provides passive mitigation of the release.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n         The worst-case weather conditions which were used for this scenario are not typical;\n\n         Industry standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of the receiver; \n\n         The receiver is located in a low traffic area within the engine room which minimizes the possibility of loss of containment due to vehicular impact (e.g., from forklifts etc.);\n\n         Ammonia is not corrosive in this service and the vessel is relatively new;\n\n         Pressure safety valves limit operating pressure in the vessel.\n\n        The facility has a preventive maintenance program in place to maintain the on-going integrity of vessels;\n\n         The facility has a training program designed to ensure that the system is operated by qualified personnel; and,\n\n         The facility emergency response procedures enable trained personnel to respond quickly to isolate any potential releases.\n\nThe alternative release scenario at the Grocers Supply Company facility involves the release of 11,250 pounds of ammonia over a 30-minute period due to the failure of a 1/2\" diameter ammonia liquid pipe on the facility's roof.  Under alternative release weather conditions, ammonia could travel 0.2 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  This distance has been calculated bas"
