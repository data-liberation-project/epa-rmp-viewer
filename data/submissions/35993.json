The goal of this policy is to reduce the risk to Plant employees and to protect the public and the environment.\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\n        The process at the water treatment plant subject to the RMP regulations is the disinfection system, which manages greater than threshold quantities of chlorine and ammonia.\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n        The accidental release prevention program at the Water Purification Plant is focused on the safe management of chlorine and ammonia used in the disinfection system.  The first step in the prevention program at the Plant was the establishment of a management system to assign overall responsibility and responsibility for the individual program elements. Additional steps include: ensuring process safety information on the disinfection system is accurate, complete and up-to-date; ensuring the system is designed and modified safely by periodically conducting process hazard analyses; ensuring the system is operated and maintained in a safe manner by developing, maintaining and implementing Standard Operating and Preventive Maintenance Procedures; ensuring Plant employee are adequately trained and tested in the RMP program elements; ensuring new equipment and modifications to the disinfection system are designed, constructed, operated and maintained by following Management of Change, Pre-startup Review and Hot Work Permit Procedures; ensuring contractors are qualified, and oriented to the site hazards; and conducting periodic Compliance Audits and Incident Investigations including resolution"

On February 20, 2003, there was a release of less than 1 pound of chlorine due to a faulty valve on a railcar that was received at the plant. There were no injuries.  \n\nThe emergency response program: \n\n        The Water Purification Plant is included in the City of Richmond Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) emergency response plan.  In addition, the Plant has in place an emergency action plan than includes procedures to be followed in the event of an accidental release of chlorine or ammonia.  The procedures cover the following: evacuation plan; recognizing emergencies; emergency action procedures; coordinating personnel; first aid procedures; notifying the public and local emergency response agencies; emergency response contacts; emergency response equipment; reportable release quantities and documenting releases; emergency alarm system; emergency responders; training and drills; and pre-emergency coordination with the LEPC."
