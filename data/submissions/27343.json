(Facility) is a citrus juice manufacturing facility (NAICS Code 311411) using one regulated substance, anhydrous ammonia (CAS Number 7664-41-7), as a refrigerant.  Three processes at the facility use anhydrous ammonia in excess of the treshold quantity defined by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) chemical accident prevention standard.  The three processes are listed below.\n\nThe Main Facility\nThe Ready to Serve (RTS) Facility \nFreezers 5 and 6 \n\nA hazard assessment was performed using the USEPA RMP*CompTM Model\nThe worst-case release scenarios were assumed to be the total release of anhydrous ammonia from the high pressure receivers of each of the three processes over a 10 minute period.  \n\nThe alternative release scenarios selected was from failure scenarios developed during process hazard review and analyses.  For the three processes, the alternative scenarios occurred as a result of a 1/4-inch orfice developing in the bottom of the high-pressure receivers because of corrosion.\n\nPotential zones of impact were constructed for the selected release scenarios.  These zones were analyzed to provide estimates of the total population and public and evrionmental receptors that could potenially be exposed should the hypothetical releases occur.  Although off-site areas would be impacted by the releases, the Facility believes that safety procedures and mitigation measures will reduce the potential for off-site consequences and subsequent risks to the surrounding community.  The Facility's safety devices include leak detectors, alarms, and automatic system shut-off features.\n\nIn order to fulfill the requirements of the Risk Management Program (RMP), the Facility has developed an accidental release prevention pr"

The accidental release prevention program satisfies the requirements for the USEPA RMP and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management  (PSM) program.  The prevention program ensures that the Facility is operated under safe conditions and that any risk of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia is minimized.  The program has been written to reduce the potential of an accidental release due to human error, the Facility's prevention program ensures that operating procedures are current and reviewed annually.  Training also plays a vital part in the program.  Employees and contractors working near or on the three processes are required to be trained in the processes and the hazards of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nTo prevent equipment failure that could result in a release, the Facility's program ensures that equipment inspections, tests, and preventative maintenance are performed in accordance with accepted engineering practices, manufacturer's recommendations, and planned maintenance schedules.\n\nAll existing and proposed future equipment has been designed according to applicable statndards and codes.  The Facility maintains records and documentation on equipment inspections and test.  Precautions are taken to ensure that new equipment and processes are inspected and tested, that all changes on the processes are authorized, and employees are informed of changes.\n\nThe Facility performed Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) to address the facility hazards and to evaluate and control where the potential for a release exists.  Employees were involved in determining hazards of the processes and subsequent consequences.\n\nActive employee participation will ensure the success of the RMP at the Facility.  Employees have been assigned various tasks to ensure that all elements of the RMP are implemented.

The Facility is also included in the community emergency response plan.  Employees at the Facility do not respond to accidental  releases, but coordinate with outside responders.  Therefore, an Emergency Response Team was not established at the Facility.  In the event that an anhydrous ammonia release occurs, all employees are required to evacuate the area and report the incident.  The Emergency Action Plan consists of evacuation procedures, facility emergency numbers, and coordination with the Umatilla and Lake County Fire Departments.  The plan also addresses notification procedures to the public and the local emergency response agency."
