The company manufactures a variety of specialty chemicals for the lubricants and coatings industries.  The company operates one facility for all manufacturing, research, marketing and administrative functions.  King Industries also operates a sales office in The Netherlands.  The company has operated in Norwalk since 1932.\r\n\r\nKing Industries uses a material called Oleum 20%.  Oleum 20% is the trade name for the mixture of 20% sulfur trioxide and 80% sulfuric acid.  The company has two storage tanks for oleum that are capable of storing more than 10,000 lbs each.  This exceeds the reporting amount for oleum (40 CFR Part 68.130).  Thus, King Industries is subject to Risk Management Plan Program 3 requirements (40 CFR 68.10).\r\n\r\nKing Industries manages the safety of its operations using principles and practices spelled out in OSHA's Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Substances regulation (29 CFR 1910.119).  The company has eleven employees dedicated to working on safety and environmental issues, out of 199 total employees.  The company maintains a full-time fire brigade department.  The company has an extensive training program for all its employees.  Operating procedure reviews, plant safety policy reviews, work procedure reviews, and any other training required by safety and environmental regulations are included in the company's training program.  The company uses state-of-the-art process and safety equipment throughout the facility.  The company has an ongoing inspection program for equipment, piping and vessels to help maintain reliability and prevent any incidents from occurring.\r\n\r\nKing Industries also has several programs for auditing and inspecting both new and existing facilities to ensure their continued safe performance.

      "SummaryText": "o thoroughly review all plant changes prior to execution.  The company conducts a pre-startup safety review for all changes, to make sure they are done properly and the system will continue to function safely.  The company conducts process hazards analyses to review all possible scenarios that may result in a release of material; appropriate changes are made to prevent that release from ever happening. King Industries is also certified to the ISO 14001 and 18001 standards for safety, health and environmental management. \r\n\r\nIf a release were to take place, the company maintains a thorough incident investigation program.  This investigation includes a cross-functional team of operators, maintenance personnel, engineers and any other personnel who may be able to contribute to the investigation.  The investigation team determines the root cause(s) for the incident, and offers recommendations to prevent recurrence for the process in question and the facility in general.  The company completes these recommendations on a priority basis.  King Industries uses these programs on all plant activities, regardless of their regulatory status.\r\n\r\nKing Industries completed the most recent process hazards analysis study for facilities handling oleum in May 2013.   Recommendations from this study are expected to be completed by Dec. 2014. The emergency shutdown systems for oleum offloading are tested annually. The last occurred on September 2013 and the system was found to be functional. The next test will occur in September 2014.\r\n\r\nKing Industries takes the potential to have an incident very seriously.  The company maintains written procedures on accidental release prevention, incident command and emergency response.  The company emphas accidental release prevention through all of these documents and in its training programs.  The company's training program includes annual refresher training in accident prevention and emergency response awareness for all manufacturing personnel."
