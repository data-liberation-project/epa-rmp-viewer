This commitment is\ndemonstrated by significant investments of resources to prevent releases of hazardous substances and for accident prevention, such as employee participation and training, and considering safety in the design,\ninstallation, operation, and maintenance of processes.  Valvoline policy is to implement practical controls to\nprevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  However, if a releases does occur, the Hernando Plant has a well-defined emergency action plan and controls to contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Valvoline Pyroil Plant, located in Hernando, Mississippi, produces a variety of car-care products.  The\nfacility consists of an outdoor tank farm and administrative and manufacturing buildings where the finished\nproducts are processed and packaged .  These products are well known under the Pyroil brand name and the manufacturing facility is ISO 9002 certified.  The plant has an excellent safety and environmental record, with a high level of employee involvement and commitment to operational excellence.  \n\nThe Pyroil plant has one manufacturing process (starting fluid manufacturing process) that uses a flammable substance - ethyl ether - listed in the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule.  There are no toxic or reactive regulated substances involved at the site.  The starting fluid manufacturing process involving ethyl ether consists of storage, blending and packaging.  The process operations are covered by OSHA's process safety management (PSM) standard and are considered Program Level 3 for the RMP rule.  \n\nA product distribution center, located on adjoining property (separated by railroad tracks), warehouses  the\nfinished products, containing ethyl ether.

There are no public receptors within a distance to an endpoint from a worst-case scenario;\n     2.   The warehouse has had no release of a regulated substance in the past five years resulting\n          in offsite exposure or consequences; and\n     3.

Because the plant process regulated by the\nEnvironmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation is also subject to\nthe Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management systems in place to implement the accidental release prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Pyroil plant conducts its business using a teamwork approach.  A number of business and operational\nteams provide an active forum for employee participation in the implementation of PSM standard elements. \nExamples of employee involvement range from participation in process hazard analysis  \nto recent development of operating procedures.  Employees have access to all information created as a part of the prevention program.

Within this program, each process is systematically\nexamined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Valvoline Pyroil plant primarily uses a combination of What-If, checklist and hazard and operability\n(HAZOP) analysis techniques to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of\npeople who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team\nidentifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accidental release prevention and mitigation\nmeasures, and the team makes suggestions for additional safeguards when the team believes such\nmeasures are needed.\n\nThe PHA team findings are evaluated by local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of\nmitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.\nThis ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk ranking receive prompt attention. All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are\ncompleted. The formal resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates process hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five (5) years. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Pyroil plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as\n(1) process  startup, (2) normal op"

These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually\ncertified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as\nnecessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nIn addition, the Pyroil plant has established documentation requirements for logging key process parameters. This documentation also provides guidance on how to respond to a deviation from upper or lower limits for a specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process area and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Pyroil plant maintains a\ncomprehensive training program for all employees involved in process operations. New employees receive\nbasic training in plant operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through skills demonstration) adequate\nknowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. Experienced operators  receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.

The Pyroil plant has established safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., level, composition) in process documentation. The Pyroil plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly-trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown).\r\n\r\nThe Pyroil plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and\r\nconstruction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.

The other two smaller ethyl\r\n    ether blend tanks have a MAWP of 200 psig and 300 psig and their spring-loaded pressure relief\r\n    devices are set at 100 psig and 140 psig, respectively.  The normal operating pressure for all three\r\n    of these ethyl ether storage tanks is 5-8 psig, providing a significan"

(The nitrogen supply\r\n    system has an overpressure relief device set at 12 psig).\r\n\r\n    Low oxygen level in the ether storage tanks reduces overall corrosion rates.\r\n\r\n    Ether with a stabilizer is purchased to minimize formation of hydrogen peroxide (and other ether\r\n    decomposition products).  Each shipment is received with a Certificate of Analysis for the stabilized\r\n    contents and hydrogen peroxide levels.\r\n\r\n    Ether contains an extremely low level of water, thus minimizing corrosion rate.\r\n\r\n    Ether and starting fluid storage tanks were initially inspected (e.g., wall thickness, weld inspections)\r\n    in 1995-96 and were reinspected in February, 1999 and recertified.  A program is in place to inspect\r\n    these tanks on a periodic basis.\r\n\r\n    Administrative practice is implemented to close manual valves on each tank in the event of process\r\n    shutdown (e.g., during weekends, or at night, when the process is shut down).\r\n\r\n    A visual inspection of the ether tank farm is carried out on a regular basis.\r\n\r\n    Containment wall protects storage tanks from external impact (e.g., from tank trailer).\r\n\r\n    Mechanical integrity inspections include daily visual inspection of piping, pumps and associated\r\n    systems for leaks. \r\n    \r\n    Safe work practices (e.g., hot work practice) include cessation of all traffic and construction activities\r\n    during ether tank trailer unloading; and\r\n\r\n    All flammable solvent storage tanks are equipped with level indication and high level alarm.\r\n\r\nRelease/Fire Containment / Control\r\n\r\n    Tank farm has a concrete floor and grooves cut in the floor to channel small spills to low point drain.\r\n\r\n    The tank farm area is covered by monitor nozzles to cool flammable solvent tanks (including ether\r\n    storage tanks) in case of external fire.\r\n\r\n    The Pyroil"

A fire-safe valve with fusible link\r\n    on each tank isolates the tank contents from further release.  A manual block valve is provided\r\n    downstream of the firesafe valve.  The valve is normally open during process operations. \r\n\r\n    Separate containment areas for tank trailer unloading and solvent storage tanks are provided.\r\n\r\n    Perimeter security fence provides facility access control and prevents entry of unauthorized\r\n    personnel\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe Valvoline Pyroil plant has an excellent record of accidental release prevention over the past five (5)\r\nyears. There has not been any reportable release or accidents involving ethyl ether at the Pyroil plant over\r\nthe past 5 years. Every incident (including any near-miss) is thoroughly investigated to determine ways to\r\nprevent similar incidents from recurring and this is applied to all relevant processes and operations.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe Starting Fluid fill room will have upgraded fire detection and suppressant systems including UVIR flame sensors, fixed carbon dioxide spray heads, and an auxiliary foam suppressant extinguishing system.  Changes to the blend room include an improved piping/manifold system, ventilation upgrades, and fire resistant coating for all tank supports.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCESS 2.  PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION CENTER (WAREHOUSE)\r\n\r\nValvoline has provided many safeguards to prevent and/or mitigate consequences of accidental releases: \r\n\r\n         automatic fire water sprinkler system\r\n         segregation of products containing ethyl ether to isolate highly-flammable materials\r\n         control of ignition sources (e.g., only EE-rated fork trucks are allowed)\r\n         personnel training, including fork truck driver certification program,\r\n         special fire"

The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and postincident cleanup and decontamination requirements. In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency action program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to Pyroil plant processes or other Valvoline facilities. The emergency action program changes are administered through the"
