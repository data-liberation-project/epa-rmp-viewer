It includes required actions by plant employees as well as required notification and coordination with local responders and agencies. All employees are trained in the execution of the Emergency Response Plan and drills are conducted annually.\r\n\r\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated substances:\r\n\r\nNatural Gas Liquids (NGLs) (i.e., ethane propane mixture and propane) are stored in caverns at Mitchell for subsequent delivery by pipeline to other facilities. The total volume of the available cavern storage is fixed. However, each individual cavern may be used for more than one NGL, depending on marketplace requirements. This RMP filing is predictive because thirteen new caverns are under construction and will be placed into service over the next year.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\r\n\r\nThe Mitchell Plant has implemented all the elements of a Program 2 Risk Management Plan (RMP). The plant has also implanted all the elements of Williams Midstream\u00bfs System Integrity Plan (SIP), which contains additional environmental, health, and safety standards. Key element of these programs include:\r\n\r\nSafety Information: A variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  \r\n\r\nHazard Review/Process Hazard Analysis (PHA): A systematic examination of the plant to identify possible hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures: The Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) initial start-up, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) emergency operations, (6) normal shutdown, and (7) start-up after turnaround.  \r\n\r\nContractors: The Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

The program includes Classroom, OJT, and computer-based training. Employees are tested to demonstrate competency.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change: Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  \r\n\r\nIncident Investigation:  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts concerning an incident or near miss and to develop cor"

The program consists of procedures for responding to releases of regulated substances, including the possibility of associated fires or explosions. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in these procedures annually to perform emergency response duties.  The program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the gas plant processes.  Emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process. The overall emergency response program for the Plant is coordinated with The Rice County Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes attending periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials and industry representatives.  The Plant has 24-hour communications capability with the LEPC. The Plant conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\r\n\r\nSafety meetings are conducted monthly where various safety issues are discussed and addressed, including safety specific training for the following topics (typically one per meeting):\r\n- industrial hygiene\r\n- hearing conservation\r\n- personal protective equipment\r\n- PSM overview\r\n- w"
