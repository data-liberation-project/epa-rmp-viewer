The organization of this executive summary follows the elements listed in the U.S. EPA's RMP*Submit Users Manual, with a brief introduction.\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\n\nArizona Public Services (APS) owns and operates the West Phoenix Power Plant, an electric power generation facility located in Maricopa County, Arizona.  The units at the West Phoenix Power Plant include two simple-cycle turbines, three 85 MW combined-cycle units (CC1-3), a 120 MW natural gas-fired combined cycle unit (CC4), a 530 MW natural gas-fired combined cycle unit (CC5), a natural gas-fired auxiliary boiler, and three steam generating units.  As part of the construction of CC5, and the retrofitting of one existing combined cycle unit (CC3), selective catalytic reduction (SCR) control systems were installed to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx).  The SCR system utilizes aqueous ammonia to reduce NOx emissions.  Ammonia with concentrations of 20% or higher is listed as a regulated substance under Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.\n\n\n\nAs a result of the SCR NOx control systems, the quantity of aqueous ammonia stored and used at the facility is greater than the Threshold Quantity, thus a Risk Management Plan (RMP) is required.  The aqueous ammonia system was identified as the only process at the facility that triggers RMP requirements.  As explained in the following sections, even the highly unlikely worst-case release from the aqueous ammonia system will not result in a public receptor within the distance to toxic endpoint.\n\n\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies are supported at the highest level within the Company.  The facility is operated to protect the health and safety of our employees and neighbors"

In addition, a release such as that used for the worst case scenario is highly unlikely due to this ongoing training, and preventive maintenance inspections of the ammonia system.\n\n\n\n2. Description of Facility and Regulated Substance Handled\n\n\n\nThe West Phoenix Power Plant is located in the western portion of the greater Phoenix metropolitan area.  As mentioned, an SCR system is being installed to control NOx from a new unit and one existing unit.  The SCR system for CC5 uses a 29.4% solution of ammonia in water, ammonium hydroxide.  The ammonia storage and handling system for CC5  consists of a single 30,000 gallon storage tank, pumps, and piping to the vaporizer, which produces a uniform distribution of aqueous ammonia injected into the flue gas upstream of the SCR catalyst.  The storage tank has a maximum design pressure of 25 psia and is completely within a walled containment basin designed to hold all of the tank contents.  The tank has an administrative fill limit of 28,500 gallons.\n\n\n\nCombined cycle (CC3) has been retrofited with a system using the same 29.4% solution of ammonia in water, ammonium hydroxide.  The ammonia storage and handling system for CC3 consists of a single 30,000 gallon storage tank, pumps, and piping to the vaporizer.  The storage tank also has a maximum design pressure of 25 psia and is completely within a walled containment basin designed to hold all of the tank contents.  The tank also has an administrative fill limit of 28,500 gallons.\n\n\n\n3. Worst-case Release Scenario\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario is a release of the entire contents of the storage tank for CC3 or CC5.  The worst-case analysis was conducted separately for CC3 and CC5 in order to determine which is worst-case because they have separate storage and handling systems at two different locations.  Both tanks are surrou"

Using EPA's Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis, dated April 1999, the dike areas for both tanks are less than the area of a pool that could form and the containment areas are sufficient to hold the entire volume.  Under worst-case meteorology as per the guidance (1.5 m/s and F stability) and adjusting the release rate for release temperature, the resulting distance to toxic endpoint from Reference Table 10 for both tanks is 0.1 miles.  For CC3, this distance is contained within the property boundary.  The nearest public receptor is at least 800 feet away to the south, well beyond the distance to the toxic endpoint.  For CC5, the distance extends just beyond the property boundary to the north and there is not a public receptor within this distance.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release from either storage tank is predicted to remain on-site or not reach a public receptor.  The facility has not had a release of a regulated substance in the past five years, thus it qualifies for Program 1 and an alternate release scenario is not required.\n\n\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe aqueous ammonia system was designed to reduce potential offsite impacts by including a concrete dike to provide 100% containment around the storage tank.  Operators will receive ongoing training in accident prevention and chemical safety, will conduct visual inspections of the ammonia system routinely, as well as perform maintenance recommended by the equipment manufacturers to reduce the risk of accidents.\n\n\n\n5. Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of a regulated substance at the West Phoenix Power Plant in the past five years.\n\n\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nAPS is required to meet the requirements for Program 1, which includes coordination with the local emergency responders.  APS has coordinated emergency response with"
