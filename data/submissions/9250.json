      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary for the Wastewater Control Plant\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Policy and Emergency Response Policy\n\nThe City of Bend Wastewater Control Plant has a redundant chlorine sensitive alarm system operating 24 hours per day connected via telemetry to a paging call system.  The alarm system sensor is set to detect 3 ppm chlorine.  The site also has visual and audible alarms that engage with the chlorine sensors.\n\nThe containers, piping, valves and dispensers are of the highest manufacturing quality.  Quality control is performed on site quarterly and encompasses all equipment used in the chlorinating process to ensure proper prevention of a release and efficient response should a release occur.\n\nWritten policy thoroughly discusses all maintenance and minor leak response procedures.  Training of all personnel is periodic and on going.\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substance Identification\n\nThe facility is a publicly owned and operated wastewater treatment facility that uses chlorine gas for disinfecting approximately 4.0 mgd wastewater effluent.  \n\nChlorine gas is stored in a concrete block building located in the center of a 44 acre fenced compound.  Entrance to the compound is restricted and the chlorine building is kept locked at all times.  A maximum of 15 -  1 ton full cylinders are stored within the chlorine building.  Only 1 ton cylinder is in use at any one time.  \n\nWorst case Release Scenario\n\nThe EPA RMP*Comp program was used to estimate the distance to the end point if a catastrophic release of chlorine should occur.  \n\nAssuming an accident occurred while off loading a 1 ton cylinder from the delivery truck, the following scenario was developed.  1 ton of chlorine gas was released at a rate of 200 pounds per minute over a 10 minute period.  The result is an off site exposure to chlorine gas above the toxic end point of 0.0087 ppm to a radius of 1.3 miles.\n\nNo passive mitigating measures were considered to be in effect during this scenario"

      "SummaryText": ".\n \nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nThe accident history for the Wastewater Control Plant was reviewed to determine the most realistic alternative scenario to consider.  There has not been a catastrophic release of any kind since 1981, the start up of the City of Bend's Wastewater Control Plant.  Therefore, a what if  scenario was developed using worst case wind speed, temperature, and gas stability data.  The passive mitigation measures include a closed building.  Active mitigating measures include vacuum/pressure regulating valves, and automatic exhaust fans.  \n\nThe what if assumption that was used is as follows.  A pipe attached to the chlorinator valve cracked allowing the gas in the piping to be released.  This equals 3.74 pounds to be released over a period of 10 minutes.   The toxic end point of 0.0087 ppm chlorine is reached at 0.1 miles.  The chlorine never leaves the compound, no off site exposure occurs.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe City of Bend Safety Policy requires that all employees expected to work with chlorine gas as part of their job duties follow OSHA/PSM rules.  In addition, initial training and continuous refresher training is mandatory at a minimum of every 3 years.\n\nAlarm systems are checked for operational integrity continuously.\n\nAll release incidents regardless of severity are reviewed by a team composed of management and staff who are actively involved with the operation of the equipment.  \n\nMechanical integrity of all equipment and piping used in the chlorine distribution system is checked annually.\n\nA compliance audit is performed every 3 years. The audits shall insure that all the accidental release prevention measures are being conducted in a timely manner, that action is taken in response to all suggestions to improve release prevention, and that documentation is recorded.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThere have not been any accidents resulting in off site releases of chlorine gas in the past 5 years.

      "SummaryText": "have not been any since the start up of the facility in 1981.  Any release due to valves leaking or other minor leaks have been attended to in a safe and timely manner.  \n \nEmergency Response Program\n\nAny catastrophic releases of chlorine gas will result in a response by the Bend Fire Dept. who will take command of the scene.  \n\nOperation staff is expected to train and respond to minor releases that occur on process equipment.\n\nA chlorine alarm occurring while non-routine activity is being conducted shall be evaluated by trained operation employees following the safety procedure adopted by the City.  The degree of the release will be determined by the trained employees witnessing the release.  If it is determined that a release is beyond their ability to repair given the safety policy guidelines, the City of Bend Fire Dept shall be called to take command.\n\nThe Bend Fire Dept. conducts practice drills on a semi-annual basis for the Wastewater Control Plant.\n\nPublic notification of a catastrophic release shall be through the County Sheriff's Dept. who uses the Emergency Broadcast System and door to door evacuation.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAny and all suggestions made by operation staff will be considered and action taken will be documented including decisions to make no change.\n\nAt this review, the plan to install an intrusion alarm for the chlorine building is being considered along with fire and smoke detectors."
