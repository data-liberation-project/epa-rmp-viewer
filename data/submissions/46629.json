These policies have been incorporated in the facility's Emergency Response Plan.\n\nThere are three flammable substances at the NorthStar facility that are regulated by the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions defined at 40 CFR 68. These substances are used as propellants in packaging operations at the facility. These substances and the specific process covered include:\n\n* Toxic Substances\n\n-- There are no toxic substances present at the facility in amounts greater than the threshold quantities per 40 CFR 68.\n\n* Flammable Substances\n\n-- Flammable Mixture: This material, which is a mixture of propane, isobutane, and dimethyl ether, is a propellant added during packaging operations in the adehesive preparation process. The maximum amount of flammable mixture stored on-site is approximately 50,900 pounds. \n\n-- Methyl ether: This material is used in similar fashion as the flammable mixture. The maximum amount of methyl ether stored on-site is approximately 9,350 pounds.\n \n-- Flammable Mixture: This material, which is a mixture of 1,1-difluoroethane, propane, isobutane, and dimethyl ether, is a propellant added during packaging operations in the adehesive preparation process. The maximum amount of flammable mixture stored on-site is approximately 5,840 pounds. \n\nTo address potential accidental releases, an accidental release prevention program along with chemical-specific prevention steps has been developed. \n\nThe Adhesive Preparation Process prevention program includes the following process controls and mitigation systems:\n\n*Relief valves\n*Check valves\n*Manual shutoffs\n*Grounding equipment\n*Excess flow device\n*Alarms and procedures\n\nAlso included in the prevention program for"

As part of the community involvement efforts, the following activities may be coordinated with the agencies listed above:\n\n*Pre-emergency tours\n*Emergency action drills\n*Material safety data sheets\n*Responsibility roles in evacuation procedures\n\nAlso, the facility has a plant emergency notification system.\n\nAs part of preparing the RMP, the facility's five year accident history was reviewed.  During the past five years, there have been no RMP reportable accidental releases.\n\nNorthStar is committed to continuous improvement of safety.  Planned changes and policies to promote this improvement include continuous review and update of the facility's ERP and various environmental, health, and safety polices, procedures, and practices."
