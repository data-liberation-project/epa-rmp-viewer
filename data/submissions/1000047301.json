A primary aspect of this commitment is the Evansville Water and Sewer Utility Eastside Wastewater Treatment Plant system to help ensure the safe operation of the water chlorination process.  Our commitment is also demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process, as well as, extensive training of our operating personnel. \n\n\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the Evansville Water and Sewer Utility Eastside Wastewater Treatment Plant has procedures that are designed to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for our employees and will help prevent injury to the public and the environment.  The Evansville Water and Sewer Utility Eastside Wastewater Treatment Plant's emergency response personnel receive thorough training in handling accidental releases.  An emergency response coordinator has been assigned to oversee response activities and to coordinate response efforts with local emergency agencies.  Communications with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) have been ongoing throughout the preparation of this plan and policies.\n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, the Evansville Water and Sewer Utility Eastside Wastewater Treatment Plant established a management system headed by the Wastewater Superintendent and Plant Manager to ensure the proper implementation and effectiveness of our Risk Management Program.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.0  Evansville Water and Sewer Utility Eastside Wastewater Treatment Plant and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Evansville Water and Sewer Utility East"

The regulated substance was evaluated for a possible worse-case release scenario and alternative release scenario.  It is important to understand that the Evansville Water and Sewer Utility Eastside Wastewater Treatment Plant has invested extensive resources to prevent releases, and the potential for a worse-case release is extremely small.  The alternative release scenario represents a more realistic potential for occurrence and is based on historical data from our process or other similar processes.  By identifying these potential releases, the Evansville Water and Sewer Utility Eastside Wastewater Treatment Plant has developed an extensive program to prevent such an occurrence.  This program is discussed in detail in the Prevention Program section of this plan.\n\n\n\nThe primary objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public and/or the environment as a result of an accidental release.  This point is called the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances farther than the endpoint, the effects would be less.\n\n\n\n3.1  Hazard Assessment - Toxic Substances\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with Regulated Toxic Substances is a failure of a full, one ton (2000 lb) cylinder of liquid chlorine.  A toxic cloud formed by the evaporating chlorine would reach offsite endpoints and public receptors.\n\nAn alternative release scena"

The requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management standard are nearly identical to the RMP Rule Program 3 Prevention Program requirements.  The Chlorination Process Prevention Program consists of the following elements.\n\n\n\n4.1  Process Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Evansville Water and Sewer Utility Eastside Wastewater Treatment Plant maintains a variety of technical documents that help ensure the safe operation of our processes.
