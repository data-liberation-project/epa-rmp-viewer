The container storage room can hold up to 6 one-ton containers. One container is connected to the same feed piping manifold. An alternate supply arrangement consists of one additional ton containers connected to a parallel, but normally isolated, feed piping manifold. Chlorine is stored as a liquefied gas under pressure, fed as a gas to the chlorinators, and injected as a vapor at the outlet of the into the water stream. The chlorine process is classified as a Program Level 3 process, and we implement a complete accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\r\n\r\nWe performed an off-site consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of chlorine from our facility as a regulated toxic substance that could affect the public or the environment. The off-site consequence analysis consisted of evaluating both a worst-case scenario (WCS) and an alternative release scenario (ARS) following identification of the appropriate ARS. We do not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur. An ARS represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility similar to our water treatment plant. ARS\u00bfs can be used to help the Fayette (local) Emergency Planning Committee (FEPC) improve and prepare an effective community emergency response plan.\r\n\r\nWe have submitted release scenario analyses to EPA and have shared that information with FEPC and other organizations involved in emergency response activities. It is also available to local residents, schools, hospitals, and businesses. For these events, we have emergency mitigation systems that should help reduce the consequences of the events if they occur. In all cases, if such events occur, we would activate our emergency response plan to respond to the event notify local authorities, and take appropriate action"

The paragraphs below briefly describe the scenarios we have included in our risk management plan (RMPlan), including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures we have put in place to limit the exposure distances for each scenario.\r\n\r\nWorst-case Release Scenario for Chlorine\r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario at our water treatment facility involves a failure of a ton container holding approximately 2000 lbs of liquefied chlorine gas under pressure, resulting in a release with vaporization of the entire contents of the container. In this scenario, the chlorine is released as a vaporizing liquid inside a completely enclosed chlorine storage room in our water treatment building. The containment provided by the building mitigates the release. Such building confinement reduces the release rate of chlorine vapor directly to the outdoors. Since this facility is located in a semi-populated area, the toxic cloud formed by the evaporating chlorine would reach off-site end points and nearby public receptors.\r\n\r\nNumerous administrative controls are in place to prevent a release of this type and should one occur, to provide for effective emergency response. Controls include container design, storage, operation, maintenance and inspection; container repair and emergency response equipment; and personnel training conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements, chlorine industry standards and practices, and our company\u00bfs corporate policies and procedures, which are strictly enforced at the water treatment plant.\r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenario for Chlorine\r\n\r\nOur alternative release scenario for chlorine involves a chlorine release of approximately 317 lbs through a broken flexible connection (\"pigtail\") between the chlorine container and a supply manifold in the piping to our chlorine feed system. A break in a pigtail connecting the container to the piping will permit the connected"

Credit is taken in accordance with EPA's simplified approach for the partial containment of chlorine vapor by the room/building enclosure, which mitigates the release, and also by conservatively figuring the vacuum feed system to fail at a point during a leak. The building confinement reduces the release rate of chlorine vapor directly to the outdoors. Since this facility is located in a semi-populated area, the toxic cloud formed by the evaporating chlorine would reach off-site end points and nearby public receptors.\r\n\r\nAs in the WCS, we have taken a very conservative approach to determining the ARS endpoint distance off-site. In determining the ARS endpoint distance we have, in this case, taken credit for active mitigation provided by engineered safeguards that include chlorine monitors/detectors that automatically activate an alarm in the control room and the vacuum feed system. The chlorine leak detection system is calibrated to initiate alarms at very low concentrations of chlorine (i.e., lower than industry recommended settings). Some of our additional engineering safeguards are outlined in the following section of this summary and include isolation valves. Isolation valves are provided in the downstream chlorine feed system to isolate downstream chlorine source from the pigtail leak.  As stated in the description of the WCS, numerous administrative controls are in place to prevent a release of this type and to provide effective emergency response should one occur.\r\n\r\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our site/facility emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps for Chlorine\r\n\r\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.

Employees receive training in these procedures to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to plant facilities or to the chlorine storage and feed process, or when improvement benefits are recognized. Affected personnel are informed about, and trained on, the changes.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response program for the plant is coordinated with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) having jurisdiction in Fayette County - and with emergency management officials. We have around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate emergency response organizations (e.g.. contracted chlorine emergency response [HAZMAT] teams, local fire department, police department). This provides a means for notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. Additionally, we conduct periodic walk-around orientation tours of the plant facilities with key representatives of local emergency response organizations. During such tours we discuss and revi"

Thus, our emergency response plan is fully coordinated with the community emergency response plan.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nAt the West Virginia-American Water Company New River Regional Water Treatment Plant we constantly strive to improve the safety of our operations through periodic safety reviews, our incident investigation program, and a program for soliciting safety suggestions from our facility workers. We resolve all findings from our reviews of proposed changes to facilities, equipment, and operations and from analyses of process hazards. Some findings of this type can result in modifications to the process, the prevention program, or administrative controls. The following is a list of improvements that we are planning to implement at the facility during the next 5 years to help prevent and/or have a better response time to accidental chemical releases:\r\n\r\n\tAn engineering review of the leak-tightness of each chlorine room to more precisely determine the building (containment) mitigation factor, possibly \tresulting in reduced endpoint distances for WCS and ARS releases of chlorine\r\n\r\n\tAn assessment of the effectiveness of each element of the Level 3 Prevention Program to ensure that the program will achieve its objectives and to strive for continuous program improvement"
