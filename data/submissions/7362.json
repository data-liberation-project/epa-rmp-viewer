Ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the refrigeration of the foods in the various areas of the plant.\n\nThe  ammonia threshold for triggering applicability to 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds. The Sidney plant has one ammonia refrigeration process for the preservation of the food products.  The quantity of ammonia stored on-site is approximately 7,375 pounds.  The process does not exceed the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds as set by 40 CFR 68 and thus is not regulated.  If the system charge increases to more than 10,000 lb. on-site, then the facility will be regulated under 40 CFR 68.\n\n\n3.0\tWorst-case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nWorst-Case Scenario Description\n\n \tThe largest potential release of ammonia that would occur at the plant is a rupture in the liquid portion of the freezer recirculator vessel.  Taking the specific definition of the worst-case from 40 CFR 68.25, the largest quantity of ammonia that can be stored in a vessel is in the freezer recirculator vessel during a pump out condition.  The total quantity of ammonia that can be stored in the freezer recirculator is 13,173 pounds without administrative controls.  Passive mitigation controls are applicable to this scenario.  The release would reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario Description\n\n\tThe alternative release scenario that meets both selection criteria is a forklift damaging an evaporative condenser liquid line on the roof.  The pipe is located thirty feet above ground level.  Administrative and passive controls are not applicable to this scenario.  Active mitigation of the release is human intervention (system shutdown at 20 minutes from the start of the release).  The release would reach offsite endpoints and nearby residences.   \n\n\t\n4.0\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nGilardi F"

At Gilardi Foods, ammonia falls under the RMP Program 3 prevention program which is identical to the OSHA PSM program.  EPA has said that if the process is in compliance with OSHA PSM, then it is compliance with RMP Program 3.  Thus, Gilardi Food's ammonia PSM is being reviewed and completed for the RMP document.  \n\nThere are key aspects of the ammonia prevention program that are being developed:\n\n1.\tThe ammonia PSM program at Gilardi Foods includes provisions for employee involvement, procedures for working with contractors, pre-startup safety reviews and managing change within the system. The different sections of the PSM document detail employee participation (hazard analysis team), process safety information, process hazard analysis (PHA - what-if/checklist), operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity, hot work permits, management of change, incident investigation, compliance audits and emergency planning and response (HAZWOPER plan).  The plant, therefore, maintains good training, certification, and employee awareness of operating procedures.\n\n2.\tGilardi Foods has researched information pertaining to the properties and hazards of ammonia, sought professional assistance from experts in the ammonia refrigeration industry, and used many internal resources to develop the ConAgra Frozen Foods - Ammonia Refrigeration Reference Manual.  Block flow diagrams and P&ID's have been developed and are updated as the ammonia refrigeration system audits are completed.\n\n3.\tGilardi Foods has established a hazards analysis team (comprising of plant employees) responsible for updating existing operating procedures for the refrigeration system and also verifying and documenting the mechanical integrity of the system.\n\n4.\tIn the event of a catastrophic release or an incident which could have resulted in a catastrophe, investigations will be undertaken (this is a policy of"

According to 40 CFR Part 68.42(a), there have been no accidental releases at this facility.\n\n\n6.0\tEmergency Response Program\n\nAs mentioned previously, the Gilardi Foods facility has developed an OSHA hazardous substance emergency response program called HAZWOPER. The HAZWOPER document contain detailed procedures for: 1) pre-emergency planning and coordination; 2) personnel roles and lines of authority; 3) training; 4) communication; 5) emergency recognition and prevention; 6) safe distances and places of refuge; 7) site security and control; 8) emergency alerting and response; 9) ammonia decontamination; 10) emergency medical treatment and first aid; 11) critique of response and follow-up; 12) personal protective and emergency equipment; and 13) medical surveillance.\n\nGilardi Foods's emergency response plan (HAZWOPER) is a detailed document which discusses the role of employees and management in an emergency situation.  All emergency response personnel undergo training and records of this training are maintained and updated on site.  The plan outlines specific procedures for evacuations, incident alarms and alerting.  Depending upon a given situation, the Fire Department will be called to provide back-up emergency responders and equipment.   The Fire Department will be called for all fire related emergencies.  The incident commander has ultimate control of implementation of the emergency response plan.\n\n\n7.0\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe plant has a safe ammonia system and they continue to make it even safer with improvements such as: ammonia sensors in the engine room, which will be tied to the ventilation system."

The Gilardi Foods facility has a thorough emergency training program for on-site emergency responders.  The facility has implemented Gilardi Foods HAZWOPER plan (emergency response program) which is a plan designed for the safety of its employees', the community and the environment.  This detailed emergency response program includes procedures for handling an emergency - the established action plan and appropriate personnel involved in containing a hazardous release (HAZMAT team).  As part of this emergency response program, Gilardi Foods emphasizes a thorough training program and medical surveillance of the HAZMAT team prior to and after an incident.  With the potential dangers associated with a hazardous chemical release, Gilardi Foods has researched and developed safe containment and disposal procedures as well as an evaluation procedure following an emergency response.  All of these components make the Gilardi Foods HAZWOPER plan a thorough and comprehensive plan for release prevention and emergency response.\n\nThe emergency response policies at the Gilardi Foods facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage 24 hours - 7 days per week.  There are also provisions for coordination with outside agencies such as the Sidney Fire Department in the event of an emergency.\n\n*From this point in the Executive Summary, anhydrous ammonia will be synonymous with ammonia.\n\n\n2.0\tProcess Description and Regulated Substances\n\nGilardi Foods is a producer of prepared frozen pizzas.
