Plant personnel monitor the operation of the refrigeration system on a daily basis.  Periodic preventative maintenance procedures are performed on the refrigeration equipment, including inspecting and testing the equipment to ensure the mechanical integrity of the system.  Properly maintained equipment reduces the risk of an accidental release.\r\n\r\nWhile it is Ducor Cold Storage's objective to be a responsible citizen of the community in all of its business activities, the limited staff at the cold storage facility precludes emergency response operations.  As such, an emergency action plan has been prepared for the Ducor Cold Storage facility and a chain of command to respond to emergencies has been established.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \r\n\r\nThe Ducor Cold Storage facility is located at 5351 Road 236.  Ducor is the closest community to the Ducor Cold Storage facility.  \r\n \r\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as the refrigerant that provides cooling for the Ducor Cold Storage facility.  The refrigeration system currently consists of two suction accumulators with liquid transfer systems, six compressors, three evaporative condensers, two high pressure receivers, eight pre-cooler rooms, nine cold storage rooms, and the associated hallway, staging and shipping areas.  Bunker mounted accumulators are utilized to feed the flooded evaporators in the pre-cooler rooms and cold storage rooms.  \r\n\r\nDuring normal operation, the anhydrous ammonia is distributed throughout the refrigeration system.  However, during major maintenance activities, the refrigeration system can be pumped down to evacuate the ammonia from the system and store it in the high pressure receivers.  The maxim"

The maximum storage capacity for both high pressure receivers is 40,109 pounds.  \r\n\r\nWorst Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\r\n\r\nOffsite consequence analyses are used as tools to assist in emergency response planning.  The RMP regulations require the owner or operator of a stationary source to analyze the offsite impacts due to an accidental release of a regulated substance.  The offsite consequence analysis for a Program 3 process must analyze the worst case release scenario and an alternative release scenario.  Since the ammonia-based refrigeration system at the Ducor Cold Storage facility is considered a Program 3 process, both release scenarios were evaluated in the offsite consequence analysis.\r\n\r\nThe offsite consequence analysis must include an estimate of the residential population within an area potentially affected by the accidental release scenario.  This area is defined as a circle with a radius equivalent to the distance the release would travel with concentrations at or above the toxic endpoint.  The circle also defines the area in which potential environmental receptors must be identified.\r\n\r\nThe worst case release is defined by the U.S. EPA as the total release of the contents of the single largest vessel or pipe within 10 minutes.  For liquefied gases stored under pressure, the entire contents of the vessel or pipe are assumed to be released as a vapor.  A total vapor release is highly unlikely.  However, this standardized worst case scenario was developed for emergency response agencies to use for planning purposes.\r\n\r\nAn alternative release scenario is a release that is more likely to occur than the worst case release scenario.  For the Ducor Cold Storage facility, the alternative release scenario was selected based on the results of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for the ammonia-based refrigeration system.

A leak from a valve packing was identified in the PHAs as having a medium probability of occurrence with a discharge rate high enough to cause an offsite impact, and therefore, was chosen as the alternative release scenario.\r\n\r\nAn analysis of the offsite consequences for the worst case and alternative release scenarios was completed for the Ducor Cold Storage facility.  For the worst case release scenario, the release of 26,426 pounds of ammonia from the largest outdoor high pressure receiver over a 10 minute period was modeled.  The RMP*Comp model indicated the worst case plume would travel 1.9 miles at concentrations at or above the endpoint.  Using 1990 Census data, the population potentially affected within the worst case release scenario circle is 212 persons.  The public receptors from the worst case release scenario include residences and a few agricultural facilities.  There were no environmental receptors within the worst case release scenario circle.\r\n\r\nIn the alternative release scenario, a packing leak from an isolation valve located on the roof was modeled as a release of liquefied ammonia stored under pressure.  For a release of 11 lb/min of anhydrous ammonia, the model calculated that the plume would travel less than 0.1 mile at concentrations at or above the endpoint.  No residences are located within the 0.1 mile area around the Ducor Cold Storage facility.  As such, there would be no population impacts from the alternative release scenario.  There were also no other public receptors or environmental receptors within the alternative release scenario circle. \r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nA PSM program, which meets the requirements of the general accidental release prevention program, has been implemented by the Ducor Cold Storage facility to address the anhydrous ammonia system.
