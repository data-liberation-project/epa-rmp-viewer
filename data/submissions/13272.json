Solutia, Pensacola is one of the 18 chemical manufacturing facilities that make up the company.  Solutia, Inc. has approximately 8000 employees.\n\nBuilt in 1953, the Pensacola Plant is situated on a 2200 acre tract, 12 miles north of the City of Pensacola, on the Escambia River.  Over 600 acres are presently in use.\n\nMost major raw materials (ie. Anhydrous Ammonia and Butane are the two regulated substances)  arrive at the plant by barge on the Escambia River -- 7 miles from the Intercoasta Waterway.   Rail and truck shipments of Butane supplement the barges.  Butane barges can hold up to a maximum of 3.3 million pounds, remain under the control of the carrier, and normally there are no more than two barges are on site at any one time. The plant could have as many as 25 rail cars with the largest containing 160,000 pounds.  There could be as many as 10 tanker trucks on site with the largest containing 45,000 pounds.   We only receive anhydrous ammonia by barge and it remains under the carrier's control.  Although we have never had more than one barge of ammonia on site,  we believe there could be situations warranting  two.  The largest ammonia barge contains 5 million pounds.    \n\nStaffing at Pensacola is currently just under 1450 Soluita employees and 1350 permanent contract employees.\n\nSolutia Inc. is the world's largest producer of nylon carpet staple -- all here in Pensacola.  In addition the facility produces nylon polymer chips for the automotive and electrical industries."

Goal and Objectives\n\nThe site established a 1999 recordable goal of nine or less injuries.  Other safety goals were established to reduce the number of recommendations in the electronic tracking system that pass their due date and to those for which no one has yet to accept responsibility.  Plant objectives were set for increasing involvement in the Behavior Based Safety (BBS) processes, toward completing in-depth process hazard analysis, and maintaining the safety manual rules up-to-date.  \n\n      d.  Planning\n\nFor continuous improvement, the Site Safety Steering Committee(SSSC) continues to  reevaluate it function and redefine its goal.  The SSSC is engaged in improving the communication of ES&H issues. \n\nThe site has reorganized the training group and is utilizing a new software to improve the delivery and quality of the computer based compliance training program.\n\nThe Industrial Hygiene sampling strategy was revised in 1998.  At each year end, the IH group  examines the sampling strategy and past monitoring results to develop the next year's sampling schedule.  \n\nA BBS implementation committee was formed to assist those areas that are not currently involved in this process to help remove roadblocks.\n\nSafety audits, pre-start-up audits of equipment and project reviews are conducted to ensure safe operation of equipment and safety procedures are in place.  Work plans are generated prior to the start of many tasks and several areas conduct Job Safety Analyses for tasks.  \n\n      e.  Written Safety and Health Program\n\nThe \"Safety Program Management\"  Section II - 1.19 procedure was rewritten in 1998, and reissued after employee and management input/approval during the 1st Quarter of 1999. \n\n      f.

The contents will be collected each day by mail room employees and delivered to the Safety Department.  A new category has been added to the ACT System for follow-up and tracking.  A list of concerns and suggestions as well as the status of the recommendations will be posted on the bulletin board near each box.  This additional method of reporting hazards is documented in the Safety Program Management rule Section II-1.\n\nEmployees are encouraged to express safety concerns and suggestions to Area supervision and the Safety Department as they arise.  However, if an employee wishes to express concerns or suggestions anonymously, they should contact the Safety Department via plant mail or by phone expressing their concern.  The employee may also utilize the Safety Suggestion Drop Boxes located at 4 of the plant entrances.\n\n      f.  Accident/Incident Investigation System\n\nThe Accident Reporting and Investigation Procedure (Section VI-1.00) was revised in 1998.  Two"

Success Stories \n \n1.  Fire Truck\n\n     The Fire Department was successful in its efforts to purchase a new fire truck. Early in 1997 the plant formed a team of fire chiefs and representatives from Safety and Fire Protection to develop a project and specifications for a new fire truck.  By September 1, 1997 the committee had completed the project, developed preliminary specifications for the new truck. The company placed the order for the new truck with a check for approximately $255,000.00.  Nearly one year later and several specification review meetings the plant took delivery of a new E-One, Industrial Foam Pumper in June, 1998.  The truck has a 1500 gallon per minute pump and holds 1,000 gallons of foam and 500 gallons of water.  The new truck is very reliable and the pump panel is very simple and easy to operate.\n\n2.  Focus Walkthru Program  \n\n     The site fully implemented the Focus Walkthru Program during 1998.  This procedure provides a self assessment process for evaluating an area's level of compliance with ES&H requirements.  It provides for increased interaction between Site Leadership Team members and other employees.  They are conducted on a periodic basis to determine compliance with established procedures, work practices, Government regulations, and Solutia polices.  The site used this program in selected areas in previous years.  Its site wide use is considered to be another successful tool for performing self assessments.\n\n3.

This new system provides \"one stop\" information directing the employee to the MSDS for details, and is expected to increase awareness of chemical hazards and protective measures.\n\n4.  ES&H Compliance Owner Process\n\n     During 1998 the ESH Team developed and fully implemented an Environmental, Safety and Health Compliance Owner Process.  An ESH Compliance Owner (CO) was selected for every area of the plant site who was recognized as the specialist or the point of contact for all ESH issues.  In addition to their job responsibilities as area facilitators, process engineers, and technicians they accepted a broad range of additional ESH related responsibilities, all aimed at achieving the site's goal of daily ESH excellence.  During the year the CO's received extensive training from the ESH staff, met approximately quarterly to network and utilized an electronic communication system. \n\n     All CO's were trained and provided with appropriate resource materials in the form of permits, audit checklists, guidance documents, and electronic database access.  During the year the CO's effectively served as  ESH ambassadors and ESH resources for each area of the plant.  This process proved to be an essential element in the plant's effort to achieve continuous improvement in ESH performance."
