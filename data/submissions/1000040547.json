This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention programs, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes. Our equipment adheres to process safety policies, guidelines, and best practices that have been developed based on company and industry experience over the years. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the incident.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe regulated equipment is owned by Ineos and is located at the BP Naperville Campus at 150 West Warrenville Road, Naperville, Illinois 60563. The primary purpose of this equipment is to conduct polymer research and development. At present, Ineos has only one process -- the Polypropylene Process-- which is subject to the Clean Air Act Risk Management Planning requirements. This process contains two flammable regulated substances which are in excess of the threshold quantity as follows: propylene and ethylene. Propylene is stored on site in an outdoor vertical 15,000-gallon tank. The maximum allowable fill volume of the tank is 12,000 gallons, which equates to 53,000 pounds. This is greater than the quantity of ethylene onsite at any given time. The maximum quantity of ethylene stored on site at any time is 12,000 lbs. The propylene tank is located within the facility's 300 Tank Farm. The tank farm has an additional tank, formerly used to store an isobutylene mixture, which is currently out of service and has been filled with low pressure nitrogen. Other parts of the covered process include the polyolefin pilot plant, small polyolefin pilot plant and the flammable liquids shed associated with laboratory operation. Please note that Ineos"

Since this process is also regulated by the OSHA PSM standard, the summary is organized in the format of the OSHA PSM elements.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nIneos encourages employees who work in the Polypropylene Process to participate in multiple facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved are documented in our Employee Participation Plan.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe Polypropylene Process personnel keep a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. The Polypropylene Pilot Plant has documentation available showing the location of this information to help employees and visitors locate any necessary process safety information. \r\n\r\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known exposure concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical ratings of equipment, piping and instrument drawings, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and operator training, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\r\nIneos has a program to ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. This process applies to the Polypropylene Pilot Plant. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nIneos primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team's recommendations are forwarded to management for resolution.

These procedures are developed/revised by experienced operators as needed and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. The procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate and may be revised as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\r\n\r\nIneos has established safe work practices to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) control of site entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources while equipment is undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into confined spaces, and (5) a permit and procedure for performing Hot Work in areas that contain flammable materials. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that research and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Ineos has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.

This system requires that changes to process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, etc. be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change. The system helps to ensure that all documentation is updated and training completed prior to the commissioning of the change.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nIneos promptly investigates all incidents and near misses that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the root cause and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked to completion. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years, so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits"

      "SummaryText": "To help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly in the Polypropylene Process, Ineos periodically conducts an audit. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. Both hourly and management personnel participate in the audit. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked to completion. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports along with the resolution of findings are retained.\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe processes at Ineos have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all Program 3 EPA RMP covered processes at Ineos, currently only the Polypropylene Process. Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, Ineos has process safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of a release. The following types of safety features are used in the 300 Tank Farm.\r\n\r\nRelease Detection\r\n\r\n1. Hydrocarbon detectors with alarm.\r\n\r\nRelease Containment/Control\r\n\r\n1. Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\r\n2. Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\r\n3. Redundant equipment and instrumentation (i.e. uninterruptible power supply for process control system, backup firewater pump)\r\n4. Atmospheric relief devices\r\n\r\nRelease Mitigation\r\n\r\n1. Fire suppression and extinguishing systems\r\n2. Deluge systems for specific equipment\r\n3. Access to BP Naperville response personnel\r\n4. Personal protective equipment (e.g., protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus)\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION"

      "SummaryText": "Ineos works cooperatively with the landlord (BP) to maintain a written emergency response program, the goal of which is to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The program includes procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion. In the event of a release, BP Naperville emergency response personnel are the first responders. The response procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. In addition, Ineos and the landlord (BP) have procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. Ineos employees and representatives of the landlord (BP) receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated as necessary.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nIneos is committed to the safety of its employees and the surrounding community. In particular, the safe operation of the Polypropylene Process is maintained by ongoing evaluations. For example, through internal audits and employee participation, safety items are regularly identified, evaluated and implemented as appropriate.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the Ineos Naperville site has adopted 20 principles for managing behavioural safety and process safety. These 20 safety principles were rolled out across Ineos sites in 2012. Audits will occur every 3 yrs going forward to evaluate compliance to the 20 safety principles. The foundation of the principles is that Ineos should always seek to ensure asset integrity and people safety through technical solutions supported by organisational solutions. The following 20 principles"

We believe all incidents and injuries can be prevented.\r\n2. Everyone's first responsibility is to ensure they work safely.\r\n3. Everyone has the duty to stop work if they feel the situation is unsafe.\r\n4. The expectations and standards are the same for everyone on the site.\r\n5. Rules and procedures must be observed and respected.\r\n6. We should look out for each other's safety and unsafe situations.\r\n7. All injuries and incidents /near misses must be reported and investigated.\r\n8. Risk assessment must be carried out prior to, during and on completion of work.\r\n9. All team leaders have a special responsibility for promoting and upholding these principles.\r\n10. We must always work within the limit of our competency and training.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Principles:\r\n1. The asset operating manager is responsible for its overall integrity.\r\n2. The asset engineers are responsible for maintaining the asset and protective systems integrity.\r\n3. The responsibilities in the organization for defining and maintaining the correct operating envelopes must be clear.\r\n4. Operating procedures and envelopes must be observed. Deviations must be reported and investigated.\r\n5. Any changes must be properly risk assessed and subjected to MOC procedures.\r\n6. Process hazards are systematically identified, risk assessed, reviewed and managed.\r\n7. All assets must be subject to periodic inspection designed to ensure their integrity and the reliability of their protective systems.\r\n8. Operations must always place the safe operation or shutdown of the asset ahead of production.\r\n9. When in doubt the asset must always be taken to its safest state.\r\n10.
