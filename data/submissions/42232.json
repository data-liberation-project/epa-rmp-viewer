The USEPA provided software designated RMP*Comp (version 1.07) to assist in estimating the distance to a toxic endpoint, in the event of a release as describe herein.  The USEPA\u00bfs RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance provides tables for obtaining toxic endpoints and exhibit B-1 of this guidance document provides 0.0087 mg/L as the toxic endpoint for Chlorine.  \n\n3.2 Alternative scenarios \n\nALTERNATIVE SCENARIO ONE. On a hot day, a one inch diameter flexible line connecting the railcar to the rest of the process has a slow leak (not a complete break) from a 0.125 \u00bf diameter hole.  The line pressure is assumed to be 180 psig.  The chlorine sensor is located about 5 feet horizontally from the rail car and about 15 feet below the hose, and should be activated almost immediately (less than 1 minute).  An operator goes to the control room and puts a respirator on within 9 minutes and has the leak isolated in another 10 minutes.  Total time for the chlorine leak is 20 minutes\n\nRMP*Comp yields a distance of less than 0.1 mile.  In order to obtain a more conservative value, the tables from the OCA Guidance were utilized.  Table 16 of the OCA Guidance, using a release rate of 5 lb./min and toxic endpoint of 0.01 yields an estimated distance to toxic endpoint for this scenario of 0.19 miles. \n\n\n4. General accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps. \n\nIt is the policy of Kemiron to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which Kemiron handles chlorine combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility, the safe handling procedures that are used, and the training of Kemiron personnel. The owners and management of this facility regard employee and public safety as a very serious matter and have taken many precautions to maintain a safe working and public environment.  Some of these steps include:\n\n\u00b7Installing chlorine sensors and alarms;\n\u00b7Ins"

All of the employees handling chlorine have been thoroughly trained. This facility has a strong commitment to the safe handling of chlorine and to minimizing the probability of an accidental release.  This is achieved through a combination of personnel training, process safety equipment and operating procedures.\n\n5. Five-year accident history. \n\nThe Kemiron Great Lakes East Chicago facility is a new plant, and Chlorine handling is scheduled to start in May 2005. In the past 5 years there have not been any accidental releases of chlorine that led to deaths or injuries of people on- or off-site or response or restoration activities at environmental receptors in the last five years. None of the employees or contractors has been involved in any accidents related to the hazardous substances defined in section 112(r) that is stored or handled at this facility. However, Kemiron has developed and implemented an extensive program for investigating and follow-up of all accidents/incidents, which may occur in the future at the East Chicago facility.  \n\n6. Emergency response program.\n\nThe facility has a comprehensive emergency response program.  The Emergency Response Plan contains specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release of chlorine, procedures to inform the public and health care information.  All employees working with chlorine are given 40 hour Hazardous Waste Operator (hazwoper) training with annual 8 hour refreshers.  This plan will be coordinated with the Lake County LEPC.  \n\nKemiron\u00bfs personnel are trained to respond to accidental releases of regul"

This new facility manufactures ferric chloride (FeCl3), ferrous chloride (FeCl2) and other chemicals for the water treatment industry using chlorine gas as one of the raw materials. Chlorine has been identified by the Environmental Protection Agency as a regulated substance subject to section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), which required the preparation of this Risk Management Plan (RMP).  Chlorine is the only chemical on the EPA list present at the Kemiron facility in amount and concentration exceeding the applicability threshold. In addition, due to the Chlorine presence Kemiron is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management standard and is submitting a program level 3 Risk Management Plan.\n\nChlorine is a listed toxic substance under the Risk Management Plan regulations found at 40 CFR 68 and is subject to those regulations since it is stored in quantities in excess of 2,500 pounds. \n  \nKemiron utilizes Chlorine as a raw material to produce FeCl3. Kemiron Great Lakes receives railcars with Chlorine, SPL (Spent Pickle Liquor), and Hydrochloric Acid (HCl) at the East Chicago Facility. Chlorine gas is received in 90-ton (180,000 lb) rail tank cars.   Normally, only two rail tank cars are present on-site at a time, but occasionally up to 6 rail tank cars can be present. Ony one rail car is connected to the process at any one time. The maximum amount of chlorine that can be stored at this plant is 1,080,000 lb.  They are stored under ambient temperatures, which can exceed 100 degrees F in the summer.  Normal internal pressure is 60 to 70 psi, but on a hot day pressures may reach 180 psi in the process. \n\nChlorine gas is piped from the railcars to the reaction vessels (chlorinators), where it reacts with ferrous chloride to form ferric chloride.  There are three reaction vessels, which involve the use of chlorine.   Each reaction vessel is fitted with two, independen"

In case of reaction vessel over pressurization, spring-loaded pressure relief valves would discharge the chlorine into a process tank of ferric chloride.  In the unlikely case of continued over pressurization, a rupture disk is utilized as an additional safety feature.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nAll design has been based on what will result in the safest and most environmentally sound operation. The process is a proprietary closed system. A small amount of water is introduced to the process for pump sealing, dilution, and make-up for cooling tower evaporation.  The process produces hydrogen gas (H2), which is evacuated and scrubbed.  The portion of scrap iron and carbon not digested ends up in a filter press, which is shipped off site to a landfill.  \n\nRMP regulations require offsite consequence analysis for a potential release of chlorine to the atmosphere.  Kemiron Great Lakes is required to consider two release scenarios, identified as \u00bfworst case\u00bf and \u00bf alternative scenario\u00bf.  The first scenario is defined by the EPA, which states that \u00bf the owner or operator shall assume that the \u00bf maximum quantity in the largest vessel \u00bf is released as a gas over 10 minutes,\u00bf due to unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as \u00bfmore likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario\u00bf. To determine the area of impact, Kemiron Great Lakes used an air dispersion modeling program called RMP*COMP which was provided by the EPA.\n\nWorst -case release scenario\n\nThe Clean Air Act risk management planning regulations require Kemiron to prepare a worst-case scenario consisting of the release of the entire contents of the largest vessel containing a regulated chemical in 10 minutes.  The largest chlorine-containing vessel is a rail car, whose content totals 90 tons (or 180,000 pounds).  Hence, the rate of release would be 9 tons/minute (18,000"
