The policy includes working with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies to promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork and to orchestrate an effective contingency plan in the unlikely event of a process incident occurring at the 6th Street Pump Station.  It is the Gadsden Water Works and Sewer Board's policy to adhere to all federal, state, and local laws applicable to the 6th Street Pump Station. \n2.0 Description of Facility and the Regulated Substance Handled\nThe 6th Street Pump Station is a publicly owned and operated wastewater collection and pumping station.  Chlorine is used primarily for disinfecting the sewage before pumping it to West River Wastewater Treatment Plant.  Another possible use for chlorine is for odor control.  The maximum quantity of chlorine stored at the facility is 6,000 pounds (3 one-ton containers).  The chlorination system consists of a vacuum regulator, chlorinator, chlorine leak detector, alarm, associated piping, valves, and other miscellaneous equipment. \n3.0 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\nThe Gadsden Water Works and Sewer Board has complied with the requirements of the RMP Rule, 40 CFR Part 68, for the 6th Street Pump Station.  A comprehensive review of all systems, as well as administrative, technical, and operating and maintenance procedures, has been conducted, in addition to the other required program elements of the RMP Rule.  A detailed hazard review was conducted for the 6th Street Pump Station using a What-If analysis.\n4.0 Five-year Accident History\nThe 6th Street Pump Station has never had a release of ch"
