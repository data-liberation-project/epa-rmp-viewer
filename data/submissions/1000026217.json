The resources invested in the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances demonstrate this commitment.  The CWL Medallion Pumping Station implements reasonable controls, such as training of personnel and the safe design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to make every effort to prevent the release of hazardous substances but in the event of a release, our trained personnel and local emergency response agencies will respond to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injuries to the public or the environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.0    Description of the CWL Medallion Pumping Station and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe CWL Medallion Pumping Station handles one substance regulated by the Risk Management Plan Rule (RMP Rule) in quantities above the Threshold Quantity.  This substance is:\n\n\n\n* Chlorine - stored in 1 ton cylinders and used for disinfection of the water prior to distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.0    Hazard Assessment\n\n \n\nThe RMP Rule requires the CWL Medallion Pumping Station to perform a Hazard Assessment of the regulated substances stored and used in the covered processes at the facility.  This Hazard Assessment includes an offsite consequence analysis for the following scenarios:\n\n \n\n* One worst-case and one alternative release scenario for the toxic substance chlorine for the chlorination process unit at the facility.\n\n\n\nThe CWL Medallion Pumping Station completed a Hazard Assessment for the covered processes and the results have been appropriately communicated to the local emergency response agencies. The Hazard Assessment has been recently updated to reflect chang"

The following details the prevention program elements at The CWL Medallion Pumping Station that apply to these processes.\n\n\n\n4.1    Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe CWL Medallion Pumping Station maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of the CWL Medallion Pumping Station processes.  Material safety data sheets (MSDSs) document the physical and chemical properties of hazardous substances handled at the CWL Medallion Pumping Station, including the chlorine in the covered process.  The engineering design documents include the operating parameters, the design basis and configuration of the equipment in each covered process, and references to applicable codes and standards.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2    Hazard Review\n\n\n\nThe CWL Medallion Pumping Station performs and periodically updates hazard reviews of the covered processes to help identify and control process hazards.  Checklists are used to guide the hazard review.  These checklists include items to help ensure the CWL Medallion Pumping Station operates and maintains the equipment in a manner consistent with the applicable design specifications, codes, standards, and regulations.\n\n\n\n4.3    Operating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe CWL Medallion Pumping Station develops and maintains operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be performed.  The operating procedures are used to:\n\n\n\n1. train employees and contractors, and\n\n2. serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal and abnormal process conditions.\n\n\n\n4.4    Training\n\n\n\nThe CWL Medallion Pumping Station trains personnel in the operating procedures to help ensure safe and effective performance of their assigned tasks. A record of all training is maintained to help ensure new a"

The CWL Medallion Pumping Station maintenance program includes:\n\n\n\n1. procedures to safely guide workers in their maintenance tasks,\n\n2. worker training in the maintenance procedures, and\n\n3. inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before equipment fails.\n\n\n\n4.6    Compliance Audits\n\n\n\nThe CWL Medallion Pumping Station performs periodic (at least every three years) audits of covered processes to verify the processes are operating in compliance with the requirements of the RMP Rule.  A compliance audit report is prepared after each audit, and any deficiencies noted by the audit are corrected in a timely manner.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.7    Incident Investigations\n\n\n\nThe CWL Medallion Pumping Station investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment.  The CWL Medallion Pumping Station trains employees to identify and report any and all incidents requiring investigation.  An investigation team is assembled and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.\n\n\n\n4.8    Chemical-specific Prevention Steps - Chlorine\n\n\n\nIndustry standards are followed at the CWL Medallion Pumping Station to help ensure safe handling of chlorine.  The vendor supplies chlorine via a Department of Transportation (DOT) approved truck and in DOT approved 1 ton cylinders.  The process equipment is designed and constructed with state-of-the-art materials and technology utilizing the standards and guidelines of the Chlorine Institute, American Water Works Association, ASME, ANSI, and other applicable codes.  Workers who perform operations involving chlorine receive training emphasizing safe handling "
