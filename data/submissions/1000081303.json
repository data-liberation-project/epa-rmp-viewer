We shall, as a minimum: (1) consult with employees and their representatives on the conduct and development of the process hazard review and other elements of the risk management plan, and (2) provide to our employees and their representatives access to the process hazard review and all other information required to be developed under that standard.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe City of Conroe believes that preventative maintenance is the key to minimizing the potential for accidental releases. Standard Operating Procedures (SOP's) have been reviewed and revised to enable the employees to perform their work in a safe and efficient manner.\n\nThe city of Conroe has taken steps to educate and inform the operators, suprvisors, and maintenance crews in the appropiate response to an accidental release. The training includes classroom training and operating procedures on the proper response to emergency situations.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Southwest Wastewater Treatment Plant utilizes chlorine for disinfection and sulfur dioxide for dechlorination of the treated wastewater. The maximum inventory and theshold quantities for these chemicals are shown below. All chlorine and sulfur dioxide containers are stored and utilized within separate buildings. The builings will act as passive mitigation in the event of a release.\n\n\n\nChemical Maximum Invento"

It is Conroe's philosophy to continually improve the safe working conditions of its employees to minimize accidents and reduce the potential for either an on-site or off-site release. With this in mind, Conroe has incorporated many of the RMP elements into other areas of the process not covered under 40 CFR 68 to improve the overall safety of the plant."
