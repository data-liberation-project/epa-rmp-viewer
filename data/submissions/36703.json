Water Plant #1 and four other plants have quanties \r\nof regulated hazardous chemicals above the EPA threshold. The City\r\nhas a unified Risk Management Program which applies to each plant.\r\nOnly water Treatment Plant #1 operations and policies are presented \r\nin this Plan.\r\n\r\nWater Treatment Plant #1 uses one regulated substances chlorine \r\n(CAS Number 7782-50-5)in the chlorination process.\r\nThe chlorination process consists of the use of chlorine from\r\none-ton cylinders to disinfect Drinking water.\r\n\r\nIn order to fulfill the requirements of the Risk Management Program\r\n(RMP), the facility has developed an accidental\r\nrelease prevention program and emergency action plan for the \r\nfacility.The accidental release prevention program\r\nsatisfies the requirements for the USEPA RMP and the Occupational \r\nSafety and Health Administration's (OSHA)\r\nProcess Safety Management (PSM) program.  The prevention program \r\nensures that the facility is operated under safe\r\nconditions and that any risk of an accidental release due to human \r\nerror,the facility's prevention program ensures that\r\noperating procedures are current and reviewed annually.Training also\r\nplays a vital part in the facility's program.\r\nEmployees and contractors working near or on the chlorination process \r\nare required to be trained in the chlorination process and the hazards \r\nof chlorine.\r\n\r\nTo prevent equipment failure that could result in a release, the \r\nprogram ensures that equipment inspections, tests, and\r\npreventive maintenance are performed in accordance with accepted \r\nengineering practices, manufacturer's recommendations, and \r\nplanned main"

The potential for a chlorine release is greatly \r\nreduced in the chlorination process due to the use\r\nof a vacuum system from point of chlorine withdrawal to its point \r\nof application.  In the event that there is a failure\r\nin chlorination equipment, the system will automatically shut down \r\n(i.e., failsafe).\r\n\r\nAll existing and proposed future chlorination equipment have been \r\ndesigned according to applicable standards and codes.\r\nThe facility maintains records and documentation on equipment \r\ninspection and tests. Precautions are taken to\r\nensure that new equipment and processes are inspected and testes,\r\nthat all changes on the process are authorized, and\r\nemployees are informed of changes.\r\n\r\nThe facility performed a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) to address \r\nthe hazards in the chlorination process and to\r\nevaluate and control where potential for a chlorine release exists. \r\nEmployees were involved in determining hazards of\r\nthe process and subsequent consequences. The chlorination process \r\nwas found to be operating safely and no changes were recommended.\r\n\r\nActive employee participation will ensure the success of the RMP at\r\nthe facility.
