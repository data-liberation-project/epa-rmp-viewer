We have implemented a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as to protect the environment.  These programs include both Union Carbides Responsible Care. requirements and governmental requirements, such as the Environmental Protection Agencys (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule and the Occupational Safety and Health Administrations (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.\n\n2 Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\nThe South Charleston Technical Center is Union Carbides largest center for engineering, research and development, and integrated data processing.  Most of Union Carbides major processes for petrochemicals have been developed at the Technical Center. \nThe RMP rule requires that if a facility, such as theTechnical Center, has a specific amount (threshold) or more of any one of 140 toxic and flammable chemicals, the facility must follow the RMP rule requirements.  The site does not handle or store threshold quantities of EPA regulated toxic substances.\n\nThe site uses threshold quantities of the following EPA RMP-regulated flammable substances in our pilot plant processes for research and development and in some cases for the production of chemical products:\n\nPropylene    \nEthylene\nIsopentane\n1-Butene\n\n3 Key Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\nEPAs RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenario(s) and alternative release scenario(s) for our facility.

Written operating procedures and a high level shutdown device / alarm limits the maximum filling capacity of this storage tank to 80 percent (69,500 lbs).  According to EPAs Off-Site Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance Table, this release could impact off-site public receptors.  A concrete dike is present around the tank, but it is not recognized by EPA Look-up Table as a mitigating control due to propylenes rapid rate of vaporization.  \nThe following administrative control was used in this analysis:\n7 Inventory Restriction:  Written operating procedures and a high level shutdown device/alarm limit the maximum filling capacity of this storage tank to 80 percent (69,500 lbs.).\nIn addition, specific steps to prevent this scenario from occurring, and to mitigate its effects should they occur, include:\n7 Combustible Gas Detectors/Deluge System:  Sensors are designed to detect flammable vapors and automatically activate an area alarm and deluge system (water spray) to suppress vapors.\n7 Fire Water Spray Monitors: Area fire water spray monitors can be used to help suppress vapors.\n\nAlternative Release Scen"

According to the OCA Guidance Table, this release could impact off-site public receptors. \n\nThe following active mitigation measures are used in this analysis:\n7 Emergency Shutdown System:  Combustible gas detectors are present to detect flammable vapors, automatically isolate and shutdown the chemical transfer pump, and activate the deluge system (water spray) to suppress vapors.\n7 Operator Surveillance:  An operator is required to be present while unloading ethylene from a tank truck.\nThis scenario assumes that the combustible gas detector detects the ethylene vapor and actuates the emergency shutdown system within 5 minutes after the release or the operator detects the release within 5 minutes and manually stops the transfer.\nOther specific steps to prevent this scenario from occurring, and to mitigate its effects should they occur, include:\n7 Fire Water Spray Monitors: Area fire water spray monitors can be used to help suppress vapors.\n\n4 General Accidential Release Prevention Program \n\nA) General Program\n\nOur general accident prevention program consists of compliance with the EPA RMP rule and OSHAs PSM standard and implementation of Union Carbides Operational Safety Program and Episodic Risk Management System.
