Maximum capacity of the storage tank is 188,000 gallons.\n\nSummary of Release Scenarios\n\nWorst Case Release\n\nNatural Gasoline:\nThe worst case release scenario would be a total loss of a full tank of natural gasoline resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The storage tank capacity is 188,000 gallons or 1,034,000 pounds.  Of the 1,034,000 pounds, about 705,705 pounds are made up of the materials subject to the Risk Management Plan.\n\nAlternative Release\n\nNatural Gasoline:\nThe most likely cause of a natural gasoline is a release during a delivery due to a faulty hose or valve resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  Deliveries are most often made by tank truck and less frequently by railcar and pumped into the storage tank.  The alternative scenario uses railcar as it involves the largest quantity.  Deliveries by rail are typically 30,000 gallons or 166,000 pounds of which 111,375 pounds are made up of the materials subject to the Risk Management Plan.\n\nUnloading of denaturant railcars occurs during business hours and is observed by facility personnel.  If a release were to occur the attendants could stop the flow within minutes.  The loadout area where deliveries occur has a catchment basin with underground piping to secondary containment. \n\nExplanation on prevention of Natural Gasoline releases:\n\nPassive Mitigation\nThe natural gasoline storage and unloading are equipped with secondary containment (Tank Farm).  Material release from unloading or tank farm will stay in the secondary containment.  Electrical equipment in the tank farm area is rated for Class 1 Division 1 to prevent any leakage from being ignited by electrical equipment.\n\nActive Mitigation\nHot work in the unloading area and tank farm is strictly controlled by hot work permits.

      "SummaryText": "The Andersons Marathon Holding LLC\nGreenville Operations\nRisk Management Plan - Executive Summary\n\nSite and Process Description\n\nThe Andersons Marathon Holdings LLC is located at 5728 Sebring Warner Road, located north of Sebring Warner Rd in the City of Greenville in Darke County, Ohio.  The facility operates 24 hours a day and 7 days a week with a staff of approximately 63 people.\n\nThe following operations are performed at this facility: Grain Receiving, Drying and Storage, Grain Milling, Fermentation, Distilling, Dehydration and Evaporation, Decanter Separation, Corn Oil Extraction, Wet and Dry Distillers Grain with Solubles (WDGS / DDGS) Drying, Wet and Dry Distillers Grain with Solubles Storage and Shipping, and Ethanol Storage and Shipping.  \n\nCorn is stored temporarily in concrete silos and steel bins prior to being fed to four Hammer Mills where the corn is dry-milled into a powder and then conveyed to the production area.\n\nCorn is blended with water and enzymes and pumped into Fermenters for batch fermentation.  Fermentation final product results in a Beer Mash, a mixture of ethanol, non-fermentable solids, and water.  The Beer Mash product goes through a degassing process to remove residual volatile organics from fermentation, and then enters the distilling process.\n\nCO2 gas is a byproduct of fermentation and sent to a scrubbing process that reduces the amount of ethanol and hazardous air pollutants released to the atmosphere.  A blend of water with and chemical additive flows countercurrent to the gases and removes the ethanol and HAPs from the CO2 gas.  CO2 gases from the Scrubber system vent to atmosphere or a dry ice production facility adjacent to property.\n\nThe distilling process separates components of the Beer Mash that results in 190-proof ethanol, non-fermentable solids and water.  The 190-proof ethanol is pumped to bulk storage prior to pumping into a dehydration process to remove the residual water, with the final product resulting in 200-proo"
