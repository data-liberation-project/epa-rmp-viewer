The purpose of the PSSR is\n\nto ensure those safety features, procedures, personnel and\n\nequipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to\n\nplacing the equipment in service.  This review provides one\n\nadditional check to verify that construction is in\n\naccordance with design specification and that all-supporting\n\nsystems are operationally ready.  Applicable checklists are\n\nused to verify all aspects of readiness.

The basic\n\naspects of the program include:  (1) training, (2)\n\ndeveloping written procedures, (3) performing inspections\n\nand tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5)\n\napplying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these\n\nactivities form a system that maintains the mechanical\n\nintegrity of the process.\n\n\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training in (1) overviews of\n\nthe process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable\n\nmaintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and 5)\n\napplicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can\n\nperform their jobs in a safe manner.  Equipment\n\ndeficiencies, once identified, are corrected prior to\n\nfurther operation of the equipment, or a management team\n\nwill review the use of the equipment and determine what\n\nactions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the\n\nequipment.\n\n\n\nAs part of the mechanical integrity program, quality\n\nassurance measures are incorporated into equipment purchases\n\nand repairs.

These procedures\n\nare used by all personnel involved in both user and non-user\n\nmaintenance activities.\n\n\n\n1.6.12 Management of Change\n\nThe Akzo Nobel Industrial Specialties management of change\n\nprogram is a system to review and evaluate changes to\n\nprocess chemistry, operating conditions or limits,\n\nequipment, and procedures to prevent unexpected adverse\n\nimpacts.    The management of change program uses a\n\nquantitative risk assessment to determine the significance\n\nof the change.
