      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\n\n\nThe Ignacio Gas Plant has implemented all the elements of a Program 3 Risk Management Plan (RMP) and all the elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program. The Ignacio Gas Plant has also implemented the elements of Harvest Midstream Environmental, Health and Safety standards. \n\n\n\nThe Ignacio Gas Plant's Emergency Response Plan (ERP) is site-specific. It includes required actions by plant employees as well as required notification and coordination with local responders and agencies. All employees are trained in the execution of the ERP and drills are conducted annually.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\n\n\nThe Ignacio Gas Plant (IGP) processes raw natural gas into pipeline quality natural gas and other natural gas liquids. The raw natural gas is received by two pipelines, one containing NGLs and one that contains little NGL liquid but has some CO2. The IGP is a natural gas liquids (NGL) extraction facility with fractionation and is designed to treat and process approximately 600 MMSCFD of raw field natural gas. \n\n\n\nThe purpose of the IGP is to produce pipeline spec residue gas by separating NGL out of the raw field gas to produce a residue gas, fractionated liquids for local sales, liquefied natural gas, and a Y-grade stream. The NGL rich gas is compressed on the inlet of the plant and then treated by an amine plant to remove CO2 and any H2S. Next, water is removed using a glycol dehydration system followed by a molecular sieve dehydrator.  The gas flows into the cryogenic plant, where using pressure drop and refrigeration, the gas is cooled and heavier liquids condense. The residue gas flows to the recompressors and to the tailgate of the plant. The liquids produced flow either to the fractionator for separation into saleable products, propane, field grade butane, or natural gasoline, or it flows directly to the Y-grade tanks. From the Y-grade tanks the liquids are pump"

The inlet pipeline with CO2 is compressed on the inlet of the plant and dehydrated in a glycol system if needed. It is then blended with the residue gas from the cryogenic plant to produce pipeline quality gas on the plant outlet.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\n\n\nThe Ignacio Gas Plant has implemented all the elements of a Program 3 Risk Management Plan (RMP) and all the elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program. The Ignacio Gas Plant has also implemented the elements of Harvest Midstream Environmental, Health & Standards. Key elements of these programs include:\n\n\n\n?Process Safety Information: A variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.\n\n\n\n?Process Hazard Analysis (PHA): A systematic examination of the plant to identify possible hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\n?Operating Procedures: The Ignacio Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) initial start-up, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) emergency operations, (6) normal shutdown, and (7) start-up after turnaround.\n\n\n\n?Contractors: Ignacio Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors, (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) are aware of any hazards in the workplace, (3) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (4) understand and follow site safety rules, and (5) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. \n\n\n\n?Pre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs): The purpose of the PSS"

      "SummaryText": "R is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup before placing modified equipment into service.\n\n\n\n?Mechanical Integrity: The Ignacio Gas Plant has well established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in safe operating condition. \n\n\n\n?Safe Work Practices and Procedures: Examples of safe work practices include methods for controlling plant entry, presence and exit of support personnel, lockout/tagout procedures to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, hot work procedures and permits for work with the potential for generating ignition sources in the presence of flammable or combustible material, and confined space entry permits and procedures to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry is allowed into a permit required confined space.\n\n\n\n?Training: The plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. The program includes OTJ training. Employees are tested to demonstrate competency.\n\n\n\n?Management of Change: Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.\n\n\n\n?Incident Investigation: The goal of each investigation is to determine that facts concerning an incident or near miss and to develop corrective actions to prevent recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.\n\n\n\n?Compliance audits: Audits are conducted on a regular basis to ensure that the facility is in compliance with applicable RMP/PSM procedures and regulations.\n\n\n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History:\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases in the past five years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program Information:\n\n\n\nThe Ignacio Gas Plant maintains a written emergency response program to protect employees"

      "SummaryText": ", contractors, public and the environment from hazards associated with accidental releases of regulated substances. The program consists of procedures for responding to releases of regulated substances, including the possibility of associated fires or explosions. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, and notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs. Employees receive training in these procedures annually to perform emergency response duties. The program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the gas plant processes. Emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process.  \n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for Ignacio Gas Plant is coordinated with La Plata County LEPC. This coordination includes attending periodic meetings, which includes local emergency response officials and industry representatives. The Ignacio Gas Plant has 24-hour communications capability with the La Plata County LEPC. The Plant conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the La Plata County LEPC and emergency response organizations. \n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\n\n\nIn response to the most recent Process Hazard Analysis, the Ignacio Gas Plant plans to evaluate additional engineering safeguards and continue training of employees and contractors. These additional safeguards will lessen the risk associated with the release of regulated substances."
