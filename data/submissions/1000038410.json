Facility Policy\n\nThe management and employees of the Ottawa Cooperative Association are committed\n\nto the prevention of any accidential releases of anhydrous ammonia. If any releaase\n\nshould occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire depertment and or other \n\nauthorities to mitigate and minimize the imacts of the release to the people and the \n\nenvironment.\n\n\n\n2. Facility Informaation\n\nOur plant consists of two NH3 storage vessels. Our maximum inventory report is located\n\nin our compliance manuals. We have also shared this quanitity with our local first\n\nresponders to help them in planning and training.\n\n\n\n3. Worst case scenario and alternate release scenario\n\nThe worst case and the alternate release scenarios have been evaluated and shared \n\nwith our local first responders as part of an on going training program. More\n\nimportantly, our employees have been trained in their respective emergency actions,\n\nincluding  the emergency meeting place and each of their individual responsibilities\n\nregarding an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\n4. Accidental release program\n\nThe facility strives to comply with the provisions of the US occupational safety and\n\n health administration (OSHA), 29 cfr, 1910.111  \"storage and handling of anhydrous\n\nammonia\".  This facility is also in compliance with the provisions of the kansas\n\nfertilizer law.  The OSHA standard is referenced in the rmp registration form in\n\nsection 8.3 b.\n\nThere are many hazards associated with anhydrous ammonia. We require that each \n\nemployee that loads ammonia be trained every three years at a state sponsered\n\ntraining school and yearly trained in operating and safety procedures at a given\n\nammonia plant. All employees are trained to inspect the ammonia plant before\n\nfilling procedures and before use do a visual enspection of all hoses and valves to\n\nmake sure there has not  been a failure of equipment since the last time it was used.\n\nEmployees are reminded "

Five year accident history\n\nSince this is a new plant there have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia\n\nthat have caused deaths, injury, or significant property damage at the facility nor to\n\nour knowledge has there been any accidental releases resulting in off site death,\n\ninjuries, evacuations, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n6. Emergency action plan\n\nA. A written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910-38\n\nB.
