This training includes topics such as classification\nsystems and hazard identification; ammonia spill control and containment; respiratory protection; air monitoring instrumentation; proper personal protective equipment; medical monitoring; and proper termination procedures for emergency response activities. The facility conducts annual HAZWOPER refresher training to keep employees current and comfortable with their responsibilities under the plan using classroom discussion and response to mock emergency scenarios.\n\nAs part of the RMP requirements, SFI undertook a review of the potential offsite consequences of the accidental release of the largest vessel in the systems. Although such a release is highly unlikely, the regulation requires this review.\nSFI stores and uses anhydrous ammonia on site for refrigeration of products in storage as well as for cooling of manufacturing process lines. Ammonia is used for its excellent energy efficiency and flexibility, in addition to benefits to employee safety. Ammonia at the facility is kept entirely within the refrigeration system, much as the refrigerant in your car air-conditioner. \n\nSFI is committed to minimizing accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration p"

Schreiber has more than 30 manufacturing and distribution facilities globally.\n\nThe SFI \u2013 Green Bay Plant employs approximately 184 people.

Anhydrous ammonia is subject to EPA regulation under 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Risk.\n\nManagement of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.\nPursuant to the RMP regulations (40 CFR 68) and the Process Safety Management (PSM)\nregulations, SFI has developed a comprehensive PSM written program to protect our employees and the surrounding community from exposure to the hazardous chemicals onsite. The facility completed an initial process hazards analyses (PHAs) for ammonia using the industry standard HAZOP Analysis developed through the International Institute for Ammonia Refrigeration. The most recent PHA revalidations were completed in 2022 using the HAZOP methodology. The original and revalidation PHAs were completed using technical and operations staff from the Green Bay Plant as well as experienced facilitators.\nThe PHAs reviewed operational, human factors, and facility siting issues relative to the design of the refrigeration system, and recommendations were made, as appropriate, to address these concerns. SFI's implementation of the PSM program includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce employee and community exposure to accidental releases of ammonia. The plans include preventive maintenance programs (mechanical integrity) for the ammonia system, and a program for both pre-startup safety reviews and management of changes"
