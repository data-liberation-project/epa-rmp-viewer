One overall planning philosophy that is included promotes a safe working environment.  An example of implementing this philosophy is when the Safety and Training Department reviews accident reports, investigates specific situations, and makes recommendations to correct safety problems. More specifically, this safety philosophy is exemplified in an accidental release prevention policy utilizing an approach that combines management strategies with technological controls and operating procedures.  Management strategies include minimizing the amount and types of hazardous chemicals used/stored at the facility. Operating procedures include hazard awareness training, and having an emergency response plan to address accidental releases from the facility.  Technological controls include automated safety valves and vacuum operation of chlorine injection systems.      \n\n\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nMPW is a municipal water, electric and communications utility.  The utility serves the city of Muscatine, Iowa (population 23,000) and certain adjacent surrounding areas.  Regulated substances addressed by this plan are used at the MPW Generation Station. The two chemicals included in the Risk Management Plan are chlorine (Cl2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2).   Both chemicals are used for water treatment.  Chlorine is used as a biocide and disinfectant.  Sulfur dioxide is used for dechlorination.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are delivered in cylinders by truck and stored as a liquid under pressure, but are removed from and used in the vapor or gaseous state.  \n\n\n\nThe Generation Station, which has controlled access 24 hours per day, includes four electric generating units with ancillary equipment.

      "SummaryText": "lorine is used to treat once-through condenser cooling water for three of the generating units. The water is withdrawn from and returned to the Mississippi River.  Chlorine inhibits biofouling of the condenser tubes (biofouling restricts flow through the tubes and reduces thermal exchange efficiency). To be effective, the chlorine concentration in the cooling water is high enough that the water must be dechlorinated in order to meet the allowable chlorine discharge limit in the station National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit.  Sulfur dioxide is used for dechlorination.  \n\n\n\nA single building houses the equipment for both chlorination and dechlorination of the cooling water for all three generating units.   Two rooms in the building are used for chlorination/dechlorination.  One room houses the control equipment.  The other room houses the chlorine and sulfur dioxide cylinders.  Only two chlorine cylinders and one sulfur dioxide cylinder are connected to the system at a time. The facility is normally unmanned, but laboratory personnel who operate the equipment or operations personnel, visit the facility daily.  The facility has leak detection sensors for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  The alarms for these sensors sound in the Unit 9 Control Room of the adjacent power plant building that is staffed 24 hours per day, 365 days per year and activate a strobe light and audible alarm outside the building.  The alarm also generates a print out from the laboratory PLC that can be used to control the equipment remotely.  When an alarm is activated, control room personnel contact appropriate response personnel to investigate the cause of the alarm and address any problem(s).\n\n  \n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n       \n\nThe MPW general accidental release prevention program incorporates the following elements:\n\n   1.

Compliance audit review of equipment and procedures.\n\n\n\nChemical specific release prevention steps consist of implementing procedures and utilizing equipment.  For example, it is less stressful for the laboratory personnel to wear a full-faced respirator and use the buddy system whenever making cylinder connections.  Equipment precautions include release detectors.\n\n\n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\n\n\nNo accidental release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide has occurred from the facility during the past five years.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe utility has a chemical specific emergency response plan for chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  This plan establishes procedures, assigns responsibilities, identifies assembly areas, addresses shelter/evacuation of the general public, explains arrangements for medical treatment, lists outside assistance sources, contains a utility equipment list, and specifies training requirements.  The utility and City of Muscatine have entered into a 28E State Code agreement that designates the Muscatine Fire Department (MFD) to perform all emergency responses at the facility. Response planning has been coordinated with the MFD (all firefighters are hazmat trained), and a member of the Local Emergency Response Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\n                                                                                                                                                                        \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nSeveral activities during past years have already enhanced the safety of using this chemical.
