Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nCoca-Cola North America \u00bf Paw Paw (CCNA) is committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to our to our accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance and employee training associated with our regulated processes. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible accidental releases of regulated substances. However, if such an accidental release does occur, CCNA has coordinated with the Paw Paw Township Fire Department and the Van Buren County LEPC for emergency response support.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThis facility is used for the packaging of fruit juice and juice-based drink products. Ammonia is the only RMP regulated substance present at the facility in excess of a threshold quantity. It is utilized as the refrigerant in the facility\u00bfs closed-loop refrigeration systems. The systems provide process and warehouse cooling for the raw materials and the facility\u00bfs chilled juice packaging operation. The facility has three (3) separate ammonia refrigeration systems. The amount of ammonia present in the largest refrigeration system is 12,092 pounds. The two (2) smaller systems contain approximately 5,310 and 2,652 pounds of ammonia, respectively. Due to the size and proximity of the refrigeration systems, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, this facility is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR part 68. CCNA is also subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119, as w"

Furthermore, these personnel are offered special training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at CCNA to manage changes in ammonia refrigeration system technology, equipment and procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by an ammonia refrigeration system modification are promptly made aware of, and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews\n\nPre-startup safety reviews are conducted any time the ammonia refrigeration systems, or any of its components, are opened up for repairs, tie-ins or modifications. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating procedures and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nCCNA will conduct audits on a regular basis to ensure that the provisions set out under the RMP regulation are being properly implemented. These audits will be carried out at least every three (3) years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits shall be undertaken in a safe and prompt manner. The latest audit was performed in 2003.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nCCNA promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in an accidental release of ammonia. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions implemented to prevent the release from reoccurring. All incident investigation reports will be retained for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nCCNA believes that accident prevention is a team effort. Employees are strongly encouraged to express th"

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention program that is in place at CCNA.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nCCNA maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nAs part of the ammonia refrigeration system installation process and as required under PSM, the facility conducted a comprehensive study to ensure that hazards associated with its ammonia refrigeration system are identified and controlled efficiently. These studies, using \u00bfWhat If\u00bf scenarios, are repeated every 5 years by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in refrigeration engineering and process operations. Any findings related to the process hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. The latest revalidation was performed in 2003.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purpose of safely conducting activities related to our ammonia refrigeration system, CCNA maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation including startup, normal operations, emergency operations, normal shutdown and emergency shutdown. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to all operators and contractors who work with the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nTraining\n\nCCNA has a training program in place to ensure that employees who are working with the ammonia refrigeration system are competent in all relevant operating procedures. Refresher training is provided at least three (3) years or more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nCCNA carries out and documents maintenance checks on ammonia refrigeration system equipment to ensure proper operation. Process equipment examined by these checks includes, among others, pressure vessels, piping systems, pressure relief valves, emergency sh"

In addition, all employees have access to all information related to RMP implementation, including process hazard analysis (PHA) information.\n\nContractors\n\nCCNA hires experienced contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and/or construction activities related to the ammonia refrigeration systems. Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation is made of the contractor\u00bfs safety performance. CCNA has a policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor\u00bfs work with the ammonia refrigeration systems. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of ammonia occur.\n\n4. Five-year Accident History\n\nAlthough this facility has never had a release that meets the definition of 40 CFR 68.42 for reportability in Section 6 of this submission, in the past five years this facility did experience two minor releases in excess of EPA's RQ.  All required notices and submissions about these releases were made.  The releases did not result in any injuries, deaths, environmental damage or property damage either on-site or off-site, nor were any evacuations or sheltering in place required off-site.\n\n5. Emergency Response Plan\n\nThe CCNA Emergency Response Plan focuses on evacuation of the facility in the event of an ammonia emergency. Containment and mitigation of a release will be accomplished by qualified, offsite contract personnel. Local emergency response agencies will perform rescue, firefighting, first-aid, medical treatment and other response functions only after a release has been stopped and it is safe to enter the premises. CCNA maintains a written Emergency Response Plan to document specific procedures to be implemented in the event of various emergencies, including an ammonia release. The Emergency Response Plan includes procedures for facility evacuation and notification of the local emergency"

The Paw Paw Township Fire Department is the primary emergency response agency for all facility emergencies.\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSeveral changes are planned or underway to improve the safety of the ammonia refrigeration systems at CCNA. In response to the ammonia releases that have taken place two (2) evaporative condensers are being replaced and single pressure relief valves on the system are being upgraded to dual reliefs on 3-way valves to provide redundancy within the relief system and enable a release to be stopped manually in the event a relief valve does not reseat.\n\nA construction project at the facility is expanding the warehouse cooling system to accommodate additional cooler space and the machine room for this system will be expanded and will meet all current codes and standards. In addition, ammonia detectors will be installed to detect both a release inside the machine room and a release via the pressure relief valve system.\n\nFinally, a new automated control system is being planned to replace an old automation system that is no longer supported by the manufacturer and has exceeded its expected useful life."
