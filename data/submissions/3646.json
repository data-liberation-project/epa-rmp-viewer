The CFF facility has a thorough emergency training program for on-site emergency responders.  The facility has implemented CFF's HAZWOPER plan (emergency response program) which is a plan designed for the safety of its employees', the community and the environment.  This detailed emergency response program includes procedures for handling an emergency - the established action plan and appropriate personnel involved in containing a hazardous release (HAZMAT team).  As part of this emergency response program, CFF emphasizes a thorough training program and medical surveillance of the  HAZMAT team prior to and after an incident.  With the potential dangers associated with a hazardous chemical release, CFF has researched and developed safe containment and disposal procedures as well as a evaluation procedure following an emergency response.  All of these components make the CFF HAZWOPER plan a thorough and comprehensive plan for release prevention and emergency response.\n\nThe emergency response policies at the CFF facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage 24 hours - 7 days per week.  There are also provisions for coordination with outside agencies such as the Crozet Fire Department in the event of an emergency.\n\n*From this point in the Executive Summary, anhydrous ammonia will be synonymous with ammonia.\n\n\n2.0    Process Description and Regulated Substances\n\nCFF is a producer of prepared frozen food products, specifically dinners, entrees, and specialty products.  The NAICS code for these processes at this facility is 311412. The facility i"

Ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the refrigeration of the foods in the various areas of the plant.\n\nThe ammonia threshold for triggering applicability to 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds. The plant has ammonia stored on site for two different processes.  The quantity of ammonia stored on-site is approximately 20,924 pounds for the Freezer Warehouse and approximately 177,565 pounds for the Processing Plant.  Thus, 40 CFR 68 is applicable to the Con Agra Frozen Foods (CFF) plant in Crozet, Virginia.\n\n\n3.0    Worst-case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nWorst-Case Scenario Description\n\nThe largest potential release of ammonia will occur with a puncture in the liquid portion of high pressure receiver 1.  The total quantity that can be released during the worst-case release is 19,700 pounds of ammonia. There are no applicable administrative or passive controls for this scenario.  The release would reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario Description - Processing Plant \n\nThe alternative release scenario that meets the selection criteria is an ammonia release from improper oil draining through a valve on the thermosyphon receiver.  In this scenario, an operator would leave the valve open releasing ammonia. The valve open would be oriented in such a way as to produce a horizontal jet release.  The ammonia would be discharged at a height of 2 feet. There are no applicable administrative controls or passive mitigation.  Active mitigation of the release is human intervention (valve closed or system shutdown at 10 minutes from the start of the release).   The release would reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario Description - Freezer Warehouse\n\n    The alternative release scenario that meets the selection criteria is an ammonia rele"

The release wold reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.  \n    \n\n\n4.0    General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nCon Agra Frozen Foods (CFF) has developed an OSHA PSM  program for  their  ammonia refrigeration systems. At CFF, ammonia falls under the RMP Program 3 prevention program which is identical to the OSHA PSM program.  EPA has said that if the process is in compliance with OSHA PSM, then it is compliance with RMP Program 3.  Thus, CFF's ammonia PSM is in general conformance with RMP Program 3.  \n\nThere are several aspects of the ammonia prevention program that are key:\n\n1.    The ammonia PSM program at CFF includes provisions for employee involvement, procedures for working with contractors, pre-startup safety reviews and managing change within the system. The different sections of the PSM document detail employee participation (hazard analysis team), process safety information, process hazard analysis (PHA - what-if/checklist), operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity, hot work permits, management of change, incident investigation, compliance audits and emergency planning and response (HAZWOPER plan).  The plant, therefore, maintains good training, certification, and employee awareness of operating procedures.\n\n2.    CFF has researched information pertaining to the properties and hazards of ammonia, sought professional assistance from experts in the ammonia refrigera"

Block flow diagrams and P&ID's have been developed and are updated as the ammonia refrigeration system audits are completed.\n\n3.    CFF has established a hazards analysis team (comprising of plant employees) responsible for updating existing operating procedures for the refrigeration system and also verifying and documenting the mechanical integrity of the system.\n\n4.    In the event of a catastrophic release or an incident which could have resulted in a catastrophe, investigations will be undertaken (this is a policy of the PSM document).  Necessary preventative measures will be taken to reduce the risk of incident reoccurrence.\n\n\n5.0    Five-year Accident History\n\nThe review of CFF's accident history includes the following range of dates: June 22, 1994 - June 21, 1999. To date, according to 40 CFR Part 68.42(a), there have been no accidents with ammonia at the facility.  \n\n\n6.0    Emergency Response Program\n\nAs mentioned previously, the CFF facility has developed an OSHA hazardous substance emergency response program called HAZWOPER. The HAZWOPER document contain detailed procedures for: 1) pre-emergency planning and coordination; 2) personnel roles and lines of authority; 3) training; 4) communication; 5) emergency recognition and prevention; 6) safe distances and places of refuge; 7) site security and control; 8) emergency alerting and response; 9) ammonia decontamination; 10) emergency medical treatment and first aid; 11) critique of response and follow-up; 12) personal protective and emergency equipment; and 13) medical surveillance.\n\nCFF's emergency response plan (HAZWOPER) is a detailed document, which discusses the role of employees and management in an emergency situation.  All emergency response personnel undergo training and records of this training are maintained and updated on site.  The plan outlines specific procedures for evacuations,"
