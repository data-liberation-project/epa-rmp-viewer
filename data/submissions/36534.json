PURPOSE\n\nThis document describes MeadWestvaco Paper Division - Rumford, Maine mill's philosophy and procedures for managing the risk to employee health, contractor health, public health, and to the environment.  Besides providing a basis for organizing Process Safety Management and Risk Management Plan activities, this document also helps to meet the OSHA requirement of 29 CFR 1910.119 and EPA requirement of 40 CFR Part 68 for a system that oversees the integration and implementation of the elements of a Process Safety Management and Risk Management Plan programs.  Other specific purposes of this document are (1) to clearly define how our Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management Plan (RMP) system meets all regulatory requirements and (2) to explain where to find the programs or results related to each regulatory element.  The Process Safety Management and Risk Management Plan system is designed to ensure that ongoing implementation is effectively maintained.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY \n\nMeadWestvaco Paper Division - Rumford, Maine is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for MeadWestvaco employees, contractors, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, MeadWestvaco's Rumford Mill has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  Two components of this system are a Process Safety Management (PSM) program that helps manage the risk and that complies with the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals; and a risk management program (RMP) that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk manag"

This document is intended to satisfy the RMP requirements of the rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at MeadWestvaco.  These federal regulations apply to this facility because we use various chemicals that are on the PSM/RMP list at or above threshold concentration and quantity.\n\nThe process safety and risk management program at Rumford consists of three elements:\n\n   1.   A hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential off-site consequences of \n         hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five \n         years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated \n         substances) - see topics 1.3 and 1.5\n\n   2.   A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than \n         a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes) - see topic 1.4\n\n   3.   An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated \n         substances from covered processes - see topic 1.6\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMPlan.\n\nCOVERED PROCESSES AND NOT-COVERED PROCESSES\n\nMeadWestvaco Paper Division - Rumford, Maine (\"Rumford\") has Chlorine Dioxide as a covered chemical. \n\nThe Chlorine Dioxide system includes the manufacture and storage of Chlorine Dioxide and ends at the addition of Chlorine Dioxide to the Bleach Plant mixers.  The starting boundaries of the Chlorine Dioxide manufacturing (R-8 Process) begins at the chemical feed pumps; the acid feed pump; the methanol feed pumps (P-59 A & B); and the chlorate feed pump.\n\nChlorine Dioxide is also used as a biocide in the Mill.  The boundary for the biocide system starts at the tie in to the 1.2% (12 g/l) solution from the Chlorine Dioxide Storage and ends at the mixer in the R-8 Chlorine Dioxide Plant where the solution is diluted to 0.2 % (2g/l) solution.

The ruling was that OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard (1910.119) does not extend to stored flammables in \"atmospheric tanks\", even if they were connected to a \"process\" within the definition of the standard.\n\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nRumford is committed to the safety and health of Rumford workers and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Rumford implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes at Rumford; and programs to evaluate the hazards at Rumford.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, Rumford attempts to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will prevent injury to the public or the environment.  Rumford provides response training to Rumford personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local fire department.  Response activities have been discussed and coordinated with the LEPC.\n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, Rumford established a management system headed by the Safety Manager to oversee safety-related activities.\n\n1.2  The MeadWestvaco Corporation - Maine Paper Operations and Regulated Substances\n\nRumford is an integrated pulp and paper mill involved in the manufacture of bleached pulp and related finished paper products.

Employee Participation. MeadWestvaco  Paper Division - Rumford, Maine developed a written employee participation plan for covered processes to help ensure that the safety concerns of MeadWestvaco employees are addressed. \n\n Rumford employees have access to information developed under the Process Safety Management Standard.  The information is in the Process Safety Management Coordinator's office, or information in the office will state where the information or records are stored.\n \n2.  Process Safety Information.  MeadWestvaco maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operations.

Recommendations from the operators are reviewed, and changes to the program are implemented as appropriate.\n\n6.  Contractors. MeadWestvaco Paper Division - Rumford, Maine established a program to help ensure that contractor activities at the Rumford Mill are performed in a safe manner.  The program reviews the safety record of all contractors to help ensure that MeadWestvaco only hires contractors who can safely perform the desired job tasks.  MeadWestvaco explains to the contract supervisors the hazards of the process on which they and their employees will work, MeadWestvaco safe work practices, and MeadWestvaco emergency response procedures.  MeadWestvaco requires that the contractor supervisors train each of their employees who will work at MeadWestvaco before that worker begins work at the MeadWestvaco site.  MeadWestvaco periodically reviews contractor, training documents and work performance to help ensure that safe practices are followed.\n\n7.  Pre-Startup Safety Review.

Management of Change.  The MeadWestvaco Paper Division - Rumford, Maine management of change program evaluates and approves all proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, and procedures for a covered process to help ensure that the change does not negatively affect safe operations.  Process changes that are determined to be a replacement in kind (e.g., replacing a valve with an identical valve) are allowed without completing a management of change.  All other changes must be confirmed through the management of change program to help ensure that inadvertent consequences of process changes are prevented, safety consequences of changes are addressed, affected process safety information and procedures are updated, and affected employees are notified of the changes.\n\n\nThe management of change completed forms are maintained in the mill's Document Control system for a minimum of five years.\n\n11.  Incident Investigation. MeadWestvaco Paper Division - Rumford, Maine investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, and the environment so that similar accidents can be prevented.  MeadWestvaco trains employees to identify and report any incident requiring investigation.  An investigation team is assembled, and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.
