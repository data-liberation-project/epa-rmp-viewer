The specific changes associated with this RMP update include:\n\n\n\n- Adding Direct Transfers between Marine Vessels and Rail Tank Cars of two mixtures that contain n-Pentane, and\n\n\n\n- Various RMP data element updates based on revisions to Stolthaven Houston's Emergency Action Plan (\"EAP\") and our Standard Operating Procedures (\"SOP\") found in the terminal's Local Training Manual (\"LTM\"). \n\n\n\n\n\n? 68.155(a):  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nAt Stolthaven Houston Inc. we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes related to bulk chemical storage and distribution in a safe and responsible manner.  The facility uses a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning programs to protect the environment and to ensure the safety of our employees, our industrial neighbors, and the citizens of the surrounding communities.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that Stolthaven Houston Inc. has designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\n- A description of our facility and the substances regulated by Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 (\"40 CFR 68\") that are currently handled on-site in stationary sources above their corresponding threshold quantities\n\n\n\n- An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n\n\n\n- A five-year history of significant accidental releases from processes covered by the Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") RMP regulations\n\n\n\n- An overview of our emergency response programs\n\n\n\n- An overview of planne"

The facility currently consists of 188 large above-ground storage tanks, five truck loading/unloading racks (Truck Racks T-3, T-4, T-5, T-6 and T-8), four rail car loading/unloading racks (Rail Racks R-1, R-2, R-3 and R-5), one barge dock (Barge Dock-C), and a finger pier jetty equipped with two separate marine vessel berths (Ship Dock 2/3).  A rail car cleaning station is located within the Stolthaven Houston Terminal, and a biological waste water treatment plant and various air pollution control devices are also operated on-site to reduce the impact of the Stolthaven Houston Terminal on the environment.\n\n\n\nBulk liquid products are received into the Stolthaven Houston Terminal by various modes of transportation cargo containers that can include tank trucks, ISO tank containers, flexi-bags, rail tank cars, barges, and marine parcel tankers.  The received liquid products are stored on-site according to customer-specified requirements, and are subsequently transferred off-site through one or more of the above-referenced transportation modes.  Stolthaven Houston Inc. also performs direct product transfers between marine vessels and rail tank cars with no intermediate storage in the facility's above-ground storage tanks.  Similarly, land-based intermodal (IMO) transfers directly between tank trucks, ISO tank containers, flexi-bags, and rail tank cars are also performed routinely at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal.

A VAM filter-pot was also installed adjacent to the storage tank.  Stolthaven Houston's permanent, stationary fire-water protection systems in the immediate area of Tank P50-5 were also upgraded to provide additional cooling water if-needed in the event of an emergency incident involving any of the the facility's flammable or combustible liquid storage tanks in close proximity.

On the evening of August 23, 2013 nitrogen pressure was being used to unload a rail car containing TDI into one of Stolthaven Houston's on-site TDI storage tanks.  As the rail car was being unloaded, the rail switching crew on-duty coupled the terminal's locomotive to a string of rail cars, including the working TDI rail car, and began to pull the cars away from the rail rack.  As the rail car being emptied of TDI was moved from the unloading spot, the TDI cargo hose released from the top of rail car, and the 1-inch valve connected to the plant nitrogen hose was sheared off of the rail car.  Nitrogen pressure in the rail car caused approximately 4,500-gallons of TDI to be released "

There was no off-site release of TDI liquid.  A Stolthaven Houston operator on duty at the rail rack immediately closed the rail rack TDI product line valve leading to the storage tank being filled, and the TDI liquid release from the rail car stopped once the residual nitrogen pressure in the car reached atmospheric pressure.  A third-party environmental response contractor was contacted within an hour of this release to assist with the necessary clean-up efforts, which were completed on the late afternoon of August 27, 2013.\n\n\n\nAs a result of this incident, the following corrective actions were implemented by Stolthaven Houston Inc. after review by the terminal's Management Steering Committee:  (1) the TDI incident was discussed in detail at a mandatory meeting conducted at Rail Rack R-2 for all facility Operations, Waste Water, and Maintenance Department personnel, (2) Standard Operating Procedures related to rail car switching were formally updated on September 20, 2013, and (3) operator training related to the revised rail car switching and blue flag procedures was conducted during Operations Departmental meetings held according to shift in September of 2013.  \n\n\n\nNote that this incident did not result in any on-site deaths or injuries.  Similarly, there have been no accidental releases from any RMP covered processes in the past five years which resulted in known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nAll incidents at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal are formally investigated as part of our facility's ISO QMS to identify and correct the root cause(s) of the events, and to implement appropriate corrective actions for continuous process improvement.\n\n\n\n"
