The requirements involve instituting a prevention plan to avoid unnecessary Chlorine leaks in addition to developing, revising, and updating its existing emergency response procedures.  The expectations of the above-mentioned requirements are to allow minimal injury and damage to occur, as well as to provide aid and guidance for other responders in the event of an accident.\r\n\r\nThe prevention plan, developed by the District, has been designed to ensure that all precautions are taken so as to prevent and mitigate any possible Chlorine release.  One element of this plan is to assess the Chlorine process for potential hazards that could contribute to a leak then correct the problems immediately.  Another essential component is written operating procedures for all duties associated with Chlorine, while another is to provide proper training to employees involved in those duties.  All training and inspection information will be documented for future reference.\r\n\r\nThe emergency response plan was implemented with the intention that plant personnel will respond, contain, and repair all Chlorine leaks.  Therefore, as stated in our plan, we are considered a responding stationary source.  One reason for this is because we feel our employees are properly trained and experienced enough to resolve the problem in a timely manner.  Another reason is because plant policy only allows Chlorine cylinders to be handled only during normal working hours so an adequate amount of qualified responders are present to initiate a response if necessary.  Nonetheless, Chlorine releases are possible after hours, however, two"

The physical address is 1052 Highway 1, Thibodaux. \r\n\r\nBackground Information (North)\r\nThe Lafourche Parish Water District No. 1 is a potable drinking water production facility.  The District purifies water taken from Bayou Lafourche and distributes the water to customers throughout Lafourche Parish. \r\nChlorine gas is used as a disinfectant in the treatment process and is stored, handled, moved, and fed continuously.  The District has one (1) ton cylinders on site.  Plant personnel remove one (1) ton cylinders when empty and replace them with full cylinders.  This involves transporting cylinders with a forklift, lifting the cylinders with a hoist, and mounting a regulator onto the cylinder valve.  All of which is done during normal working hours in order to reduce potential leaks from occurring after hours.      \r\nBy the District's discretion, our facility is classified as a responding stationary source.  District personnel can deal with most emergency response and repair situations; however, outside assistance may be necessary depending on the severity of the Chlorine leak. PPE and repair equipment used to respond to Chlorine releases are provided and stored in a dedicated location at the plant.\r\nThe plant has a dedicated Emergency Response Area.  B repair kits, portable SCBAs, Level B containment suits, gloves, and extra air bottles can be found in an Emergency Response Cart located in this Emergency Response Area.  The Level A containment suits are located in a cabinet on the second floor in the plant foyer.  There are four (4) Self Contained Breathing Apparatuses located at the North Plant.

It will also aid other emergency response personnel by providing guidance in the event of an accident.  Some of the elements of this plan are referenced below.\r\n\r\nAlarm\r\nA Chlorine leak detector sounds an alarm when elevated Chlorine concentrations are found.  The Chlorine alarm will sound continuously for the duration of the abnormal concentrations.  It will not silence until the Chlorine leak is repaired and/or the concentrations have fallen. All employees, contractors, visitors, etc. should exit the leak area while observing the wind direction and immediately report to their designated primary assembly area as noted in the next section.  The Ranking Supervisor for the Purification Department shall proceed with the Emergency Response Coordination. \r\n\r\nAssembly Area\r\nUpon hearing the Chlorine alarm, all purification personnel should immediately report to the Lab/Control Room.  If it is inaccessible, they should then report to an area in the yard that is upwind of the leak.  A windsock is located top of the lime silo for determining wind direction.\r\nPurification Department:\r\nPrimary \tLab/Control Room\r\nSecondary \tDesignated by wind direction\r\nAdministration personnel, distribution personnel, contractors, visitors, etc. should immediately report to their primary assembly area, as long as it appears safe.
