Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance present at our facility.  The entire ammonia inventory is attributed to its use as a refrigerant.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Sysco Northeast Redistribution Center are committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our facility is completely coordinated with the Warren County Fire Department which provides emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), \n\nWorst case and alternate release scenarios were developed using the methodology given in the EPAs Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration. The details of the chosen scenarios are located within the Risk Management Program that is located on site.\n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nSysco Northeast Redistribution Center maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all the processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe methodology used to carry out the analysis is What If-Checklist.  The analyses were undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.
