As requested by EPA, a separate RMP has been prepared and submitted for USAG?s WTP 1 due to the distance separating it from WTP 3.  This RMP complies with the Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA) Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, under Section 112 (r) of the CAA Amendments of 1990, 40 CFR Part 68, also called the Risk Management Program Rule (RMP Rule).  \nThe chlorination system at the WTP 3 uses chlorine gas fed from liquid chlorine containers.  Chlorine is the only chemical subject to the RMP Rule that is used at WTP 3; therefore, it is the only process examined. This document summarizes the existing health and safety programs, internal management response team, policies, procedures, and ongoing actions that are designed to prevent or minimize health and environmental impacts of accidental releases of chlorine. To date, USAG has had an accident-free record of chlorine storage and use at WTP 3, which is attributable to the safety of the process and the focus on training in safety, operating procedures, maintenance procedures, and emergency response procedures. \nUSAG has contracted the operation of WTP 3 to a private contractor (Chugach).  The personnel employed by the private contractor operate the WTP 3.  The private contractor is required to comply with the contractor?s responsibilities of the RMP Rule.\n\n2.0  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nUSAG is committed to the safety of the process, personnel, and the public, and to the preservation of the environment through the prevention of accidental r"

USAG has been proactive in improving the safety of WTP 3 using reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. These controls include leak detectors and alarms; awareness training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes; and programs to evaluate hazards at WTP 3.  USAG requires the private contractor operating WTP 3 to use personnel trained in the operation of the chlorine storage and chlorination system. \nIn the event of an accidental release, the private contractor personnel and USAG Fire Department personnel control and contain the release in a manner that is safe for personnel working in the area and helps prevent injury to the public or the environment.  USAG provides response training to its personnel and to the private contractor personnel upon request, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the Fire Department.\n\n3.0  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Information\nThe WTP 3 is within USAG, which is located in Madison County.  Industrial water is treated to purify water to domestic water standards. \nThe WTP 3 uses rapid sand filters to treat the raw water. Water from the Tennessee River is pumped into a 380,000-gallon clear well. Fluoride and chlorine are added to the water, filtered in the sand filters, chlorinated again, and pumped to a concrete open-top tank with a capacity of 5 million gallons and to another tank with a capacity of 2 million gallons. WTP 3 has a capacity of 4.6 mgd, with an average flow of 3 mgd.\nThe WTP 3 currently stores a maximum of four 1-ton containers of chlorine, for a total storage capacity of 8,000 pounds.  Chlorine gas is withdrawn from the 1-ton chlorine containers for the chlo"

WTP 3 has had no accidental releases of chlorine that led to an offsite impact in the last 5 years.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for WTP 3 is 22131 and it is not among the NAICS codes covered under the RMP Rule.  But the chlorine storage at WTP 3 is subject to the OSHA PSM standard; therefore, they are considered as Program Level 3 processes.  \n\n4.0  Offsite Consequence Analysis\nThe following information summarizes the updated offsite consequence analysis submitted to EPA using RMP*Submit 2004, as required by the RMP Rule.\n\n4.1  Chlorine Hazard Assessment?Worst-case Scenario\nFor the worst-case release scenario (WRS) at WTP 3, USAG evaluated the offsite impacts associated with the release of the entire contents of a single largest vessel or pipe over a 10-minute duration.  The released liquid was assumed to quickly volatilize and to disperse as a vapor cloud.  The maximum distance to the Risk Management Program toxic endpoint concentration of 3 ppm, was determined using EPA?s RMP Comp? model.  This circular distance to the toxic endpoint was used to evaluate the offsite impacts. \n\n4.2  Chlorine Hazard Assessment?Alternative Release Scenario\nThe alterative release scenario (ARS) depicts a more likely release scenario that could occur compared to the WRS.  For the WTP 3, USAG evaluated the offsite impacts associated with the release of chlorine gas from a 1/16-inch-diameter pinhole leak in the valve on the chlorine container, a likely scenario, for a release time of 60 minutes.  This scenario was selected during the process hazard analysis (PHA) conducted for WTP 3.  Only one ARS was evaluated for WTP 3.  The chlorine release rate was calculated using EPA?s RMP Comp? model and used to evaluate the offsite impacts.\n\n5.0  Five-year Accident History\nNo chlorine releases have occurred at USAG?s WTP 3 during the l"
