This commitment is demonstrated by resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training, emergency equipment, participation in emergency drills, and meetings with local emergency response organizations.\n\nThis commitment is also consistent with  the corporation's environmental, health and safety policy, which provides that:\na)  All facilities will be designed, operated, and managed to protect the health and safety of the employees and the public;\nb)  All employees will be educated on the applicable environmental, health and safety standards and procedures;\nc)  Sufficient human and financial resources will be allocated to sustain these goals; and  \nd)  Audits will be conducted regularly to verify compliance with this policy.\n\nThese corporate policies also emphasize the  importance of complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, so that all employees and the surrounding community will be adequately protected from potential fire, explosion and /or toxic release hazards associated with catastrophic releases.\n\nIt is Mosaic Fertilier LLC's policy to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated and hazardous substances.  If an accidental release does occur, Mosaic's trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.  Mosaic has a comprehensive program for complying with safety and environmental regulations for all regulated and other hazardous substances handled.\n\n2. Stationary Source and the Regulated Substance Handled\n\nThe Mosaic New Wales Plant, produces monoammonium phosphate (MAP), diammonium phosphate (DAP), and crop nutrients, as well as a variety of animal feed ingredients.  The raw materials used in this process include molten sulfur, phosphate rock, and anhydrous ammonia.  The sulfur is burned with air in an enclos"

In turn, the sulfuric acid is reacted with phosphate rock to produce phosphoric acid.  Phosphoric acid is then reacted with the anhydrous ammonia to produce  MAP and  DAP. \nRegulated toxic substances involved in the process include anhydrous ammonia, sulfur dioxide, and sulfur trioxide; however, anhydrous ammonia is the only PSM/RMP regulated substance that exceeds the listed threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds (lbs.).  Sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide are fully consumed as intermediates in the production process, and they are not present in quantities that exceed their applicable threshold quantities.\n\n3. General Accident Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Steps\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is regulated  as a highly hazardous chemical under OSHA's PSM Standard.  The quantity of anhydrous ammonia present at the New Wales Plant exceeds the OSHA PSM threshold for ammonia, so the New Wales Plant is subject to OSHA's PSM requriements.  The New Wales ammonia process therefore satisfies the eligibility requirements for a Program 3 Prevention Program under the RMP rule.  The New Wales plant has fully implemented OSHA's PSM standard requirements and is using this program as its RMP Prevention Program.  A brief summary of the facility's PSM program is as follows:\n\nThe PSM Program at the New Wales Plant is an active on-going process with full participation from employees at all levels and from all areas of the facility.   The intial Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for the covered process was completed in 1994 and revalidated in 1998, 2002, and 2007. The action items generated from the PHA revalidations have been completed or are currently in progress.  The ammonia storage system was upgraded to meet applicable nationally recognized codes and standards following the 1998 revalidation.  \n\nThe New Wales PSM Review committee meets once a month"

This includes writing and updating operating and maintenance procedures; training for all operators and maintenance personnel; reviewing mechanical integrity, quality assurance, and management of change programs,and contractor safety programs; and developing an audit schedule which meets the OSHA PSM standard requirements.\n\n4.  Five Year Accident History\n\nIn the past five years, the New Wales ammonia process has had no accidental releases that resulted in on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n5. The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe New Wales Plant has an emergency response program in place to address foreseeable emergency situations and incidents involving all hazardous substances on site.  The Emergency Response Plan establishes a mechanism for providing hazard and emergency preparedness information to employees, external emergency response agencies, and the community.  The New Wales Emergency Response Program contains procedures for notifying plant personnel, the public, and local emergency response agencies about an accidental release.  It has been designed to advise all plant personnel how to respond to emergency situations and what their responsibilities are during emergencies.  The New Wales Plant has defined an emergency as  a non-routine, unusual set of circumstances that call for immediate safety or environmental action.  The New Wales plant also has an Emergency Action Team on each shift that conduct training and practice drills with County emergency personnel.  These Teams are provided with appropriate personal protective and accident mitigation equipment to handle plant emergencies.\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe New Wales Plant is working to resolve in a timely manner all action items generated as a result of internal audits and PHA revali"
