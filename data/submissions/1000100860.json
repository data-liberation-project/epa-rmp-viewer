The latitude and longitude of the controlled pressure receiver is 36.607225, -119.529138. The facility is located approximately 7.5 miles east of state highway 99 in an industrial area surrounded primarily by businesses.\r\n\r\nAccording to FEMA Flood Map Service, the facility is located in \"a special flood hazard area\". The elevation of the machinery room was designed with the flood hazards in mind.\r\n\r\nSunWest Fruit Company is not located in an Alquist-Priolo Fault Zone as defined by the California Department of Conservation. In addition, a review of United States Geological Survey (USGS) fault maps revealed that there are no faults in close proximity to the site. The USGS 2018 One-Year Model revealed that SunWest Fruit Company has a 1-2% chance of experiencing \"potentially minor-damage\" due to ground shaking in 2018.\r\n\r\n1.2.3 Description of Covered Processes\r\n\r\nThe refrigerated spaces are equipped with air-cooling evaporators and accumulators as required for flooded operation.

The high pressure receivers receive high pressure liquid from the condensers and supply high pressure liquid to each zone of refrigeration. The high pressure receivers are also used to provide storage for ammonia not being used in the process at any given moment. The high pressure receivers are equipped with a main liquid feed shut-off valve (king valve) that is clearly labeled and can be used to stop the flow of ammonia throughout the system. Under normal conditions, the high pressure receivers contain high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nControlled Pressure Receiver\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the controlled pressure receiver (CPR) is to provide a safe location to add and store liquid ammonia at a constant pressure in the refrigeration system. The CPR receives liquid from the thermosyphon vessel that is supplied by the condenser. The CPR is maintained at an intermediate pressure that is less than the condensing pressure, but greater than the suction pressure. From the CPR, liquid is supplied to each zone of refrigeration. The CPR is also used to provide storage for ammonia not being used in the process at any given moment.

Each accumulator is equipped with an expansion valve which expands the high pressure liquid into a low temperature and pressure liquid as it enters the vessel. The flooded accumulators supply, by gravity, low pressure liquid to the associated evaporators. Liquid and vapor returned from the evaporators is separated inside the flooded accumulators to allow only the vapor to be returned to the main suction accumulators. Under normal conditions, the flooded accumulators contain low pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nAir-Cooling Evaporators (Flooded)\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the air-cooling evaporators is to remove heat from the air in order to maintain a predetermined space temperature. The air-cooling evaporators receive liquid from the flooded accumulators. The evaporators contain a set of continuous coils through which the low pressure liquid flows. Due to the low pressures and temperatures maintained in the evaporator, the liquid refrigerant absorbs a great deal of heat from the surrounding area and evaporates. To increase the rate of heat removed, the evaporators use an electric fan to move warm air over the coils of cold liquid ammonia. Once the liquid has evaporated to form low temperature and pressure vapor, it returns to the supplying vessel.

Once the liquid has evaporated to form low temperature and pressure vapor, it exits the evaporator and is returned to the main suction accumulators.\r\n\r\nHydrocoolers\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the hydrocoolers is to remove heat from water which is used to precool fresh fruit. The hydrocoolers receive liquid from flooded accumulators. Low pressure liquid and vapor exits the hydrocoolers and is returned to the supplying vessel. Under normal conditions, the hydrocoolers contain low pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nMain Suction Accumulators\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the main suction accumulators is to prevent liquid from entering the compressors. The main suction accumulators receive vapor from the flooded accumulators and separate any residual liquid from the vapor to allow only the vapor to be piped to the suction of each compressor. Liquid in the main suction accumulators drains by gravity into the liquid transfer vessels. The main suction accumulators are equipped with a high level float switch that is wired to shut down the compressors in the event of a high level situation. This prevents liquid ammonia from entering the compressors.

Under normal conditions the liquid transfer vessels can contain either high or low pressure liquid and vapor.\r\n\r\nCompressors\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the compressors is to raise the temperature and pressure of the low pressure gas in order to reject the heat absorbed in the evaporator to the atmosphere. The compressors receive low pressure vapor from the main suction accumulators and discharge high pressure vapor to the evaporative condensers. The compressors are equipped with high discharge pressure cutouts to shut the equipment off if the pressure exceeds the setpoint. Under normal conditions, the compressors contain both high and low pressure vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nEvaporative Condensers\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the evaporative condensers is to reject the heat absorbed in the evaporators and hydrocoolers to the atmosphere. The evaporative condensers receive high pressure, superheated vapor from the compressors and supply high pressure liquid to the high pressure receivers or thermosyphon vessel. The condensers use air and water to cool the warm ammonia as it passes through a series of tubes within the condenser. As the cooling medium of air and water draws the heat from the vapor, the refrigerant condenses into a liquid and flows to the high pressure receiver/thermosyphon vessel. Under normal conditions, the evaporative condensers contain high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nThermosyphon Vessel\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the thermosyphon vessel is to provide a supply of liquid ammonia necessary to cool the oil in the compressors.

Either a Calibration Technologies GG-NH3 or a Honeywell EC-F9-NH3 provide low concentration detection and alert personnel if the ammonia concentration exceeds 25 ppm via the accompanying audible/visual alarms. An additional warning is triggered at 50 ppm and the equipment is shut off at 80 ppm.
