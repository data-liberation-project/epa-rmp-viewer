Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Montrose Potato Growers Cooperative Association in Montrose are strongly committed to\nemployee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our\ncomprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation,\noperating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our\nfacility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated\nsubstances.  If such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to\ncontrol and mitigate the effects of the release.  We also coordinate our response efforts with the\nMontrose Fire Department, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\nammonia stored in a 30,000 -gallon tank  at our facility in Montrose (Figure 1).  The maximum\namount stored is 25500 gallons (131223 pounds) at the maximum fill capacity of 85 %.\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\nWe utilized RMP PRO for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite\nconsequence analysis for our facility.  The following details these scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the          \nanhydrous ammonia storage tank (131223 pounds) in gaseous form over a 10-minute period.  At\nClass F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, and a urban topography, the maximum distance\nto a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L is 5.2 miles (Figure 2).  The estimated population within a 5"

The\nscenario involves the release of 7616.42  pounds of ammonia in a gaseous form over a period of 30\nminutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14\nmg/L of ammonia is 0.31 mile (Figure 3).  The estimated population within a 0.31-mile radius of the\nfacility is 2,000.\n\n  4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention\nrequirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements\nof the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\nMontrose Potato Growers maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the\nchemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes\n(Appendix D).\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are\nidentified and controlled effectively.  Any findings from the hazard analysis are addressed in a\ntimely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nMontrose Potato Growers maintains written operating procedures to ensure that activities within our\ncovered processes are conducted safely.  These procedures address various modes of operation; the\ninformation is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes\n(Appendix B).\n\nTraining\nMontrose Potato Growers has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees\nwho are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these\nprocesses.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nMontrose Potato Growers conducts documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure\nproper operation.  Maintenance checks are conducted by qualified personnel with previous trai"

Examples of process equipment that would receive maintenance checks\ninclude:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency\nshutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance\nchecks are corrected in a safe and timely manner (Appendix C).\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Montrose Potato Growers to manage changes in process\nchemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or\nother employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly\nnotified of the modification and offered training to deal with it.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nMontrose Potato Growers routinely conducts pre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and\nmodifications in established processes.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction,\nequipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing\nequipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nMontrose Potato Growers conducts compliance audits on a regular basis to determine whether the\nplan's provisions, set out under the 40 CFR part 68, are being implemented.  Any non-compliance\nissue discovered during the audit is promptly corrected.\n\nEmployee Participation\nMontrose Potato Growers truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is\na team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning\naccident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access\nto all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP, particularly\ninformation resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\n  5. Five-year Accident History\nMontrose Potato Growers has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last\n5 years.
