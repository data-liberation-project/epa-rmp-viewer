The cylinders supply chlorine gas via the vacuum feeders and 1/4 inch plastic tubing to an air stripper tower located inside the B4 well house. A MSA chlorine gas detection system and alarm are installed in the chlorine cylinder enclosure and wired directly to the Raytheon Command Center. Only one cylinder is active (manually opened) at any time, and a single cylinder supply lasts approximately 3 to 4 months. Depleted cylinders are normally replaced when the second cylinder reaches 50% capacity or less. The fiberglass enclosure housing the cylinders is secured behind a pad locked chain link fence enclosure, and access is restricted to trained and authorized personnel.\n    In the event of a detected leak, the 24 hour Command Center is notified electronically and emergency response procedures are initiated. Should a leak be detected by other methods (visual, odor, etc.), employees are trained to call the Command Center at extension 4444.\nb) Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\n    The gaseous chlorine disinfection system consists of two (2) 150 lb. chlorine cylinders mounted vertically in an outdoor fiberglass enclosure adjacent to the B4 well house, and approximately 45 feet of ??A? inch polyethylene tubing supplying chlorine gas to an air stripper.\nc) General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n    Raytheon reviews all materials and processes prior to implementation and prior to any significant change. Current release prevention methods and controls are implemented where required and available. The chlorine cylinders are equipped with manual shutoff valves and Cap"
