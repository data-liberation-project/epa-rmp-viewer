Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nRecommended corrective actions to mitigate the potential for an accidental ammonia release are proposed on the tables located in RMP Binder Chapter 0.0. The table items result from recommendations made during the Process Hazard Analysis, a Code Compliance Review, Seismic Review, and a Safety Inspection performed by a qualified person. Some recommendation items in the recommendation table originate from multiple codes but are listed only once. Specific facility areas and systems categorize recommendations resulting from the Safety Inspection; some of which may repeat general Process Hazard Analysis and Code Compliance Review items. \n\nBased on the severity of the hazards identified, implementation deadlines are also recommended. All refrigeration equipment is well maintained and operated in a safe manner by trained personnel. Operating, maintenance, training, and safety procedures will be formalized with improved written documentation."

All cold rooms are monitored by an alarm and detection system for unsafe ammonia concentration levels. Monitoring is done 24-hours per day. All relief valves except the surge drums of two vacuum tubes are tied into a diffusion tank to prevent a release to atmosphere in a high pressure situation.\n\n4. Five-Year Accident History\n\nAccording to Taylor Farms Retail personnel, there has been no releases of anhydrous ammonia in the last 5 years that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\nTaylor Farms Retail facility is a Non-Responding facility. Facility only responds to situations that are within their capabilities. These may include, emergency shutdown, equipment isolation and pumping down the system. No emergency response actions or site clean-up that are beyond the capabilities of the refrigeration personnel will be performed. In case of an emergency, incident will be reported immediately to the RMP Program Coordinator. The RMP Program Coordinator is responsible for assisting county emergency responders upon arrival on site. This may include contacting emergency response agencies, schools, daycare centers, and acute care facilities that may be affected by the release. The RMP Program Coordinator will also be responsible for evacuation of employees if necessary and for coordination with community emergency responders if off-site evacuation"

Fixed and portable refrigeration equipment locations can be found on the plans located on sheets R1.0, R2.0 and R2.1 in the RMP Binder. International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) Ammonia Refrigeration Safety Inspection Checklists, located in Appendix 12 of the RMP Binder, describe equipment details.\n\nThe refrigeration system at this facility is a single-stage vapor compression cycle. In general, the process chemistry for the refrigeration system is provided in Chapter 8 of the RMP Binder.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas in its natural state and is extremely irritating to mucous membranes and lung tissue. The gas is pungent and may be suffocating as shortness of breath and labored breathing can develop if inhaled. Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and/ or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions. Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain and serious skin burn. See Chapter 8 Appendix 8.4 for Safety Data Sheets (SDS) for anhydrous ammonia.\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nTaylor Farms Retail, Inc. maintains a release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases. The program includes regular inspections, monitoring equipment and logging conditions, scheduled maintenance, and operator training.

There are three refrigeration trailers located on-site. The vacuum tube consists of a chamber in which the produce is cooled and a cooling coil where low -pressure ammonia flows and evaporates. There are two vacuum tubes on-site; one full-car (24 Pallet) and one half-car (12 Pallet) during the winter season, November through April. All portable equipment is owned by Western Precooling Systems (WPS). WPS is responsible for setting-up, charging ammonia, maintaining, unloading ammonia, and removing the systems from the site each season. \nThe main system compressors and condenser are supplied by a high-side refrigeration trailer during the season. The facility pumps down all the ammonia in the system to nurse tanks during the off season. All the portable systems are removed during the off-season. The facility does not have refrigeration machinery room and all the refrigeration equipment except cold room fan coils are located outdoors. Each vacuum tube unit operate independently with a dedicated refrigeration trailer. None of the vacuum tube units or their associated refrigeration trailer are connected to the main system. \n\nAll compressors on the trailers have safety switches that would shut down the compressors upon detection of unsafe operating conditions. The low-pressure receiver is equipped with a high-level float switch that will turn off the compressors in case the liquid level rises too high.

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nTaylor Farms Retail, Inc. conducts inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment prior to startup and during operations. These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases. On-site personnel and certified refrigeration contractors review the equipment as required.\nOn-site personnel provide initial emergency response. On-site personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide first response. First response may include emergency equipment shutdown, system isolation, or controlled operation such as pump down to prevent or reduce an off-site release. No emergency operations will be performed that are beyond the capabilities of the operators or other on-site personnel. Local fire and police departments with mutual aid response will provide emergency response for a major release event. The refrigeration contractors would also be on-call to provide emergency response.\nEmergency response training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required to for new employees. Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nTaylor Farms Retail uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in their operations at their facility. See Chapter 8 Appendix 8.1 of the RMP binder for the drawings showing the facility location map and site plan.\n\nThe refrigeration system is used for product precooling (vacuum cooling) and cold storage. Refrigeration machinery is composed of both fixed and portable equipment. Fixed system equipment includes cold room evaporators (fan coils), pressure vessels (low-pressure receiver, controlled high-pressure receiver, and oil pot), ammonia pumps, and a diffusion tank. Portable equipment includes refrigeration trailers and vacuum tu"
