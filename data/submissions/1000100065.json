This decreases the surface area of the ammonia solution available for evaporation, in result slowing down the release rate of ammonia from the ammonia solution. Emergency response plans have been coordinated with off-site responders. In the event of a hazard beyond the capability of EKPC to control, employees and visitors will evacuate the facility and notify these responders according to the facility emergency action plan.\r\n\r\nTwo accidental release scenarios were modeled as part of the EKPC risk management program. The worst \u00ad case scenario assumed that the entire contents of an ammonia tank considering the administrative control on capacity were released within a ten-minute period. This type of release is assumed to occur through catastrophic failure of the container due to corrosion, impact, or construction defects.  The alternative scenario assumed the failure of a truck unloading hose while offloading to the storage tank. The release has a duration of five minutes based on operator and/or truck driver response time. The tank has a check valve to prevent backflow so the release occurs up to the truck's excess flow valve closure rate of 144 gpm. Both public and environmental receptors were determined for each release scenario.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia process has been in operation since 2001 and no accidental releases have occurred.  In addition, no accidental releases have occurred to date of any hazardous material stored at the EKPC Spurlock Station facility."

The system will reduce thermal NOx from boiler combustion emissions through the use of anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia will be stored on site in amounts larger than the threshold quantity for 40 CFR Part 68 and is covered by these risk management regulations.  The process will be regulated as a program 3 process under 40 CFR Part 68.\r\n\r\nThe process equipment and procedures have been designed to maintain the safe handling and use of anhydrous ammonia.  Equipment is designed and constructed in accordance with applicable standards.   The ammonia pressure, temperature, and level will be monitored locally and remotely.  Alarms exist for high and low pressures and levels.  Each tank is equipped with pressure relief valves and high-level overflow protection.  Ammonia sensors are positioned so that a computer system can continuously monitor ammonia levels in the ammonia storage area and at the facility perimeter.  The computer system will activate visual and audible alarms at particular detection concentrations. Procedures for safe operation include employee training, periodic analyses of process hazards, reviews of proposed process changes, equipment inspection and maintenance procedures, contractor reviews, and the investigation of releases that do occur in order to prevent reoccurrence. \r\n\r\nEmergency equipment provisions include an emergency shutdown (ESD) system and permanently mounted water cannons with fog nozzles. The ESD can be activated from the control room to stop process operations in a fail-safe mode. The water cannons are designed to remove released ammonia fumes from the air and can cover the entire ammonia storage area. A containment po"
