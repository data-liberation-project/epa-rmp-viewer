FACILITY POLICY: The owners, management and employees of Maynard Co-Op (the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2. FACILITY INFORMATION: The primary activity at the ffacility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients. The maximum quantity stored would be 127,500 pounds.\n\n3. WORST CASE AND ALTERNATE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS:\n\nA. The Worst Case Scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over a period of 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 127,500 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, ppm) is 2.4 miles.\n\nB. The Alternate Case Scenario, based on the five year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a 3-inch transfer hose followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic or manual shut-off intervenes and stops the flow of ammonia. The maximum quantity released would be 26,640 pounds. The distance to the endpoint (200 ppm) is 1.2 miles.\n\n4. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM: The facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of the standard of the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR Part 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". In addition, Standard K-61.1, \""

      "SummaryText": "Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" has been adopted by reference into Iowa Administrative Code (IAC) Part 21-Chapter 43-Rule 43.6(200). \n\n5. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY: There have been no accidental releases of anydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility: nor, to the best of our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM: The facility has: a) a written Action Plan in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR Part 1910.38 and b) provide state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY: Safety improvement is an ongoing process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding the storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
