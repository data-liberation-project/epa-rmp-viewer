      "SummaryText": "Hydrofluoric Acid is used to etch glass and is an ingredient in cleaning compounds among other uses.  Cyclohexylamine is used in water treatment, as a rubber accelerator, and intermediate in organic synthesis.  The same properties that make these chemicals valuable as a commodity also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling them to reduce the threat to nearby members of our community as well as to the employees of the company.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and Local regulations. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE & EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nBrenntag Southwest owns emergency equipment that aids in the ability to stop leaks from containers of these products, and maintains employees who are trained in the use of this equipment.
