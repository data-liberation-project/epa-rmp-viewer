The TSDF may be subject to these provisions because it is possible that threshold quantities of several specific regulated toxic and/or flammable liquids may be present in greater than threshold quantities.  Under most circumstances Spring Grove Resource Recovery's records indicate that regulated substances are present in concentrations below 1% and/or in less than the threshold quantities specified in the ARP regulation.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) which is prepared under the EPA's predictive filing provisions has been developed in accordance with the requirements specified under 40 CFR Part 68, Subpart G.  The RMP certifies that Spring Grove Resource Recovery, Inc. has instituted a Risk Management Program that is in compliance with U.S. EPA ARP requirements. \n\nThe RMP includes an Executive Summary and Data Elements following the format published by U.S. EPA.  This document identifies the applicable corporate policies and risk management systems, including comprehensive accident prevention and emergency response programs.  In addition, this RMP identifies a set of worst case and alternative release scenarios, the potential off-site consequences of those releases, and the facility's five year accidental release history.

SGRRI has always placed the highest priority on the health and safety of its employees and members of the community in which it operates.\n\nSGRRI may be subject to the provisions of the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Requirements because several of the regulated toxic and flammable liquids may be present in quantities which exceed the regulatory thresholds for these substances.

In order to standardize and simplify to a practical level the many factors that can potentially occur in an accidental release situation, some of these assumptions may not take into account the available preventive measures or mitigation methods that would diminish or even eliminate the implied risks that are suggested by \"worst-case\" analyses.  For that reason, both the results for the standardized \"worst case\" defined by the EPA methods and an alternative case, which is believed by Spring Grove Resource Recovery to more realistically represent situations that may possibly occur within the lifetime of the facility, are presented and described.  The actual incident history for this facility over the last five years has been reviewed.  No accident has resulted in reportable on-site injury, off-site injury, emergency response, or damage to property or the environment\n\n3.1    Worst-Case Release for Toxic Substances.\n\nAs defined by 40 CFR Part 68, a worst-case release for a toxic liquid is an instantaneous spill of the entire tank contents, taking into account passive mitigation such as a dike and administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity.  Since Spring Grove Resource Recovery does not process the following six chemicals: isopropyl chloroformate, methyltrichlorosilane, nitric acid, phosphorous oxychloride, phosphorous trichloride, and trimethylchlorosilane, a worst case tank release was not calculated for those substances.  The worst-case release scenario for the Spring Grove Resource Recovery facility corresponds to a release from the largest storage tank on-site assumed to be filled with 15,000 gallons "

Such a scenario is extremely unlikely because it would require that the contents of 273 55-gallon drums each containing the maximum concentration would be pumped into an otherwise empty tank. \n\nEPA requires that worst-case analyses be conducted using stability class F and 1.5 m/sec wind speed. Meteorologists have defined six \"atmospheric stability classes,\" A through F, each representing a decreasing degree of turbulence in the atmosphere.  The most turbulent condition is stability A, which is associated with light winds and very strong solar heating.  Stabilities B and C are characterized by progressively weaker solar heating and stronger winds.  Neutral or D stability occurs when winds are strong or when the sky is overcast.  At night the earth's surface cools, causing the lower atmosphere to stabilize and become less turbulent.  Stability E (moderately stable) corresponds to partly cloudy conditions with moderate winds.  Stability class F (very stable) represents a very low level of turbulence due to overnight radiational cooling and weak winds.\n\nTo describe the aerodynamic surface roughness for modeling purposes, EPA has established surface roughness categories based on land-use type. 'Urban' surface roughness indicates areas where there are many obstacles, such as industrial buildings, compact residential areas and trees.  'Rural' indicates that there are few buildings and that the terrain is generally flat and unobstructed by trees.  The Spring Grove Resource Recovery facility and vicinity are urban in nature.\n\nThe toxic endpoint selected by EPA for toxic substances is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline, Level 2 (ERPG-2), which was developed by the American Industrial Hygiene Association.  An ERPG-2 is \"the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to 1 hr without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health e"

RMP*COMP implements the consequence analysis calculations set forth in the EPA's Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance (OCAG). The resulting emergency response planning zone is defined by a circle with a radius equal to 6.8 miles.  \n\nThe worst-case planning zone encompasses a resident population of approximately 574,231, based on the 1990 Federal Census, and estimated by applying EPA's LANDVIEW III program.  The potential worst-case planning zone includes schools, public recreation areas and commercial areas.  \n\n3.2    Alternative Release for Toxic Substances.\n\nThe alternative release examined for all of the 18 regulated chemicals corresponds to an accident occurring during on-site handling of a 55 gallon drum, where the drum is accidentally punctured by a fork truck. The unconfined spill was modeled with RMP*Comp to estimate endpoint distances for the 18 regulated substances that may at some time be present at the site.  The alternative scenario was simulated using meteorological conditions that are typical of the Cincinnati, Ohio area. In RMP*Comp, EPA uses meteorological conditions for alternative releases of D stability and a wind speed of 3 m/sec.  Stability Class D represents conditions of neutral stability, or moderate atmospheric turbulence.  Based on climatological data from the Greater Cincinnati airport, the average wind speed is about 4 m/sec, providing greater dilution than assumed in RMP*Comp.\n\nAlternative dispersion modeling to determine the distance to toxic endpoint was conducted using the U.S. EPA's RMP*COMP (Version 1.06) software.  As discussed in Section 3.1, the modeling was performed using the conservative assumption of urban surface roughness. The resulting planning zone is defined by a circle ranging from 0.1"

No environmental receptors would be affected.\n\n3.3    Worst Case Release for Flammable Substances\n\nThe worst case for flammable substance is defined as a vapor cloud explosion involving the largest  amount of a regulated substance in a single vessel.  The endpoint is a 1 psi overpressure. The largest vessel containing a regulated flammable substance at the Spring Grove Resource Recovery facility is a 55 gallon drum.  Applying RMP*Comp results in an estimated worst-case endpoint distance of 0.05 miles for ethyl ether (90%). This zone extends off-site, affecting adjacent commercial areas, but does not impact residential areas.\n\n3.4    Alternative Flammable Release\n\nThe potential for a vapor cloud explosion resulting from an outdoor release of a flammable liquid is extremely unlikely. The alternative release is the spill of a 55 gallon drum resulting in a pool fire.  In this instance, the endpoint established by the ARP regulation is the radiant heat of 5 \nkW/m2  for 40 seconds.  Applying RMP*Comp results in an endpoint distance of 0.01 mi.  Thus, the impact of an alternative release does not extend beyond the facility fenceline.\n\n\n4.0   ACCIDENT PREVENTION\n\nSpring Grove Resource Recovery has procedures in place to prevent and mitigate potential releases of toxic and flammable substances.
