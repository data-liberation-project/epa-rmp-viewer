As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Vie-Del Company Fresno has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1 Vie-Del Company Fresno, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Vie-Del Company Fresno has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\n\n\nProcess Name         | Process Chemical         | Process Quantity(lbs.)\n\nNorth System           Anhydrous Ammonia          20,000\n\n\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses and physical property damage.\n\n\n\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have: \n\n\n\nPrepared a unified program based on the PSM plan to meet CalARP and RMP obligations as well\n\n\n\n"

Low temperature liquid circulates by thermal convection through the heat exchanger.  Low pressure and temperature gas collects in the accumulator (or shell of the heat exchanger), and passes through a pressure regulator into a suction line. The suction line returns the vapor to the main suction accumulator (North System only) where residual liquid can be separated from the vapor. From there the low pressure vapor is piped to the compressors which elevate the temper"

During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nVie-Del Company Fresno has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration and sulfur dioxide processes. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n\n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Vie-Del Company Fresno facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. The ammonia process contain a total charge of approximately 20,000 lbs. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity ins"

Nevertheless, Vie-Del Company Fresno continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\n\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program.

In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Vie-Del Company Fresno's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\n\n\nVie-Del Company Fresno has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be acces"
