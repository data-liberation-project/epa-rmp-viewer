Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Dakota Plains Cooperative in Litchville, North Dakota are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement the appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. We also coordinate our response efforts with the Valley City, ND, Fire Department, which provides additional emergency response information and expertise.\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled Our facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous ammonia stored in a 30,000-gallon tank, eight 1,450-gallon nurse tanks, and thirty-two 1,000-gallon nurse tanks at our facility in Litchville, North Dakota (Figure 1).  The maximum amount stored is 62,560 gallons (321,933.8 pounds) at 85% standard maximum storage capacity including the capacity of the on-site nurse tanks.   The largest single storage vessel at our facility contains 131,223 pounds at 85% standard maximum storage capacity.\n\n  3.
