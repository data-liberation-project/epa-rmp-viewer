      "SummaryText": "d by a diked secondary containment system. \nBF3 complexes are manufactured on the Delaware side of the plant.  BF3 complexes are used to make adhesives, pharmaceuticals, synthetic lubricants, and flavors/fragrances.  Boron trifluoride is used as a raw material to make BF3 complexes and as mentioned above (BF3 process) is regulated by the RMP rule.  One of the complexes, BF3 etherate, is a clear, colorless, flammable and corrosive liquid with a sharp pungent odor.  BF3 etherate is packaged and shipped in pails, drums, and tank trucks.  One of the raw materials used to produce BF3 etherate is ethyl ether.  Ethyl ether is regulated by the RMP rule.  It is a flammable, liquid and is stored on site in a bulk tank under its own vapor pressure.  The BF3 complexes process area is equipped with a water spray system and remote operated valves designed for emergency use.\n\nFluosulfonic acid (FSA) is manufactured on the Pennsylvania side of the plant.  It will be stored as a feedstock for the existing boron trifluoride process.  Fluosulfonic acid is produced using the chemicals anhydrous hydrofluoric acid (HF) and sulfur trioxide (SO3), both, regulated by the RMP rule.  Anhydrous HF is a clear, colorless fuming liquid with an extremely acrid odor. SO3 is a clear, colorless, and corrosive oily liquid that will rapidly react with water to form sulfuric acid.  HF and SO3 are stored onsite in separate bulk tanks, supported by mitigation system and secondary containment.\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program at Honeywell Delaware consists of 12 elements.  Each of these elements is described below.  Also described within each of these elements are associated chemical-specific prevention steps, where applicable.\n\n3a.
