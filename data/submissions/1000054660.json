The resources \n\ninvested in the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances demonstrate this commitment.  The City of Liberty Wastewater Treatment Plant implements reasonable controls, such as training of personnel and the safe design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to make every effort to prevent the release of hazardous substances but in the event of a release, our trained personnel and local emergency response agencies will respond to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injuries to the public or the environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.0 Description of the City of Liberty Wastewater Treatment Plant and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe City of Liberty Wastewater Treatment Plant is located in the city limits of Liberty, Texas, a city with a population of over 7,000 residents.  The facility is capable of treating 2.5 million gallons of wastewater per day.  The City of Liberty Wastewater Treatment Plant handles one substance regulated by the Risk Management Plan Rule (RMP Rule) in quantities above the Threshold Quantity.  This substance is:\n\n\n\n* Chlorine - stored in 1 ton cylinders and used for disinfection of the water prior to release to the receiving stream.\n\n* Sulfur Dioxide - stored in 1 ton cylinders and used for chlorine residual removal of the water prior to release to the receiving stream.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.0 Hazard Assessment\n\n \n\nThe RMP Rule requires The City of Liberty Wastewater Treatment Plant to perform a Hazard Assessment of the regulated substances stored and used in the covered processes at the facility.  This Hazard Assessment includes an offsite consequence analysis for the follo"
