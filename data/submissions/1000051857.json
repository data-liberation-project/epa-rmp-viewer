The purpose of this Emergency Response Plan is to provide clear, concise directions during an emergency.  Its function is to prevent physical harm to staff, public, environment, or facilities.  The plan is a key to preparedness and was developed using EPA, DEP, County, and City guidelines.  It includes a series of action plans for specific situations and list emergency supplies, emergency organizations, and preparedness training.  \r\n\r\nSpecific emergency scenarios covered by the plan include Chlorine or Sulfur Dioxide Leaks, Civil Disorder, Cold Weather, Fire, Hurricanes, Lightning/Electrical Storms, Threats, Threat Identification Sheet, Tornadoes and Windstorms.\r\n\r\nAll responses to non-weather emergency scenarios begin with notification of the appropriate fire or police resources through 911.  These scenarios detail information to convey to first responders to protect the welfare of both plant staff and provide notification to nearby communities.  Additionally, ongoing training of plant staff is provided by local fire departments.  This facilitates cooperation between plant staff and first responders as well as providing emergency response training to plant staff.\r\n\r\nLeak detection equipment and online alarms also provide protection from releases of the regulated processes. The most recent review was conducted on 9-15-2015.\r\n\r\n8.  Planned changes to improve safety \r\n\r\nNo changes to the regulated processes are planned at this time."

      "SummaryText": "1.  Introduction:\r\n\r\nThe City of Milton Wastewater Treatment Plant, located in Milton, Florida, stores and uses two regulated toxic chemicals in processes as defined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) chemical accident prevention standard, commonly referred to as the USEPA Risk Management Program (RMP).  According to the RMP standard, facilities that use or store a covered substance at or above the threshold quantity are required to comply with the requirements of the rule. \r\n\r\nChlorine is utilized at the Milton WWTP for the disinfection of treated wastewater.  Typically, two full and one partial one-ton cylinders are stored for this purpose.  The City also stores up to six full and empty 150 pound cylinders for use as disinfectant in their potable water system.  The maximum possible stockpile of chlorine, based on the conservative assumption that all vessels are full, would be 6,900lbs.  The EPA RMP threshold quantity for chlorine is 2,500lbs, which is exceeded by the maximum storage capacity of the Milton WWTP.\r\n\r\nSulfur dioxide is used to dechlorinate treated wastewater prior to discharge to surface waters.  Typically, two full and one partial one-ton cylinders are stored for this purpose.  The maximum possible stockpile of sulfur dioxide, based on the conservative assumption that all vessels are full, would be 6,000lbs.  The EPA RMP threshold quantity for sulfur dioxide is 2,500lbs, which is exceeded by the maximum storage capacity of the Milton WWTP.\r\n\r\n2.  Overview of accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the Milton WWTP: \r\n\r\nAccidental releases are prevented by applying standard procedures for operations and maintenance of regulated processes, regular inspections of process equipment, leak detection equipment, and system design features where line breaks result in system shut down, and power outages are avoided by implementation of a backup generator system.  \r\n\r\nThe facility has an Emergency Response Plan with deta"

Description of the Milton WWTP's overall approach to chemical safety:\r\n\r\nThe general approach to chemical safety at the Milton WWTP is by the application of standard procedures for operations and maintenance of regulated processes, regular inspections of process equipment, leak detection equipment, and system design features where line breaks result in system shut down, and power outages are avoided by implementation of a backup generator system.  \r\n\r\nWWTP staff is committed to the safety of their chemical process, and the plant in general, and all facets of this approach undergo regular review by staff and operators. The most recent review was conducted 9-16-15.\r\n\r\n4.  Provide a description of your facility, processes, products, and regulated substances: \r\n\r\nThe City of Milton Wastewater Treatment Plant was constructed to provide centralized treatment of wastewater that is collected from the Milton wastewater service area.  Treated wastewater is first chlorinated for disinfection, and then dechlorinated (by the addition of sulfur dioxide) to make benign the treated wastewate"

The provisions of the standard are set forth in Chapter 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations in Part 68 (40 CFR 68).  According to the RMP standard, facilities that use or store a covered substance at or above the threshold quantity are required to comply with the requirements of the rule. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the RMP standard, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) is intended to prevent the release of hazardous chemicals that could result in on-site consequences involving employees.  The Florida Division of Safety adopted the PSM standard as 38I-20 of the Florida Administrative Code (FAC), which includes the public sector such as municipally owned water and wastewater treatment facilities.\r\nSince the Facility stores chlorine and sulfur dioxide in quantities that exceed the threshold quantities for both the RMP and PSM standards, the Facility is subject to the requirements of the RMP and PSM standards for both chemical stockpiles.\r\n\r\nFlorida is a Federal OSHA State as the OSHA PSM has been adopted into Florida rules.  Since Florida does not have a delegated OSHA program, regulated processes involving regulated toxic substances, such as the use of chlorine and sulfur dioxide, are subject to the Program 3 conditions of the RMP.\r\n\r\nIn order to fulfill the Program 3 requirements of the RMP, a Prevention Program must be prepared in accordance with 40 CFR 68, Subpart D, and therefore must"
