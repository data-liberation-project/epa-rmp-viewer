It was sent prepaid and delivered via FedEx tracking number 8457 1501 7053, along with a EPA RMP Certification Statement signed by the City of Waseca, MN Utilities Director. Separate correspondance was submitted to both the local fire department and Emergency Management Coordinator. The previous RMP update was submitted in July 2014 updated for up to 6,000 lbs of chlorine on-site.        \n\n\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies - We at the City of Waseca Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with emergency responders to provide highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled - Our facility's primary activities encompass wastewater treatment. Disinfection of secondary effluent wastewater via chemical means is of utmost importance in the treatment process. To assist in the disinfection process, we have the following regulated substance present at our facility.\n\n\n\nSubstance:                 Chlorine\n\nMaximum Inventory:             6,000 pounds\n\nExceeds 40 CFR Part 68 Threshold:     Yes\n\n\n\nThe quantity of sulfur dioxide store"

Due to the nature of sulfur dioxide, the City of Waseca WWTP applies its safety procedures to the sulfur dioxide process as well as the chlorine process.\n\n\n\nSubstance:                 Sulfur Dioxide \n\nMaximum Inventory:             less than 5,000 pounds \n\nExceeds 40 CFR Part 68 Threshold:     No\n\n\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario - To perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used material provided by the EPA in the RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants. The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for chlorine involves a catastrophic release from a one-ton cylinder used in the disinfection process. The scenario involves the release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes. Under worst case weather conditions, namely Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 3.0 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.\n\n\n\nOne alternative release scenario has been submitted for chlorine as well. This alternative release scenario involves a release from a transfer hose failure. The scenario involves the release of 100 pounds of chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes. Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L is 0.1 miles, assuming the transfer hose failure occurs indoors.  \n\n\n\n4.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps - Our facility has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under both 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA and the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.   The following sections briefly describe the elements of our prevention pro"

The methodology used in the past to carry out these analyses has been both \"what-if' questions and a detailed checklist. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of every five years, or more frequently if necessary. Any findings related to each analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures - For the purposes of safely conducting activities related to the covered process, the facility maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation (e.g., initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround). The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the process.\n\n\n\nTraining - The facility has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees that are operating the process are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with the process. New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently. Much of our work on or around the covered process involves a minimum of two employees. Refresher training is provided annually and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity - The facility carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment (e.g., storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, alarms, contr"

Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change - Written procedures are in place at the facility to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews - Pre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as\n\na regular practice at the facility. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.  At the WWTP, a thorough pre-start up review is conducted each spring prior to the use of chlorine in the system.  \n\n\n\nCompliance Audits - The facility conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. These audits are carried out at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation - The facility promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of five years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation - The facility truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a "
