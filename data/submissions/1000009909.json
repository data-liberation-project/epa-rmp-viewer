      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR NATCHEZ WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT\n\nI.  Introduction\n\nThe Natchez Wastewater Treatment plant treats wastewater generated by the inhabitants and businesses located in the city of Natchez, MS.  The city of Natchez has a population of 19,460 people and a number of businesses, schools, industrial facilities, and recreational areas.\n\nII.  Regulated Substance and Covered Process\n\nIn order to comply with Federal and State regulations concerning water treatment, chlorine and sulfur dioxide are used for the disinfection of wastewater.  There is up to 4,000 lbs. of chlorine and 4,000 lbs. of sulfur dioxide in process at any given time, therefore, the Natchez Wastewater Treatment Plant falls into Level II of the EPA's Risk Management Program Regulations.\n\nIII.  Emergency Response and Policies\n\nThe Natchez Wastewater Treatment Plant is committed to reliably treating wastewater that conforms to all local, state, and federal water quality standards for the inhabitants of Natchez, MS with public safety as a top priority.
