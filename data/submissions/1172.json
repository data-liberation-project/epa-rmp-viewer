In addition our policy is to adhere to all federal, state, and local laws.  The goal of the Farmers Coop Oil Company is to provide for the safety of their employees, their customers and the general public.  In order to fulfill this goal Farmers Coop Oil Company has hired a company named Regulatory Consultants, Inc. (RCI) to maintain and administer comprehensive safety programs and procedures.  RCI safety services supervisors audit and monitor facility compliance with safety standards of the company.  All locations are required to conduct their own internal audit utilizing checklist survey forms that are reveiwed regularly and updated as necessary to ensure all applicable federal, state and local regulations are covered.\n\nEach location has a site safety coordinator as a leader of our RMP\"s.  These coordinators are given training to monitor the day to day safe work activities, maintain the required reulatory recordkeeping, conduct regular safety meetings, conduct employee training and act as the location's contact with RCI.  The site safety coordinators are also the location emergency contact.\n\nA description of our facility and the regulated substances handled.\n\nThis facility is a wholesale farm supply distribution center as such we store and distribute a wide variety of pesticides and fertilizers including Anhydrous Ammonia.  Anhydrous Ammonia is received by truck, is handled and stored on-site and is a regulated substance by the EPA requiring us to comply with the Risk Management Program.  We sell anhydrous ammonia to grower customers in either 1,000 gallon or 1,500 gallon nurse tanks.  The customer applies the ammonia into the soil as a source of nitrogen fertilizer for growing agricultural crops.  This facility maintains approximately 28 1,000 gallon nurse tanks an"

Anhydrous ammonia is stored in 3 stationary storage tanks, (1 @ 30,000 and 2 @ 12,000 gallons), on site.  252,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia is the maximum storage capacity of stationary storage tanks.  Therefore, the total facility anhydrous ammonia storage capacity for our facility is 607,600 pounds.  The largest single storage vessel at our facility contains 140,000 pounds.\n\nThe worst case scenario.\n\nOur worst case scenario is the loss of the total contents of the 30,000 gallon storage tank, when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of full capacity), release as a gas over ten minutes, resulting in total vaporization.  The maximum quantity released would be 140,000 pounds.  According to DEGADIS modeling, this release (distance to point of dispersion to 200PPM) would have an off-site impact.  It should be noted that The Wanamingo Soil Center has never had a release of an entire stationary storage tank.\n\nAlternative release scenario.\n\nTHE MOST COMMON ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO FROM OUR FACILITY WOULD NOT REACH AN END-POINT OFF-SITE.  The alternative release scenario modeled for the purpose of this plan is a 2 minute release from a stationary storage tank representing a valve and hose failure requiring a manual shut down.  The release scenario (distance to point of dispersion to 200PPM) would have off-site impact.  It should be noted that The Wanamingo Soil Center has not had a release of this type from this facility.\n\nThe general accidental  prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n\nThe ammonia system is designed, installed and is maintained in accordance with ASTM standards and ASME codes.
