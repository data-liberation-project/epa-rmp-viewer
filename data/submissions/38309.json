A combination of accidental release prevention programs, emergency response planning programs and coordination with knowledgeable employees to perform process hazard analyses (PHAs) and other applicable plans are employed to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented to meet the Risk Management Program (RMP) requirements found in 40 CFR 68.\n\nChlorine is the only substance on-site at or above the threshold quantity for an RMP regulated substance.  The Chlorine System is also an OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) covered process.  The maximum on-site quantity of chlorine (180,000 lbs) exceeds the EPA\u00bfs RMP threshold quantity of 2500 lbs and requires a worst-case release scenario analysis.  A  Program 3 Prevention Program has been developed and is based on the PSM program defined in 29 CFR 1910.119. \n\nManagement - 40 CFR 68.15\nThe Fernandina Beach mill is a Program 3 RMP facility. Therefore, a management system has been designed to implement the elements of the RMP program as required by 40 CFR 68.15.  Qualified personnel or their designee(s) have been tasked with the responsibility to develop, implement, and integrate elements of this program.\n\nReview and Update \u00bf 40 CFR 68.36\nThe Fernandina Beach mill reviews and updates the plan every five (5) years or as needed.\n\nDocumentation - 40 CFR 68.200\nRecords supporting the implementation of the PSM/RMP plan are maintained as required by the regulation and JSC policy.\n\nFive Year Accident History - 40 CFR 68.42\nThe Fernandina Beach mill maintains records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur.
