Risk Management Plan\n\n\nCaribbean Petroleum Refining Limited Partnership is 99% owned subsidiary of Caribbean \nPetroleum Corporation.  Caribbean Petroleum Refining Limited Partnership was formed in \nFebruary of 1996 as part of a reorganization of the partnership.  Caribbean Petroleum \nCorporation under this reorganization transferred the terminal, the pipeline and terminal facilities \nto the Caribbean Petroleum Refining Limited Partnership.\n\nCaribbean Petroleum Refining Limited Partnership enjoys a unique position on the island of \nPuerto Rico ? that of owning its own terminal but also owning its own chain of retail outlets across \nthe island (approximately 215 service stations), owning an oil dock, and, having access to \npipelines connecting the facility to the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, the San Juan \nInternational Airport and all major marketers? bulk terminal facilities.\n\nCaribbean Petroleum Refining Limited Partnership does not currently operate the refinery located \nat this site and this is the greatest change from the previous RMP submission.  The tanks and \nbullets are used for wholesale bulk storage and distribution of the following hydrocarbon products;\n\n     1. Regular gasoline.\n     2. Premium gasoline.\n     3. Number 6 fuel oil.\n     4. Low sulfur diesel fuel.\n     5. High sulfur diesel fuel.\n     6. Jet fuel.\n     7. Light distillate.\n     8. HD5 ? high purity propane.\n\nThe facility does not currently produce or store butane at the terminal.  In August of 2000 the \nrefinery ceased the processing of crude oil due to market conditions.  The refinery does not have \nan HF Alkylation unit nor does it use chlorine as a biocide at the cooling tower.  Toluene is not \nproduced nor stored as a finished product and only exists as a minor component of the gasoline.  \nThus, "

This policy is \nsupported by many programs, such as, the compliance with OSHA?s 1910.119 Process Safety \nManagement regulation which includes the communication of risks and hazards to the employees \nand contractors, the development of an employee training and retraining program with written \noperating procedures.  Since the terminal is subject to the 29 CFR 1910.119 regulation, it \nqualifies as a Program 3 facility under the EPA?s Risk Management Plan regulation.\n\nThe terminal management also stresses the development and documentation of the process \nsafety information, the management of change procedure, pre-start up safety reviews and an \nequipment mechanical integrity inspection program for all major equipment items and piping \nsystems, safety equipment, as well as, new equipment purchases.  The terminal operations \npersonnel also issue hot work permits and cold work permits for maintenance activities in the \nareas where the various products are stored and transferred.\n\nThe terminal also conducts the following safety inspections on the basis as noted:\n\n     1. Work areas ? weekly.\n     2. Portable fire extinguishers ? monthly.\n     3. Fire protection system ? every 2 months.\n     4. Boilers ? annually (when operated).\n     5.

There is an employee staffed emergency brigade which can be mobilized \nrapidly should a release occur and subsequently develop into a fire.  The following civil entities \nprovide back-up support for the terminal emergency brigade:\n\n     1. Bayamon Fire Department.\n     2. Catano Fire Department.\n     3. San Juan Fire Department.\n\nIn addition to the emergency brigade, the LPG truck loading station has two (2) fire monitors, as \nwell as, four (4) area combustible gas detectors that alarm in the immediate area when a release \nof propane is detected.\n\nThe terminal engineering staff also follows and adheres to the guidelines set forth in American \nPetroleum Institute (API) standards, National Boiler Inspection Codes (NBIC) for fired boilers \nwhen operated, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) pressure vessel and \npiping codes, and the National Electric Codes for flammable environments.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps.\n\nCaribbean Petroleum Refining, LP has a long-standing commitment to the safety of the general \npublic, of the terminal employees and to the preservation of the environment.  One primary \nportion of this commitment is the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances in \nand around the terminal.

During the period of December of 1998 and January 1999, the \nterminal staff performed a thorough pre-start up safety analysis of each unit using a HAZOP \nbased methodology.  Since the refinery was shut down in 2000, the five (5) year revalidations will \nnot be performed until prior to the next start-up of the refinery.\n\nThe terminal has a policy of conducting periodic mechanical integrity inspections, depending on \nthe type of equipment and as based on the applicable American Petroleum Institute Codes and \nRecommended Practices.  The last mechanical integrity inspections of the propane bullets were \nconducted during the period of 1999 - 2000 per the API Code 510 and RP 572.  The next \ninspections are scheduled for the year 2010.\n\nThe terminal additionally has a facility-wide fire protection system with emphasis on the areas of \nthe terminal where releases and subsequent fires are more likely to develop.  The fire protection \nequipment is tested on a periodic basis.  The fire protection system has two fire water pumps ? \none driven by a gasoline engine and one driven by a diesel engine.  Firewater is stored in a tank \nwith a capacity of 1,050,000 gallons of fresh water.\n\nThe terminal also operates and maintains a foam fire truck which is used to disperse a water and \nfoam mixture on existing fires or on released flammable liquids to prevent their ignition.\n\nThe propane bullets are specifically protected by deluge systems that are remotely and manually \noperated in event of a fire.\n\nThe five year accident history.\n\nWith the fact in mind that the refinery was shut down in August of 2000, there has been only one \nrelease of flammable materials in the propane storage and handling area.  This happened on \nMarch 31, 2004, during a truck unloading process where the operator had given the instruction to \na propane truck driver to begin unloading.

The operating procedures were revised to prevent recurrence.  \n\nThe emergency response program.\n\nThe Caribbean Petroleum Refining, LP emergency response plan is designed to address the \nterminal?s main hazard ? the hazard of fires and/or explosions.  The response plan covers office \nbuilding fires specifically during working hours on weekdays, weekends and holidays.  The \nresponsibilities for various functions during the emergency are clearly defined in the response \nplan.  Gathering places for employees evacuated from the office building by the fire are also \nlisted, as well as, methods to account for all employees.\n\nThe emergency response plan also addresses fires that occur in the terminal away from office \nbuildings.  The response plan contains reporting procedures for employees when the fire is too \nlarge to be extinguished with a portable, handheld fire extinguisher.  At that point the fire alarm is \ncommunicated via radio by the security guard at the front gate which mobilizes the shift \nsupervisor and the company staffed emergency brigade.
