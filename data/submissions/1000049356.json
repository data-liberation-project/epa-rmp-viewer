This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n1.) To save lives.\n\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n3.) To protect the environment.\n\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nAmericold maintains an emergency response (safety) committee whose members are the designated\n\nemergency coordinators for the facility. The Plan provides the response organization and notification\n\nprocedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be\n\nimplemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. This Plan is\n\nreviewed and updated at least once per year. This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance\n\nwith the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Americold, Heyburn, #0700 facility chills and stores a variety of food products in their cold storage\n\nwarehouse. The refrigeration process, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through\n\nvarious physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor,\n\nthen back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold storage rooms. Changes in\n\npressure are directly related to changes in temperature. For example, lowering the ammonia pressure lowers\n\nits temperature. Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat.\n\nRemoval of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize. Heat is later\n\nremoved from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid. Typical operat"

All\n\nEmergency Response Team members are fit tested and respiratory trained annually.\n\nDuring the RMP Development Review, it was recommended that the facility conduct annual evacuation drills\n\nto ensure all employees understand the emergency response procedures. \n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nDuring the update of the Process Safety Management program at this facility, the Process Hazard Analysis\n\nstudy revealed mitigation measures to improve safety at the Americold #0700 facili"
