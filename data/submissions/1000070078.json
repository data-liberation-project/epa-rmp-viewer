This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident protection, accidental release prevention, and mitigation, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our facilities. Enable's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, gas plant personnel are trained to follow Enable's emergency response procedure in an effort to safely avert further release. \r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE Ardmore Booster Station AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES \r\nThe Ardmore Booster Station, located approximately 8 miles east of Ardmore in Carter County, Oklahoma, operates a natural gas gathering compressor station to continue the transportation of natural gas to our customers. The compressor station products include natural gas (primarily methane) and naturally occurring hydrocarbon (condensate) comprised of propane, butane, pentane, and heavier hydrocarbons, some of which are regulated flammable substances. The process to represent all regulated flammable substances at the Ardmore Booster Station which contain above the threshold quantity is as follows: \r\n\r\n\u00bf Condensate Flash Tank comprised of primarily C3+ mixture. \r\n\r\nIn order to establish the safest possible environment for our employees and the public, there are no regulated toxic substances above the threshold quantity present at the Ardmore facility. \r\n\r\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS \r\n\r\nThe Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release of a regulated flammable substance in this Program Level 3 facility is a Vapor Cloud Explosion (VCE) involving 86% inventory of the Condensate Flash Tank containing the C3+ mixture.

Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\r\n \r\nThe Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the Calumet gas plant is a VCE resulting from a 60 minute release of condensate from a truck loading pump seal leak totaling 4,012 pounds. The release is expected to be isolated by an operator within sixty minutes (active mitigation). The maximum distance to the 1-psi overpressure endpoint for this event is 0.13 miles or 675 feet. This event was selected as being a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response. \r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accidental release prevention program in place at the Ardmore Booster Station. Because the processes at the gas plant which are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation. This summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accidental release prevention program. \r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n \r\nThe Ardmore Booster Station encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the corporate office and addresses each accident prevention program element.

      "SummaryText": "the facility has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety. The teams typically have members from various areas of the facility, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and facility management. \r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information \r\n\r\nThe Ardmore Booster Station keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the facility are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information. \r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in our Operating Procedures and/or Process Safety Information. \r\nThe facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). \r\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.

This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised. \r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) \r\n\r\nThe Ardmore Booster Station has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. \r\n\r\nThe Ardmore Booster Station primarily uses the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained. \r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard an"

The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to corporate management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained. \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures \r\n\r\nThe Ardmore Booster Station maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process. \r\nIn addition, the Ardmore Booster Station maintains Operating Procedures and/or process safety information that provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters. This information is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks. \r\n\r\nTraining \r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Ardmore Booster Station has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.

This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training. \r\n\r\nContractors \r\n\r\nThe Ardmore Booster Station uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, Enable evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n \r\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs) \r\n\r\nThe Ardmore Booster Station conducts a PSSR for the new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.

A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented. \r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity \r\n\r\nThe Ardmore Booster Station has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process. \r\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner. Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment. \r\n\r\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.

This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices \r\n\r\nThe Ardmore Booster Station has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely. \r\n\r\nManagement of Change (MOC) \r\n\r\nThe Ardmore Booster Station has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change. \r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n \r\nThe Ardmore Booster Station promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or person"

      "SummaryText": "al injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations. \r\n\r\nCompliance Audits \r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the accidental release prevention program is functioning properly, the Ardmore Booster Station periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are required at least every 3 years. Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained. \r\n\r\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS \r\n\r\nThe process at the Ardmore Booster Station has hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility. \r\n\r\nUniversal Prevention Activities \r\n\r\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all processes at the Ardmore Booster Station. Collectively, these prevention program a"

The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes: \r\n\r\nRelease Detection \r\n\u00bf Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms and shutdowns. \r\n\u00bf High/Low alarms and shutdowns. \r\nRelease Containment/Control \r\n\u00bf Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases. \r\n\u00bf Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated). \r\n\u00bf Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature). \r\n\u00bf Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptable power supply for process control system). \r\n\u00bf Atmospheric relief devices. \r\n\r\nRelease Mitigation \r\n\u00bf Fire extinguishers. \r\n\u00bf Personnel trained in company emergency response procedures. \r\n\u00bf Personal protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing). \r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \r\n\r\nThe Ardmore Booster Station is a new facility with no accidental releases that have resulted in offsite effects. We investigate every incident very carefully to determine ways to prevent similar incidents from recurring.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\n \r\nThe Ardmore Booster Station maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency"

In addition, the facility has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to processes or other Enable facilities. \r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response program for the Ardmore Booster Station is coordinated with the Carter County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the local fire department. This coordination includes periodic meetings of the LEPC, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. The Ardmore Booster Station has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident."
