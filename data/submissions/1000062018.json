Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nBlackhawk Station is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility.  It is Blackhawk Station's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe facility's primary activities encompass electric power and steam generation as a Qualifying Facility cogeneration power plant.  Blackhawk Station has one (1) regulated substance present at the facility.  This substance is identified as Ammonia (anhydrous).  Ammonia (anhydrous) is used for stack NOx emission control.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nBlackhawk Station has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nBlackhawk Station maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nBlackhawk Station conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with the processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What-If/Checklist.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular i"

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nBlackhawk Station conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  The most recent compliance audit was conducted on 11/17/2014.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nBlackhawk Station promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nBlackhawk Station truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\nOn occasion, Blackhawk Station hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.
