Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Butterfield & Associates Grain, Inc. in Meadville are strongly committed to employee, public,\nand environmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental\nrelease prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures,\nmaintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to\nimplement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release\ndoes occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects\nof the release.  We also coordinate our response efforts with the Meadville Fire Department, which\nprovides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\nammonia stored in a 30,000-gallon tank at our facility in Meadville (Figure 1).  The maximum\namount stored is 22,500 gallons (131,223 pounds) at the maximum fill capacity of 85%.\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\nWe utilized RMP PRO for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite\nconsequence analysis for our facility.  The following details these scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the\nanhydrous ammonia storage tank (131,223 pounds) in gaseous form over a 10-minute period.  At\nClass F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, and urban topography, the maximum distance to\na toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L is 5.2 miles (Figure 2).  The estimated population wi"

The estimated population within a 0.31-mile radius of the\nfacility is 400.\n\n  4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention\nrequirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements\nof the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\nButterfield & Associates Grain, Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes\nthe chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes\n(Appendix D).\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are\nidentified and controlled effectively.  Any findings from the hazard analysis are addressed in a\ntimely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nButterfield & Associates Grain, Inc. maintains written operating procedures to ensure that activities\nwithin our covered processes are conducted safely.  These procedures address various modes of\noperation; the information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in\nthe processes (Appendix B).\n\nTraining\nButterfield & Associates Grain, Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that\nemployees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with\nthese processes.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nButterfield & Associates Grain, Inc. conducts documented maintenance checks on process\nequipment to ensure proper operation.

Process operators, maintenance personnel or\nother employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly\nnotified of the modification and offered training to deal with it.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nButterfield & Associates Grain, Inc. routinely conducts pre-startup safety reviews related to new\nprocesses and modifications in established processes.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that\nconstruction, equipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior\nto placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nButterfield & Associates Grain, Inc. conducts compliance audits on a regular basis to determine\nwhether the plan's provisions, set out under the 40 CFR part 68, are being implemented.
