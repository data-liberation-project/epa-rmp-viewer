This\nevaluation was performed to assure that the facilities chlorine injection system complies with\napplicable regulations.  Key elements of the Risk Management Plan provided by Watts Engineers\nincluded:  a review of the accidental release prevention and emergency response policies; a\nreview of the regulated substance handled; a worst-case and an alternative release scenario; a\nreview of the general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention\nsteps; a review of the five-year accident history; a review the emergency response program; and\nparticipation in meetings and planning changes to improve the Process Safety Program.   Watts\nEngineers will electronically submit this Risk Management Plan to the Environmental Protection\nAgency (EPA) by June 21, 1999.  \n\n     The Oswego WTF is located on the West Side of the City of Oswego between the State\nUniversity of New York at Oswego and the Niagara Mohawk Power Station.  It employs\nnineteen (19) full-time employees.  Activities at the facility include the treatment of water from\nLake Ontario, clarification and filtration, and treated with chlorine gas before being released to\nthe municipal water supply.  \n\n     Chlorine is considered a regulated substance under the Risk Management and Process\nSafety Programs.  Characteristics of this gas or liquid include a pungent suffocating odor.  It is\nirritating to the mucous membranes.  When chlorine reacts with water, it forms hydrochloric\nacid.  Hydrochloric acid gas is a toxic and corrosiv"

Long term exposures to small concentrations or short term exposures to high\nconcentrations may result in adverse health effects.  Since chlorine gas is heavier then air,  It can\nsettle in low spots along the ground, therefore, care should be exercised while working in\nconfined spaces or low lying areas.  \n\n     The City of Oswego and senior management at the Water Treatment Facility have a\nstrong commitment to the overall safety of it's employees, the public, and the environment.  It is\nthe policy of the West Side STP to train each employee and contractor about safety\nconsiderations and emergency procedures in the unlikely event of a discharge.  A maximum of\ntwelve thousand  (12,000) pounds of chlorine gas in six (6) tanks gas are either used or stored at\none time at the facility.  Each tank contains two thousand (2,000) pounds of chlorine gas. The\nchlorine is composed of 99.5 percent chlorine and 0.5 percent inert ingredients.  The tanks are\nlocated on a storage pad behind the facility.  The storage pad is covered by a canopy constructed\nof sheets of corrugated steel used for a roof.  The storage area is otherwise open to air.  Chlorine\nis being delivered by truck and unloaded using a two ton crane onto a set of steel rails where the\ngas tank is stored until it is ready for use. Each end of the rails are chocked to prevent the gas\ntanks from rolling.  Each gas tank has it's own valve guard to prevent objects from coming in\ncontact with the valves.  \n\n    \n     When a chlorine tank is needed, a two ton crane lifts the cylinder and is moved along a\ncrane rail through a set of double steel doors and into the tank scale room.  The tank scale room \nis fully enclosed.  The room is labeled \"chlorine hazard\" and emergency instructions are posted\nat the door.  Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) are located in a common hallway by the\noperators station.  \n\n      Next to the tank scale room is the chlorine injection r"

Here, the chlorine is\ninjected into the wastewater through a series of valves and PVC tubes.\n\n       The chlorine tanks are stored on to a calibrated scale, designed to hold the four, two\nthousand pound tanks on roller trunnions. The chlorine containers have two valves in each head,\nWith the tank in a horizontal position and the valves in a vertical line, they deliver gas from the\nupper valve and liquid from the lower valve.  Five hundred (500) psig copper tubing fitted with a\nspecial adapter is used to connect the tank to the tubing system.  To connect the line to the\ncontainer, a valve protection hood and the valve outlet cap are removed.  A wrench is used to\nconnect the valving to the yoke.  A new gasket, which is supplied with the container is used each\ntime a connection is made.  As part of the Process Safety Management Program leaks are then\nchecked using ammonia vapor.  The appearance of white vapor indicates a chlorine leak.  A\nprotective suit, gloves, and a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) are worn by the operator\nand a chlorine tank repair kit are kept on hand in the unlikely event of a chlorine leak while\nchanging tanks.  In the past five years, this facility has had no accidental releases of chlorine.\n\n     The City of Oswego Water Treatment Facility maintains a general accidental\nrelease prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps.  As a part of this program, a\nchlorine alarm system is in place at the facility.  The chlorine meter and alarm are located on the\nwall outside of the chlorine injection room.  The chlorine sensors are located in the injection\nroom and the tank scale room.  In the event of a chlorine leak, a audio alarm will sound in the\noperator's control room which is staffed twenty four (24) hours a day, seven days a week.  The\nmonitor is maintained and calibrated by an outside contractor. The calibration frequency is yearl"

All employees are trained yearly on the chlorine alarm\nsystem.  An operator receiving an alarm is to call the Oswego Fire Department immediately.  In\nthe event that the chlorine alarm system is inoperable, the chlorine tank scale room and the\nchlorine injection room will be checked by an operator hourly with a portable chlorine meter. \nThe operator also carries a radio to communicate with another plant personnel should a leak be\ndiscovered.\n\n     The chlorine injection system itself operates under a vacuum produced by the injector\nmechanism.  Gas leaves the tank through a vacuum regulating valve.  A diaphragm senses\nvacuum on one side and atmospheric pressure on the other.  A spring loaded stem off the seat is\ndisplaced by force on the diaphragm.  Gas moves toward the flow control components and proper\nvacuum is maintained.  While under vacuum, gas enters the rotameter where it's flow is\nmeasured.  Gas flow rate is controlled by a v-notch orifice and either manual or automatic\npositioning of the v-grooved plug in it's ring.  A differential regulating valve is located after the\norifice which maintains the proper vacuum across the v-notch.  A pressure-relief valve vents to\nthe atmosphere if a malfunction occurs and pressure builds.  Gas is then dissolved in the water\nstream at the injector.  Check valves are in place and designed to close on injector shutdown. \nThere are no lines carrying gas under pressure in this system.

Two\nmembers are trained to the Technician Level, and eleven members are trained to the Specialist\nLevel.  The fire department has toured the plant to become familiar with what is on site, and\ndevelop different leak scenarios and practice emergency response measures.  In June of 1996, a\nHazMat drill with the Fulton Fire Department Haz-Mat Team was conducted.  The Haz-Mat\nTeam was activated.  The scenario staged was that a tank while being changed, started leaking. \nA full decon was set up.  The entry personnel used the chlorine kit to stop the tank from leaking. \nA full critique was conducted, and everyone at the scene reviewed the site.  On March  18, 1997,\nseven members of the Haz-Mat Team conducted a drill at the treatment plant.  This scenario was\na leak in the feed line.  The crew followed SOPs to fix the problem.

These airborne concentrations are the maximum airborne concentrations that most\npeople can be exposed to for up to one hour without experiencing serious or irreversible effects\nor symptoms.  The calculated distance to endpoint is 1.3 miles.\n\n       The alternate release scenario for the chlorine injection system is one that is more likely\nto occur than the worst case scenario that reaches an end point off-site.  A chlorine leak caused\nby piping or valve failure is used in the alternative scenario.  A hole diameter of 1/4 inch on the\npiping or valve could theoretically occur.
