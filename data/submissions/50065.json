      "SummaryText": "Veolia Water North America operates the Northside Poluution Control Treatment plant for the City of Auburn, (owner). The facility is an activated sludge/ extended aeration sanitary wastewater treatment operation that is located on the Northwest side of the city at Richland Road. The site is approximantely 5 acres located in a rural setting. The site is approximantely 6000 feet above sea level and the natural flow of surface water appears to be to the South -Southeast towards Willow Creek Subdivision and a tributary of Willow Creek Pond. The facility treats the 25 percentage of the Sanitary wastewater for the City. The site is regulated under the State of Alabama NPDES permit #AL0050245. The process utilizes both mechanical and biological treatment to remove organics from the wastewater prior to returning the treated water to the environment. Part of the process uses chlorine gas in contact with the treated water for disinfection. The chlorine gas is stored and is placed into service in a chlorine contact building which is isolated from the remainder of the plant. Operators are thoroughly trained in the handling of the chlorine. A review of the process indicates that the worst case scenario is the release of a one ton cylinder that is being placed in service, plus a small amount of a second cylinder that is in service. The release would allow gaseous chlorine to migrate off the plant site to the south-southeast towards a subdivision at a distance of some 1700 yard.. The enevolpe of expansion would be some 1800 miles. The most likely alternative scenario is the release of a partically full cylinder, with the same flow pattern and traveling about 773 yards in the same general direction. In either case, the emergency response would involve activation of the local Emergency Response Program. The site has a Process Safety Management Program in place that includes the following elements; Hazard Review, Operating Procedures, Trainig, Maintenance, Incident Investigation, Com"
