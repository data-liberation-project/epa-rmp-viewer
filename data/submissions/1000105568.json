The Five Year Accident History:\n\nAt approximately 5:00 AM CST on December 6, 2019, the filling operator was sprayed with Hydrofluoric Acid (49%) while performing routine transfer operations. The material splashed between his chemical protective suit and work clothes. Exposure was limited to the upper torso (pectoral region)\n\nThe filling operator showered, and calcium gluconate was applied liberally then taken to the emergency room per plant policy. Once at the emergency room it was determined that the filling operator need to be transferred to the regional burn center.\n\nThe Root Cause was determined that the operator improperly executed the Line Breaking Procedure and Permit.\n\n\n5. The Emergency Response Plan:\n\nAn Emergency Response/Contingency Plan has been developed to provide a formal emergency preparedness program that protects human health and property for both the employees and surrounding community in the event of an emergency such as fire; explosion; release of highly hazardous chemicals (HHC); transportation emergency; criminal acts; and natural emergency.  This plan also formalizes the arrangements with local police, local neighbors, fire departments, hospitals, and emergency response contractors, and all governing state and federal agencies in case of an emergency.  A copy of this plan is available to each employee and is intended to meet the mandates of the Occupational Safety & Health Act, 29 CFR 1910.119 (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals), and all other applicable state, federal, and local governing authority requirements.\n\n6.
