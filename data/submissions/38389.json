      "SummaryText": "PROCESS SUMMARY\nThe Reddy Ice #301 facility located in Austin, Texas, manufactures ice for wholesale/retail distribution. The facility maintains approximately 23,500 pounds of anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant for ice making and storage vaults. \n\nThe facility refrigeration system is a standard closed loop design consisting of compressors, condensers, high-pressure and low-pressure ammonia storage vessels, ice makers, and air-cooling evaporators for the storage vaults. There are two operating systems, one for the ice makers, and one for the storage vaults. Each of the systems is supplied liquid anhydrous ammonia from a common storage receiver located outside the engine room. The system has numerous protective controls including motor overload, high and low temperature and pressure, low oil pressure, high and low liquid level cutouts, and pressure relief valves on all equipment. Ammonia detectors and alarms are installed throughout the plant, and the compressors are controlled by a microprocessor Process Limit Controller (PLC).\n\nAnhydrous ammonia, when properly used, has proven to be a safe and reliable refrigerant. The sharp odor of ammonia provides its own warning agent. Practically all accidents involving anhydrous ammonia can be avoided through the facility?s program of proper training; knowledge of the equipment and procedures; and conducting preventive maintenance on all ammonia equipment. Reddy Ice has instituted administrative and engineering controls as well as training programs on the corporate level to prevent such accidents.\n\nThe facility has multiple safeguards pertinent to the anhydrous ammonia process. These include an ammonia detection and alarm system, exhaust purge fans, controls which shut down the compressors if operating limits are exceeded, and the capability of shutting the entire system down if required. Administrative controls are in place that limit the utilization of vessels to approximately 20% to 45% of their intended capacities.\n\nThe com"

This accident prevention program is a way to make safe operations and accident prevention systematic throughout the facility. Reddy Ice Group corporate management and Reddy Ice-Austin management are committed to operating a safe and compliant facility for the protection of its employees, the public, and the environment. A Combined Process Safety Management/Risk Management (PSM/RM) Program has been developed to meet the accidental release prevention requirements of both EPA?s Risk Management Program (40 CFR Part 68) and OSHA?s Process Safety Management Standard (29 CFR 1910.119) under the Clean Air Act. The Combined PSM/RM Program contains thirteen elements, establishing requirements for employee participation, safety information, hazard analysis, pre-startup safety review, standard operating procedures, employee training, management of change, mechanical integrity/preventive maintenance, hot work permits, contractor qualifications, release incident investigation, compliance audits, and trade secrets. These elements are tied together by a management system to ensure plant-wide development, implementation and integration of all the Program requirements.\n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM\nA management system has been developed to oversee the implementation of the PSM/RM Program elements. The plant manager has been identified as PSM/RM Program Coordinator, with overall responsibility for developing, implementing and integrating the Program requirements. Under the PSM/RM Program, various responsibilities have been assigned to othe"

A rotating safety committee meets each month to present a safety meeting and address any safety issues brought up by employees during the month.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\nAs required by the Risk Management Program regulations, the Reddy Ice-Austin facility has conducted a hazard assessment including offsite consequence analyses (OCAs) for potential accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. The OCAs describe the potential offsite exposure to surrounding areas from an accidental release. A worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenarios were developed and calculated using the EPA RMP*Comp modeling program, and the potentially affected offsite population and facilities were identified.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe Reddy Ice-Austin facility has not had any releases that would require reporting as part of a five-year accident history.\n\nEMERGENCY PLANNING AND RESPONSE\nThe Reddy Ice-Austin facility operates under an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that includes procedures for: notifying plant personnel, the public, and local emergency responders; emergency evacuation/response procedures; use of emergency alarms and equipment; employee training in evacuation and response procedures; first aid for ammonia exposure; and periodic review and updating of the emergency action plan. The plan is reviewed regularly for verification of data, and revised and updated as necessary to reflect changes in facility operations and personnel.\n\nAs required, the facility has coordinated emergency response activities with the Travis County LEPC and the Austin Fire Department, and has appropriate mechanisms in place to notify emergency responders if needed. The ammonia inventory is verified and reported annually to the state and local authorities, and the plant is incorporated into the community emergency response plan developed under 42 USC.\n\nPLANNED CHANG"
