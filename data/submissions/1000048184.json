During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\r\n\r\nYoungstown Grape Distributors has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration processeses. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \r\n\r\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration processeses at the Youngstown Grape Distributors facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. The East System ammonia process contains a total charge of approximately 16,000 lbs. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\r\n\r\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration processes and keep an active logbook of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performin"

Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \r\n\r\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\r\n\r\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nYoungstown Grape Distributors has implemented many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, Youngstown Grape Distributors continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\r\n\r\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Youngstown Grape Distributors ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Youngstown Grape Distributors management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\r\n\r\nYoungstown Grape Distributors has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program.

The facility has one (1) RMP ammonia systems that provide refrigeration capacity to multiple cold storage rooms.  The rooms use evaporator coils that contain chilled liquid ammonia.  System safety devices provide substantial control and alarm capability.\r\n\r\nThe East and West refrigeration systems utilize pumped liquid recirculators where high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped to a liquid recirculator through a liquid feed solenoid valve and an expansion valve.  From there, low pressure liquid is pumped to each cold room, where it passes through a solenoid valve, hand expansion valve and into evaporator coils.  Low temperature liquid circulates through the evaporator coils.  Low pressure and temperature gas and overfeed liquid passes through check valves and is returned to the liquid recirculator.  The residual liquid is separated from the gas in the accumulator and the suction gas is piped to reciprocating compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas.  The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to a water cooled evaporative condenser where the high pressure ammonia gas is liquefied and returned to the high pressure receiver.  The system uses water to defrost the coils.\r\n\r\nYoungstown Grape Distributors was designed and installed by professional refrigeration engineers in accordance with industry standards at the time.  It was also built in compliance with the Uniform Mechani"
