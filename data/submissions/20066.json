      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nWe at A.E. Staley Manufacturing Company-Dayton are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\nTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the manufacture of citric acid.  We have one regulated substance at our facility.  This substance is Ammonia (anhydrous).  Ammonia (anhydrous) is used in the fermentation of dextrose to citric acid.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) is 65,000 lb.\n\nTHE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIOS \nTo evaluate the worst case scenario and the alternate release scenarios we have used EPA's RMP Guidance for Waste Water Treatment Plants and EPA's RMPComp software. The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO submitted involves a catastrophic release from the Ammonia tank.  In this scenario 65,000 lb. of Ammonia (anhydrous) is released in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  At class F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s windspeed, and urban topography a distance of 3.1 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14mg/L.\n\nTHE AMMONIA ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO involves sending a charge of Ammonia to an empty fermentor when no dextrose is present. This scenario would release 200 lb of Ammonia over 5 minutes.   Under neutral weather conditions of class D atmospheric stability and 3 m/s wind speed and assuming urban topography the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia (anhydrous) is 0.1 miles.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM"

This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with ANSI Standard K61.1, 1989 edition.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION-A.E. Staley Manufacturing Company-Dayton maintains a record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment design associated with all processes.  \n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS-Our facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the What If/Checklist method.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at regular intervals.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA review for the Ammonia (anhydrous) system was performed February 10, 1999.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES-For the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processed, A.E. Staley Manufacturing Company-Dayton maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operation, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a maintenance shutdown.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTRAINING-A.E. Staley Manufacturing-Dayton has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided as needed.\n\nMECHANIC"

Process equipment examined by these checks includes: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE-Written procedures are in place at A.E. Staley Manufacturing-Dayton to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed March 7, 1997.  Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employee whose job task are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPRE-START UP REVIEW-Pre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications is established processes are conducted as a regular practice at A.E. Staley Manufacturing Company-Dayton.    These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment in operation.\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS-A.E. Staley Manufacturing Company-Dayton receives corporate audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the PSM rule and RMP rule are being implemented.  The most recent compliance audit was conducted June 20, 1997.
