This site was originally developed in 1909 for a lumber mill operation. The \r\nWauna mill began its current business of producing pulp and paper in 1965.  The pulp and paper \r\nmill was originally built and operated by Crown Zellerbach Corporation.  In 1986, James River \r\nacquired Crown Zellerbach.  In 1997 the ownership of the facility changed to Fort James \r\nOperating Company when James River merged with Fort Howard.  The Wauna Mill is still \r\ncurrently owned and operated by Fort James Operating Company although, in November 2000, \r\nGeorgia Pacific Corporation acquired all stock shares of Fort James. \r\n\r\nThe Wauna mill is a fully integrated pulp and paper mill that uses the following general \r\nprocesses: The Mill produces a variety of paper products.  These products include towel and \r\ntissue products for retail stores and the commercial market, uncoated printing papers. The Wauna \r\nmill employs about 1,000 people from the local area. \r\n\r\nSawdust, wood chips, and purchased pulp are transported to the mill by barge or by truck. \r\nSawdust and wood chips are stored in piles prior to processing.\r\n\r\nWauna uses the kraft process to convert wood into pulp.  The kraft process uses a sodium \r\nhydroxide and sodium sulfide solution under heat and pressure to dissolve the lignin component \r\nof wood. The dissolved lignin and spent pulping chemicals are separated from unbl"

The bleaching process uses sodium hydroxide, oxygen,  chlorine dioxide, and \r\nhydrogen peroxide to remove residual lignin from the pulp and whiten it to commercial \r\nbrightness levels. The chlorine dioxide solution is produced on-site from sodium chlorate, \r\nsulfuric acid, methanol, and water.\r\n\r\nThere are four papermachines at the Wauna mill.  Three of the papermachines produce towel and \r\ntissue grades, and one produces white printing papers. \r\n\r\nBleached pulps derived from different wood species, as well as purchased pulp and secondary \r\nfiber recycled from waste paper, are blended to produce a mixture tailor-made for each paper \r\ngrade.  The rolls of paper from the towel and tissue papermachines are converted on-site into \r\nnapkins, towels, bathroom tissue, or facial tissue. Rolls of paper from the communication \r\npapermachines are wrapped and sold directly to printers and converters.  The mill also operates a \r\npulp dryer which produces baled pulp for internal use or sale to outside customers.\r\n\r\nWastewaters from the mill are collected and pumped to an air activated biological treatment \r\nfacility. The facility includes a primary clarifier, a stabilization basin, an aeration pond, and two \r\nsecondary clarifiers. Primary and secondary sludges are dewatered together and burned, along \r\nwith other wood wastes, in a state-of-the-art fluid bed boiler.

The guidance suggests that a wind \r\nspeed of 3.0 meters per second should be considered for the Alternate Release scenarios,  unless \r\nthe facility has data to support a different wind speed.  For the ARPP, Fort James reviewed PSD-\r\nquality meteorological data that were collected at the Wauna mill  in 1992-1993, and determined \r\nthat a wind speed of 3.0 meters/second is a reasonable worst condition estimate. \r\n\r\nThe downwind dispersion of a hypothetical dense-gas plume also depends on the assumed \r\nsurface roughness.

Process Hazard Analysis.  The Wauna Mill performs and periodically updates process hazard \r\nanalyses (PHAs) of the covered processes to help identify process hazards and generate \r\nrecommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process. A team composed of \r\npersonnel with engineering and process operating experience and a team leader with experience \r\nin performing process hazard analyses is assembled to analyze the process. The facility primarily \r\nuses the \"Hazard and Operability\" (HAZOP) and/or \"What If'\" technique, supplemented with \r\nchecklist, to perform this analysis. The PHA team prepares a written report describing the results \r\nof the analysis, including recommendations. Responsibility for resolving the recommendations is \r\nassigned to personnel and, when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the process are \r\nimplemented.\r\n \r\n 4. Operating Procedures. The Wauna Mill operators, supervisors, and engineers work together to \r\ndevelop and maintain accurate operating procedures to define how tasks related to process \r\noperations should be safely performed. The operating procedures (1) are used to train employees \r\nand (2) serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations \r\nand upset operating conditions. The operating procedures include:\r\n \r\n -Steps for safely conducting activities\r\n \r\n -Applicable process safety information, such as safe operating limits and consequences of \r\nprocess deviations\r\n \r\n -Safety and health considerations, such as chemical hazards, personal protective equipment \r\nrequirements, and"

Written test and oral reviews are used to verify that the employee \r\nunderstands the training materials before the employee can operate the process.\r\n \r\n The operators are consulted annually about the frequency of the training and the materials to be \r\nused for the training. Recommendations from the operators are reviewed and changes to the \r\ntraining are implemented as appropriate.\r\n \r\n 6. Contractors.  The Wauna Mill has established a program to help ensure that contractor \r\nactivities at the facility are performed in a safe manner. The program reviews the safety record of \r\nall contractors to help ensure that the facility only hires contractors who can safely perform the \r\ndesired job tasks. The Wauna Mill explains to the contract supervisors the hazards of the process \r\non which they and their employees will work, the facility safe work practices, and the emergency \r\nresponse procedures for the facility. The facility requires that the contractor supervisors train \r\neach of their employees who will work on or near a covered process before that employee begins \r\nwork at the site.

The Wauna Mill maintains the mechanical integrity of the covered \r\nprocess equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or \r\nthe environment. The facility mechanical integrity program includes (1) an inspection and testing \r\nprogram to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before the equipment fails and (2) \r\na quality assurance program to help ensure that new and replacement equipment meet the design \r\nstandards required for service in The Wauna Mill covered processes.

Chlorine Dioxide is produced \r\nat the facility and stored as a diluted aqueous solution to avoid the necessity of transporting large \r\nquantities of the solution. Chlorine dioxide is produced in the chlorine dioxide generator and \r\npiped to an absorber column, where a aqueous solution of nominal 1% strength is produced.  For \r\npurposes of the Risk Management Plan, it is assumed that the solution strength can range as high \r\nas 1.4% (14 grams per liter).\r\n \r\n In addition to the required prevention program elements, the Wauna Mill has also implemented \r\nsafety features specific to the Fluid Bed Boiler (FBB) Nitrous Oxide (NOx) Control System.  In \r\nthis system, anhydrous ammonia is piped from a storage tank to the mill's Fluid Bed Boiler to \r\ncontrol NOx emissions, as required by the mill's Title V air operating permit. \r\n \r\n1.5  Five - Year Accident History\r\n \r\nFort James has demonstrated a good record of accident prevention.
