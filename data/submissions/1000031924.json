This commitment is inherent in its comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also completely coordinated with the San Joaquin County OES and Tracy, CA Fire Department, which provide additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\n2 The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Cheese Manufacturing. The plant is located at 2401 MacArthur Drive in Tracy, CA. We have one RMP-regulated substance, Anhydrous Ammonia, at our facility, which is used to provide refrigeration for the manufacturing of cheese. The maximum inventory of Ammonia at our facility is approximately 100,000 lbs.\n\n\n\n3 The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth by the EPA under 40 CFR part 68. The ammonia refrigeration system is also subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119, and to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nLeprino Foods Company maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur f"
