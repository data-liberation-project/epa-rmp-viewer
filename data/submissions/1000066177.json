Our safety strategy revolves around our Do It Right value and permeates our business in three key ways:\r\n\u00bf\tRobust systems that provide a clear, repeatable direction toward excellence.\r\n\u00bf\tSuperior performance that aligns effective and efficient EHS activities with operations.\r\n\u00bf\tEngaged culture that empowers consistent behaviors that drive toward excellence.\r\nCF Industries works closely with emergency responders and other local officials to develop detailed emergency response plans that extend beyond our physical operating locations.\r\n\r\nYAZOO CITY NITROGEN FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\nYazoo City Nitrogen Facility manufactures anhydrous ammonia, nitric acid, urea-ammonium nitrate solutions, urea liquor, diesel exhaust fluid (urea liquor), ammonium nitrate solutions, and ammonium nitrate (solid). Intermediates in the manufacture of these products include ammonia, CO2, nitric acid and urea. The regulated only substance, as defined by 40 CFR Part 68, which are present at the facility in more than a threshold quantity is ammonia.\r\n\r\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nThe Yazoo City Nitrogen Facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with all of the accidental release and chemical-specific prevention requirements as set forth in U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 40 CFR Part 68. This facility is also subject to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard 29 CFR 1910.119. The following summarizes the elements of the release and chemical-specific prevention that are in place at our facility:\r\n\u00bf\tProcess safety information that is accurate and up to date;\r\n\u00bf\tWell-trained operating, maintenance, and contract personnel;\r\n\u00bf\tWritten operating procedures;\r\n\u00bf\tMechanical inte"

The ERP is designed as a guide to help in determining the magnitude of an incident, the steps needed to bring the incident under control and the requirements to ensure that all federal, state, and local laws are complied with. The ERP is a definitive plan that assigns responsibilities, defines several different methods of communication, designates evacuation procedures, and coordinates with outside assistance. The plan also designates the type and frequency of training that employees are required to have depending on their responsibilities. Furthermore, the plan commits the company's management team to devote the necessary resources to prepare, implement and audi"
