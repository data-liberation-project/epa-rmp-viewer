This document consists of the executive summary and registration data elements (68.155 through 68.185).\n\n\n\n1.0    RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nThe Omaha Dry facility in Omaha, Nebraska has a good record in preventing releases of anhydrous* ammonia.  As part of their release prevention program, the plant has an excellent and very detailed preventative maintenance program.  More information about these aspects of the prevention program is discussed in Section 4.0 of this Executive Summary.\n\n\n\nThe facility has implemented a Chemical Release Response Plan which is to provide information and guidance to safely deal with an ammonia release.  This detailed emergency response program includes procedures for handling an emergency - the established response plan and appropriate personnel involved in containing an ammonia release ? HAZMAT Response Team. These components make the Chemical Release Response Plan a thorough and comprehens"

The emergency response policies at the facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage 24 hours - 7 days per week. \n\n\n\n*From this point in the Executive Summary, anhydrous ammonia will be synonymous with ammonia.\n\n\n\n2.0    PROCESS DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Omaha plant produces various meats including:  dry sausage, pepperoni, salami, and proscuitto ham. The NAICS code for the processes at this facility is 311612.   Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to preserve the meat products. Omaha Dry has one regulated substance under 40 CFR 68: ammonia.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the refrigeration of the products in the various areas of the plant.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia threshold for triggering applicability to 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds.  The total quantity of ammonia stored in the refrigeration process is documented as 29,524 pounds.  The process exceeds the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds as set by 40 CFR 68 and thus is regulated by the Risk Management Program.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.0    WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has associated hazards that can potentially affect on-site employees and the general public off-site if there is a release from the system.  Described below are the associated hazards and the worst-case and alternative release scenario for the regulated chemical.  Though there may be other scenarios possible, EPA only requires that one worst-case and one alternative scenario be reported for each regulated chemical. \n\n\n\nAmmonia is classified as a Group 2 Refrigerant per ASHRAE Standard 34-1989.  The dominant characteristic of this chemical is its toxicity.  It is a self-alarming chemical by its distinctive pungent odor.  Due to this odor, persons exposed to ammonia vapor will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small concentrations.  Ammonia will burn at a very narrow and high range of concentrations accompanied with a high ignition te"

Ammonia is readily absorbed into the moisture of the skin and, at high concentrations, can cause severe burns.\n\n\n\nThe risks to persons in an accidental release of ammonia include:\n\n\n\n1.    Corrosive attack of skin and other tissue (including lung tissue)\n\n2.    Freezing of skin and other body tissue when contacted by liquid ammonia\n\n3.    Eye contact\n\n\n\nBelow is a description of the release scenarios for ammonia and their off-site consequences:\n\n    \n\n4.0    GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nOmaha Dry has developed an OSHA (PSM) program for their ammonia refrigeration system. At Omaha Dry, ammonia falls under the RMP Program 3 Prevention Program which is identical to the OSHA PSM program.  EPA has said that if the process is in compliance with OSHA PSM, then it is compliance with RMP Program 3.  Thus, Omaha Dry?s ammonia PSM system has been reviewed and the PSM system elements are being implemented for the RMP.  \n\n\n\nListed below are the key aspects of the ammonia prevention program:\n\n\n\nThe plant uses a Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) for control scheduling and accomplishment of preventative maintenance on components of the refrigeration system.  The scope of preventative maintenance (PM) and testing/inspection (T/I) for refrigeration components is based on individual vendor recommendations and generally accepted engineering practices with regard to types of preventative maintenance and inspections and their recommended frequencies.  The plant has created work tasks for each type of PM and T/I associated with the refrigeration system.  These tasks are included on the individual work order generated by the CMMS.  This system ensures that each operator/mechanic is aware of the pertinent safety precautions required for a PM procedure as well as the step-by-step actions required to complete the procedure.  The operator/mechanic and the"

In the event a PM or T/I procedure is not completed satisfactorily, the operator/mechanic notes it on the work order, and a follow-up work order is generated to address the specific deficiency.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.0    FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe review of Omaha Dry?s accident history includes the following range of dates: June 21, 1999 ? June 21, 2004.  According to 40 CFR Part 68.42(a), there have been no accidental releases at this facility.\n\n\n\n6.0    EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nAs mentioned previously, the Omaha Dry facility has developed a Chemical Release Response Plan. The response plan is a detailed document which discusses the role of employees in an emergency situation. The plan outlines specific procedures for evacuations for plant personnel. All emergency response personnel (HAZMAT Response Team) undergo emergency response training.  For all emergencies, the Incident Commander has operating authority for emergency response at the site of the release and has the authority to obtain resource support from within all departments of Omaha Dry in order to effect a quick and proper response. This team is responsible for implementing the response plan and controlling all aspects of the plan and personnel.\n\n\n\nThis document contains specific procedures for:  incident response guidelines; responsibilities and lines of authority; coordination with other emergency response plans; testing of alarms; chemical release drills; HAZMAT Response Team; training; communication with outside agencies; evacuation routes, safe distance and places of refuge; site security and control; emergency medical treatment and first aid; PPE and emergency equipment; decontamination; and critique of response operations.\n\n\n\n7.0    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nBased on the completed Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for ammonia, a list of action items to improve safety was deve"
