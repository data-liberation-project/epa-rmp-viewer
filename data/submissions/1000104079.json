Our approach with safety is demonstrated with our certification in the voluntary protection program (VPP) through OSHA. \nThe Motley Facility manufactures surimi seafood and uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant for coolers, chillers and freezers. The system is a two stage system consisting of a discharge side, intermediate stage and suction side.  About half of the ammonia piping is located on the roof and the other half below ceiling in the facility.  Outside in a fenced in area are the condenser units and the high pressure receiver.  All compressors are located inside the facility. \nOur facility uses anhydrous ammonia in excess of the threshold limit and is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management Program (PSM) and the Risk Management (RM) requirements. We have an active PSM committee made up of plant employees that regularly meet to review program metrics, plan new projects, set up training and ensure full employee participation in the program.  \nThe facility is monitored and operated using a state of art computer software program. PSM & RMP programs are electronically managed through software developed by Trident Seafoods for process safety management of the refrigeration system.  \nThe facility has an emergency response program with a full in-house HAZMAT team that is capable to respond to an ammonia release in a timely manner.  The facility has also coordinated with the Motley Fire and Police Departments as to their role if there were a major release.  The HAZMAT team is trained annually and regularly performs drills.  \nTEP distances were determined for potential ammonia releases using the RMP*Comp.  The TEP distance for the worst-case release of ammonia, assuming a catastrophic failure of the Low Temperature Recirculator containing 11,242 pounds of ammonia, is 1.6 miles.  The TEP distance for the alternative or more likely release of ammonia, assuming a \u00bc-inch diameter hol"
