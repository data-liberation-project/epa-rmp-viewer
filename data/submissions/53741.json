Pentane was utilized as a surrogate for this compound.\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA RMP*Comp model.  Based on the criteria of 40 CFR 68.10, the distance to the specified endpoint for the worst-case scenario could impact operations at the Elk Hills Power Production facility located adjacent to our regulated facilities.  However, our facility does meet, and has fully implemented the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119 as outlined in Section 4 below. \n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all steps necessary to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility.  These elements are the basis for our Process Safety Management system as required under 29 CFR 1910.119.\nProcess Safety Information\nOccidental of Elk Hills, Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is HAZOP.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and "

The most recent PHA update was performed on the Cogen facility in September 2008.\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Occidental of Elk Hills, Inc. maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\nTraining\nOccidental of Elk Hills, Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes as well as emergency response activities.  Refresher training is provided annually.\nMechanical Integrity\nOccidental of Elk Hills, Inc. carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Occidental of Elk Hills, Inc. to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures, and personnel.

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\nCompliance Audits\nOccidental of Elk Hills, Inc. conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  The most recent compliance audit was conducted in Sept 2008.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\nIncident Investigation\nOccidental of Elk Hills, Inc. promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent future releases.
