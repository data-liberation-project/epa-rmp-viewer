Pentane was utilized as a surrogate for this compound.\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA RMP*Comp model.  Based on the criteria of 40 CFR 68.10, the distance to the specified endpoint for the worst-case scenario could impact operations at the Elk Hills Power Production facility located adjacent to our regulated facilities.  However, our facility does meet, and has fully implemented the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119 as outlined in Section 4 below. \n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all steps necessary to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.
