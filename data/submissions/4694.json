For all personnel assigned responsibility for individual requirements, this plan identifies the persons responsible and is made up of four major areas identified as The  Management System, Hazard Assesment, Prevention Program and The Emergency Response Program.  Consumers Ohio Water Company is committed to safety and the implementation of all standard safety procedures.\n\nThe Hazard Assesment is made up of the worst case analysis, alternative release analysis and a five year accident history.  This facility has had no accidents in the past five years.\n\nThe only covered chemical at this location is chlorine. This facility is a standard water treatment plant which utilizes chlorine in the disinfection process for potable water.  The average amount of chlorine at any given time at this facility is 8,000 pounds.\n\nThe worst case release scenario would be the entire contents of one ton chlorine cylinder being released, although this would be an improbable scenario.  This scenario would have an off site impact of 1.5 miles from the treatment plant.  One alternative release scenario, which would be a more like scenario, consists of a pin hole leak in a line which would  have a .1 mile release radius or a vacuum regulator leak which would have a release radius of .2 miles.  The modeling of these scenarios was performed utilizing a Degadis System which is approved by USEPA for RMP modeling.  There are presently containment mitigation devices in place to help reduce the effects of any releases.\n\nThe Prevention Program is the most comprehensive section of the RMP and includes Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Mechanical Integrity, Management of Change, Pre-Startup Review, Compliance Audits, Incident I"
