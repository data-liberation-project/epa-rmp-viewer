The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the facility:\nThe Linde Gas, LLC facility located in Billerica, Massachusetts complies with NFPA- 58 requirements for LP-Gas Storage and NFPA-55 requirements for the storage of chlorine cylinders.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal,state, and local laws. If an emergency accidental release were to occur involving either our propane or chlorine storage/handling systems, it is our policy to immediately notify the Billerica Fire Department, who would respond to the emergency.
