The PSM/RMPr includes all Program 3 Accident Prevention Program elements: Management System, Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor, Pre-Startup Review, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work Permit, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Emergency Response, and Compliance Audits. Equipment included under this covered process includes a 12,000-gallon stationary storage tank, piping, and valves.  Trained Helena personnel perform the transfer of anhydrous ammonia from the storage tank to the Fertilizer Blender (Covered Process 2).  Helena is responsible for training its personnel and managing the anhydrous ammonia in accordance with its PSM/RMPr.\n\n\n\nHelena receives anhydrous ammonia by a vendor that transports the anhydrous ammonia with a 9,600-gallon commercial tanker truck. The commercial tanker truck is temporarily parked on the Facility property while the anhydrous ammonia is transferred to the on-site storage tank. The transfer process from the commercial truck is performed by the commercial tanker truck operator (Vendor/Contractor). Helena does not own or operate the commercial tanker truck. The vendor is responsible to Helena for complying with relevant operation, maintenance, and training procedures and documentation. At a minimum, the vendor must (1) have in place and certify compliance with applicable and relevant DOT and OSHA regulations, (2) make available to Helena and EPA upon request any contractor-related documentation necessary to demonstrate compliance, and (3) certify that it has in place emergency shut-down procedures for ammonia unloading operations and that its OSHA and DOT programs comply with federal, state, and local regulatory requirements. Further, Helena will provide a copy of its Contingency Plan to its Vendor for review, and a copy of its RMPr Document upon request.\n\n",

At the stationary blender: water; mono-ammonium phosphate (MAP); 32% urea; ammonia nitrate (URAN); and ammonium sulfate is blended with anhydrous ammonia to make Suspension.  At the point that the anhydrous ammonia is blended with the other ingredients, the anhydrous ammonia becomes inert.  The Suspension is a liquid fertilizer product and is sold to the end user (e.g. farmer) for application.  Helena is responsible for training its personnel and managing the anhydrous ammonia in accordance with its PSM/RMPr.\n\n",

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nThis Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management Plan (RMP) Program document (PSM/RMPr) was prepared on behalf of Helena Chemical Company (Helena) pursuant to the requirements of the Clean Air Act ? 112(r) as codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) at 29 CFR ? 1910.119 and by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR ?68.  The OSHA PSM and EPA Subpart D RMP standards are applicable to operations in Orangeburg, SC.  At this Facility, Helena engages in the formulation, distribution and sale of chemicals (i.e. retail) to customers, most of who use Helena's products to support agricultural operations.  \n\n\n\nThis electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the Orangeburg Facility located approximately 5 miles southwest of Cameron, SC at 2471 Gramling Road, Orangeburg, SC 29115.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Orangeburg Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Orangeburg Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release (even though a release is unlikely) will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\n\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\n\n\nHelena is submitting this plan as a 5-Year update and has changed the RMP Program Level from 2 to 3.  All relevant sections for a Program 3 RMP Facility have been reviewed and/or updated.  The updates are reflected in both the EPA RMP Submit report and the Facility PSM/RMPr.\n\n\n\nFACILITY\n\n\n\nThe Orangeburg Facility is a retail agricultural fertilizer facility and operates two (2) covered processes that include (1) Covered Process 1: Storage and Handling, and (2) Covered Process 2: Fertilizer Blending.  Anhydrous ammonia is transported to the Facility via a commercial tanker truck (9,600 gallon) and then transferred to a 12,000-gallon stationary storage tank.  The c"

      "SummaryText": "ommercial tanker truck operator (Vendor/Contractor) performs this transfer operation.  \n\n\n\nHelena stores the anhydrous ammonia in its storage tanks and then transfers the anhydrous ammonia from the storage tank to the Fertilizer Blender to manufacture Suspension, a liquid fertilizer.  Helena performs this operation in accordance with its PSM/RMPr prevention program.  \n\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nWorst case and alternative case consequence analyses were completed for both covered processes. The worst case scenario release assumed that all the contents in the largest single storage tank were released.  The release was modeled as if the ammonia tank was punctured on the side at the ground level. The resulting release of ammonia was modeled as a ground level horizontal jet.\n\n\n\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario assumes a rupture of a 2-inch line caused by an impact from a vehicle or some other source on the liquid ammonia transfer line during a major loading or unloading operation.  Although this event is classified as an alternative scenario, even an accident of this type is unlikely to occur due to the safety equipment (excess flow devices, emergency shutoff valves, and check valves) and operating procedures that Helena uses to safeguard ammonia transfer operations.\n\n\n\nBoth the worst case and alternative scenario are overly conservative because even a 2-minute release is unlikely to occur since excess flow valves on the system should close immediately upon increased flow resulting from the ruptured transfer line.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Fertilizer Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Facility.  The Fertilizer Manager is assisted by other trained Helena staff, as directed.  The Fertilizer Manager is responsible for ensuring that Helena Staff are properly trained in the implementation of the Program 3 Accident Prevention Program elements: Management System, Employee Participation, Process Safety Informatio"

Helena has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency response agency and local fire department.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place, in the past five (5) years because of the ammonia operations at the Orangeburg Facility.\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\n\nThe Risk Management Plan implemented by Helena Chemical Company at the Orangeburg Facility complies with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r). The RMP will be updated as the Orangeburg Facility adds, deletes, or changes processes. The Emergency Response Program has been coordinated with the Orangeburg County LEPC and Fire Department.\n\n\n\nNOTE: Sections 4, 5, 6, and 8 of the standard RMP produced by EPA's RMP Submit Program are not applicable to the Orangeburg Facility.\n\n"
