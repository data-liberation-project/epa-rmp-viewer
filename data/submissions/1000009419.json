      "SummaryText": "The Linde Clear Lake facility, owned and operated by Linde North America, Inc. is located at 9502 Bayport Blvd,; Pasadena, TX  77507.  The management and employees of the Clear lake facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of Propylene.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the community and the environment.\n\nThe facilities primary operation is the manufacturing, purification and distribution of Carbon Monoxide.  A support process to this operation involves the use of propylene.  Propylene is use in a refrigeration system which cools part of the carbon monoxide production process.  Propylene is received from a Propylene pipeline supply and stored in three liquid vessels, a 1265 gallon Accumulator, a 1077 gallon economizer vessel and an 888 gallon heat exchanger.  The system contains a maximum of 17,700 pounds of propylene, if liquid full.  The propylene is then used in a closed refrigeration system.\n\nThe worst-case scenario, based on the EPAA?s definition for a flammable gas release, and alternative release, or more probable, scenarios were conducted using the EPAA?s RMP*Comp. (ver. 1.07) and can be reviewed by contacting the facility.  The population effected was calculated using A?Landview VA? which is based on the 2000 US Census.\n\nPassive and Active Mitigation systems are in place that would reduce the likelihood of a release or the release itself.  These include a fire deluge system, check valves, a preventive maintenance schedule, and safeties.\n\nThe facility has developed a comprehensive prevention program designed to prevent accidental releases of propylene.  The program utilizes state-of-the-art technology, sound engineering practices, administrative controls and active employee participation.  Employees serve on task groups and teams in developing and maintaining risk management p"

They are frequently consulted concerning the various aspects of the program and ways to continually improve the safety of the process.\nWritten process safety information was developed for the propylene system to enable managers, supervisors, and employees to identify and understand the process hazards.  This information was utilized to develop a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) which assists management and employees in making decisions for improving safety and reducing the consequences of releases of propylene.  The PHA focuses attention on equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions, (routine and nonroutine), and external factors that might impact the process by identifying potential failure points or failure modes in the process.  The new PHA was completed in April 2006 and will be updated at least every 5 years.\n\nDetailed Operating procedures exist which describe tasks to be performed, dates to be recorded, operating conditions to be maintained, samples to be collected, and safety and health precautions to be taken.  The procedures were reviewed and approved to ensure they are technically accurate by employees, managers and personnel with the technical expertise/knowledge of the process.  The operating procedures were review in March 2009 and are annually reviewed and revised as necessary to reflect current operations.\n\nEmployees are thoroughly trained, including maintenance and contractor employees.  The training meets and exceeds the requirements as outlined on OSHAA?s hazard communication standard 29 CFR 1910.1200.  Training includes operating procedures, safe work practices, emergency procedures (including alarms), special assignments, evacuation and emergency response; safety rules and procedures; routine and nonroutine work authorization; and other pertinent process safety information.  Each employee trained has a defined and documented program based on their job duties.  The training goals and objectives have been established and wr"

In addition, employees receive traditional classroom instruction including lectures, videos, programmed and on-the-job instruction.  Employees are encouraged to actively participate.  The employees are periodically evaluated to ensure they posses the necessary skills and knowledge via written tests, observation and/or oral interviews.  The training program was last reviewed on March 2009.\n\nA contractor screening process has been established and is designed to ensure that contractors hired or used can accomplish their assigned tasks without compromising the safety and health of employees and the public.  The screening program involves obtaining information on the contractorA?s safety performance, including injury and illness rates, and experience.  In addition, the contractorA?s safety performance, job skills, knowledge, and certifications (such as pressure vessel welders) are also verified.  The contractorA?s safety procedures were last review in March 2009.\n\nPreStart-up Safety Reviews (PSSR) are used for new or modified processes to improve the design and construction of the process from a reliability and quality stand point.  The PSSR recommendations are resolved before final installations are complete.  Other items completed prior to initial process startup include piping and instrument diagrams, operating procedures, and ensuring operating personnel are fully trained.  The initial Startup and normal operating procedures are fully evaluated as part of the PSSR to assure a safe transfer into the normal operating mode for meeting the process parameters.  The last PreStart-up Safety Review was conducted in 1995.\n\nAn on-going mechanical integrity program (maintenance) is used to ensure safe process operations.

This program was review in March 2009.\n\nHazardous work or nonroutine wok is controlled in a consistent manner.  The hazards indentified are communicated to those performing the work and to operating personnel whose work could affect the safety of the process.  The Celanese/Linde Hazardous work Program describes the steps that a supervisor, contractor representative or other authorized issuer needs to follow to manage hazardous work.  The program references and coordinates applicable lockout/tagout procedures, line breaking, hot work authorization, elevated work/fall protection, controlling access to covered process areas, and excavation procedures.  LindeA?s confined Space Entry program is a separate permitting system designed to manage its employees/contractors in performing this type of work.  This Program was review in March 2009 for both employees and contractors.\n\nManagement of Change (MOC) procedures have been developed for permanent changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment and facilities.  MOC procedures are designed to ensure that prior to any change occurring, the technically qualified personnel with knowledge and expertise of the chemical process, reviews and approve the proposed changes.  This would include both technical and mechanical changes.  Process changes include all modifications to equipment, procedures, raw materials and processing conditions other than A?replacement in kindA?.
