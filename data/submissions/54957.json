      "SummaryText": "Stationary Source Information\nThe Withlacoochee River WPCP is a NPDES permitted wastewater treatment facility.  The facility uses chlorine in the disinfection process before discharge of treated wastewater to the Withlacoochee River.  The facility is located in southwest Lowndes County, Georgia.\nFive Year Accident History\nThe facility has had one reportable accident in the past five years.  The accident involved a chlorine release with one employee injury.  There were no environmental or off site impacts.  The accident was fully investigated.  As a result of the investigation training and certification requirements have been changed, and response procedures are under review.\nWorst Case and Alternative Case Scenarios\nThe worst case distance to endpoint is 0.9 miles.  This distance goes beyond the property boundries of the facility.  The alterative case distance to endpoint is 0.1 miles.  This distance does not go beyond the property boundries of the facility.\nAccidental Release Prevention\nThe Withlacoochee River WPCP complies with generally accepted measures for this business type, and all applicable state and federal laws.  The facility has chlorine storage and feed systems within enclosed buildings.  Process area monitors are used to provide prompt notification of chlorine release.  Written operating procedures are designed to limit the chance of accidental release.\nEmergency Reponse Program\nThe Withlacoochee WPCP employees will not respond to a release of chlorine.  The facility has a written policy (with training) to inform the Valdosta Fire Department through the use of 911.  The Valdosta Fire Department has arranged to respond to facility emergencies involving chlorine.  The Valdosta Fire Department is equipped to hande a release to the magnitude in which chlorine is stored.\nPlanned Improvements\nThe facility has just replaced chlorination equipment and is not planning additional improvements at this time."
