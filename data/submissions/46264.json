This program will help prevent the occurrence of, or minimize the consequences of, catastrophic releases by stating our policies and procedures for the management of process hazards in start-up, operation, inspection, maintenance, and other matters addressed in the federal standard.\nOur program calls for maximum employee participation and includes all elements of the employee participation provisions\nof the standard.  We shall, at a minimum: 1) consult with employees or their representatives on the conduct and \ndevelopment of the process hazard review and other elements of the risk management plan, and 2) provide to our employees\nor their representatives access to the process hazard review and all other information required to be developed under that\nstandard.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Reponse Policies\nThe City of Waco belives that preventive maintenance is the key to minimizing the potential for accidental releases.  Standard Operating Procedures have been reviewed and revised to enable the employees to perform their work in a safe and efficient manner.  The City of Waco has taken steps to educate and inform the operators, supervisors, and maintenance crews in the appropriate response to an accidental release.  The training includes classroom training and operating procedures on the proper response to emergency situations.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Subatances\nThe Mount Carmel Water Treatment Plant uses chlorine and liquid ammonium sulfate for disinfection of the trated water.  THE MAXIMUM INVENTORY FOR CHLORINE IS INCREASED FROM 24,000 POUNDS TO 40,000 POUNDS AS A RESULT OF REHABILITATION OF THE FACILITIES RESULTING IN GREATER WATER TREATMENT CAPACITY.  The chlorine is stored in a building (passive mitigation) with a one-ton capacity scrubber.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nThe City of Waco has imp"

This program includes: safety information, hazard reviews, operating and maintenance procedure, training, compliance audits, incident investigations, and emergency response procedures.\n\nFive-year Accident History\nIn the past five years, there have not been any accidental releases that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant damage either on-site or off-site.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nThe City of Waco has implemented a Risk Management Plan that meets or exceeds the requirements of 40 CFR 68.  It is Waco's philosophy to continually improve the safe working conditions of its employees to minimize accidents and reduce the potential for either an on-site or off-site release.  The City of Waco incorporates the RMP elements into other areas of the process not covered under 40 CFR 68 to improve the overall safety of the syste.  A one-ton capacity scrubber is installed at the Mount Carmel Water Treatment Plant as part of those improvements.\n\nTHE PURPOSE OF THIS SUBMISSION IS TO UPDATE ON-SITE STORAGE CAPACITIES AND UPDATE PROCESS INFORMATION."
