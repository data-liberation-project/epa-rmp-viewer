      "SummaryText": "EPA RMP Executive Summary\n\n\n\nEndicott is located approximately 2.5 miles from Alaska's northern coast in the Beaufort Sea.  A three-mile man-made gravel causeway connects Endicott's two man-made gravel islands.  The 45-acre Main Production Island (MPI) was constructed as a self-contained facility and can house up to 150 employees and contractors.  The MPI has its own operating and processing, living facilities, life support systems, medical clinic, firefighting and spill response equipment.  An operating and support crew of about 50 employees and contractors work on the MPI at any one time.\n\n\n\nPipelines are supported above ground on steel support structures.  Oil and gas liquids are transported from production wells on the MPI where oil, water and gas are separated.  Sales oil is then shipped down a 26-mile pipeline where it enters the Trans-Alaska Pipeline.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \n\n\n\nThe Endicott Emergency Action Plan (EAP) covers responses for situations in which there is probable loss of life, extensive injuries, environmental damage, or significant business interruption to normal operations.  The emergency procedures comply with OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.38 (Emergency Action Plans), 29 CFR 1910.120 (HAZWOPER) and apply to all contractors and visitors.  This plan includes information on alarms, evacuation plans, safe briefing areas, containment, control, cleanup and emergency notification procedures. \n\n\n\nAs described in the EAP facility employees undergo a variety of training to prepare for emergency situation.  These include evacuation drills, total island evacuation drills, Endicott Response Team joint training exercises, rescue training, personal protective equipment training, and Incident Command System training.\n\n\n\nRegulated Substance\n\n\n\nPropane (CAS No. 74-98-6), which Endicott uses in their closed loop Propane Refrigeration System, is on the list of regulated flammable substances (40 CFR ?68.130).  Liquid propane"

      "SummaryText": " is purchased commercially, trucked to Endicott and added to the Propane Surge Drum when required.  The greatest amount of propane held in a single vessel is 4,800 gallons in the Propane Surge Drum.  This is well below the vessel's design capacity (6,664 gallons) and over 500 gallons below 80% maximum capacity.  This vessel is located outside of Module 303 in the NW corner.  The worst case release scenario analyzed for propane identified that no public receptors (e.g., offsite residences, institutions, industrial, commercial, etc.) would be impacted.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program - Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe Endicott facility utilizes various detection alarm systems designed to warn of abnormal conditions that could result in injury to personnel, property damage, or damage to the environment.  An amber light visual alarm signals a problem with the propane system.  These detection systems are tested on a set maintenance schedule to assure their operation. \n\n\n\nA Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) of the Propane Refrigeration System at the facility is conducted every 5-years.  When changes to the propane system are made, a Management of Change (MOC) process is followed.  This process is designed to identify potential hazards being introduced by a change, and, to allow all necessary personnel to be informed of and trained on the change.  Process and management system improvements are implemented based on PHAs, periodic audits, and MOC findings.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nEndicott Island's propane system has not had a reportable accident or incident with offsite consequences in the previous 5 years or since Hilcorp has owned/operated the facility.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nEndicott has its own professionally-trained fire department which responds and serves as the local fire department.  There is no other agency/jurisdiction providing emergency response at Endicott.  In the event additional emergency response support was required mutual a"

      "SummaryText": "id would be provided by fire departments from other nearby North-Slope Alaska oil fields.  Mutual aid drills are conducted annually.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the volunteers in the fire department, Endicott trains employees for other spill response roles including Operation Level First Responders and Specialized Employees (Operators).\n\n\n\nOperations Level First Responders are trained to respond to an emergency in a defensive manner without actually trying to stop the release.  Their function is to contain the release from a safe distance, keep it from spreading, and prevent exposures.\n\n\n\nSpecialized Employees (Operators) are personnel who are qualified to operate the facility/well pads during routine day-to-day activities.  Their duties are to identify the nature, location and scope of the emergency as well as performing source control.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety at the Swanson River Facility include using PHA recommendations to improve the integrity of the process as well as selection of a new management of change tool to support improvement of the management of change system.  \n\n"
