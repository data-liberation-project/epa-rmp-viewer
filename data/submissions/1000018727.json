During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\nSimonian Fruit has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process.  These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release.  The results of the analyses are reported in the body of the program. \n\n1.3.2\tANHYDROUS AMMONIA\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Simonian Fruit facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year.  It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner.  Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia.  In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n1.4\tFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nSimonian Fruit has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n1.5\tEMERGENCY ACTION AN"

As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary.  To accomplish this, Simonian Fruit has elected to use PSMWriter&copy;, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc.  This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n1.1\tSIMONIAN FRUIT, RISK & PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM \nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Simonian Fruit has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program.  This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following process which has the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\nAmmonia Refrigeration\tAnhydrous Ammonia\t16,000 lb\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety.  The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals.  Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\nSimonian Fruit has an exemplary safety record, one that we are quite proud of.  Our company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.  We have: \n1.\tPrepared a unified program based on the PSM plan to meet CalARP and RMP obligations as well\n2"

Our facility has one ammonia system which provides refrigerating capacity to two cold storage rooms equipped with forced air cooling and five cold storage rooms for palleted product.\nThe systems operate as follows: high pressure liquid from our main receiver is piped to each cold room, where it passes through an expansion valve into low temperature & pressure accumulator vessels.  From the accumulators, cold liquid ammonia is circulated through evaporator coils.  As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature & pressure gas which is returned to the accumulator vessel.  The ammonia vapor is returned from the accumulator vessels through a suction return line to our engine room main suction accumulator.  From there it is piped to the reciprocating compressors.  The high pressure discharge from the compressor is sent to the water cooled condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquefied and returned to our high pressure receiver. \n\nThe facility was built by professional refrigeration engineers in accordance with standard design, and installation of ammonia mechanical refrigerating systems.  It was also built in compliance with the Uniform Mechanical Code and Uniform Building Code applicable at the time of construction. The system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and safety relief valves which vent ammonia gas to the atmosphere i"
