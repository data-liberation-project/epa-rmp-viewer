The Facility Policy:  The owners, management, and employees of Akron Services, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammoniaby utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training of all persons that work with the material.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire dept and the local emerency planning committee so that they can plan for any response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility information:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop nutrient.  Product may also be loaded into semi trailers for sale and distribution to other local dealers.  \n\n3. Worst case/alternative-case scenarios are developed at this facility but are withheld from the executive summary as security-sensitive information.  The worst case scenario includes the risk that both storage tanks would be lost since they are piped together and it would be unlikly one could be shut off if the other had a significant release.\n\n4.  The accidental release program:  The facility complies with the Rules and Regulations relating to The Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions, Equipment, Containers and Storage Facilities.  These regulations administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture are consistent with ANSI K61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n5. The Five-year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site; nor to our knowledge, have any accidental releases resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6.
