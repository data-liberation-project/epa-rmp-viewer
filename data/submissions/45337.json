These include ?Dawn,? ?Ivory,? and ?Joy,? which might be found in a home kitchen.  The Kansas City Kansas P&G plant has been in continuous operation since 1905, and it is the first P&G plant opened outside of Cincinnati, Ohio, our corporate headquarters.\n\nIn Kansas City and elsewhere, P&G has a long-standing commitment to a safe work environment for employees and minimizing the impact of our operations on the environment.  Our safety and environmental programs are managed by highly skilled employees, and actively supported by the participation of all employees and all management, and a strong corporate staff.  The goal of both the safety and environmental programs is prevention.  Procter & Gamble believes in a zero defect work environment where issues are identified and fixed as a part of daily work.  This zero defect mentality leads to continuously improving operations and zero incidents that could harm people or the environment.  Although P&G?s safety record is already among the best in the business, we are constantly striving for improvement.\n\nThe Kansas City plant has an excellent history of safe operations. Incident and ?near miss? reporting is encouraged and rewarded.  Any incidents or near misses on site are followed by a thorough incident investigation and follow-up action steps are taken to prevent recurrence.  Routine inspection as well as detailed analysis using non-destructive test equipment such as boriscopes, ultrasonic thickness instruments, dye penetrant tests, etc. are routinely used to ensure the equipment is at optimal condition at all times.\n\n\nChemicals Used in Kansas City Subject to EPA Report\nP&G?s Kansas City Soap Plant uses three chemicals that are subject to reporting under this filing to the U.S. Environmental Protection Age"

      "SummaryText": "ncy (EPA).  All are necessary materials used to manufacture soaps and detergents.\n\nDimethylamine is delivered by dedicated rail cars and is unloaded into three tanks.  These tanks are above ground and surrounded by a dike to contain any spills around the tanks or the unloading area.  These tanks are regularly inspected, inside and out.  The walls of the metal tanks are routinely tested for integrity.  The tank and unloading areas are also protected by a water deluge system that discharges water automatically if it senses heat.  The water system can also be activated manually at the site or from a remote location in the event of an incident.  Fire fighting nozzles also are located around the tanks and can deliver high volumes of water into the storage area.  Employees monitor the area via video cameras.  The total volume of all three tanks is always less than 2/3 of the maximum capacity to allow room to transfer material out of one tank to the other two in the event of a problem with one tank.  Because of the flammable nature of dimethylamine, all equipment in the area is electrically classified for use in an explosive environment and grounded against static discharge.  The dimethylamine used to manufacture detergents is completely consumed in chemical reactions during the process.\n\nBromine comes to the Kansas City plant in dedicated trucks and is unloaded into a single tank.  The tank is located in an enclosed, covered spill-containment area that is below grade.  The unloading area also is protected against spills.  This tank is externally inspected every year and internally inspected every two years.  The tank is protected by a foam vapor suppression system, and is monitored by video cameras.  When the tank is emptied for maintenance, any vapors remaining are collected in a mist vacuum and scrubber system that neutralizes any remaining bromine.  Bromine is used as a catalyst during the making of detergents.  It is neutralized and sent back to the supplier as sodium"

      "SummaryText": " bromide for recycling.\n\nEpichlorohydrin is delivered to our plant in dedicated rail cars and is unloaded into two tanks.  Dikes surround the unloading and tank storage areas, and both locations are grounded.  Neither tank is allowed to be more than half full, which allows the transfer of the contents from one to the other during maintenance or an emergency.  Each tank is inspected externally every year and the integrity of the metal walls is routinely examined.  Both the storage and unloading areas are protected by a foaming deluge system that employees can activate remotely.  Fire fighting monitor nozzles are located around the tanks, as are remote video cameras.  Epichlorohydrin is completely consumed in the manufacturing of detergent.\n\nPrior to July 2001, the site had a fourth chemical subject to RMP requirements, sulfur trioxide.  The surfactant making process that used sulfur trioxide was replaced with a more modern system that eliminated the need to keep that hazardous material at this facility.  In July 2001 the sulfur trioxide system was decommissioned.  \n\nAccident History\nIn the past 5 years there have been three incidents involving RMP regulated chemicals.  \nIn June, 2001, there were two separate releases of dimethylamine to the atmosphere from our process due to over pressurization, the largest of which was 6,600 lbs.  Several nearby residents and emergency responders reported acute respiratory distress and sought medical treatment due to exposure to dimethylamine.  Because of the similarity of the two incidents, the process was shutdown while an extensive process hazard analysis review was conducted by expert resources.  Many improvements to the process were initiated including additional interlocks, safety instrumented control devices and a pressure relief surge system connected to an emergency flare that would consume any dimethylamine released in an emergency.  Many procedural changes were made to prevent pressure build-ups and training conducted for"

      "SummaryText": " all personnel associated with that process.  Since this event there have been no further incidents involving dimethylamine.\n\nThe third RMP-chemical incident occurred on October 23, 2001.  Approximately 43 lbs of bromine was released when a pinhole leak developed in an instrument tube.  A construction worker working near the tank was injured. The root cause analysis determined that proper piping specifications had not been followed and a material not compatible with bromine was allowed to come in contact with the substance under certain conditions.  Many changes were made to procedures that led to the introduction of bromine into the failed pipe, new isolation equipment was installed to prevent bromine from contacting incompatible materials, and all department personnel were trained in the new procedures.  Since this accident no other bromine incidents have occurred at this facility.\n\n\nHow We Prevent Releases\nThe worst case scenarios studied for the off-site consequence analyses required by this risk management program are unlikely to happen because they assume there will be no effective safety systems or emergency response.  \n\nProcter & Gamble has conducted a detailed hazard study of each of the three RMP chemicals.  Company engineers and operators identified potential points from which a chemical may be spilled or leaked during the process.  We have used that analysis to design better systems, train operators and maintenance employees and to develop accident prevention and response systems.  \n\nAs described above, each chemical is contained within a tank and piping system appropriate for that service.  Well-trained operators monitor the conditions 24 hours per day, 7 days a week via inspection rounds, video cameras, temperature and pressure gauges, and other instruments.  Volumes in the tanks also are monitored.  Tanks are not refilled unless the arriving truck or rail car can be emptied completely.  This helps prevent overflows and spills.  Control systems of the "

      "SummaryText": "hazardous processes are monitored and controlled by safety instrumented systems designed to initiate a controlled shut-down if operating parameters go beyond predetermined safe operating ranges.\n\nAs called for in the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management system, plant operating systems are repeatedly assessed and improved.  Process technicians, engineers and the site safety teams work together to bring about these improvements.  Some products of this improvement process are the mist vacuum neutralization system and triple redundant safety instrumented system controls.  \n\nIn the event of an incident, the Kansas City plant has systems to respond quickly.  Processes can be shut down on an emergency basis.  Spills or leaks can be noted immediately and reported to control room operators. The plant has a direct line to the Kansas City, Kansas Fire Department for quick reporting of releases.  The fire and police departments have developed procedures to communicate instructions to the public in the event that action is needed.  These communications can be carried out either by radio or TV broadcast or through direct communications in the streets.\n\nWe have held joint response drills with the Kansas City, Kansas fire department and Haz Mat Team annually for over 15 years.  These allow training of new people and polishing the skills of experienced responders.  The emergency response teams tour our facility regularly so they are familiar with the location of critical equipment.  These regular activities help bring about excellent communications between Procter & Gamble and local emergency responders.\n\nAll Procter & Gamble employees who work in the vicinity of these three chemicals have been thoroughly trained in the company?s standard operating procedures for both routine and non-routine operations.  These workers participate in the annual drills with local emergency preparedness officials as well as conducting table-top exercises within"
