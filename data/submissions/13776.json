      "SummaryText": "At the John B. Rains Filter Plant, various procedures, equipment, and alarm systems have been installed in order to minimize risks to the community presented by the chlorine used in the water purification process.  A minimal amount of the chemical is stored, a vacuum type of feeding system is in use in order to minimize leaks, alarms are used to signal a problem, employees are trained and knowledgeable in the proper maintenance and operation procedures, and the Fort Payne Fire Department's Hazardous Materials equipment and personnel are readily available.  The highest risk presented to the community would be an accidental chlorine release resulting from a fire.  In order to minimize this risk, the Waterworks Board of the City of Fort Payne is considering: 1) installing a sodium hypochlorite system to replace the chlorine system, 2) the construction of a fire wall, or 3) construction of a separate building to house the ton cylinders of chlorine.  It is projected that a solution will be chosen and implemented by March, 2000.  This facility is included in the community emergency response plan."
