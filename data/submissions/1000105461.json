This has improved Barrel Ten's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Barrel Ten's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\nBarrel Ten has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. management of change, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Barrel Ten has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\nFor the future, Barrel Ten now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \u0093living document\u0094. It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Barrel Ten employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Barrel Ten will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety."
