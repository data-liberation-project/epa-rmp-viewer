Rock Port,Missouri  64482\nContact:  Wally Riebesell\nPhone: (660) 744-5325\n\n     1.     Facility Policy.\n          The owners, management and employees of Mo Valley Ag are committed to the prevention\n     of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the\n     facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Atchison Co. LEPC, and/or other\n     authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n\n     2.     Facility Information.\n          The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous\n     ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production.\n     The maximum quantity stored would be 123,360 pounds in storage tanks and nurse tanks.\n\n     \n     3.     Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n          a.     The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank\n     released as gas over a period of 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 51,000\n     pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by\n     design standards. The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or\n     ppm) is 1.5 miles.\n\n          b.     The alternate release scenario, a 1-inch transfer hose is used as an alternate release\n     scenario followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow\n     shut-down valve/valves intervenes or remote manual shut-off is closed and stops the flow of\n     ammonia. The maximum quantity released would be 3,000 pounds. The distance to the end point\n     (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .22 miles.\n\n     4.     Accidental Release Prevention Program\n          The facility is in compliance with the provisions of \"Safety Requirements"

The OSHA standard\n     is referenced in this RMP Registration Form, see section 8.3 (b).\n\n     5.     Five-Year Accident History.\n          There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have\n     caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge,\n     has there been any accidental releases resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, property\n     damage, or environmental damage.\n\n     6.     Emergency Action Plan.\n          This facility has:\n               a.     A written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n               b.     Provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-\n                       to-know information as required under SARA title III (EPCRA);\n\n     7.     Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n          Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed\n     to assess the conditions of the facility. There are no additional specific safety recommendations\n     regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
