The facility has an Emergency Response Team that is trained to First Responder Operations Level on an annual basis.  All Emergency Response Team members are fit tested and respiratory trained annually.   \n\n In addition,  the facility will contact the local Fire Department regarding participation in the evacuation drills.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nDuring the development of the Process Safety Management program at this facility, the initial Process Hazard Analysis study (7/03) generated mitigation measures that would improve safety at the Mobile Refrigerated Services facility located at 1000 Alabama State Docks, Mobile Alabama 36602.  These action items have been addressed. This is a newly built facility."
