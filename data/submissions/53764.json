Acetylene, as part of a filling and distribution process\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Policy\nPraxair is dedicated to being the best performing industrial gas company in all aspects of our business, including safety, health, and environmental affairs. Our safety, health, and environmental policy call for a commitment to protecting the health and safety of our employees, neighbors, and the surrounding environment. This policy is the basis for engineering and construction programs that produce equipment and process systems that minimize the possibility of accidental chemical releases and operational safety programs that ensure safe operation of our facilities. Praxair is committed to the continuous improvement of these programs.\n\nPraxair is an active member of the American Chemistry Council and subscribes to the council?s program of Responsible Care? Employee Health and Safety Code of Management Practices.\n\n\nPrevention Program\nIn accordance with OSHA?s Process Safety Management standard and EPA?s Risk Management Program rule, the Cahokia facility has a comprehensive accident prevention program in place. This program is built around process safety concepts such as:\n- Technical documentation of Process Safety Information, describing the physical properties of the hazardous substances, the safety systems in place to control these substances, and the critical operating parameters of the associated equipment and systems.\n- Procedures and programs to develop, maintain, and control key program elements such as process operations, equipment mechanical integrity, em"

Following is a description of some of these safety features.\n\nThe acetylene filling area is equipped with a deluge system which can be operated manually or passively. The facility also employs plant emergency trip stations so that in the event of an emergency all plant processes will be halted.\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\nThe Cahokia facility covered chemical process is newly installed.  There have been no covered process releases that resulted in an EPA RMP recordable accident.\n\n\nEmergency Response Programs\nPraxair has an emergency response program in place to minimize the effects of accidental release of regulated substances on employees, the public, and the environment. The Cahokia location will be a ?non-responding facility? as defined in section 8.1 of the CEPPO General Guidance for Risk Management Programs (July 1998), i.e. Praxair employees will respond to minor incidents.\n\nFor other than minor incidents Praxair has in place an emergency response plan in coordination with the St. Claire County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Cahokia Fire department. Each agency has a listing of the hazardous"

We look to constantly improve the safety of our processes using recommendations developed through the prevention program and a program soliciting safety suggestions from our employees.\n\nThere are currently no major projects for safety improvement that have reached the planning stage."
