The facility also employs plant emergency trip stations so that in the event of an emergency all plant processes will be halted.\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\nThe Cahokia facility covered chemical process is newly installed.  There have been no covered process releases that resulted in an EPA RMP recordable accident.\n\n\nEmergency Response Programs\nPraxair has an emergency response program in place to minimize the effects of accidental release of regulated substances on employees, the public, and the environment.
