All of these mechanisms are in place to prevent an accidental release.\n\nThe five-year accident history:\n\nThere were no incidents at the facility in the past five years that meet the definition of the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) reporting requirements.\n\n\nThe emergency response program:\n\nLubrizol maintains an Emergency Response Plan (ERP) at its facility located at 155 Freedom Rd., Painesville, Ohio 44077. There is an emergency response organization (ERO) in place twenty-four hours a day consisting of an incident commander and trained emergency responders. There are also certified hazardous material technicians, EMT's, rescue squad and paramedics on staff. The ERP is documented within Lubrizol Painesville's Intranet web site and is accessible to all Lubrizol-Painesville employees. The Plan includes procedures for the notification of local fire authorities and the local emergency planning committee (LEPC). The Lake County Emergency Management Agency maintains a public notification and alert system capable of notifying the surrounding community as needed. There is continuous training of LubrizolA?s ERO personnel on and off site and in conjunction with the local emergency responders. The ERP is updated as changes are needed.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nAn environmental, health and safety corrective action system exists to address all odors, spills, injuries and near misses at the facility. This system documents the incident and includes information on the root cause & mitigation measures and the individual responsible for implementing the corrective actions. A system is in place to review progress towards completion of the corrective actions and to check the effectiveness of these actions.\n\nSafety meet"

      "SummaryText": "ings and training are held on a regular basis to review these incidents to update employees on topics that will improve the overall environmental, health and safety of our facility and surrounding community.     \n                                                                                          All the RMP covered processes undergo a process hazard analysis on a routine basis to identify any potential hazards. If there are recommendation actions from these analyses, projects are initiated to address the recommendations as part of the facilityA?s capital improvement process.  Past projects related to RMP regulated processes have included upgrades to fire suppressant systems, level transmitters on vessels, replacement of liquid and vent piping, installation of safety barricades surrounding storage vessels, replacement of metering devices on material feed lines and installation of additional emergency equipment.\n\nThese are some examples of Lubrizol's philosophy of responsibly maintaining a safe environment for its employees and the surrounding community.\n"
