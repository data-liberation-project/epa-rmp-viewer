      "SummaryText": "DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nSpringfield Pipeline LLC owns and operates the Tyler County Gas Plant located in Tyler County Texas, U.S.A.  The plant receives natural gas from various oil and gas production facilities through the field.  The acid gas components (carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide) are removed from the gas using an amine unit.  The sweetened gas is then dried using a glycol dehydrator.  The dried gas is then routed to a JT unit.  In the JT unit the gas is expanded adiabatically from a higher pressure to a lower pressure and causes natural gas liquids (NGL) to separate from the gas stream.  The NGLs are routed to pressurized storage tanks located on site and eventually hauled by truck for sales.  Both hydrogen sulfide and NGL are regulated substances.  NGL, a mixture of regulated flammable substances, is present in an amount greater than the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.  The plant does not handle hydrogen sulfide in an amount greater than the threshold quantity of  10,000 lbs.\n\nOFFISTE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\nDue to security concerns, Springfield has elected not to include details of the offsite consequence analysis results in this Executive Summary.  This information can be made available to EPA, State and local emergency personnel upon request.\n\nThe covered process qualifies as Program 3 RMP because the worst case scenario reaches off-site receptors.  The Tyler County Gas Plant has not had an accident in the past five years.  The plant was initially brought on-line in March of 2004.  The regulated substance was not present on-site until the summer of 2005.  The plant has an active and up-to-date emergency response plan and process safety management program.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\nThe Tyler County Gas Plant has a commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering saf"

Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, the Emergency Response Plan will be initiated and trained gas plant personnel will respond to control and contain the release as well as notify local emergency response agencies for assistance.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant. The processes at the Tyler County Gas Plant are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA?s) risk management program (RMP) regulation and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration?s (OSHA?s) process safety management (PSM) standard.  The following summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\nThe Tyler County Gas Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and initiating Management of Change to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the PSM program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the gas plant.   \n\nProcess Safety Information\nThe Tyler County Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the gas plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n\nCh"

For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) on the Pipe & Instrument Diagrams (P&ID) along with the normal operating conditions.  The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated and manual shutdown systems).\n\nThe gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\nThe Tyler County Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Tyler County Gas Plant uses the DP10 technique to perform these evaluations.  This comprehensive method was developed by the MMS for offshore operations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigat"

Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. To help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\nThe plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures are used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. \n\nIn addition, the plant maintains a procedure that provides guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit deviations for specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Tyler County Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.

After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\nThe Tyler County Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, the Tyler County Gas Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to gas plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team?s findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs. \n\nCompliance Audits\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Tyler County Gas Plant periodically conducts an internal audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. Both on-site and corporate personnel participate as audit team members.
