The management and employees of Gateway FS, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the NASHVILLE Fire Department, Washington County Local Emergency Planning Committee or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2. The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at the facility, which is located at 9993 ST. RT.127 NORTHis the storage and distribution of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The storage and handling system consists of 2-30,000 gallon storage tanks, loading risers, associated plumbing and nurse tanks.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\n\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 713,000 pounds, this includes the amount of anhydrous ammonia that could be stored in nurse tanks.\n\n\n\n3. This facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K6-11\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health "

Compliance with these regulations and on-going training of our employees make up accident release prevention program.\n\n\n\n4. Five year accident History\n\n\n\nThe following is a list of accidental releases in the past 5 years that have occurred at the facility:\n\nWe had accidental release of less than 100 pounds of anhydrous ammonia on 5/31/2005. One employee was hospitalized. \n\n\n\n5. The emergency response program.\n\n\n\nThe facility has:\n\n-a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n-provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving anhydrous ammonia, it is our policy to notify the NASHVILLE Fire Department and WASHINGTON County LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency. Our emergency action plans have been coordinated with both the fire department and LEPC.\n\n\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n\n\nSafety Improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. This facility is now subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management regulations, 29 CFR 1910.119, and all necessary modifications to equipment, procedures, recordkeeping and training will be made. This facility will then re-certify as an EPA RMP Program-3 facility by the required regulatory deadline.\n\n"
