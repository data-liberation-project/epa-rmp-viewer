      "SummaryText": "The Stones River Water Treatment facility is located at 5528 Sam Jared Road in Murfreesboro, Tennessee.  The facility stores and uses chlorine that is found in Appendix A of 1910.119, which presents a potential for a catastrophic event at or above the threshold quantity.\n\nThe members of our team are Alan Cranford, Curtis Robertson, Mike Johnson, Nelson Vickers, Robert Hughes and Todd Adams.\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\nThe safety attributes are listed on the MSDS for chlorine that is part of our Process Safety Management Plan. We use the booklet titled Chlorine Safe Handling by Van Water & Rogers Inc. as a procedure guide and for training of operators. We also use the film \"Chlorine: Safe Handling Program\" for operator training. We have monthly safety meetings at the Stones River Water Plant. At least one safety meeting per year is devoted to chlorine. The chlorine room is inspected daily and all alarms systems are tested to assure that they are in working order. If any part of the system fails to respond properly the person inspecting the system reports the problem to his immediate supervisor. The Superintendent will then decide what action is needed to correct the problem and who should perform the work.\n\nWe use Ultralite IIa air mask, model FHR, it is a pressure demand system.  We use the instructions for use and maintenance that came with the unit for proper use and training purposes. The air masks are for evacuation only.\n\nThe maximum amount of chlorine on hand at the Stones River Water Plant is 32,000 pounds. We have an emergency chlorine gas scrubber, model 812-4 (24) with the capacity to neutralize one ton of chlorine. We have emergency shut-off, battery powered halogen valves on the chlorine cylinders that are in use or in the stand-by position. Our chlorine detectors activate these valves if we should have a leak or can be manually activated.\n\nChlorine is fed from two chlorine cylinders at a time, this is the minimum number of chlorine cylinders we can us"

      "SummaryText": "e and not have a problem with lines freezing up. Chlorine is fed through a manifold to six Wallace & Tiernan 2000 pounds per day vacuum chlorine feeders. Normally there are five chlorinators in service, with one in the stand-by mode. The chlorine is pulled through the chlorine feeder by vacuum generated by an injector and metered through the chlorinator.\n\nAt the injector, water is added to the chlorine making a chlorine solution of less than 0.1 % chlorine. From the injectors the chlorine solution is piped through three-inch lines to the feed points at the water plant. Four of the chlorinated water lines go to the softening basins where it is added to disinfect the water. Two three-inch lines go to the filter effluent line under the filters. One of these lines is used to post chlorinate the filtered water.\n\nChlorine is an oxidizing agent, therefore it reacts with inorganic and organic matter found in water. This reaction with organic and inorganic matter causes the formation of many different compounds. All the chemical reactions that take place are not known at the present time. Enough chlorine is feed into the water to satisfy the chlorine demand of the water plus have free chlorine residual remaining in the water to assure that all of our distribution system has a minimum of 0.2 mg/I."
