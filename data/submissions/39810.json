(We submitted our 1999 Risk \nManagement Plan under the name \"GE Plastics\". However, at the end of 2003, General Electric Company \nchanged the name \"GE Plastics\" to \"GE Advanced Materials, Plastics\".) We have developed comprehensive \nsystems and programs to assure the safety of our employees and the surrounding community. We operate \nin compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management rule, a \nrigorous set of standards that govern our daily process safety control methods and behaviors.\nThese guidelines have been adopted to satisfy, in part, the stated policy of GE to safely manage our site \noperations and to take care of the people who work here and the community around us. We recognize that \nany less commitment would weaken our ability to provide jobs for our employees and to be a part of the \neconomy of Central Alabama.\n\nThis Risk "

      "SummaryText": "Management Plan is a continuation of that effort. It shows solid integration of our plant emergency \nresponse resources and communication channels with those of the community.\n\nOur intensive ongoing internal reviews and OSHA's external audit process continue to validate the strengths \nof the programs we have in place. We have been certified by OSHA under its Voluntary Protection Program \n(VPP) as a \"STAR\" site, the highest certification OSHA gives.\n\nWe believe it is important for all interested parties to have access to information that can help them better \nunderstand our business and our facility. If you have any questions about this document, or any other aspect \nof our company or our plant, please contact our Community Relations Representative at (334) 832-5650.\n\n0.2 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nOur company is committed to operating safe and environmentally sound chemical and plastics production \nfacilities everywhere we do business. Protection of our environment, our neighbors and our employees is the \nhighest priority. This ongoing commitment to worker and public safety is demonstrated through resources \ninvested for safe design, operation, and maintenance of our facilities.\n\nThe Burkville facility uses in its manufacturing processes some raw materials that are classified as toxic by \nthe EPA. While we are committed to 100% compliance with governing laws, regulations, and engineering \nstandards, as well as systematic assessments to manage and maintain safe operation with these materials, \nwe routinely go far beyond the regulatory requirements. Our operating practices and procedures provide for \nnumerous controls that are implemented to prevent an accidental release of a chemical.\n \nIn the event of a major release, our trained on-site emergency response organization would be activated. \nThis organization includes a fire brigade as well as medical and chemical emergency response teams \nstaffed with GE employees who have trained "

Many of these employees \nserve in their community fire and emergency response organizations, devoting much of their personal time \nto additional drills, training and community response.\n\nThe Burkville facility has contracted the Alabama Fire College to provide the Emergency Response training \nfor our Tactical Response Team (TRT) members. Alabama Fire College instructors have conducted training \nfor our facility in all areas of chemical emergencies, industrial fire fighting and emergency management. A \nreview of our emergency response program was made as part of the OSHA STAR review in 1998 and was \nfound to fully meet all the OSHA emergency response requirements.\n\n0.3 DESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe Burkville plant is located about 15 miles west of Montgomery, AL. The 348 members of the Burkville \nTeam manufacture engineered plastics, marketed under the trademarked name LEXAN. Our products are \nused in industries including automotive, electronic, computer, compact disc and large appliances.\n\nWorkplace safety and environmental protection are part of the GE culture and record. Of the initial $325 \nmillion investment in the plant by General Electric Company, nearly 25% went to safety and environmental \nsystems. General Electric Company has now invested some $1 billion in the plant for expansion, capital \nimprovement, safety and environmental protection.\n\nDemonstration of this safety and environmental commitment is reflected not only in the VPP Star \ndesignation but also in many examples including: 1.) reduction of emissions by 60% while increasing \nproduction by more than fivefold; 2.) Seventeen years of operating without exceeding the plant's water \npermits [Twice the plant has received the Award of Excellence for industrial wastewater treatment in \nAlabama]; and 3.) Recognition in 1997 and 1998 by the Chlorine Institute for safety performance in the Brine \nRecovery Unit.\n\nCompleted in 1987, the pl"

The Wildlife and \nLand Management Committee, an employee volunteer group, pursues programs, including reforestation, \npond management and bluebird trails.\n\nThe Burkville, AL plant uses two chemicals that are regulated under the EPA's Risk Management Program \n(RMP) rule. These are chlorine and phosgene, and both are on the RMP list of regulated toxic substances. \nChlorine and phosgene are raw materials used to manufacture our products.\n\n0.4 GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION / CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nGE has implemented a comprehensive program to prevent accidental releases of highly hazardous \nchemicals known as Process Safety Management (or PSM). PSM is an integral part of working safely at GE \nfacilities. PSM ensures that proper safety information is in place; operating procedures are followed; \nchemical hazards are identified; employees and contractors are trained; and critical equipment is properly \ninspected and maintained. PSM satisfies the accidental release prevention program requirements of the \nRMP. Some of the many, specific safety features to prevent a chemical accident include:\n\n-Computer-controlled safety systems on the phosgene and chlorine manufacturing processes to ensure that \nany deviations from the intended operating conditions are immediately identified and corrected; \n\n-Safety procedures that reduce the potential for human error which could lead to a release - including annual \ntraining;\n\n-State-of-the-art building enclosures around chlorine and phosgene equipment to contain a leak and prevent \nthe leak from reaching the atmosphere; \n\n-Dedicated emergency safety equipment that cleans or \"scrubs\" chlorine or phosgene gas in the event of an \nemergency release from the manufacturing process;\n\n-Dedicated control equipment that continuously cleans or \"scrubs\" chlo"
