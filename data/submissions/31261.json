      "SummaryText": "Teepak, LLC is a leading manufacturer of cellulose casing products for the meat industry.  Our commitment to the responsible operation of our facilities is formulated in our corporate \"Environmental, Health and Safety Policy\".  We are committed to minimize the impact that our products, processes, and operations might have on our employees, our neighbors, and the environment.\nThe regulated substance, carbon disulfide, is closely monitored from its entry into the plantsite, through storage, and introduction into the production process.  We believe that the possibility of the worst case scenario occurring is extremely unlikely, but steps have been taken to minimize the impact of such an event.  Engineering controls have been implemented so that no effects from the more likely alternative scenario should be felt outside of the plantsite.\nDuring the last ten years there have been no accidental releases that have resulted in deaths, injuries, property damage, or environmental damage either on site or offsite.  \nIn the unlikely event of a release of carbon disulfide our Fire Brigade personnel have been trained in initial emergency response, and would direct the situation until the Vermilion County HAZMAT team arrives.  Teepak maintains close ties with the Danville/Vermilion County Emergency Management Agency, the Danville Fire Department, and its Safety Manager sits on the local LEPC.\nWe continually evaluate our systems with the goal of assuring their reliability and effectiveness.  We are currently looking to install process detection systems in critical areas of the operation."
