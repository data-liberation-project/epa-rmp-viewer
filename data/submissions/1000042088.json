      "SummaryText": "Chlorine is the most commonly used substance for disinfecting drinking water.  The addition of chlorine or chlorine compounds to water is called chlorination.  Chlorination is considered to be the most important process for preventing the spread of waterborne disease in drinking water.  The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) also uses chlorine for drinking water disinfection purposes to protect public health per state and federal water quality standards.  Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations.  The LADWP takes safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as it takes in providing safe drinking water.  The LADWP North Hollywood Wells Chlorination Station chlorine handling process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and Plan and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program requirements.  The facilities subject to the EPA and CalARP regulations are required to prepare and update Risk Management Plans (RMPs).  The RMP is to include policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility and the actions, which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency.  The LADWP prepared and submitted RMPs for the North Hollywood Wells Chlorination Station in June 1999, June 2004 and June 2009.  This RMP is the five-year update of the June 2009 RMP.  The LADWP prepared Program Level 2 RMPs in 1999 and 2004 because North Hollywood Wells Chlorination Station is not subject to Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations.  However, in the excess of caution, the LADWP decided to prepare a Program Level 3 RMP in 2009.  Thus, this 2014 update of the 2009 RMP also demonstrates compliance with the Program Level 3 requirements. \n\n\n\nThe following information is specifically required in the RMP Update Executive Summary: \n\n\n\n?

All applicable requirements of the State of California and EPA's Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures. \n\n \n\nThe LADWP emergency response policy involves the preparation of emergency response plans for hazardous materials which are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA and CalARP Program Emergency Response Program Requirements.  The LADWP has prepared an Emergency Response Plan for the North Hollywood Wells Chlorination Station to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.  The Emergency Response Plan has been coordinated with the local response agency (City of Los Angeles Fire Department).  The North Hollywood Wells Chlorination Station has an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\n\n\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\n\nThe North Hollywood Wells Chlorination Station is located at 11805 Vanowen Street, North Hollywood, California. This facility chlorinates well water before being supplied to parts of the San Fernando Valley.  In June 2009, when the last RMP was submitted to the EPA and the Los Angeles Fire Department, the chlorination station consisted of a chlorin"

In 2011, the LADWP decided to replace the chlorine wet scrubber with a one ton chlorine dry media scrubber. The installation of the dry media chlorine scrubber is in progress. Thus, the North Hollywood Wells Chlorination Station currently does not have any main scrubber. However, the LADWP has decided to withdraw only gaseous chlorine from the ton containers till the chlorine dry scrubber (main scrubber) starts normal operation. A chlorine dry media mini-scrubber has been installed to neutralize any chlorine release from the pressure relief vent installed on the vacuum regulating valve with check-relief unit.\n\n\n\nThe facility currently stores chlorine, a regulated toxic substance under the EPA and CalARP Program rules.  A maximum of six one-ton chlorine containers are stored at the North Hollywood Wells Chlorination Station. The facility is designed for four of these chlorine containers to be connected to the chlorination process to feed liquid and gaseous chlorine and two others are stored as spares.  However, because the main chlorine scrubber is not in operation, the four chlorine containers are connected to the process to feed only gaseous chlorine and the other two containers are stored as spares. The one-ton container is the largest vessel (container) on line. The maximum quantity of chlorine present at the North Hollywood Wells Chlorination Station at any given time exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the EPA and the CalARP regulations.  It also exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the federal and the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (CalOSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standards. However, the facility is normally unoccupied and water treatment operators visit the facility daily and respond to any trouble alarms that may occur.

All the four containers are equipped with Halogen actuators on the angle valves and feed gaseous chlorine under pressure. The actuators will close the angle valves when a chlorine concentration of 10 ppm is detected in the room.  The gaseous chlorine withdrawn from the chlorine containers bypass the evaporators. One bank of two chlorine containers serves as the primary bank and the second bank serves as an automatic backup when the primary containers run dry. Space is allocated in the room for the storage of two additional containers that are not provided connections to the system.  The gaseous chlorine then proceeds to vacuum regulator check unit. Chlorine gas under vacuum from the vacuum regulator check unit is fed to one of the four chlorinators that regulate the flow of chlorine.  From there, gas then travels under vacuum to the injectors. It is important to note that in case of loss of vacuum downstream of the vacuum regulating valve with check-relief unit, air would be drawn in rather than chlorine being released and the vacuum regulating valve with check-relief unit will shut down the chlorine supply to the chlorinator, operating as a shut-off valve.\n\n\n\nThe gas header line is equipped with automatic switchover vacuum regulating valves (vacuum regulating valve with check-relief vent), and pressure gauges.  The primary (also gaseous chlorine) bank provides all the chlorine to the station until it is depleted.  The other gaseous chlorine bank automatically starts supplying chlorine when the primary bank is depleted.  This automatic system is achieved by setting the automatic vacuum regulating valve leading from the secondary bank to standby.

Six injectors are located inside the station. The injectors draw chlorine gas into mixing water to form a concentrated solution.  The solution is piped to diffuser tubes located in the water distribution pipelines. Residual chlorine analyzers monitor residual chlorine downstream of the diffusers. \n\n\n\nChlorine leak detectors are provided to detect chlorine leaks in the chlorine container room and the chlorinator room.  The detectors activate an alarm system which includes:  (1) flashing red lights over the entry door to the buildings, (2) an audible alarm within the chlorination building, and (3) an alarm at the Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant Control Room (LAAFP) at Sylmar.\n\n\n\nA dry media chlorine \"mini-scrubber\" unit (MS) has been installed at the NHWCS. MS is an emergency chlorine scrubber intended to protect personnel working in the building or immediate area from a chlorine gas release from the pressure relief vent installed on the vacuum regulating valve with check-relief units. Mini-scrubber can neutralize up to 25 lbs of chlorine, and the media manufacturer specifies chlorine removal to less than 5 parts per billion. The mini-scrubber is activated automatically at a chlorine concentration of 1 ppm.\n\n\n\nIn the event power is lost at the chlorination facility, an alarm will alert the LAAFP control room.  Chlorine flow will continue unaffected, with no safety consequences. The station is powered by two separate power supplies. \n\n\n\nThe facility is normally unoccupied; water treatment operators visit the facility daily.

A PHA was again performed on March 14, 2014 for the full chlorination system because the chlorine wet scrubber has been removed from the chlorination station but the dry scrubber is still under installation. In addition, the LADWP has decided to withdraw only gaseous chlorine from the ton containers till the dry scrubber is installed at the chlorination station. The March 14, 2014 PHA will be updated again within a five-year period or whenever there will be a major change in the process.  A list of recommended actions was developed in March 2014 to further improve the chlorine safety and staff is currently evaluating these recommendations.  Staff will document the completion of the recommended actions.\n\n\n\nA seismic walkthrough was completed on February 21, 2014 based on the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) Region 1 guidance document, and recommendations are being evaluated for implementation.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe LADWP has prepared written operating procedures for North Hollywood Wells Chlorination Station that provide clear instructions or steps for safely conducting act"

The required conditions prior to startup include the following:\n\n\n\n?    Construction and/or equipment are in accordance with design specifications.\n\n?    Safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate.\n\n?    A PHA has been performed for any new facilities and recommendations have been resolved or implemented prior to startup.\n\n?    At modified facilities, MOC requirements have been met.\n\n?    Training of each operating and maintenance employee involved in the process is complete.\n\nThese procedures ensure that no new and/or new/significantly modified process will startup and no regulated substances will be introduced into such a process before the pre-startup safety review.  This constitutes a final check that the process and equipment are ready to go and that the recommendations of the PHA have been implemented or adequately addressed.  This will ensure that the design and construction of a new or modified process is safely executed and that the facility is prepared to operate it. \n\nMechanical integrity procedures for the plant ensure that written maintenance procedures are implemented and documented, including training of maintenance personnel.\n\n\n\nMaintenance \n\nThe LADWP operates a maintenance program, MAXIMO Program that generates a work order for performing the preventive maintenance routine, which occurs after a designated time past the closing of the previous work order for that particular maintenance process.

Based on the 2009 PHA, a few equipment and procedural changes were recommended. All the above recommendations have been evaluated and implemented by the LADWP, including the installation and operation of a dry media chlorine mini-scrubber. Additionally, four recommendations to further improve chlorine safety were identified in March 2014, when the PHA was performed for the facility (without the main chlorine dry scrubber and withdrawal of only gaseous chlorine from the ton containers). The main chlorine dry media scrubber is currently under installation at the chlorination station and an updated RMP will be submitted after the main chlorine dry scrubber starts normal operation. Based on the 2014 seismic assessment, two recommendations were made to improve chlorine safety. It is expected that all the recommendations will be evaluated by December 2014 and implemented by June 2015.  The implementation of these recommendations will further improve the safety of the chlorine system.\n\n\n\n"
