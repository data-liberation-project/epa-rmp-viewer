The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant to maintain proper temperatures for milk,cream and ice cream within the facility.Anhydrous ammonia is an effective refrigerant that is utilized by numerous food processing facilities. Ammonia is normally a gas at ambient temperature however, here it is handled as a gas liquified under pressure. The refigeration system consists of a Control-pressure receiver, evaporators, Condensers,vessels, compressors,piping and valves. \n ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nMidwest Ice Cream Company is committed to promotimg Safety for the facility, employees and the surrounding community.The facility does comply with OSHA's (PSM) Process Safety Management standard 29CFR1910.119, and EPA's (RMP)Risk Management Plan 40CFR part 68. The purpose of these programs is to ennsure the refrigeration system is operated safely and consistently to prevent releases from the system. In addition, these programs serve to develop procedures to minimize releases in the event they do occur and to outline appropriate emergency responses to take in the event of a release.\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nMidwest Ice Cream Company remains committed to safety for their employees and the community. We have developed and established numerous programs to prevent accidental releases of Ammonia and to remain in compliance with the PSM Standard. These programs include: Employee participation, Incident Investigation, Compliance Audits, Annual Training for employees,Operating Procedures, Process Hazard Analysis(PHA's), Process Safety Information, Pre-startup Review, Management of Change, Mechanical Integrity, Contractor Safety and Hot works permits.\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE INFORMATION\nThe facility maintains an Emergency Response Plan that was prepare"

As an intricate portion of the PSM Program,  the plan includes: Adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, instructions for notification to local,state and federal agencies and the public.\nIn the event of an emergency involving the Ammonia system, it is the policy of the facility to request assistance as necessary from local emergency services, by dialing 911.This action will notify the Belvidere Police Department, the Belvidere Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC). Midwest Ice Cream Company is included in the local emergency response planning.\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nMidwest Ice Cream Company has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the past five years.Due to the stringent release prevention policies, there have been no accidental releases during this period.\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nSeveral Developments and findings have resulted from implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program. They include, additional Ammonia sensors in the production area, employee training, expansion of the facility HAZMAT team to include all shifts and evacution drills. We will continue to operate and maintain the system in accordance with IIAR Guidance and will continue to implement and follow OSHA PSM program in conjunction with the Risk Management Plan."
