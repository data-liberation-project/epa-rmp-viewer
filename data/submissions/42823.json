These pipelines are mixed natural gas liquid lines (natural gasoline, naphtha, normal butane, iso-butane and propane), a dedicated ethane/propane liquids line and various other pipelines.  Each of these pipelines have electric driven pumps and gas turbine driven pumps that add horsepower to the product transfer down the pipelines, or the pump system can be bypassed when the pumps are not needed or down for maintenance.  The Hobbs facility can also receive propane from one of the two natural gas liquids pipelines to a single 63,000 gallon capacity storage tank.  This tank can be used for distribution to the four propane truck transport loading docks which also has capabilities to stench the propane for retail sales companies.  The previously mentioned tank is presently dormant and not in use.  But if service is required the tank level is administratively controlled to hold and not exceed 80% of its capacity.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Enterprise has thirteen salt mined caverns for underground storage of hydrocarbons to/from interstate pipeline.  The product for these caverns comes to/from the various pipelines.  The caverns are regulated by the Department of Transportation.\r\n\r\nIn our process we use the following chemicals that the EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequence in the event of a substantial accidental release:\r\n\r\nToxics\r\n\r\nNo toxic materials to report.\r\n\r\nFlammables\r\n\r\nPropane is a finished product which can be delivered into a single storage tank via the dedicated propane pipeline or the mixed product pipeline.

This scenario assumed the pump continued to operate at a rate of approximately 500 gallons per minutes (gpm) for 10 minutes after the line break.  The simulation calculated that 31,500 pounds of material were released in the assumed time frame.  Mitigation measures were taken into account when selecting the alternative release scenario.

Furthermore, the plan is coordinated with the Gains County LEPC Director, which includes the Gains County Sheriff\u00bfs Department, the local Police department, Fire Department, and Emergency Medical Service.\r\n\r\nIn the event of an accidental release, local Enterprise personnel are trained to sound the alarm, shut off the source from a safe location or activate the emergency shutdown system, contact 9-1-1 and secure the area.  The 9-1-1 system is used to notify the Gains County Sheriff\u00bfs Department and local Fire Departments.  Remote activation can also be accomplished from the system\u00bfs control center which is based in Houston, Texas.  The Enterprise Houston Control Center has area video cameras with dial-up access.  In addition, there are local gas detection systems that alarm locally and in Houston Control.
