The success of this policy is evidenced by the safe operation of the facility since its origin in 1963.\n- That there is no smoking permitted anywhere inside the building, other than a single designated smoking area.  This keeps fire hazards to a minimum.\n- That no vehicles, such as forklifts, are permitted near ammonia refrigeration equipment, including piping.  Forklift operators are trained to use caution wherever refrigeration equipment is present.\n- That all operators must be properly trained before they are permitted to work on, or operate the refrigeration system.\n- That all operators are required to undergo a 24 hour hazardous material training as per OSHA 1910.120 regulations.  This is done to insure their ability to participate in the correction or repair of conditions that might result in an accidental release.\n- That every employee, visitor, contractor or truck driver is informed of the safety aspects of the facility.\n\nDescription of our facility and the regulated substances handled, including how and why we use ammonia.\n\nOur company supplies refrigerated warehousing to companies in the food industry.  Our building is basically a large refrigerator/freezer used to prevent food from spoiling.  Refrigeration is an essential component of the health and safety in everyday life of the consumer.  Our facility supplies refrigeration services to thousands of food related businesses to help insure safe storage and shipment of their products.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is utilized as the refrigerant in our refrigeration system.  Unlike the now-banned or restricted chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's such as certain Freons and Genetrons), ammonia is not an environmental ozone depleter.  When in the environment, it readily enters the natural nitrogen cycle, supplyi"

This translates to lower energy costs, thereby resulting in savings to the consumer, less dependence upon foreign energy imports, as well as less production of public-utility-generated greenhouse gases.\n\nDescription of the \"Worst case release scenario\" and the \"Alternative release scenario\", including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\nWe used the EPA supplied RMP-Comp software package to perform the release scenario calculations.  As part of our modeling, we have assumed that the building structure will act in the capacity of passive mitigation, to decrease the rate of release to the environment.\n\nWe have performed a \"Worst case scenario\" calculation for a release from a ruptured refrigeration vessel that could potentially hold 423 cubic feet of ammonia.  However, it is our normal opeating procedure to keep this vessel filled to only about 25% to 35% of its capacity.  From our calculations we have concluded that there would be offsite consequences to the surrounding community in the event of an ammonia release.  However, due to our continous inspection and maintenance procedures, we feel such a release is extremely unlikely.\n\nWe have also performed an \"Alternantive release scenario\" calculation.  The alternative release we have presented would be if a forklift completely broke one of the major pipes in the system.  In this instance the effect on the surrounding location would be drastically less than in the worst case scenario described above.  This is even assuming no active active mitigation devices.  However, our protection systems and devices in the refrigeration system make off-site impacts even less likely.\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and prevention steps relating to the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nPreventative maintenance has been"
