CHEMICAL COMPANY, INC. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with MOSHEIM FIRE DEPARTMENT which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Distribution of chemical products.  We have 4 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Chlorine, Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous),  Hydrofluoric Acid and Aqua Ammonia. The Sulfur Dioxide, Hydrofluoric Acid, Aqua Ammonia  and Chlorine are received prepackaged in different size containers.  Chlorine, Sulfur Dioxide,  Hydrofluoric Acid and Aqua Ammonia  are used only for resell to our customers.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 46,750 lbs. while Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous),  Hydrofluoric Acid and Aqua Ammonia are present at our facility in quantities of 27,500  lbs., 2,000  lbs.  and 14,800 lbs. respectively.\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios and alternative release scenarios, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance as well as RMP COMP VER 1.06 AND"
