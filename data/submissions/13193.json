The portion of the Port facility that is subject\nto Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations is operated by BP Chemicals Green Lake (BP\nChemicals).  The RMP incorporates the release prevention, emergency response, and training\nprovisions of both the owner and operator, since these two entities coordinate on-site\nprocedures to ensure that both Port and site BP Chemicals employees are properly prepared\nto prevent and respond to emergencies.\n\n1.4  Owner History\n\nThe Port was constructed in the 1950s and was designed to accommodate the transfer of\nchemicals and petrochemicals between ship or barge traffic and pipelines connected directly\nto remote client facilities.  In 1998, a major expansion of the Port was initiated to\naccommodate BP Chemicals material transfers and storage.  The construction phase of the\nproject and the operational startup of the storage facility is scheduled for June 20-22, 1999. \nThe Port owns all equipment used to transfer and store chemicals at the facility, and BP\nChemicals is responsible for operation of the equipment to properly manage the chemicals.\n\n1.3  Operator History\n\nThe process used to produce BP Chemicals Green Lake products contain quantities of listed\nhazardous chemicals that require application of Process Safety Management (PSM) as required\nin OSHA 29 CFR Part 1910 and the RMP.  BP Chemicals Green Lake Plant has an\noutstanding environmental record and is an OSHA VPP Star site, is ISO 9002 certified, and\nis a participant of the Clean Texas 2000 initiative.  The facility has received the following\nawards:\n\n          \n\"Best In Texas\" from the Texas Chemical Council for the years '89, "

A technical team consisting of six local\narea Chemical Manufacturers Association member companies, including BP Chemicals,\nselected the basis for the scenarios.  The team's findings were communicated in public\nmeetings in October 1995 and again in May 1999 in an effort known as the Victoria/Calhoun\nCounty Communications.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\n1.6.1  Worst-Case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst-case scenario involves a catastrophic release of acrylonitrile from a full storage tank\nduring worst-case weather conditions.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released into\na dike.  The distance to the toxic endpoint calculated by RMP*Comp (TM) is 11 miles.  For\nthis scenario, the planned emergency response is use of water sprays and foam in the diked\narea to minimize downwind effects and fire and explosion potential. \n\n1.6.2  Alternative Release Scenario - Acrylonitrile\n\nThis case involves a vessel leak through which acrylonitrile was released in 60 minutes\nthrough a 1 square inch hole during neutral weather conditions.  The distance to the toxic\nendpoint calculated by RMP*Comp (TM) is 1.5 miles.  For this scenario, the planned\nemergency response is use of water sprays and foam in the diked area to minimize downwind\neffects and fire and explosion potential.\n\n1.6.3  Alternative Release Scenario - Ammonia\n\nThis case involves a vessel l"

The Port Director works\nin cooperation with the BP Chemicals Plant Manager who is in direct consultation with the\nPSM/RMP Coordinator.  The PSM/RMP Coordinator provides technical expertise for process\nsafety, communicates requirements to appropriate manufacturing managers, and coordinates\npolicies and procedures to meet process safety requirements in support of the manufacturing\nareas.  Because the day-to-day operations at the Port facility associated with BP Chemicals'\nmaterials are the responsibility of BP Chemicals, the PSM program has been developed by BP\nChemicals, along with the Process Hazard Analyses, Process Safety Information compilation,\nStandard Operating Procedures, Inspection and Testing procedures, and other safety-related\nprograms.  Due to the nature of the owner/operator relationship, emergency planning and\nresponse procedures and plans have been a collaboration of the Port and BP Chemicals.
