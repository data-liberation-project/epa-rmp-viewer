Chlorination is considered to be the most important process for preventing the spread of waterborne disease in drinking water.  The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) also uses chlorine for drinking water disinfection purposes at the Upper Stone Canyon Station to protect public health per state and federal water quality standards.  Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations. The LADWP takes safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as it takes in providing safe drinking water.\n\n\n\nThe LADWP Upper Stone Canyon Chlorination Station (USCCS) chlorine handling process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and Plan, and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program regulations. The facilities subject to the EPA and CalARP Program regulations are required to prepare and update Risk Management Plans (RMPs). The RMP is to include policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility and the actions taken by the facility in an event of an emergency.\n\n\n\nThe LADWP prepared and submitted RMPs for the USCCS in 1999, 2004 and 2008. The LADWP prepared Program Level 2 RMPs from 1999 through 2008 because Upper Stone Canyon Chlorination Station is not subject to PSM regulations. However, in the excess of caution, LADWP prepared a Program Level 3 RMP in 2010. The 2014 update of the 2010 RMP also demonstrated compliance with the Program Level 3 requirements. This document is an update of the June 2014 RMP for the Upper Stone Canyon Chlorination Station. \n\n\n\nThe following information is specifically required in the RMP Executive Summary:\n\n\n\n?

All applicable requirements of the State of California and EPA's Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \n\n\n\nThe LADWP emergency response policy involves the preparation of emergency response plans for hazardous materials which are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA and CalARP Program Emergency Response Program Requirements.  The LADWP has prepared an Emergency Response Plan for the Upper Stone Canyon Chlorination Station to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency. The Emergency Response Plan has been coordinated with the local response agency (City of Los Angeles Fire Department). The Upper Stone Canyon Chlorination Station has good record in preventing accidents from happening.\n\n\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\n\n\n\nThe Upper Stone Canyon Station is located at 1900 North Stone Canyon Road in Los Angeles, California. There are multiple chlorine feed points on the reservoir complex property to disinfect water in Upper and Lower Stone Canyon Reservoirs, the Upper Stone Canyon bypass pipelines #1 and #2, and the membrane filtration plant.

The station building consists of a chlorine storage room, chlorine equipment room, an electrical equipment room, several chemical storage rooms, and a 4,700-lb capacity dry media scrubber room. The facility stores chlorine, a regulated toxic substance under the EPA and CalARP Program rules. The Upper Stone Canyon Chlorination Station stores a maximum of 22 ton chlorine containers. Ten of these ton containers can be connected to the chlorination process to feed chlorine liquid or gas.  The maximum quantity of chlorine present at the Upper Stone Canyon Chlorination Station at any given time exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the EPA and CalARP regulations. It also exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the federal and California Occupational Safety and Health Administration PSM Standards. However, the facility is normally unoccupied and water treatment operators visit the facility daily and respond to any trouble alarms that may occur. Therefore, the LADWP Upper Stone Canyon Chlorination Station is not subject to federal or California OSHA PSM standards.\n\n\n\nThe design incorporates two banks of four ton containers each, which normally feed liquid chlorine to evaporators. There is an automatic switchover system that determines which liquid chlorine header feeds the evaporators. This system consists of a control panel, two motorized ball valves, and a pressure switch on the liquid header before the evaporators. When the pressure in the liquid chlorine supply line drops to 20 psi, the switchover system opens the valve isolating the standby bank of ton containers to allow liquid chlorine to flow. At the same time, it closes the ball valve on the now empty bank of ton containers.\n\n\n\nThe system is also configured with gas headers for each of the two banks of four ton containers. This is essentially a complete gas feed system with automatic switchover capability. It can be used durin"

It has been provided because of the uncertainty of operations at this site in the future.\n\n\n\nBecause the normal operation is by withdrawing liquid chlorine, and the evaporators are equipped with motorized vacuum regulating valves downstream, it is possible for the gas supply to the chlorinators to be automatically shut off at the vacuum-regulating valve. These valves can close upon a low temperature condition in the evaporator or at the valve, or upon power failure. For this reason, in order to assure no interruptions of chlorine feed, a third bank of two ton containers is provided. These two ton containers connect to a gas header which leads to three automatic switchover type vacuum regulating valves in parallel acting as an automatic backup gas supply. The vacuum regulating valves have a capacity of 3,000 ppd each, for a total feed capacity of 9,000 ppd. The valves open automatically based on a high vacuum condition that pulls the valve out of its detent position. Because this is a mechanical setting on each separate valve, and the settings are not exactly the same, it is likely that not all of the valves will open at once. One would open, followed by a second and then a third if the feed demand is great enough. With only two one-ton containers supplying this gas manifold, the sustainable gas feed rate is only about 800 ppd due to the inherent physical properties of chlorine.  Therefore, when it comes on line it must be considered an emergency supply only.  A quick response from an operator is needed to come to the station and either get the liquid system back on line, or else start shedding chlorine feed (such as shore feeds) to a rate that can be sustained from two gas containers.  Other options include placing one or both of the primary banks of four one-ton containers each on their gas header systems.  This emergency backup is intended for only an hour or so of feed before"

Chlorine gas from the vacuum regulating valve with check-relief units is pulled by vacuum to the chlorinators and then to the injectors. It is important to note that in case of loss of vacuum downstream of the vacuum regulating valve with check-relief units, air would be drawn in rather than chlorine gas being released. In addition, the vacuum regulating valve with check-relief unit will shut down the chlorine supply to the chlorinator, operating as a shut-off valve. \n\n\n\nA dry media type chlorine gas scrubber system (main scrubber) is installed at the station. The unit is actuated by chlorine detectors at a chlorine concentration of 3 ppm.  The scrubber can neutralize up to 4,700 lbs of chlorine in case of a chlorine leak. The scrubber draws suction from the chlorine ton container and chlorinator rooms through a duct.  The station is equipped with an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) in addition to a backup power generator. Therefore, in case of the failure of regular power, the scrubber will remain functional.\n\n\n\nA dry media chlorine \"mini-scrubber\" unit (MS) has also been installed at the Upper Stone Canyon Chlorination Station. The MS is an emergency chlorine scrubber intended to protect personnel working in the building or immediate area from a chlorine gas release from the pressure safety relief vent provided in the vacuum regulator check units. Mini-scrubber can neutralize up to 25 lbs of chlorine, and the media manufacturer specifies chlorine removal to less than 5 parts per billion.\n\n\n\nAll the ton containers connected to the process are equipped with Halogen actuators which shut the ton container valves when desired.

Chlorine gas is withdrawn from the chlorinators under vacuum to the injectors.  In the injectors, chlorine mixes with a high-pressure water supply to form a concentrated solution.  The chlorine solution discharged from the injector is diffused into the pipelines or the reservoirs through multiple diffuser nozzles.  The Stone Canyon Complex injection system has eighteen injectors spread out among seven vaults, at various locations throughout the complex.\n\n\n\nSeven chlorine leak sensors are provided in the station to detect chlorine leaks.  The sensors are located in the chlorine container and chlorinator rooms, as well as from the scrubber inlet and outlet ducts.  The detectors signal an alarm by activating a flashing red light over the entry door to the building, as well as an audible alarm within the container and chlorination rooms, and activating an alarm at the Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant (LAAFP) Control Room at Sylmar.  Also, the chlorine injector vaults are equipped with chlorine leak sensors.\n\n\n\nProcess control is by a programmable controller, which determines the feed rate based on the water flow rate and the chlorine residual.  There are flow meters transmitting flow signals to the controller.  Chlorine residual analyzers continuously monitor the treated water residuals.\n\n\n\nIn the event power is lost at the chlorine facilities, an alarm will alert the LAAFP control room.

The hazard review/PHA was revalidated in April 1999. In March 2004, a hazard review/PHA was again performed for the whole chlorination station. A hazard review/PHA for modifications to the facility was performed (based on the design drawings) in March 2002. This hazard review/PHA was further reviewed in August 2008 after the facility was constructed. The 2008 hazard review/PHA was again reviewed in June 2013 as part of the five year update of the hazard review/PHA. The 2013 PHA was again reviewed and updated in April 2014. A PHA was again performed for the USCCS on March 15, 2019, and will be updated again within a five-year period or whenever there will be a major change in the process.

The required conditions prior to startup include the following:\n\n\n\n?    Construction and/or equipment are in accordance with design specifications.\n\n?    Safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate.\n\n?    A PHA has been performed for new facilities and recommendations have been resolved or implemented before startup.\n\n?    At modified facilities, MOC requirements have been met.\n\n?    Training of each operating and maintenance employee involved in the process is complete.\n\n\n\nThese procedures ensure that no new and/or significantly modified process will startup and no regulated substances will be introduced into such a process before the pre-startup safety review. This constitutes a final check that the process and equipment are ready to go and that the recommendations of the PHA have been implemented or adequately addressed. This will ensure that the design and construction of a new or modified process is safely executed and that the facility is prepared to operate it. \n\n\n\nMechanical integrity procedures for the plant ensure that written maintenance procedures are implemented and documented, including training of maintenance personnel.\n\n\n\nMaintenance \n\n\n\nThe LADWP operates a maintenance program, MAXIMO Program that generates a work order for performing the preventive maintenance routine, which occurs after a design"
