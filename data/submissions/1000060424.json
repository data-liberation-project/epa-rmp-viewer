As part of that commitment, Pixelle has established management systems to maximize the safety of operating processes at this facility.  One component of this design is a risk management plan (RMP) that guides the safe handling, storage, and usage of regulated hazardous substances at Pixelle and complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  \n\n\n\nOne of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at Pixelle.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at Pixelle.\n\n\n\nThe risk management program at Pixelle consists of three elements:\n\n\n\n1) Hazard assessments to analyze and understand (a) the potential for offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accident and incident investigations that have occurred involving substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances) - see Emergency Response Plan Topics 1.3 and 1.5.\n\n\n\n2) Prevention programs to help maintain and safely operate those processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance - see Emergency Response Plan Topic 1.4.\n\n\n\n3) Emergency planning for public notification and response should an accidental release of a regulated substance from covered processes ever occur - see Emergency Response Plan Topic 1.6.\n\n\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMPlan.\n\n\n\nPixelle's risk management planning is designed to assure that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner.

In fact, Pixelle has a comprehensive safety program in place, which directs many levels of safeguards against release of hazardous substances to prevent and mitigate injuries and damage from a hazardous substance release.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nPixelle's safety policies integrate many levels of personal, process, and environmental safety. However, this RMPlan is limited to address those elements of the safety program at Pixelle that are required by the RMP Rule.\n\n\n\nPixelle limits the use of hazardous substances.  \n\nBefore using a hazardous substance at Pixelle, less hazardous alternatives are considered.   When a hazardous substance must be used, Pixelle thoroughly reviews the potential for this substance to adversely affect employees, the public, and the environment and manages its processes to prevent such effects.\n\n\n\nPixelle prevents releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility. \n\nPixelle is committed to the safety of employees, the public, the preservation of the environment, and the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  When a hazardous substance is used at Pixelle, the equipment is carefully designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  In conjunction with best engineering practices, government and industry standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment. \n\n\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nPixelle follows industry standards (e.g., Department of Transportation [DOT]), National Fire Protection Association [NFPA], The Chlorine Institute, and manufacturers' guidelines) to maximize the safe handling, storage, and usage of all hazardous materials.  For the Chlorine Dioxide process, Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) are conducted in accordance with the requirements specified by OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard.\n\n\n\nPixelle implements "

In the event of a significant accidental release, Pixelle maintains a trained and certified hazardous chemical emergency response program and would evacuate employees and contact local emergency response agencies (LEPC) as necessary to control, contain, and prevent/reduce the consequences of the release.  Pixelle and local emergency response agencies (through the Chillicothe City Fire Department) have established a process to alert the community in the event an offsite consequence exists.\n\n\n\nPixelle and Regulated Substances\n\nPixelle is an integrated paper products company primarily involved in the manufacture of pulp and paper from both hard and softwoods.  Pixelle handles one regulated toxic (no flammable) substance in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP rule.\n\n\n\nAs part of the manufacturing process at this facility, Chlorine Dioxide is used as a stock bleaching agent in the Pulp Mill and is inventoried at quantities above the EPA threshold limit and is regulated by the RMP rule.  This system is regulated and compliance is managed in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard.  As such, it is designated as Program Level 3 process for RMP rule compliance purposes.\n\n\n\nRegulated Process                Program Level               Substance                    Quantity\n\nChlorine Dioxide Storage               3                  Chlorine Dioxide                30,000 lb\n\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSES\n\nPixelle has performed offsite consequence analyses to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.

An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) might occur at a facility like Pixelle, and (2) would result in the greatest potential offsite consequences if the release occurred.\n\n\n\nThe primary objective of performing the offsite consequence analyses is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).  When considering the release of a toxic substance, it is expected that people at the endpoint distance would experience little or no exposure, with no long-term health consequences.  However, the potential for some short-term consequences (e.g., strong eye irritation, or throat irritation), while not likely, does exist.  Some people who are particularly susceptible to the substance released could become incapacitated.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nPixelle maintains a number of programs to help prevent accidental releases and ensure safe operation.  The accident prevention programs in place at Pixelle include:\n\n\n\nProgram 3 Prevention Program.\n\nSince 1963, Pixelle has used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Beginning in 1992, Pixelle formalized this prevention program for the Chlorine Dioxide Generation and Storage processes to comply with the 14 elements of the OSHA process safety management (PSM) prevention program.  In 1996, in accordance with the EPA RMP rule, one Program 3 process was identified.  RMP requirements for this system are essentially the same as OSHA PSM, except that the program also focuses on protecting the public and the environment.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of Pixelle's prevention program that address the RMP rule prevention program and ERP requirements.\n\n\n\nPixelle's Prevention Program for the RMP Pro"

For each regulated process, these documents address (1) physical properties of hazardous substances handled at Pixelle; (2) operating parameters of the equipment at Pixelle; and (3) the technical and design bases, and configuration of the equipment.  Pixelle ensures that this process safety information is available to all Pixelle employees, the local emergency planning committee (LEPC), and the Chillicothe Fire Department.\n\n \n\nWhen important information was not available from the design documents, it was developed through special projects, or in the case of operating parameters, during process hazard analysis of the process.  Operating parameters are included in the standard operating procedures to enhance the safe operation of the process.  These documents are used in (1) employee training; (2) performing process hazard analyses; and (3) the monitoring and maintenance of equipment. \n\n\n\nSafety data sheets (SDS) document the physical properties of hazardous substances handled at Pixelle, including regulated substances in covered processes.  SDSs for hazardous substances handled in each process are available in the process control room so the operators have ready reference to this information.  In addition, SDSs are provided to the LEPC and the fire department as required for use in developing emergency response plans.\n\n\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\nIn accordance with the Process Safety Management Standard and to help identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process, Pixelle conducts and recertifies process hazard analysis (PHA) of the regulated process.

Recommendations and action items resulting from the analysis are documented and tracked to completion.  Responsibility to resolve action items are assigned to unit personnel, and where appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the process are implemented.\n\n\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nPixelle process safety personnel, engineers, operators, and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to regulated process operations should be safely performed.  The operating procedures (1) are used to train employees and (2) serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.\n\n\n\nTRAINING\n\nPixelle provides basic chemical specific HAZCOM training for all employees.  Pixelle trains employees to safely and effectively perform their assigned tasks.  For current hazardous process operations personnel, Pixelle training programs include both initial and refresher training that cover (1) general overview of the process; (2) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process; and (3) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices.  Both oral reviews and written tests are used to verify that an employee understands the appropriate level of training prior to working in, on, or around a regulated process.\n\n\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\nPixelle maintains the mechanical integrity of regulated process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment.

For regulated processes, all not-in-kind, non-emergency changes must have prior review and qualified approval before the change can be implemented.  This is to prevent inadvertent consequences of a process change, and to ensure any potential hazards created by the change are proactively recognized and addressed; affected process safety information and procedures are updated; and affected employees are notified of the changes.\n\n\n\nPRE-STARTUP REVIEW\n\nPixelle performs a safety review of a new or modified process before the process is placed into service to help ensure that the process has been prepared to operate safely.

A flange gasket was found to be leaking approximately one drop every five minutes, and is estimated to be less than 0.1 pound of dilute chlorine dioxide solution released. (Note:  The quantity released was entered as one pound in the Accident 1 section, 6.5, as that is the minimum quantity that can be entered.)  During investigation, the release slowed and came to a stop. The gasket was replaced during the next opportunity. The team also recommended review of system components, preventative maintenance procedures, and employee gas monitor training. \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAMS\n\nPixelle's personnel and procedures are prepared to coordinate the activities of the facility and maintain an emergency response team trained in emergency response procedures.  Pixelle periodically conducts emergency response drills, including annual drills coordinated with the local fire department, the first-response emergency team, the Corporate Crisis Management Team, and local emergency response agencies.  Pixelle employees will respond to minor events that do not have the potential for significant effects (e.g., small fires or small leaks).  In the event of a larger fire or release, employees will be evacuated from the area, the Pixelle Emergency Response Team will be responsible for initial response and assessment, and contact with the Chillicothe City Fire Department as necessary.  All Pixelle personnel are trained in evacuation procedures.\n\n \n\nPixelle has established a written emergency response program to help safely respond to accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for:\n\n- Informing the local fire department and the public about accidental releases that could reasonably result in offsite consequences;\n\n- Providing proper first aid and emergency medical treatment to treat accid"
