ACCORDING TO EPA LOOKUP TABLES, THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT IS .43 MILES.\n\n     THE ALTERNATVE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR PROPANE WOULD BE THE FAILURE OF ONE 30,OOO\nGALLON STORAGE TANK WHEN FILLED TO 80% CAPACITY (130,000 POUNDS) RESULTING IN TWO-THIRDS OF A VAPOR CLOUD EXPLOSION CAUSING A 1 PSI OVERPRESSURE.  ACCORDING TO EPA LOOKUP TABLES, THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT IS (FACTOR OF .67 x.43 MILES = .29 MILES) .29 MILES.\n\n4.  THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \n\nFOR PROPANE, NFPA-58 RULES.\n\n5.  THE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY.\n\nA.
