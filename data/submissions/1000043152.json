The treatment facility is located on a land area of approximately 34 acres, bounded on the south side by the Artesia (91) Freeway, on the east side by the San Gabriel River Valley (605) Freeway, on the north and west sides by Cerritos Iron Wood Nine golf course.  \n\n\n\nThe CSDLAC has operated the LCWRP facility since inception in 1970.  The design treatment capacity of the plant has increased from an original capacity of 12.5 million gallons per day (mgd) to its current capacity of 37.5 mgd.

For this reason, LCWRP follows all industry recommended practices for safely storing and handling these chemicals.  LCWRP's aqueous ammonia handling processes are subject to the CalARP Program Level 2 Requirements.  LCWRP's chlorine and sulfur dioxide handling processes are subject to the US EPA RMP and to the CalARP Program Level 3 requirements.  These programs require a summary in the RMP of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility, including a description of the possible consequences in case of an accident and the actions which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency.  The following information is specifically required in the RMP Executive Summary: \n\n  ? Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\n  ? General facility and regulated substances information.\n\n  ? Offsite consequence analysis results. \n\n  ? Summary of the accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n\n  ? Five-year accident history summary.\n\n  ? Emergency response program summary.\n\n  ? Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICIES\n\n\n\nCSDLAC's accidental release prevention policy at LCWRP involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, trains staff in operation and maintenance practices, and uses tested and proven management system practices.  All applicable procedures of the State of California and EPA's Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \n\n\n\nThe CSDLAC emergency respo"

The CSDLAC has prepared a HMHWCCP for the LCWRP for storing and handling hazardous materials, including aqueous ammonia, chlorine, and sulfur dioxide to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.  The HMHWCCP has been coordinated with the local response agency, the County of Los Angeles Fire Department (LACFD).  The LCWRP has an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nAqueous ammonia (19.5% concentration) is used to maintain the disinfection limits in the treated effluent.  The aqueous ammonia is provided by delivery truck and transferred via hose to the ammonia storage tanks.  The aqueous ammonia solution is stored in 30 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) design, American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Code unfired pressure vessels.  There are three 3,800-gallon tanks at LCWRP.  The working capacity of each tank is approximately 3,040 gallons, and each tank is provided with a high level alarm.  The aqueous ammonia is then transferred from the storage tanks to dosing locations within the effluent channel and mixed.  Once the aqueous ammonia is mixed with the treated effluent, CalARP regulations no longer apply.\n\n\n\nChlorine used for chlorination at LCWRP and is received in chlorine trailers and transferred to bulk storage tanks located inside the buildings.

The capacity of each chlorine bulk storage tank is 25 tons; however, the maximum quantity of chlorine present in a tank at any given time is only 18 tons.  In case of a major chlorine leak, the bulk storage tanks and the chlorine tank trailer can be isolated by the emergency shutoff valves located on the piping downstream of the bulk storage tank manway and at the end of the flexible hoses that connect to the tank trailer.  There are emergency shutdown switches (push buttons) located at each door into the chlorine building, and on the chlorine shutdown (emergency) valve control panel located on the mezzanine of the chlorine transfer area.  On the chlorine shutdown (emergency) valve control panel, there are individual control switches for each valve.  All emergency shutdown valves can also be activated from the Plant Control Room. \n\nChlorine gas detectors are used to detect a chlorine leak in the bulk storage and chlorinator rooms.  Upon detection of approximately 0.5 parts per millions by volume (ppmv) chlorine, the detectors will send a signal which will shut down the normal ventilation system to contain the chlorine gas within the chlorination and storage rooms.

The caustic scrubber system is automatically activated in the event of a sulfur dioxide leak.\n\n\n\nThe scrubber system is equipped with an emergency generator set.  The emergency generator will automatically start powering in the event of a power failure and will continue to run for 5 minutes after regular power is restored.  The emergency generator powers the entire scrubbing system including, local alarms, caustic recirculation pumps, electrically-operated valves and the sump pump.

As part of the emergency response program, CSDLAC has developed and implemented HMHWCCPs for both facilities for the purpose of protecting public health and the environment.  The HMHWCCPs have been coordinated with the local response agency (LACFD).  The main elements of each emergency response plan are: (1) initial discovery equipment and procedure, (2) response to an emergency, including procedures for immediate action and internal notifications, (3) procedures for external notifications, including coordination with Local Governments, Incident Commanders, (4) incident action plan, including mitigation actions, response resources, (5) implementation of tactical plan, and (6) termination and follow-up actions. \n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nIn 1990, as part of its compliance with the California Risk Management and Prevention Program (RMPP), numerous changes to improve safety (recommended actions) were identified for the storage, handling and use of chlorine and sulfur dioxide as part of the PHAs conducted at the LCWRP.  The PHAs conducted in 1990 were reviewed in 19"

      "SummaryText": "97 under the RMPP and PSM Program as part of an update.  In 1999, as part of its compliance with the US EPA RMP and California RMP programs CSDLAC conducted PHA updates for the storage, handling and use of chlorine and sulfur dioxide at LCWRP.  Furthermore, in 2004 and 2009, CSDLAC conducted a PHA on the storage, handling and use of aqueous ammonia at LCWRP.  ALL recommended actions resulting from these PHAs and PHA Updates have been implemented as required.  \n\n\n\nAs part of the 2014 Five-Year RMP Update and Revalidation, PHA updates were conducted for the storage, handling and use of chlorine, sulfur dioxide and aqueous ammonia.  Based on this review, additional recommended actions have been identified to further improve the safety of chlorine, sulfur dioxide systems and aqueous ammonia storage, handling and use systems.  The implementation of these recommendations will further improve the safety of these systems.\n\n\n\nCSDLAC has initiated preliminary design for the conversion of the existing chlorine and sulfur dioxide chemical facilities at LCWRP to sodium hypochlorite and sodium bisulfite chemical facilities.  The emergency caustic scrubbers at each facility shall also be decommissioned as part of each project.  This project is expected to be completed by the next submission date in 2019.\n\n"
