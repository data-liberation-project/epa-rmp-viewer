      "SummaryText": "The City of Appleton Wastewater Treatment Facility uses chlorine and sulfur dioxide in its disinfection system processes each year on a \"seasonal\" basis: May 1 through September 30.  Because this is a non-continuous process for the facility a great deal of attention is given to all components of the disinfection process prior to start-up in May and during shutdown at the end of September.  No aspect of handling the one-ton cylinders of chlorine or sulfur dioxide is take for granted.  Maintenance and monitoring of the system's performance is considered a critical function of the safety for this process during its use.\n\nThe chemicals are housed in an enclosed structure with gas detection alarms and emergency breathing apparatus for workers along with emergency repair kits to address less than catastrophic release scenarios.  Neither of these chemicals are flammable or combustible; their total release in the worst-case scenario would be due to some collateral disaster at the facility.  Both chemicals are used in the disinfection process as one discrete cylinder connection at a time rather than the simultaneous connection of all cylinders on-site.\n\nAll facility employees are routinely trained in our emergency response procedures, handling fires, injuries, and responding to other emergency situations.  Safety is a first level responsibility of all plant staff and procedures are in place to minimize the hazards associated with the handling and use of chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  Cylinder transfers are conducted only during day time hours with full plant staffing; it at all possible.  All activities associated with these chemicals require two workers to perform cylinder transfers; and includes the use of gas monitors and personal protective equipment including emergency breathing apparatus.\n\nThe Appleton Wastewater Treatment Facility works closely with the Appleton Fire Department to communicate the potential of on-site hazards and the types of responses required from eme"

Our safety programs are based on continual mandatory employee training and are coordinated with the City of Appleton's administrative safety program which includes city emergency service groups.  We maintain much the same coordination and working relationship with the Outagamie County LEPC.\n\nWe strive to maintain our excellent safety record and have recently developed a full time staff position to coordinate all safety and training activities for our facility.  This emphasis will ensure that we do not become complacent about any of our procedures or processes."
