Policy dictates that Russell Stephenson WWTF personnel continually identify methods to reduce the use of hazardous materials and to reduce the risk to the community and environment through implementation fo new technology and procedures.  This commitment to safe and environmentally sound operations is documented in the policy and compliance manuals, which are available to all employees.\n\nDescription of Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\nThe County of Okaloosa operates the Russell Stephenson WWTF located at the intersection of Rosewood Drive and US Highway 98 in Mary Esther, Florida.  At the treatment plant, the facility stores approximately four (4) one-ton cylinders of chlorine.  The one-ton cylinders are used on-site as a disinfectant in the treatment of wastewater.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\nThe Russell Stephenson WWTF is in compliance with the RMP Rule, 40 CFR Part 68.  The facility has conducted a comprehensive review of all systems, as well as administrative, technical, and operating and maintenance procedures, in addition to the other required program elements of the RMP Rule.  A process hazard analysis was conducted at this facility using a \"What-if\" analysis.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nThe Russell Stephenson WWTF has not had an accidental release in the last five (5) years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nIn the event a significant releases occurs, the Okaloosa County Department of Emergency Services would be notified immediately to respond.  The Department of Emergency Services would dispatch experienced personnel trained to handle such situations.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nIt was observed during the process hazard analysis that the Russell Stephenson WWTF h"
