Our overall approach to chemical safety and security involves safe equipment design, well-trained employees & qualified contractors, and regular audits and assessments.\n\nThe Hermiston Generating Plant (HGP) operates an electric and steam generating facility.  Natural Gas is used to fire two combustion turbines. The exhaust gas from the turbines is used to produce steam through a Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG). The steam from the HRSG is used to turn two steam turbines. Generators are attached to both the combustion and steam turbines which generate electricity.  \n\nHGP stores an aqueous ammonia solution, which is safer to handle than anhydrous ammonia.  The ammonia solution is used in our air pollution control system to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx).  \n\nThe Hermiston Generating Plant complies with the federal Risk Management Program (RMP). The general accidental release prevention program is incorporated into overall safe plant operation.  The plant is continuously staffed, has perimeter fencing and controlled access/gate security.  The control room operators have access to real-time process monitor data for the entire plant, and can take emergency action remotely (e.g. through remote shut-off valves).  Trained operators perform regular visual inspections of equipment.  In accordance with company policy, chemical unloading is supervised, and follows written procedures.\n\nHGP has taken several chemical-specific prevention steps to avert any accidental releases of ammonia.  Control room operators remotely monitor the status of the ammonia system.  A loss of dilution air or excess ammonia flow would instantly cause an alarm in the control room where trained operators would take immediate action to correct the problem.  The ammonia storage and handling system undergoes preventative maintenance and inspection. Th"

      "SummaryText": "e ammonia storage is located inside a secondary containment structure.  In the event of a catastrophic release, this structure would prevent the spread of aqueous ammonia and slow the evaporation rate. \n\nThe aqueous ammonia system has had no spills and no accidents since HGP began operation in 1996.  \n\nHGP has an Emergency Response Plan that has been sent to the Hermiston Fire Department which is also the East Oregon Hazardous Material Team.  Plant workers undergo annual hazardous materials safety training and emergency response training, as well as emergency drills.  Plant management has made concerted efforts to coordinate with fire and emergency departments and other responders including a qualified spill cleanup contractors to ensure an appropriate response to an incident at the facility."
