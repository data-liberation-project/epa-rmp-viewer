The McCullough Complex WTP utilizes chlorine for disinfection in the treatment of drinking water.  The chlorine is stored in one-ton containers.  The chlorine feed process reduces line pressure from that in the containers (90-120 psig) to a vacuum.  The chlorine gas under vacuum is then metered and drawn into a moving water stream.

Colorado Springs Utilities believes that it is important to provide a safe workplace to its employees and minimize the impact of its operations on the surrounding community and the environment.  Accordingly, Colorado Springs Utilities has developed proactive safety and environmental programs, which are reliant upon active employee participation and management leadership and support.  This same proactive philosophy was employed in the development and implementation of the MC RMP for the chlorine systems.\n\n\n\nThe RMP is arguably the most important element of the rule.  Its program elements require the active participation of facility employees and management in conducting activities aimed at preventing accidental releases of regulated chemicals.  If prevention activities could be completely successful, there would be no need for emergency response activities, since no releases would occur.  Accordingly, a well-developed and properly-implemented prevention program will lower the possibility of an accidental release and minimize the consequences of a release should one occur.\n\n\n\nColorado Springs Utilities takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at all of its facilities by ensuring that its employees are well-informed regarding the hazards associated with the regulated processes (e.g., chlorine at the MCWTP) and actively participate in a comprehensive hazard review.  The system employees are properly trained in the safe operation of the covered"

They are aided in this work by complete, understandable system operating procedures.\n\n\n\nColorado Springs Utilities management understands its duty to provide a safe working environment and to take measures to prevent accidents that may have an effect on the surrounding community.  This understanding is reflected in procedures described and referenced in the MC RMP procedures and policies.\n\n\n\nColorado Springs Utilities has established and maintains emergency procedures.  These are reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and revised to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe MC is located at 660 West Monument Creek Road on the Air Force Academy property in El Paso County, Colorado.  The facility treats surface water through a series of physical and chemical treatment operations including pre- and post-chlorination to provide potable drinking water to residents in the Colorado Springs area.  Up to 75 million gallons of water (MGD) are currently treated daily at the McCullough Water Treatment Plant, and more than 42 MGD are treated at the Pine Valley Water Treatment Plant prior to discharge into the water distribution system. \n\n\n\nThe MC utilizes chlorine as a disinfecting agent in the treatment of drinking water.  The facility is regulated under Program 2 of the RMP rule due to the volume of chlorine stored and used at the facility.  \n\n\n\nPREVENTION STEPS FOR CHLORINE \n\nThe prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are described in detail in the MC RMP manual.  The prevention program includes the following elements:\n\n\n\n-Safety information, which includes information pertaining to the hazards of chlorine in the process, process technology, and process equipment.\n\n-Hazard review, which includes a systematic evaluation (by an employee team) of:  the hazards of the chlorine process, identification of previous process incidents, engineering"

In the event of a release of chlorine in the storage room, the normal ventilation system shuts down and the chlorine-contaminated air is sent to the scrubber for neutralization.  The scrubber is maintained and tested on a regular basis to ensure proper operation during a chlorine release event.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWithin the five-year period prior to the submittal of this RMP, there were no accidental releases of chlorine meeting the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThis facility is included in the Colorado Springs LEPC Emergency Response Program.  In addition, MC has established and maintains emergency procedures, which include an evacuation and notification plan.  The goals of the established procedures are to protect onsite employees from the hazardous effects of chemical releases and to minimize the effects of releases on the general public.  The procedures are routinely reviewed and updated to reflect personnel and regulatory changes.  Colorado Springs Utilities works closely with the Colorado Springs LEPC and ot"
