The elements of the plan are intended to prevent and minimize the accidental releases of extremely hazardous substances (chlorine and sulfur dioxide) used on site. The Allied facility emergency response program involves the preparation of response plans that are tailored to the facility and the emergency response services available in the\ncommunity. Allied's emergency response program is in compliance with the EPA and OSHA Emergency Response Program requirements and is modeled after the \"One Plan\".\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nAllied Universal Corporation repackages chlorine into U.S. DOT specification cylinders and multi-unit tank car tanks (commonly known as ton containers). In addition, Allied manufactures 10.5%-15%(by weight) sodium hypochlorite.  Sulfur dioxide U.S. DOT specification cylinders and multi-unit tank car tanks are stored at the site for distribution.  The facility includes a private sidetrack for unloading chlorine railcars. A production building, with an emergency scrubber, is used for packaging the cylinders and multi-unit tank car tanks and for sodium hypochlorite production and quality control testing. The chlorine gas detection system continuously monitors all production and storage locations.  \n\nBased upon the program criteria as set forth in the Risk Management Rule, including EPA's definition of a \"covered process\", the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes at this facility are subject to Program 3 planning.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThe Allied accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\u00c2\u00b7 Complianc"
