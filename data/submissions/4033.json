      "SummaryText": "Crystal Distribution Services is a public refrigerated warehouse.  We handle and store refrigerated and frozen foodstuffs for shipment in interstate commerce.  We use anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant in our system.  Our system has been built and is maintained in compliance with all federal, state and local regulations with regard to the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia.\n \nOur worst case senario would involve the catostrophic rupture of the main controlled pressure receiver.  This receiver is located on the 4th floor of a multi-story warehouse facility.  This facility is in an urban setting and would effect a population of 2,879.  This senario was developed with the help of the Iowa Air Emission Assistance Program RMP Development Workshop.\n  \nThis facility complies with OSHA Process Safety Management standards.  This process involves employee participation, process safety information, process hazard analysis, standard operating procedures, training, pre-start-up safety review, mechanical integrity, hot work permits, management of change, incident investigation, emergency planning and response and compliance audits.\n\nThis facility has never had an accident involving ammonia that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in place.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our ammonia system, we have a trained emergency response team that has specific training regarding ammonia release.  Our emergency response plan has been reviewed with and involves the local emergency planning agency and local fire department.\n\nA part of our plan to improve safety involves the reduction in the quanity of ammonia needed to operate the refrigeration system in this facility.   This will be done over the next five to ten years as we build and operate new and more efficient buildings.  The first of these facilities will be operational in the summer of 1999."
