      "SummaryText": "As used throughout this Risk Management Plan (RMP), the term \"Facility\" means the 283-W Water Treatment Facility (283-W Facility) and not the approximately 586 square mile U.S. Department of Energy Hanford Site.  The standard industrial source code for the Hanford Site is 9999.  There is no corresponding North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) number.  The NAICS number for the 283-W Facility is 22131, Water Supply and Irrigation Systems.\n\nThe 283-W Facility is located on the U.S. Department of Energy Hanford Site.  The 283-W Facility receives raw water from the Columbia River, treats (filters and disinfects) the raw water, and exports the treated water for process, fire protection, potable, and irrigation purposes in accordance with Washington Administrative Code, Chapter 246-290, Drinking Water Regulations.  One step of the treatment process is chlorination.  In the chlorination system, the 283-W Facility uses gaseous chlorine, stored at the facility in 1-ton chlorine containers, for injection into the raw, untreated facility influent and for disinfection of post-filtration effluent.  Chlorine is used as an algaecide and disinfectant.  Evaluation of the 283-W Facility and chlorine storage capacity indicates that the 283-W Facility stores or has the potential to store a chlorine inventory in excess of the threshold quantity (2,500 lb); therefore, the 283-W Facility is subject to Risk Management (RM) Program regulations.  \n\nThe 283-W Facility is subject to additional regulations related to the management of chemicals.  The 283-W Facility is subject to the reporting requirements under the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act of 1986 and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration Process Safety Management Rule, which also contains provisions for the safe management of chemicals.  Because the chlorine containers periodically are transported to the facility, the chlorine is stored in containers that are compliant with the U.S. Departmen"

These regulations require periodic retesting of the containers to ensure container integrity. \n\nEach of the prime contractors for the U.S. Department of Energy Richland Operations Office have developed a similar approach to the management of chemicals that is consistent with the principles of integrated safety management.  The Hanford Chemical Management Program is used to evaluate the adequacy of individual project/facility chemical management programs, identify opportunities for improvement in the safe and efficient management of chemicals, implement changes to existing chemical management programs, develop chemical management systems, as appropriate, and control day-to-day management of chemicals on the Hanford Site. \n\nProcesses subject to the RM Program requirements are divided into three eligibility levels, referred to as Programs 1, 2, and 3.  Program 1 is available to any process that has not had an accidental release with offsite consequences in the past 5 years and has no public receptors within the distance to the toxic endpoint associated with a worst-case scenario (WCS).  Processes subject to Program 1 must conduct and document a WCS, must coordinate emergency response activities with local responders, and must certify compliance as part of the RMP submission.  \n\nBased on this information, the 283-W Facility is a Program 1 process. \n\nProcesses subject to Program 1:\n\n? Need not identify one WCS for all toxics and one alternative scenario for each toxic chemical/substance\n\n? Need not identify one WCS and one alternative scenario for each flammable chemical \n\n? Need not conduct a refined modeling analysis\n\n? Need not develop an accident prevention program.\n \nToxic endpoints have been established in the RM Program guidance for chlorine.  The toxic endpoint for chlorine is 0.0087 milligrams per liter.  \n\nThe WCS assumed a complete release from one cylinder (2,000 lbs.) of chlorine.  Using the U.S. Environmental Protection Age"

The effected population was estimated at 914 people located within the effected area.  Because this area of the Hanford Site is not accessible to the public, no public receptors are within the WCS release area.  As a Program 1 process, no alternative release scenario was conducted as part of this RM Program.  However, alternative release scenarios were conducted during facility hazard assessments and analyses.\n\nAccording to the Hanford Site Environmental Report for Calendar Year 2002, Appendix G (PNNL 14295), there are no plants or mammals on the federal list of endangered and threatened wildlife and plants within the WCS release area.  However, one bird (bald eagle) and two fish (spring run chinook salmon and steelhead) species are on the list of threatened and endangered species.  Furthermore, two species of plants (Umtanum desert buckwheat and White Bluffs bladderpod), one species of mammal (Washington ground squirrel), and one species of bird (western sage grouse) were candidates for listing under the Endangered Species Act of 1973.  In addition, 11 species of plants and six species of birds were cited as being listed as either threatened or endangered by Washington State. \n\nA review of information from the Hanford Site Occurrence reporting system and discussions with 283-W Facility personnel reveals that there have been no known onsite or offsite deaths, injuries, significant property damage or offsite environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place for the last 5 years from the 283-W Facility. \n\nBecause the eligibility analysis concluded that the 283-W Facility is a Program 1 process, development of an accident prevention program is not required. \n\nThe chlorine system operations and maintenance are performed using pre-approved procedures.

Facility emergency operating procedures provide immediate emergency response and personnel protection actions for facility personnel.  Sitewide emergency response procedures provide for notification to local, and community emergency response agencies and organizations.  The facility chlorine leak detector and alarm notification systems are tested weekly to ensure reliability. \n\nThe Building Emergency Plan for the 283-W (HNF-IP-0263-283W) was developed in accordance with RM Program guidelines (EPA 550 B 98-010).  This plan includes procedures for, or references to, procedures for informing the public and emergency response agencies if an accidental release should occur.  Procedures also include requirements for documentation of proper first aid and emergency medical treatment necessary to treat human exposure, and procedures and measures necessary for emergency response after an accidental release. \n\nAdditionally, training drills are scheduled quarterly at the facility and a chlorine release drill is conducted annually in an attempt to continually improve safety. \n  \nREFERENCES:\n\nWAC 246-290, ?Drinking Water Regulations,?
