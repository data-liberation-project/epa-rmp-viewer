This electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the Pasco facility located at 1010 East Kartchner Pasco, Washington 99301. The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Pasco Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident. The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Pasco facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release (even though a release is unlikely) will be implemented in a proper and timely manner. \n\n\n\nPURPOSE OF RMP\n\n\n\nHelena has filed this RMP because it plans to store anhydrous ammonia in railcars.  An independent contractor will react the ammonia with phosphoric acid and water to make liquid fertilizer. The independent contractor will be responsible for all covered processes upon its arrival onsite.  Helena will be resonsible for the storage of ammonia in railcars only when the railcars arrive at the facility in advance of the contractor's arrival.\n\n\n\nFACILITY\n\n\n\nThe Pasco Facility is an agricultural chemical blending and distribution facility. Anhydrous ammonia is unloaded from a railcar and batch processed through a reactor.  The process operations conducted at this facility are performed by an independent contractor.  The independent contractor performs the batch reactor operations using a mobile pipe reactor. The batch operations consist of unloading the anhydrous ammonia from the railcar into the reactor and mixing it with water and phosphoric acid to produce ammonium phosphate fertilizer. The contractor is responsible to OSHA for Process Safety Management compliance and to EPA for Risk Management Planning compliance.  Helena Chemical Company does not own or operate "

      "SummaryText": "the contractor reaction process.\n\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nWorst case and alternative consequence analyses were completed for the ammonia storage process. The worst case scenario release for the Pasco Facility assumed that all the contents in a single railcar were released. The release was modeled as if the railcar was punctured on the side at the ground level. The resulting release of ammonia was modeled as a ground level horizontal jet.\n\n\n\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario assumes the rupture of a three inch hose caused by an impact from a vehicle or some other source during a major loading or unloading operation. Although this event is classified as an alternative scenario, even an accident of this type is unlikely to occur due to the safety equipment and operating procedures that the contractor will use to safeguard ammonia transfer operations.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Helena Operations Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Pasco Facility.  The Operations Manager is assisted by other Helena staff, as directed.  The fertilizer reacting process, including the transfer of ammonia, is implemented by an independent Fertilizer Reacting Contractor.  The Management System is summarized with an organization chart in the RMP.\n\n\n\nTo ensure that its Fertilizer Reacting Contractor is responsible to Helena for complying with relevant operation, maintenance, training procedures and documentation, the Fertilizer Reacting Contractor must at a minimum:\n\n\n\n1.  Have in place and certify compliance with an OSHA Process Safety Management Plan (PSM) and EPA Risk Management Plan (RMP);\n\n\n\n2.  Make available to Helena and EPA upon request any documentation necessary to comply with the PSM and RMP;\n\n\n\n3.  Certify that is has in place emergency shut-down procedures for ammonia unloading and reactor operations and that its PSM and RMP programs comply with federal, state, and local regulatory requirements.\n\n\n\nThe Helena Opera"

      "SummaryText": "tions Manager will be responsible for evaluating the Fertilizer Reacting Contractor?s past performance under the RMP program and for providing notification to the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and Fire Department when its Fertilizer Reacting Contractor intends to operate the reactor.  (A certification statement that the notification process has occurred is included in the Contractor Evaluation Form provided in the RMP.) All of Helena?s fertilizer reacting contractors subject to this standard will be required to acknowledge and sign an Independent Contractor Certification Statement which is provided in the RMP.  Helena will provide a copy of its Contingency Plan to its contractors for review and implementation of emergency notification procedures.  A copy of the Helena RMP will be available for the independent contractor?s review at the Helena facility.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nHelena Chemical Company?s Pasco Facility is a non-responding facility. Helena has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency response agency and local fire department.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no on-site deaths, injuries or significant property damage; or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place, in the past five (5) years because of the ammonia operations at the Pasco Facility.\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\n\nThe Risk Management Plan implemented by Helena Chemical Company at the Pasco Facility complies with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r). The RMP will be updated as the Pasco Facility adds, deletes or changes processes. The Emergency Response Program has been coordinated with the Franklin county LEPC."
