Recommendations from the audits are promptly converted into action plans.\n\nIncident Investigation\nSignificant environmental, safety, or health incidents at the facility are fully investigated by appropriate teams to determine root cause and to put in place action plans designed to prevent recurrence.  The findings are documented and communicated to facility personnel.\n\nEmployee Participation\nEmployee participation is the cornerstone of our safety philosophy .  Plant operators, maintenance technicians, and engineers, as well as supervisors and managers participate fully in Hazard and Operability Studies and incident investigations.

The plan also specifies rigorous training and exercise schedules for all responders.  All personnel are required to be properly equipped and qualified before they are allowed to perform critical response procedures.\n\nAs part of the ongoing training program for responders, we regularly perform readiness exercises.  These include both tabletop planning sessions as well as full field responses to simulated incidents in the plant.  Additionally, we conduct joint exercises with the County and City Emergency Response Agencies and work closely to coordinate emergency response actions with them.  Pioneer is also an active member Clark County Local Emergency Planning Committee that provides resources for emergency response to other area facilities.\n\nThe plant is equipped with a facility-wide alarm system.  As soon as the alarm system is triggered, response teams assemble immediately; including those assigned the task of making critical notifications.  Current emergency phone numbers are maintained in the control room of the facility and also in the Emergency Action Plan, which is immediately available in several critical areas of the plant, so that timely notifications can be made.\n\nAnother key safety feature at the plant is the facility-wide chlorine-monitoring network that can detect chlorine at very low concentrations.  Operations personnel monitor the real-time readings from the chlorine sensors and will respond immediately to any detection.  Additionally, the facility utilizes a computer modeling system that can help to plan potential scenarios and develop appropriate responses.\n\n\nHypothetical Models\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency has defined the Worst Case Scenario as the hypothetical rupture and full release of all contents of the facility's largest storage tank, assuming all safeguards have failed, during extreme"

While the probability of this scenario coming to pass at any facility is extremely low, it does provide a template for emergency response planning.  The computer generated model for our largest chlorine tank results in a planning zone of up to 18 miles.\n\nThe EPA has specified in the RMP rule that each facility must define a specific Alternate Scenario that could have an off site impact, based on plant operations.  This scenario is to be modeled using the actual safeguards that are in place, during typical weather conditions.  After a thorough review of our facility, we have selected the hypothetical rupture of a loading line while actively loading a chlorine rail car.  It should be noted at this point that this facility has never experienced chlorine loading hose rupture.\n\nOur loading system includes two sets of automatic valves that are specifically designed for this application, which would close immediately if a loading hose were to rupture.  The computer generated model for this hypothetical scenario results in a possible impact of up to 0.4 miles from the loading station.\n\nFive Year Release History\n\nWith no incidents to report on its Five-Year Accident History the Henderson facility is proud of it's record.

      "SummaryText": "Introduction \n\nPioneer Chlor Alkali Company, Inc. in Henderson, Nevada, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Pioneer Companies of Houston Texas. Pioneer Companies is a major producer of Chlor-alkali products in the United States.  The Henderson Plant is a medium sized manufacturing facility that presently produces sodium hydroxide (caustic soda), chlorine, muriatic acid (HCL) and sodium hypochlorite (bleach).  The raw materials and resources consumed manufacturing in the operation are salt (sodium chloride), water, and electricity. The technology employed to convert these materials into finished products is the Diamond Shamrock's modified diaphragm cell for making caustic soda and chlorine.  The second is Union Carbide's graphite equipment train for making muriatic acid, and the third is Swenson's Quadruple Effect Evaporation unit for evaporating the caustic soda to a 50 percent solution.\n\nFacility History \n\nPioneer purchased the Henderson Facility in October 1988 from a subsidiary of ICI Americas, Inc. (ICI).  ICI acquired the facility in connection with the purchase of Stauffer Chemical Company (Stauffer), which bought the facility from the State of Nevada in 1952, after having leased and operated the facility since 1945.  \n\nDemographic Profile \n\nThe Pioneer facility is located in the southeastern corner of the Las Vegas Valley within the city of Henderson.  A 10-mile radius circle surrounding the facility includes all of Henderson, a portion of southern and eastern Las Vegas, and the western portion of Boulder City.

The prevailing winds average 7-11 miles per hour.  In the absence of storms and regional atmospheric circulation patterns, there is a diurnal wind flow.  The typical diurnal flow system occurs when cool, dense air in the mountains moves downslope into the valleys during the nigh, and then reverses to flow upslope during the day as the valley heats up relative to the mountains.\n\n\nRegulated Substances At The Henderson Plant\n\nChlorine is the only chemical at the Henderson Plant that which falls under the RMP regulations although Pioneer has practiced risk management and prevention for many years throughout all areas of the facility.  Chlorine is classified by EPA as a Highly Hazardous Material (HHM) thus subject to RMP.\n\nHHM\nNAME      CHEM"
