      "SummaryText": "Advanced Comfort Products, Inc. (ACPI) owns and operates a polyurethane foam manufacturing facility at 1900 W. Lusher Ave in Elkhart, Indiana.  ACPI receives raw materials at its facility, mixes the materials to produce a polyurethane bun on a foam production line.  The bun is then cured and stored on site prior to shipping to customers.  Some limited fabrication takes place at the facility.  The polyurethane foam produced by Flexible Foam is used in many common household products, including seat cushions, bedding and pillows, and many other products where soft foam cushions are required.\r\n\r\nOne of the components used in the production of polyurethane foam is toluene diisocyanate (TDI).  This compound is subject to EPA's Risk Management Rule.\r\n\r\nToluene diisocyanate is delivered to the Lusher Avenue Facility in tank trucks.  The trucks are off-loaded to storage tanks located inside the building.  Because the storage of TDI takes place inside the building within a room designed for secondary concrete containment of the storage tank, the probablity of release on the surrounding community is mitigated.  There are no receptors (buildings or people other than ACPI employees) that would be impacted by the release of stored toluene diisocyanate.\r\n\r\nBecause there are no public receptors and there have been no accidents or releases in the last five years, ACPI's Lusher Avenue facility is classified as \"Program 1\" facility.  Because of this classification, there is no Risk Management structured prevention programs required.  However ACPI does have a written emergency action plan and hazardous materials emergency contingency plan and coordinates regularly with the Elkhart Fire Department Hazmat Team with annual inspections and cooperative planning efforts."
