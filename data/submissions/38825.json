If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Fort Worth Fire Department and Tarrant LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency.  Also, StyroChem has a contract agreement with Garner Environmental Services to respond in case of some specific types of releases.\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription of your facility and the regulated substances handled:  \n\nThis facility manufactures expanded polystyrene (EPS).  Our customers use the EPS to manufacture polystyrene foam products.  Pentane impregnation converts polystyrene beads into EPS.  The pentane system consists of one underground pentane storage tank, a holding tank, three reactors, and associated pipes, valves, and other miscellaneous equipment.\n\n\n\n\n\nWorst-case release scenario:  \n\nPer EPA requirements, our worst-case scenario is a failure of the pentane storage tank resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  There are no residence houses, schools, hospitals, churches, or parks within the distance to the endpoint.  The facility is located in an industrial park, and there are only businesses within the distance to the endpoint.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario:  \n\nOur alternative scenario is a pipe rupture resulting in a pool fire.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:  \n\nThe facility will comply with EPA's accident provisions and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The pentane system is designed and maintained in accordance with the good engineering practices.\n\n\n\n\n\nFive-year accident history:  \n\nThe five year accident history was prepared in accordance with 68.42.  The accidents reported in the RMP data elements only include accidents related to a regulated chemical that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site or known offsite deaths, injuries, evac"

We have discussed this policy with the fire department and LEPC representatives.  Sylvania facility has an emergency notification action plan and trains its employees in the appropriate procedures.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:  \n\nStyroChem has already implemented many elements of Process Safety Management (PSM).  StyroChem believes that safety is a never-ending process.  We will continue to evaluate and improve safety for the life of the process.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
