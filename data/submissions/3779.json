Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\n\nThe management and employees of Stpehenson Service Company are committed to the \nprevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental \nrelease should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire \ndepartment, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact \nof the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for \nsale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for \ndirect application as a crop production nutrient.  Access to the site is restricted to \nauthorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized \ncontractors.\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be \n400,000  pounds.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a \nstorage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum \nquantity released would be 140,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the \nlargest storage tank as limited by design standards. \n \nThe distance to the endpoint of .14 mg/L for the worst-case scenario is 2.5 \nmiles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a \nrelease from a break in a transfer hose.\n  \nThe distance to the endpoint of .14 mg/L for the alternative scenario is .19 \nmiles.  This release has the possibility of extending beyond the facility boundary.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all \napplicable state codes and regulations.  This facility has implemented the provisions \nof \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-\n61.1\", published by The American"

Five year accident history.  \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years \nthat:\n- have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the \nfacility; nor\n- to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter \nin place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. The emergency response program.\n\nThe facility has:\n- a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR \n1910.38;\n- provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community \nright-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n- a written emergency response plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR \n1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety. \n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are \nperformed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no specific \nsafety recommendations for implementation at this time."
