              "Description": "The RMP requirements under Program 3 outline safety programs that must be developed to minimize the likelihood of an ammonia release. These requirements are largely met through its compliance with the OSHA PSM regulations. Specifically, process safety information, operating procedures, pre startup safety review, mechanical integrity, hot work permit, contractors, and management of change contribute to safe operation of the system developed for compliance with the PSM Program which will ensure that ammonia releases are minimized.\n\nClemens has developed and implemented a number of standard operating procedures (SOP) associated with operating and maintaining its ammonia refrigeration system. These procedures outline steps for each operating phase, operating limits, health and safety considerations, as well as safety systems and their functions. The procedures outline safe work practices to provide for the control of hazards during operations. The process complies with good engineering practices, and procedures are in place for maintaining mechanical integrity and planning for change. Employees are trained in safe operation of the system, health and safety hazards associated with handling ammonia and emergency procedures with respect to specific job tasks. In addition, Clemens has designated the Clemens Utilities Supervisor with overall responsibility for PSM and RMP implementation. ",

      "SummaryText": "Clemens Food Group uses anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) in its refrigeration systems; ammonia is a regulated substance as listed in 40 CFR Part 68 [Table 1 to ? 68.130]. Clemens has developed this Risk Management Program (RMP) Plan to document completion of the RMP requirements. Clemens has developed the worst-case and alternative release scenarios described in the rules and determined areas which could be impacted. Because a worst-case release could have offsite consequences and Clemens is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management requirements, the facility is subject to the Program 3 Requirements under the RMP.  Clemens has adopted an Emergency Action Plan, included as Appendix 1, which outlines its internal procedures for responding to spills and releases, notification requirements, and coordination with the local emergency response organizations in the event of an ammonia release that cannot be contained and has the potential to have offsite impacts. Clemens has been actively involved in emergency response planning. They have worked with the local emergency management agency to coordinate offsite response activities. "
