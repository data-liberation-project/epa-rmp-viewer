As such, safety during all phases of this process is\nof utmost importance to the ownership, senior management, supervisors, and employees. \nContinual monitoring is performed by management and staff on both, process\u0012 and\npersonnel, to assure a satisfactory level of safety is being achieved.  Any condition found\nsuspect is analyzed and corrected.  ABC periodically trains employees as to the safe\nhandling of chemicals and machinery.  Departure from established safety practices by an\nemployee is not tolerated.\n     As mentioned previously, ABC is involved in the business of  manufacturing and\ndistributing various cleaners and related products.  Our facility is located within the\nbounds of the Great Southwest Industrial district in Grand Prairie, Texas.  Our 50,000\nsquare feet plant sits upon approximately four acres.  We package the cleaners into\nvarious containers including, aerosol cans, gallon and quart bottles, drums, and totes.  A\nvariety of chemicals, both hazardous and non-hazardous, are used in producing the\ncleaners and other compounds.  Of particular concern to the EPA per Section 112(r) of\nthe Clean Air Act is the storage and usage of approximately two thousand to sixteen\nthousand gallons of Liquefied Petroleum Gas.  These gasses are stored in liquid form by\npressurization in two certified nine thousand gallon capacity vessels located on the back\nlot of the property.  They come in two blends, known generically as A-85 and A-46. \nThese blends are naturally occurring hydrocarbons used as the aerosol propellant.\n     The worst case release scenario in regards to the LPG tanks would be the total release\nand ignition of the hydrocarbon blends.  The resulting explosion would have an off-site\nimpact of approximately 0.3 mile radius.  This is based upon the RMP.Comp model\npr"

ABC, with the counsel and recommendations of the Texas Railroad\nCommission, and local fire departments has installed hardware and safety systems making\nthe worst-case scenario highly unlikely.  The above ground tanks housing the LPG are\ncertified and periodically inspected for integrity and leaks.  Any signs of potential\nproblems are immediately repaired.  All pumps and associated switches used in the transfer\nprocess are explosion proof.  Emergency shut off switches are strategically located,\nallowing for quick shutdown of the tank pumps.  High flow water canons surround the\ntank and are used to deluge the tank with water to keep them cool in the event of an\nencroaching fire.  As one might expect, extensive training and care is used in the area of\nLPG transfer.\n     ABC has demonstrated compliance with Process Safety Management.  A thorough\nanalysis of the LPG tank, process, technology, and equipment have been conducted.  Daily\nvisual and audible inspections are performed on the tank and piping to detect any possible\nleaks.  If any are found, they are repaired immediately.\n     There have been no accidents or releases with respect to the LPG tanks in the previous\nfive years, nor in the years before.\n     The emergency response program at ABC begins at the ground level with our\nemployees.  A team of qualified personnel have been trained in the areas of detection and\ncorrection of  an accidental release of LPG  A local emergency response company, Protect\nEnvironmental Service, Inc., is on contract to respond to any large release of LPG that\nmay occur.  Periodic inspections and education is provided by the local fire department. \nMaterial Safety Data Sheets have been provided to the local fire department in the event\nof a release and the Local Emergency Planning Committee has been sent all required\ninformation including the Texas Tier II.  \n     ABC is constantly participating in any pertinent safety or instructional training offered\nby various org"
