This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, gas plant trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n \n DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n \n The Chevron Taft 1C gas plant, located near Taft, California, U.S.A., operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane, and gasoline) from natural gas.  The 1C gas plant has several regulated flammables, such as propane and butane. We provide natural gas sales that consist of methane, ethane, and traces of propane to field operations for fuel. Our storage facilities store propane products that consist of propane, trace of ethane, normal butane and iso-butane. Butane storage product contains normal butane and  isobutane and traces of propane and natural gasoline.\n \n OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n \n The WCS associated with a release of flammable substances in Program Level 2  processes at the gas plant is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank containing propane.  A written procedure is in place to limit the storage inventory to 128,000 lbs. (90% of the maximum tank capacity), however the likelihood of filling the storage tank to 100% capacity (140,000 lbs) stll exist and is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.

The resulting endpoint extends offsite however there are  public receptors (active oil pumping units from a neighboring oil company)  within the distance to the endpoint.\n \n The ARS for flammable substances at the gas plant is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) resulting from the release of propane (107,000 lbs or 75% of the maximum tank capacity) of the largest propane storage tank and a 4\" pressure relief valve malfunctions,  lifts, and released in 1 hour.   No active mitigation is initiated by operations due to storage tanks proximity from control room.  This event was selected as being a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response.  The resulting endpoint extends offsite however there are no public receptors within the distance to the endpoint.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant. Because processes at the gas plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Chevron Taft 1C gas plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are docu"

In addition, the gas plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issue.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.  Also all plant operators are encouraged to participate in company Safety Suggestion program to provide operator's input to improve safety in plant operations, to be involve in Near Miss program which provides operator's personal situation in preventing accidents, and Behavorial Based Safety Training program which gives operators an opportunity to observe other operators in work situations and discuss safety suggestion for at risk behavior or commend operator's safe conduct.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Chevron Taft 1C gas plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for essential process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the gas plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).

The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n \nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Chevron Taft 1C gas plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Chevron Taft 1C gas plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures.

This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Chevron Taft 1C gas plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.   These procedures are periodically reviewed through Job Safety Analysis (JSA) program by two or more operators to analyzed tasks, to identify possible hazards, to ensure safeguards in place and follow through with recommendations and modifications to improve job safety. Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) are certified as current and accurate annually. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.

This information is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their tasks.\n \nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations the Chevron Taft 1C gas plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a qualified operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through oral and written tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted yearly.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Chevron Taft 1C gas plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices "

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure those safety features; procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all-supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Chevron Taft 1C gas plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.

Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.  \n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Chevron Taft 1C gas plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and those proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Chevron Taft 1C gas plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process-operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change, and (3) ensure the change is communicated to affected personnel.   Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Chevron Taft 1C gas plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, significant toxic gas release, major property damage, significant environmental damage, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to gas plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.

      "SummaryText": "ts\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, The Chevron Taft 1C gas plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits (Level I PSM Audits) are facilitated by corporate staff and  are conducted at least every 3 years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to gas plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.  Also Level II and Level III PSM Audits are initiated by local staff to ensure continous compliance.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at the Chevron Taft 1C gas plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility. All Chemicals newly introduced to the Chevron Taft 1C Gas Plant has to have MOC document, Product Acceptance certification approved by the Facilities Engineer, Environmental Safety Specialist, Chevron Chemical Group and the Operations Supervisor. All Chemicals delivered to the facility must be accompanied by a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS). Chemical truck drivers are required to follow Plant entry procedures that involve signing of the Sign In/Sign Out log and safety orientation overview training. Operator on duty has to check the area with gas detectors before letting the truck into the Gas Plant. Operator has to supervise the driver during the unloading process to ensure that chemical will go to the right storage or container.\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all "

Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe Chevron Taft 1C gas plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\nRelease Detection\n\n1. Hydrocarbon detectors with high LEL shutdown alarms.\n2. Fire detectors located in the engine room and LTS plant to alarm presence of fire and shutdown process.\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n1. Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\n\n2. Emergency Shutdown System to activate valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated) and to shut down compression system.\n\n3. Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g. high or low temperatures, pressures, levels, flow)\n\n4. Curbing or berms to contain chemical and liquid releases\n\n5. Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system, backup utility generators)\n\n6. Atmospheric pressure relief devices.\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n1. Fire monitors\n\n2. Trained emergency response personnel\n\n3. Personal protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus)\n\n4. Blast-resistant buildings to help protect control systems and personnel.\n\n FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Chevron Taft 1C gas plant has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past 5 years. There have been zero incidents in the frequency of accidental releases in the past 5 years resulting in offsite effects.  We will investigate every incident very carefully to determine ways to prevent similar incidents from recurring.  We have never had an accident involving the regulated flam"

We have also access to NPGA's LP-Gas Handbook dealing with specific hazardous chemical and controlled substance.  Another emergency response source can be found in Taft Area DOT Department of Transportation binder involving LPG lines outside the plant area and is maintained by DOT coordinator.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans, and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the plant has site-specific procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to gas plant processes or other gas plant facilities.  The emergency response program changes are administered through the Management of Change  (MOC) process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\nThe overall emergency response program the Chevron Taft"
