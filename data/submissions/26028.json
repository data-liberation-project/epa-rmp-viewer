THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\n\n       THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF A\n       STORAGE TANK RELEASED AS A GAS OVER 10 MINUTES.  THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED\n       WOULD BE 84,000 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE LARGEST STORAGE TANK\n       AS LIMITEED BY DESIGN STANDARDS.\n\n       THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT OF .14 MG/L FOR THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO IS 2.0 MILES.\n\n       THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO BASED ON THE MOST LIKELY POTENTIAL INCIDENT IS A \n       RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A TRANSF"
