The same properties that makes anhydrous ammonia valuable as a cold \n\nstorage refrigerant chemical, also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in \n\nhandling anhydrous ammonia. Overall, the prevention of unnecessary human exposure, reducing \n\nthe threat to our own personal health as well as our co-worker, and reducing the threat to nearby \n\nmembers of the community is the main goal of incorporating this risk management plan into our \n\ndaily operations.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and \n\nregulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle anhydrous ammonia \n\ncombined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, with the safe handling \n\nprocedures that we utilize, and the training of our personnel.  \n\n\n\nOur emergency response program was developed with the assistance of Environmental Services \n\nGroup, Inc.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of Pulaski \n\nCounty 911 System for 911 call-out to affected responding agencies, the North Little Rock \n\nFire Department, then the notification of Ed Hansberry Plant Manager @ 501-803-0441 \n\n(24 Hours), the North Little Rock Fire Department and North Little Rock Police \n\nDepartment will help to notify and evacuate any potentially affected neighbors by utilizing \n\nvehicles with PA mounted announcing systems.  The 911 System will also notify Pulaski \n\nCounty LEPC.  \n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to cool and/or freeze storage compartments by utilizing \n\nanhydrous ammonia. Anhydrous ammonia is stored in storage vessels located at the north \n\nside of the facility.  Anhydrous ammonia is fed into the cooling system for cold storage.  \n\nThe system is a two-stage pump re-circulated ammonia refrigeration system.  The Hi Stage \n\nCompressor serves the Freezer, Coolers, and the Lo Stage "

Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized \n\nmanagement personnel, and authorized contractors.  \n\n\n\nThe regulated substance handled at the 10000 Crystal Hill Rd. location is anhydrous ammonia.  \n\nThe maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored at this plant is 18,573 pounds.  \n\nThis amount is an aggregate found in the storage vessel, as well as the entire cold storage system.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario is failure of my largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount \n\nallowed would release 18,573 pounds of anhydrous ammonia from the 10000 Crystal Hill Rd. \n\nPassive mitigation was considered for this scenario. It is assumed that the entire contents are \n\nreleased as vapor.  The distance to the endpoint of 0.14 mg/l for the worst-case scenario is 1.7 \n\nmiles.  This location is classified as rural due to the minimal amounts of obstructions around the \n\nsite.\n\n\n\nAn alternative scenario was determined for this facility. An estimation, based on the operational \n\nflow rate, cross section area of pipe, operational pressure of pipe, and the change in elevation of \n\nthe pipe. Using the RMP Comp software, a release from this type of pipe would result in a \n\nrelease of approximately 180 pounds per minute released into the atmosphere.  This release \n\nwas due to relief valve lifting for 10 minutes. This amount of vapor ammonia release would result in a \n\ndistance to endpoint of approximately 0.1 miles.  \n\n\n\nThis cold storage facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all \n\napplicable state codes and regulations. \n\n\n\nOur emergency response program was developed with the assistance "
