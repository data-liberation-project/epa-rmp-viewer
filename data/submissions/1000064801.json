      "SummaryText": "Agropur is a dairy product manufacturer located in the City of Weyauwega, Waupaca\n\nCounty, Wisconsin. The facility produces cheese from milk purchased from area farmers.\n\nThe processing of these dairy products requires the use of anhydrous ammonia. Milk that arrives at the\n\nfacility, as well as the products produced at the facility must be kept refrigerated to maintain quality and\n\nshelf-life. As a result of this need for refrigeration, Agropur utilizes an anhydrous ammonia system. The\n\nsystem contains approximately 13,343 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\nAmmonia, although a necessary component of Agropur's processing, can be dangerous to employees and\n\ncontractors, as well as the general public in the vicinity of the plant if released in an uncontrolled manner in\n\nsufficient quantities. Agropur has recognized the inherent risks with the use of anhydrous ammonia and has\n\ndeveloped and implemented a Risk Management Program (RMP) to: prevent accidental releases of ammonia;\n\nand, respond appropriately to accidental releases of ammonia.\n\n\n\nAgropur's prevention program for ammonia consists of the following elements.\n\n\n\n1) Safety information for ammonia has been gathered and evaluated to assist Agropur employees in\n\nunderstanding the hazards associated with the process. This information formed a basis for other prevention\n\nprogram elements to minimize the potential for accidental releases.\n\n2) A process hazard assessment (PHA) was completed. The purpose of the evaluation was to identify, evaluate and control\n\nthe hazards of the process.\n\n\n\n3) Written standard operating procedures (SOPs) were developed so employees and contractors have access to written instructions for the safe operation and maintenance of the ammonia process.\n\n\n\n4) Employees at Agropur have been trained, and will continue to be trained, on the job and in the classroom,\n\non aspects of the prevention program and the emergency action plan (EAP).\n\n\n\n5) A preventive maintenance system has been developed to ass"

Prior to startup of any new or modified system, Agropur\n\nwill conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the changes and modify the RMP to incorporate the new or\n\nmodified system.\n\n\n\n7) Employees at Agropur have been part of the development of the RMP and will have a role in the continuous\n\nimprovement of the program.\n\n\n\n8) Any incident, accident or near miss associated with the ammonia system will be investigated thoroughly\n\nand promptly with a committment to make improvements to the RMP.\n\n\n\n9) As part of the continuous improvement process, Agropur will conduct audits at least once every three (3)\n\nyears to identify and correct any parts of the RMP that are not functioning up to their standards. These\n\naudits are in addition to the continuous improvement process.\n\n\n\n10) Agropur will make sure its contractors onsite are aware of the hazards associated with the ammonia\n\nsystem to protect all parties (contractors, employees, neighbors). For specific tasks that require an even\n\nhigher degree of oversight (such as welding, cutting or grinding around the ammonia system components),\n\nAgropur will require its employees and contractors to obtain internal permits for hot work that mandate\n\nspecial prevention measures.\n\n\n\nAgropur has developed and implemented an EAP to protect public health, the\n\nenvironment and onsite employees and contractors. Employees have been trained on the aspects of the\n\nfacility's Emergency Action Plan. Systems are in place to inform the public and the Waupaca County Emergency Government\n\nin the event of a release.\n\n\n\nAlthough the main purpose of the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (40 CFR 68) is to develop and\n\nimplement programs to prevent releases of toxic substances and accidents with flammable substances, the\n\nfederal rule als"

These scenarios were determined using the EPA's RMPComp online tool.\n\n\n\nAgropur has not had an accident with ammonia in the last five (5) years that would require reporting under this rule.\n\nAgropur has demonstrated their committment to minimize the potential for accidental releases and thus protect their employees, neighbors and the surrounding environment in the following manner:\n\n\n\n  - committing significant resources to the training of operation and maintenance personnel;\n\n  - hiring external consultants and contractors to provide a high level of program competance; and,\n\n  - dedicating themselves to the continuous improvement of the prevention program at Agropur to further minimize the potential for accidental exposures."
