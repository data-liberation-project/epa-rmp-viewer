      "SummaryText": "This Executive Summary contains 2 Sisters Food Group?s administrative and operational programs to prevent ammonia-related accidents and reduce potential risks.  The regulated substance of concern and focus of this document is anhydrous ammonia.  The following topics are addressed in this Executive Summary:\n\n? Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n? Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\n? Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n? Emergency Response Plan\n? Five Year Accident History\n? Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n? Data Elements\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n2 Sisters Food Group is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is reflected in a comprehensive accidental release prevention program. This program addresses the design, installation, operation, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process solution equipment at the facility. \n\n2 Sisters Food Group senior management is not only committed to offering superior service, but also to maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities. 2 Sisters Food Group?s safety and environmental policies as they relate to the ammonia refrigeration system are administered by the Director of Engineering, who conducts inspections of the facility to ensure compliance.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe system at 15555 Meridian Parkway in Riverside, California was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the Uniform Mechanical Code, the Uniform Building Code, the Electrical Code, the California Fire Code, and the Uniform Fire Code at the time of construction.  The facility was constructed in 2007/2008.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is a closed system that cycles the refrigerant from liquid to gas and back again.  The system, consi"

      "SummaryText": "sting of vessels, piping, valves, and process equipment, cycles 15,000 pounds of ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for dock operations, cooler and freezer storage.  The majority of the system is located in the engine room including vessels and compressors.  The condensers are mounted on the roof, and the evaporators are located in their respective cold areas.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe 2 Sisters Food Group ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with Cal/OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.  The facility conducts maintenance and any necessary minor repairs in house, but an outside contractor is hired for major repairs.\n\nThe facility including the ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code, which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety features include ammonia sensors in the engine room as well as sensors near the evaporators, and automatic shut down systems.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine room and just outside of the engine room (condensers).  All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that are commonly piped to the water diffusion tank.\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, 2 Sisters Food Group has developed a preventive maintenance program to complete regularly scheduled inspections and tests of the ammonia refrigeration system as well as repairs as needed to process equipment.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nThe 2 Sisters Food Group facility has an emergency response plan in effect.

      "SummaryText": " Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP/CalARP document, which is maintained at the facility:\n\n  1.) To save lives.\n  2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n  3.) To protect the environment.\n  4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nThe 2 Sisters Food Group facility maintains a safety committee whose members include the designated incident commander for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\nIn case of an ammonia emergency, the facility plans to evacuate all employees in the facility.  The 2 Sisters Food Group maintains an Emergency Response Team that is HazMat trained.  The Emergency Response Team will respond to ammonia incidents in coordination with the local emergency responders (fire department hazardous materials division). The 2 Sisters Food Group facility plans to coordinate emergency response efforts with the fire department on a periodic and ongoing basis.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no reportable incidents at 2 Sisters Food Group in the past five years (May 2003 ? May 2008) as the facility is brand new in the year 2008. [CCR Title 8, ? 5189(e)(2)(G)]\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Hazards Analysis (performed in two phases), including a Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study and a Facility Inspection, provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the 2 Sisters Food Group facility located at 15555 Meridian Parkway in Riverside, California. The 2 Sisters Food Group safety committee is planning to complete several items over the next year, as a cont"
