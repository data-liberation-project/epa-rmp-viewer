PLZ-GA manufactures various organic and water based solvent cleaners and pesticides as janitorial aerosol products. The primary AST storage material and transfer operations takes place in a central portion of the facility with storm water discharges also leaving this area to the south. The facility operates 8  propellant tanks with tanks used for propane blends including: one 18,000 gallon tank for NP-70, nne 12,000 gallon tank for NP-85, one 18,000 gallon tank for NP-46, one 9,000 gallon tank for A-108; one 18,000 gallon tank for 152a; one 5,500 gallon tank for NP-31; one 5,500 gallon tank for DME; and a single 30,000 gallon tank for CO2. These tanks are located in the central courtyard on the northeast side of the production plant.  Production chemicals are stored in drums or totes and also within the ASTs. Finished products are stocked in the warehouse areas and shipped off-property through the loading dock area adjacent to the warehouse. Liquid process chemical deliveries are made directly to the tank farm via tanker truck to permanent piping systems.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Plan:  \n\n\n\nOur written Emergency Response plan is written in accordance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Regulations 29 CFR 1910.38.  The purpose of the plan is to ensure the protection of our employees in an emergency situation (fire, tornado, chemical spill, or other emergency).  We do not maintain a fire brigade, but do maintain fire response equipment such as hand held fire extinguishers for small fires.  The plan includes procedures for notification of the local emergency authorities.  In the event of an emergency involving our propane system, it is our policy to notify the Dalton Fire Department and request that they help respond to the emergency. We have coordinated our resp"
