These core values include: \n\u0095\tOperating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations. \n\u0095\tOperating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that the risk of unintentional releases are minimized.\n\u0095\tOperating and maintaining assets in such a manner that promotes the health and safety of all employees, contractors , and visitors. \n\u0095\tContinuously striving to improve.\n\nIn addition, the following specific programs are in place:\n\nEmployee Participation\nPlacid and contract employees are involved in all aspects of the Process Safety Management Program as required by 29 CFR 1910.119(c) and 40 CFR 68.83.  Placid employees are kept apprised of Process Safety Management issues through various means of communication. Placid\u0092s Portal System allows employees to access operational manuals, SDS, safety procedures, and emergency procedures. Placid Learning Management System is Exxtend Learn.  This system is used to provide computer-based employee training and manage training documentation.  It is available twenty four hours per day and is updated regularly by Placid\u0092s Training Department.  The Port Allen Refinery has been an OSHA Star Site since 2006.  In addition, Placid has a VPP Employee Safety Committee that meets weekly. Employee/VPP Safety Meetings are comprised of members from all departments, including contract employees. The suggestions from VPP meetings are posted on the Placid Portal, work orders are written and are tracked to completion. Employees can also access other important safety announcements and information via the Placid Portal.  Safety-related information i"

Placid\u0092s MOC process requires interdepartmental involvement, which ensures that engineering and supervisory level employees have knowledge of the change.  Safety Meetings are held on a periodic basis for all operations, maintenance, laboratory, terminal, administration, and contract personnel. Bulletin boards are positioned throughout the refinery and are used for communication.  Safety suggestions and concerns can be reported directly to Placid Safety personnel or through employee safety committee representatives.  Safety specific work orders can be generated by employees in the Maximo system and are tracked to completion by maintenance and safety personnel.  Near-misses can be submitted through an online submission system and are investigated by area supervisors.  Employees can access near-miss and incident investigation information on the Placid Portal at any time.  All employees, including nested contract employees, are encouraged to participate in Placid\u0092s safety program through the use of a point-based incentive program (CASH Rewards); this program rewards employees for reporting or resolving safety concerns, as well as other safety related activities.\n\nTop-Down safety audits are performed quarterly and are used to encourage open communication between management and front-line employees. During these audits, members of management make field visits to different areas of the refinery.  Employees assigned to the area are encouraged to participate in the audit and are asked to share ideas on how to make the refinery a safer place to work. Any safety concerns discovered during these audits are immediately resolved when possible; work orders are generated when the concern cannot be resolved without maintenance involvement. \n\nPeak Performance Drills are performed on shift by operations personnel.

This training creates the confidence needed to respond and react appropriately during an actual emergency. Critical Task Drills, developed by supervisors on each shift, involve a high-risk routine task in which the supervisor walks through the procedure with frontline workers. This scenario is sent to the Training Department where it can be compared to existing procedures; procedures are modified or developed as needed. The Critical Task Drill is then sent out to all shifts, where it is then reviewed with all affected employees.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nPlacid makes Process Safety Information (PSI) readily available to all employees as required by 29 CFR 1910.119(d) and 40 CFR 68.65.  Placid keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within Placid are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date PSI. \n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Safety Data Sheets.  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals, especially if they are incompatible or mixed product bring new hazards to the operation.  For specific process areas, Placid has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (i.e., temperature, level, composition) in the operation manuals for each process unit.
