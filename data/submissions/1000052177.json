The IC shall refer to the site analysis, use of engineering controls, maximum exposure limits, hazardous substance handling procedures, and the use of any new technologies.\r\n\r\nAfter assessing the hazardous substances and/or conditions present, the IC must implement appropriate emergency operations, and assure that the PPE worn is appropriate for the hazards to be encountered. If the PPE is worn while performing fire fighting operations it must meet the criteria in 1910.156(e). If an employee, while responding to an emergency, is exposed to an inhalation hazard, then the employee must wear positive pressure self-contained breathing apparatus until such time as the IC determines through air monitoring that it is safe to discontinue its use.\r\n\r\nThe IC must limit the number of emergency response personnel at the emergency site to those who are actively performing emergency operations. Operations in hazardous areas should be performed using the buddy system in groups of two or more (two in-two out).\r\n\r\nThe IC must designate a safety official who will identify and evaluate hazards and oversee the safety of the operations. When this safety official judges it to be an IDLH condition and/or to involve an imminent danger conditions, the official must alter, suspend, or terminate the activities.

      "SummaryText": "The Company:\r\n\r\nAcella Polyurethane Systems, LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of Accella Performance Materials. Accella Performance Materials designs and manufactures custom Polyurethane formulations for a wide array of industrial applications.  Accella Polyurethane Systems does not produce any part, but rather supplies these formulations in a liquid state to end product fabricators. Accella Polyurethane Systems has trained technical and quality control staff which does all of the development of our products, follows them through the manufacturing process and tests them for quality before shipment. The site has been in operation for more than 30 years. \r\n\r\nCovered Process:\r\n\r\nSeven batch units are on site in which can produce isocyanate-terminated  polyurethane pre-polymers or quasi-pre-polymers using TDI. An additional batch unit is used to produce hydroxyl-terminated polyurethane prepolymers. In the covered process the isocyanate-terminated polyurethane pre-polymers are manufactured by reacting long chain polyols with Toluene Diisocyanate in a 2/1 molar ratio to produce NCO terminated high viscosity pre-polymer.  These pre-polymers can be chain extended by the end product fabricators with water, short chain polyols, or diamines to produce high molecular weight polymers.  Quasi-pre-polymers are manufactured by reacting only part of the long chain polyol with Toluene Diisocyanate which improves mixing, reduces volatility, improves compatibility, improves the mix ratio balance, reduces the exotherm and helps match viscosity differences. Hydroxyl-terminated polyurethane prepolymers are manufactured by reacting an excess molar ratio of polyol with Toluene Diisocyanate.\r\n\r\nReactors RTR-1 & RTR-2 each have a capacity of 550-6000 gallons.  Reactor RTR-3 has a capacity of 550-5800 gallons. Reactor RTR-4 has a capacity of 300-1350 gallons. Reactor RTR-8 has a capacity of 100-400 gallons. Reactor RTR-11 has a capacity of 275-1930 gallons. Reactor RTR-12 has a capacity of 100"

All reactors are used to manufacture isocyanate-terminated prepolymers, with the exception of RTR-4, which is solely used for the manufacture of hydroxyl-terminated prepolymers. \r\n\r\nDry air is used as a blanket in the storage of the Toluene Diisocyanate, in the reactors, and as a blanket over the products produced. RTR-2, RTR-3, RTR-11, RTR-12 have hot oil jackets used to control the temperature of the reactions. RTR-11 has a cooling water jacket to maintain the temperature of reaction. The requirements to heat or cool the batch is a function of the particular chemistry of the product and subsequent degree of reaction exotherm. MDA Scientific Monitors with TDI keys are used to monitor levels of Toluene Diisocyanate.  The Monitors sounds an alarm if the atmospheric concentration of Toluene Diisocyanate exceeds 5 ppb.\r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History:\r\nAccella Polyurethane Systems has had no accidental releases of Toluene Diisocyanate during the past five years.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program:\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Coordinator is ultimately in charge of the evacuation and seeing that the building and equipment are secured. Unit supervisors, however, will generally decide what shutdown steps are required before and during evacuation.\r\n\r\nThe Incident Commander will inform any or all personnel to vacate portions or all of the facility via the intercom and phone speaker system and to notify the police (911) or local fire department if necessary.  The Incident Commander will notify appropriate government agencies as required. For example, OSHA must be notified if there have been any fatalities or five or more hospitalizations. EPA must be notified on specific spills within 24 hours if quantities are over the threshold amount.\r\n\r\nThe senior emergency response official responding shall be in charge of the site. All activities will be coordinated through this person. For an on-site incident, this person in charge could well be a designated employee, who has been train"
