The regulated substance at this facility, anhydrous ammonia, is used in a closed-loop refrigeration process for product cooling. In order to protect its employees, the public and the environment, Guida-Seibert Dairy has an integrated PSM/RMP program to prevent ammonia releases and mitigate the consequences of a release, should one occur. \n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Ammonia Specific Prevention\n\n\n\nThe facility has an emergency plan that addresses the response necessary for a release of ammonia from the system. Because of the pungent odor of ammonia, any leak is easily detected. Guidas personnel have been trained and are knowledgeable in the safe operation of the system.    In case of a release that could travel off the plant property, calls would be made to the Fire Department and the other response agencies as necessary to assist in the response. Other state and federal notifications would be made as required.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nDuring the last five years, there have been no incidents that meet the EPA RMP definition of \"accident\".\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThis facility has procedures in place to respond to the release of a hazardous substance. Employees are trained to evacuate their respective areas in accordance with OSHA 1910.38(a). Coordination with the local fir"
