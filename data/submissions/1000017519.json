      "SummaryText": "EGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe Hydrogen Facility is located at 1310 East El Segundo Blvd, El Segundo, California, 90245 on the Chevron El Segundo Refinery property.  The facility's mailing address is 214 Main St., El Segundo, California, 90245.  The Hydrogen Facility's  is approximately 3.5 acres, and it is located in the south east corner of the refinery.  The area directly east of the facility is predominately zoned for heavy industrial activities.  However, to the South, residential property is located within approximately 0.4 miles.  Also, no environmental receptors have been identified within this area. \n\nThe products from the Hydrogen Facility are hydrogen and steam.  The unit produces raw hydrogen, which is then purified. There are three types of feed stock for the unit: pentane, natural gas, and refinery fuel gas.  The Hydrogen Facility is designed to operate for nine months with pentane feed and refinery fuel gas. During the remaining three months of the year, the Hydrogen Facility operates with natural gas and refinery fuel gas.  Continuous operation with a mixture of all three types of feedstock is not foreseen.  The fuel for the reformer furnace is off-gas from the pressure swing adsorption unit, supplemented with refinery fuel gas or natural gas.\n\nThe pentane reformer feedstock meets the criteria for classification as a flammable mixture pursuant to the regulations at Title 19 of the California Code of Regulations (19 CCR), Division 2, Chapter 4.5, Section 2770.2 (b)(2).  The total quantity of pentane flammable mixture present at the facility is 33,264 pounds.  The pentane flammable mixture consists of butane (CAS# 106-97-8), isopentane (CAS# 78-78-4), and pentane (CAS# 109-66-0). The predominant component in this mixture is isopentane.  The quantity of pentane, as a flammable mixture, exceeds the 10,000 pound threshold for both the EPA RMP and CalARP regulations.\nThe facility also contains methane and hydrogen, which are regulated flammable substance"

However, the quantities of these chemicals held on site at any time are below the 10,000-pound threshold for inclusion in either program.  Facility personnel have completed a determination for the quantities of all potentially regulated substances at the facility.  Refer to Appendix A2 for the calculations regarding both hydrogen and methane.\n\n1.3    HAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nTo meet the EPA RMP and the CalARP regulations, the Hydrogen facility must analyze one worst-case release scenario that is estimated to create the greatest distance in any direction to the end point resulting from an accidental release of regulated flammable and toxic substances from covered processes under worst-case conditions.  Administrative controls and passive mitigation devices are present to mitigate off-site consequences, however none of these devices were considered in the Worst Case Scenario (WCS).  Historical data from industry reportable chemical accidents were reviewed to ensure a credible event was chosen.  All modeling was done with EPA RMP*Comp version 1.07.\n\n1.3.1    WCS Flammable\n\nThe pentane feedstock meets the criteria for classification as a flammable mixture, which consists of butane, isopentane, and pentane.  The predominant component in this mixture is isopentane.  The largest quantity of this flammable mixture contained in a single location within the facility is at the pentane feed surge drum, V-100.  The maximum quantity of flammable mixture that could be contained in this vessel has been estimated at 30,754 pounds.  The worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a flammable material at the Hydrogen Facility is a catastrophic failure of the feed surge drum due to over-pressurization from a fire near the tank.  The WCS has been modeled such that the entire contents of this vessel are released as a vapor within 10 minutes.  \n\nEPA's RMP*Comp software was used to model this WCS.  The estimated impacts (distance to endpoi"

The closest area onsite that is occupied by the public is a small parking lot where the Chevron Refinery has allowed workers to park recreational vehicles to stay during turnaround periods.  This lot is 0.28 miles from the pentane tank, which is outside the modeled WCS area.\n\n1.4    GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nIn addition to the CalARP and EPA RMP regulations, processes at the Hydrogen Facility are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.   Although not required for Program 1 facilities under CalARP and EPA RMP regulations, a prevention program has been developed by the Hydrogen Facility that includes the following elements (also indicates the applicable internal regulation number): \n\nA?    Employee participation in process safety management and accident prevention (El Segundo SMR Employee Participation for PSM/RMP/CalARP Covered Processes, ELS-SMR-0101-P);\nA?
