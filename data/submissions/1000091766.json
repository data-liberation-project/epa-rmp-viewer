A process release would also be detected by the employees through odor.  When an ammonia alarm signal is triggered, it would sound throughout the facility and an auto-dialer is activated to alert maintenance personnel. The ammonia sensors are tested semi-annually.\r\n\r\nIn the event of a process release, the alarm system auto-dialer calls the facility maintenance department, which would in turn contact the Portsmouth Fire Department if any of the following conditions are present:\r\n\u00bf\tUpon investigating the incident, High Liner determines that the release is severe enough to require response assistance. \r\n\u00bf\tReportable quantities of ammonia are released; and\r\n\u00bf\tA potential for fire exists.\r\nThe Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC or Portsmouth Fire Department) is trai"

The ammonia refrigeration process at High Liner has been designed and operates in compliance with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, and applicable State and local codes and regulations. High Liner has qualified engineering, operations, and maintenance personnel knowledgeable in the safe operation of ammonia refrigeration systems in direct responsibility of the process.  The process is also designed and operated in compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management (OSHA-PSM) rule. \r\nThrough its Emergency Action Plan (i.e., Integrated Contingency Plan) as required under OSHA PSM, High Liner has emergency response procedures in place that comply with the Accidental Release Prevention Program (ARPP).\r\n\r\nA DESCRIPTION OF YOUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\n\r\nHigh Liner is a food processing facility primarily engaged in the preparation and packaging of seafood products.  The regulated substance, anhydrous ammonia, is stored and utilized within the facility's anhydrous ammonia refrigeration systems.  As High Liner's anhydrous ammonia storage capacity exceeds AARP threshold quantity, the facility is subject to the program and is required to prepare a RMP for this process.  The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system at High Liner is the only process that stores a substance in greater quantities than the ARPP applicability threshold.\r\n\r\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe process is currently designed and maintained in compliance with American National Standards Institute / American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers guidance, and American Society of Mechanical Engineering (ASME) guidance.
