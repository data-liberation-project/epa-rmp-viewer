The prevention program consists of the following elements:\n- Employee Participation Program\n- Process Safety Information\n- Process Hazard Analysis\n- Operating Procedures\n- Training Program\n- Contractor Safety Program\n- Pre-Startup Safety Review Procedures\n- Mechanical Integrity Program\n- Hot Work Permit Procedures\n- Management of Change Procedures\n- Incident Investigation Procedures\n- Emergency Planning and Response\n- Compliance Audit Procedures\nThe Oakland facility has an emergency action plan that addresses the response necessary for a release of ammonia from the refrigeration system. Because of the pungent odor of ammonia, any leak is easily detected.  The compressor rooms are provided with ammonia detectors that activate if ammonia is detected.  The refrigeration system is designed so that major components can be isolated by closing selected valves.  Further, refrigeration system operators have been trained and are knowledgeable in the safe operation of the refrigeration system.  In case of a release that could travel off the plant property, calls would be made to the Oakland and Batesville Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee to assist in the response.  Other state and federal notifications would be made as required.\n\n5.\tFive Year Accident History\n\nThe facility has not had a reportable release of anhydrous ammonia in the last five years.\n\n6.\tEmergency Response Program\n\nThis food processing facility has procedures in place to respond to the release of a hazardous substance.  Employees are trained to evacuate their respective areas in accordance with OSHA 1910.38(a).  Coordination with the local fire department is initiated during an emergency situation.\n\n7.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAjinomoto Foods expects to improve safety performa"

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nAjinomoto Foods takes many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system.  These precautions include safety controls (detection systems, alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure.  We also have a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems and a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel.  All employees are informed of hazards in the workplace.  Employees who work with potentially hazardous substances receive proper training in the handling of those substances.  This facility has procedures in place to safely remove employees from areas in the unlikely event that a hazardous substance release were to occur, and to put in place emergency notification and response procedures.\n\n2.\tFacility and Regulated Substances\n\nAjinomoto Foods located 10646 US-51 in Oakland, MS processes and distributes various food products. The regulated substance at this facility, anhydrous ammonia, is used in a closed-loop refrigeration system for product cooling and preservation. In order to protect its employees, the public and the environment, an integrated safety management program has been established to prevent ammonia releases and mitigate the consequences of a release, should one occur.  The facility employs approximately 450 persons.  The facility typically operates 24 hours per day, five days per week, 52 weeks per year.  Staffing is greater during normal business hours due to the presence of management and administrative personnel.\n\n3.\tWorst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios\n\nOff Site Consequence (OCA) data is available for review onsite at the Ajinomoto Foods facility.\n\n4.\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Am"
