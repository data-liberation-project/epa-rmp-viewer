      "SummaryText": "The Northampton Generating Plant is owned by Northampton Generating Company LP. Our overall approach to chemical safety and security involves safe equipment design, well-trained employees & qualified contractors, and regular audits and assessments.\n\nNorthampton Generating Plant operates an electric and steam generating facility.  Anthracite culm, petroleum coke, high carbon ash, paper processing residual and wood are burned in its boiler and steam is used to generate electricity.  \n\nWe store an aqueous ammonia solution, which is safer to handle than anhydrous ammonia.  The ammonia solution is used in our air pollution control system to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx).  Northampton Generating Plant has NOx emission rates that are among the lowest for any facility of its kind.\n\nNorthampton Generating Plant complies with  the federal Risk Management Program (RMP). The recent DOT HazMat guidelines are also adhered to. The general accidental release prevention program is incorporated into overall safe plant operation.  The plant is continuously staffed, with designated security personnel, perimeter fencing and controlled access/gate security.  The control room operators have access to real-time process monitor data plant-wide.  Trained operators perform regular walk-through visual inspections of equipment.  In accordance with company policy, chemical unloading is supervised, and follows written procedures.\n\nNorthampton Generating Plant has taken several chemical-specific prevention steps to avert any accidental releases of ammonia.  Control room operators remotely monitor the status of the ammonia system.  A loss of ammonia flow would instantly cause an alarm in the control room, where trained operators would take immediate action to correct the problem.  The ammonia storage and handling system undergoes testing and preventative maintenance that meets or exceeds industry standards.  The ammonia storage is located inside a concrete secondary containment structur"

      "SummaryText": "e.  In the event of a catastrophic release, this structure along with the floating plastic balls contained inside the structure would prevent the spread of aqueous ammonia and slow the evaporation rate.\n\nThe aqueous ammonia system has had no reportable spills or accidents since began operation in 1995.  \n\nNorthampton Generating Plant has an Emergency Response Plan, which is coordinated with County of Northampton Dept. of Emergency Management.  Plant workers undergo annual hazardous materials safety training and emergency response training. Plant management has made concerted efforts to coordinate with local emergency departments to ensure an appropriate response to an incident at the facility."
