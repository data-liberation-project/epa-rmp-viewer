This facility complies with industry-standard requirements for water treatment plants that use anhydrous ammonia and chlorine in bulk containers.  The policy at this facility is to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, the policy is to notify the City Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nFacility and regulated substance\nThis facility is a 160-million gallon per day water treatment plant located in Wichhita, Kansas.  The facility employs a series of physical and chemical treatment operations that include: pretreatment, aeration, softening, stabilization, filtration, and disinfection processes.  The covered processes include the use of anhydrous ammonia and chlorine chemicals.  Chlorine is used for disinfection and ammonia is used for chloramination.  Chloramination is the process of changing free chlorine to choramines which are more persistent in providing disinfection in the water distribution system.\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia is delivered in tanker trucks and the intended inventory on site is 27,300 pounds in two bulk tanks.  The chlorine is delivered in tanker trucks and the maximum intended inventory on site is 64,000 pounds in two bulk tanks.  The bulk tanks of both chemical are stored in the tank farm area of the plant.\n\nA worst case release scenario and an alternative release scenario were performed using the EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants.  The results were verified using RMP*Comp, which is based on the formuae in the guidance document.\n\nAccidental release prevention program\nThe facility's prevention program for both anhydrous ammonia and chlorine complies with the corresponding section of EPA's 40 CFR part 68 accident prevention program rule for program level 2 processes"

      "SummaryText": "and applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The anhydrous ammonia and chlorine systems are designed, installed and maintained in accordance with state and local laws.  To achieve and maintein this compliance, the City has in place many procedural and technological safeguards.  The procedural safeguards include an employee training program and operating and maintenance procedures for those employees involved in operating the covered processes.  The technological safeguards include controls, sensors, alarms, relief valves, and industry standard systems.  All of these serve to prevent unintended  releases of anhydrous ammonia and chlorine, or at least minimize the effects of a release.\n\nFive-year accident history\nThis facility has not had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia or chlorine that caused deaths, injuries, or property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\nEmergency response program\nThe facility has a written emergency response and preparedness plan that is coordinated with local emergency responders.  The Wichita Fire Department is the primary responder.
