      "SummaryText": "ank is designed for truck and marine transport like a containerized cargo. Therefore, it includes features to enhance its ruggedness. The tank is used as a stationary tank at this site. All piping attached to the tank, penetrate tank boundaries from the top.\r\n\r\nThis, in addition to the double wall feature, provides an added safety against spillage of tank contents. The storage tank is set inside a containment area within the building at the facility to minimize the impacts of a release from the tank.\r\n\r\nTDI is used in small quantities in the reactors to produce polymers. Transfer is accomplished via a transfer pump that is controlled automatically by a flow meter. The operator sets the desired quantity in the automatic control unit which then transfers the desired amount to a reactor.\r\n\r\nHazard Assessment (Offsite Consequence Analysis) Summary\r\n\r\nWorst Case Release Result Summary\r\nScenario Description: The worst case scenario considered the discharge of the entire contents of the 6,340-gallon storage tank into the diked area. The temperature considered was 113\u00b0F, representing the maximum ambient temperature in the area over the last three years. It may be added that, given the mass of the regulated substance in the tanks, large day and night temperature fluctuations, the fact that the tank is stored indoors, and that generally high temperature conditions do not last more than a few days, 113\u00b0F represents a very conservative maximum temperature estimate for the liquid.  \r\n\r\nALOHA computer software was used to estimate the distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0070 g/m3. Based on the results, it was concluded that the hazard foot print remains within the site boundaries.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\nThere are have been no reportable accidents in the past five years.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nPolycoat Products is taking additional steps to further public safety. Several studies have been conducted recently to examine mitigation measures and additional steps"

      "SummaryText": "Polycoat Products, a division of American Polymers Corporation, has established a Risk Management Plan according to EPA's regulations (40 CFR Part 68) for the TDI Transfer System to enhance its already existing safety programs. Polycoat Products is extremely cautious in the handling of all chemicals and is very diligent about safety for its employees and its neighbors. Polycoat Products staff is well trained and utilizes modern equipment to provide safeguards. The TDI Transfer System, that contains the regulated substance Toluene Di-Isocyanate (TDI), is used for supplying TDI to the polymer production reactors in the process area.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nPolycoat Products has an emergency response plan in effect to handle potential emergency situations at this facility. This plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\r\n\r\n1.) To save lives.\r\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\r\n3.) To protect the environment.\r\n4.) To minimize property damage.\r\n\r\nKey elements of the Emergency Response Plan include specific steps that Polycoat Products management expects of its employees to take to protect health of the employees and the neighbors. The Emergency Response Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, key phone numbers and contact points, vicinity and evacuation maps, plans for evacuation, fire, injury, earthquake, chemical spill, TDI health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency\r\nsituations that may arise at the facility. This Plan is reviewed and updated to ensure it is maintained current.  This Plan has been reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the Risk Management Plan (RMP), and CalARP regulations.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\r\n\r\nThe TDI Transfer System consists of a double walled storage tank, a transfer pump, and a bank of scrubbers that are used during the filling operation, piping and valves.
