In addition to other state and local codes applicable to our facility and process. We have undertaken this process to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and use of Anhydrous Ammonia in our facility.\n\n\n\nOur goal is to promote overall worker, public, and plant safety. The Welch Food, Inc. facility is located at 100 N. Portage Street, Westfield, NY. Welch's Westfield Plant is a grape processing and storage facility.  The facility includes but is not limited to processing tanks, piping, , raw materials warehousing, finished goods refrigerated storage, miscellaneous utilities, and two ammonia refrigeration systems that share the same engine room. Also, located at the facility is shipping and receiving docks. \n\n\n\nThe facility has 2 separate ammonia systems and produces and shipped approximately.  The refrigeration systems exceed the 10,000 pound threshold required for our production process and necessitates the submission of this Risk Management Plan. \n\n\n\nA Worst ad Alternate Case Scenario were calculated for this Risk Management Plan. A Worst Case Scenario was used with a liquid release totaling roughly 6500 pounds over ten minutes with a release radius of 0.91 mile.  An Alternate Case Scenario was used with a liquid release totaling roughly 700 pounds over ten minutes with a release radius of 0.30 mile.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Welch Food, Inc. is in the process of implementing numerous policies and procedures to enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of Anhydrous Ammonia as well as other hazardous substances, fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.

Process Safety Management / Risk Management Program is in the process of being developed and implemented. This program will be organize the information and polices pertaining to the process into a complete library. \n\n\n\nVolume 1 of the PSM/RMP Library incorporates several policies. Many policies are included in Volume 1, the remaining are referenced from other training manuals maintained in the facility.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation Guidelines: This policy outlines the commitment between management and employees to establish a program for a successful (safe) program.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information: This includes information on the ammonia inventory at the facility, applicable codes, design standards, and information pertaining to the hazards of ammonia (referenced from the IIAR ammonia Data Book).\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis Program: This program outlines a thorough, orderly, systematic approach for identifying, evaluating, and controlling potential hazards within a process involving potentially hazardous chemicals such as ammonia.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures: develop, implement, and maintain clearly written, detailed procedures, guidelines, rules, and practices for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration process during all operating phases. The operating procedures provide all employees involved in the operation and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration process with the written information and precautions necessary to safety perform their tasks in a consistent manner.\n\n\n\nContractor Qualification Guidelines: This guideline has been established to verify that the contractors working in the facility are q"
