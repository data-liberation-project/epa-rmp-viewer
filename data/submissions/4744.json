      "SummaryText": "The Andersons Walton Wholesale & Retail RMP Executive Summary\n\nSource and Product Description\nThe Andersons Walton Wholesale Fertilizer is engaged in the handling, storage, shipping and receiving of bulk agricultural fertilizers (liquid and granular). This facility has been operated by The Andersons, Inc. since the end of 1989. Key personnel at this facility are Keith Erny - general manager and Joe Johnson - retail manager.\n\nThe facility occupies approximately 40 acres in Jackson Township, Cass County, Indiana.  The plant is situated 1.5 miles south of the town of Walton on the east side of State Rt. 35 and the south side of 900 South.  There are one residence across the road\n\nWalton manufactures a liquid ammonium polyphosphate fertilizer called 10-34-0 (N-P-K analysis) which is produced by combining anhydrous ammonia, phosphoric acid and water, in a controlled environment.  While the process is exothermic, the resulting heat is managed through a closed-loop process that virtually eliminates the production of a steam plume.  Production rates average 40,000 tons of polyphosphate fertilizer per year.  Walton also produces a fertilizer solution called aqua ammonia, which is made by combining water and anhydrous ammonia.\n\nOne of the RMP-regulated material involved in this fertilizer manufacturing process is anhydrous ammonia.  Three 30,000 gallon tanks are used for bulk storage of  the material. When filled to the maximum 85% capacity, these tanks can hold 76,500 gallons of anhydrous ammonia.  This material is a gas at ambient temperature and pressure.  It is a liquid when stored under pressure inside the tanks.\n\nThe other RMP-regulated material at this facility is aqua ammonia. The facility manufactures aqua ammonia for resale to the farmers.  Aqua ammonia is a solution containing anhydrous ammonia and water.  Two one-million gallon tanks, two 56,000 gallon tanks and six 30,000 gallon tanks are used for bulk storage of  the aqua ammonia. \n\nAnhydrous and aqua ammonia ar"

However, it is acutely corrosive when it comes in contact with mucous membranes, in particular.  Anhydrous and aqua ammonia are non-flammable gases.\n\n\nSummary of Major Hazards\nThe principal causes of ammonia and propane emergencies are ruptured hoses and defective valves. The most probable time for an exposure or release to occur will be during a transfer from a delivery unit (generally a tanker truck or railcar) to the bulk storage tanks or a transfer from the loading station to the nurse wagons.  Flexible hoses must be connected properly.  Hoses on tank trucks are date-stamped are replaced by the transporter in advance of the expiration date or when defects are observed.  All transfers of ammonia are observed by Anderson personnel.\n\nTransfers from the storage tanks to the processing system or loading stations occur inside fixed steel pipes and are automated from the control room.  Mass meters are used to indicate the rate of flow. \n\nWith elevated temperatures that occur during mid-to-late summer, the ammonia gas inside the bulk storage tank can expand, and possibly cause the relief valve to open in order to equalize the pressure inside the tank.  The relief valve will reseal itself when pressure is relieved.  These \"events\" are very short in duration - a few seconds at the most.\n\nA complete failure or burst tank is highly unlikely.  The bulk storage tanks were built under strict guidelines established in the ASME pressure vessel code.  The bulk anhydrous ammonia storage tank is protected by concrete traffic barriers.  All welding and structural work done on the tank or appendages are performed by certified welders.  \n\n\nConsequences of Failure to Control the Hazards for Anhydrous Ammonia\nThe worst case scenario for this facility was created using EPA's RMP Comp software.

The estimated exposed population is 8600 people.  This distance would encompass the village of Walton and surrounding residences and Lewis Cass High School.  No hospitals, prisons or sensitive environmental receptors would be affected.  There are no passive mitigation systems available for this type of scenario.\n\nIt is our belief that the risk of a complete release of the tank contents is infinitesimally small.  Active mitigation systems in place at this facility were designed to prevent or mitigate any attempts to empty the tank.  The tank is in a protected location, and all transfer appendages are protected by concrete barriers.\n\nA more probable release situation is expressed by the alternative release scenario.  We believe that a more likely release could occur from a tanker truck transfer hose failure.  Prior to the excess flow valve being activated, we estimate that the maximum amount of ammonia that could escape to the atmosphere is ~ 5,600 pounds. A release of this nature would likely last for about ten minutes.  Utilizing an average wind speed of 3.0 m/sec and atmospheric stability class D,  the resulting distance to endpoint would be 0.50 miles.   In this more realistic scenario, the only potential exposed receptors would be the residences adjacent to the facility and possibly the traffic along Highway 35, west of the facility.\n\nActive mitigation systems were included in the alternative case scenario.

Passive mitigation systems in place at the Walton facility are:\n7 Secondary containment dikes that meet or exceed regulatory standards.\n7 Bulkhead breakaway units located on the connection point to the storage tanks. If a truck driver were to drive off without disconnecting from the tank, the steel structure would cause the hose to break at the outside of the connection point.  At this point, active mitigation would take effect and an excess flow valve, just to the inside of the breakaway would prevent the tank from emptying to the atmosphere.\n \n Active mitigation refers t"

      "SummaryText": "o equipment, devices or technologies that require human, mechanical or other energy input to function.  Active mitigation systems in place at the Walton facility are:\n7 Excess flow valves are located on all outgoing liquid and vapor valves on the storage tanks.  They close automatically if the volume of gas or liquid flowing through the line exceeds the normal flow rate.  They won't reopen until the downstream shutoff valve is closed and the pressure equalizes on both sides of the valve seat.  Two principal causes of the excess valve closing are a ruptured hose or a broken pipe or shutoff valve downstream that is opened too quickly.\n7 Back check valves are located on the unloading lines of delivery trucks and are designed to ensure that the flow goes in one direction only.  This prevents anhydrous ammonia or propane from flowing to a transport tank from the storage tanks.\n7 Pressure-relief valves are located on the top of the bulk storage tanks, fixed steel piping and on the vaporizer to relieve pressure that is too great.  This can be caused by elevated temperatures in the summer or overfilling.  They open directly to the atmosphere at 250 psig and close when the pressure inside the tank drops below this pressure.\n7 An emergency shutoff cord, located along the unloading station shuts the plumbing off.\n7 An ample supply of water is available near the bulk storage tank from a nearby water tank and an adjacent water well at each unloading point.\n7 Spill control kits are located at the facility and include sorbent material, shovels, PPE and disposal containers.\n7 Operator and truck drivers supervise all anhydrous transfers to and from the bulk storage tank\n\nPrevention Program\nPreventive maintenance is an integral piece of this facility's hazard management program.  All hoses, tanks, valves and storage units are inspected at least monthly, and usually daily during the production season.  A good PM program is our strongest defense against a release of anhydrous ammonia."

Unless otherwise noted, situations were evaluated under the assumption that safety controls were in effect.  Potential consequences were listed and given a rating of 1 - 5 for severity and likelihood; with \"1\" being the worst case and \"5\" being \"none or very low\".  When plotted, a risk value was assigned from 1 - 10; again with \"1\" being the worst and most critical item and \"10\" being of least consequence.\nFinally, results were evaluated and prioritized.\n\nFormal investigations are performed for all environmental or safety incidents.  Documentation is kept on file at the facility and the corporate Safety Department.\n\nA formal Management of Change (MOC) system is administered by the Engineering Department.  A form is filled out whenever a change is made to the 10-34-0 production system.  Forms are routed from the facility operator to the Engineering and Safety Departments for review and remarks.  A copy of the completed is form is sent back to the operator.\n\nMonthly Safety Committee meetings allow employees to discuss any concerns they may have with the operation of the facility.  Issues are documented and assigned to employees for follow-up. Records of all meetings are kept at the facility.\n\nThe Walton facility also participates in a \"best practices\" task force meeting at least three times a year to discuss production and quality issues, as well a"

Operators and management, together with representatives from the Safety and Engineering Departments spend the day discussing any and all issues related to the production of 10-34-0 and aqua ammonia.\n\n\nResponse Action in the Event of a Release\nIn the event of a burst hose or defective valve, employees are instructed to shut down the conversion process and, if possible, approach the shutoff valve from upwind and attempt to turn it off. \n\nFor an uncontainable release, employees will immediately call the police and fire department or other first responders, as appropriate.  All employees, customers and contractors are to be evacuated to an upwind location. Once the response team has arrived, we will work in concert with them to close the valves between the tank and the leak.  In the meantime, a steady spray of water will deluge the ammonia gas plume and knock it to the ground, while chemically binding any free ammonia.\n\nThe employees are instructed to make emergency phone calls in this order:  the facility Manager, 911, the corporate Safety Department emergency phone number, the Indiana Emergency Response hotline and the Indiana Department of Environmental Management emergency phone number.  All applicable contact names and numbers are found in the facility spill and emergency response plan.\n\n\nCommunication procedures with responders \nThe local fire department is invited to tour the Walton facility on an annual basis.  Facility management, employees and fire department personnel have jointly discussed the location of the anhydrous ammonia and response procedures on a regular basis.  They know the location of all emergency shutoff valves and on-site response equipment.  We believe that a strong relationship with first responders is our best defense.\n\nThe LEPC and state regulatory agencies receive a copy of our hazardous materials storage information, every February, in accordance with our community right"
