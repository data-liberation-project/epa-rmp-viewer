The facility unloads ammonia railcars and trucks into storage tanks.  The ammonia is then used in the production of ammonium polyphosphate liquid fertilizer.  The facility has been in operation since 1968.\n\nThe Mt. Carmel Plant has an excellent safety record with no deaths or serious injuries to plant personnel or contractors due to RMP covered process.\n\nThe facility's safety record is a direct result of much emphasis on safety in the plant on the part of management and employees.\n\nB.     Accidental Release Prevention Policies and Program:\n\nThe facility is in compliance with OSHA PSM Standards.  Information including piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&ID's), operating procedures, management of change (MOC) documentation, and other pertinent documents are on file in the plant office.  Technical Services staff furnishes assistance and performs safety and environmental audits.  Additionally, the Safety Coordinator performs safety training on a regular basis.\n\nThe ammonia tanks and associated equipment is covered by a mechanical integrity inspection and testing schedule and is constantly monitored.\n\nSafety meetings for all employees are held at least every month at this facility.  In addition to safety training classes, each employee has taken numerous computer based training courses; several employees are certified in First Aid and CPR.\n\n\nC.     Emergency Response Policies and Program:\n\nEach employee is trained to be familiar with the Emergency Response policies and procedures through safety reviews and other plant safety meetings.  The Emergency Action Plan is reviewed on an annual basis as part of the employee meeting to provide refresher training.  Safety policies and procedures are also reviewed on an annual basis.\n\nThe local LEPC and  Fire Department personnel are furnished a copy of the Emergency Action Plan and invited to tour t"
