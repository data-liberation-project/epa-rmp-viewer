      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nFLEXIBLE FOAM PRODUCTS, INC.\n200 North Street\nSpencerville, OH  45887\n\n\nFlexible Foam Products, Inc. (FFP) owns and operates a polyurethane foam manufacturing facility in Spencerville, OH.  FFP receives raw materials at its facility, mixes the materials to produce a polyurethane foam bun on a foam production line.  The foam is then cured and stored on site prior to shipping to customers.  Some limited fabrication takes place at the facility.  The polyurethane foam produced by FFP is used in many common household products, including seat cushions, bedding and pillows, and many automotive products where soft foam cushions are required.\n\nOne of the components used in the production of polyurethane foam is toluene diisocyanate (TDI).  This compound is subject to EPA's Risk Management Rule.\n\nToluene diisocyanate is delivered to the North Street facility in tank trucks.  The trucks are off-loaded to a storage tank located inside the building.  Because the storage of TDI takes place inside the building, the probability of release of toluene diisocyanate vapors into the atmosphere is reduced.  As a result, the impact of such a release on the surrounding community is minimized.  There are no receptors (buildings and people other than the FFP facility) that would be impacted by the release of stored TDI.\n\nBecause there are no public receptors and there have been no significant accidents of release in the last five years, FFP's North Street facility is classified as a Program 1 facility.\n\n\nWORST-CASE SCENARIO\n\nDELETED in accordance with April 19 2004 Ruling.\n\nSECTION 2.  TOXICS:  WORST CASE  EXPLANATION\n\nDELETED in accordance with April 19 2004 Ruling.\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION\n\nFFP takes safety very seriously.  We use safety equipment and strict procedures to prevent releases and to reduce the impact of any release that might occur.  Some examples are:\n\n\t-Safety controls such as warning alarms, and automatic shutdowns {to be added shortly}.\n\t-Regular equipmen"
