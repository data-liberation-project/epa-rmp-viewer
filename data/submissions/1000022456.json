      "SummaryText": "OVERVIEW\nThis document describes Western Refining Southwest, Inc.'s revised Risk Management Plan (RMP) for its Gallup Refinery and provides the 5-year update to the facility's RMP.\n\nA RMP for the facility was originally filed on June 20, 1999. The RMP has subsequently undergone four revisions (07/99, 07/00, 06/04, 05/06, 07/08). The most recent revision (07/08) update the name of the owner, update the facility name and update the person responsible for RMP (Part 68) implementation. \n\n40 CFR 68.160(b)(20) dictates that the RMP registration shall include the type and reason for any change being made to a previously submitted RMP and provides four categories for the types of changes. The changes proposed in this RMP revision fall under category (i), updates and re-submissions required under 40 CFR 68.190. Therefore, Western is providing this updated submission.\n\nThis document includes all of the RMP elements required by 40 CFR 68. The RMP is not a single document. It is composed of the facility's Process Safety Management (PSM) program, the emergency response plan, an analysis and evaluation of offsite consequences of an accidental release, and other related environmental and health and safety documents and programs. This executive summary presents an overview of the plan and describes briefly the key elements of the RMP.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nGallup Refinery is committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program which covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\nSOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nGallup Refinery is located about 17 miles east of Gallup, New Mexico, north of Interstate 40 at exit 39. The facility's primary activi"

These substances include anhydrous ammonia (ammonia), 1-butene, 2-butene-cis, 2-butene-trans [2-butene, (E), 2-methyl-1-butene, butane, ethane, ethylene [ethene], hydrogen, hydrogen fluoride/hydrofluoric acid [HF acid], isobutane [propane, 2-methyl], isopentane [butane, 2-methyl-], methane, pentane, propane, and propylene [1-propene]. The various hydrocarbons in this list, with the exception of methane and ethane, are components of the liquid fuels produced at this facility (gasoline, LPG, etc.). Methane and ethane are gaseous byproducts of the refining process (essentially natural gas), which are consumed onsite as fuel for the processing of crude oil. Hydrogen is also a byproduct of the refining process that is utilized onsite both as a fuel and in the sulfur removal process for the production of clean, low-sulfur motor fuels. HF acid is utilized as a catalyst in the conversion (alkylation) of light, gaseous hydrocarbons into extremely clean, high-quality gasoline.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nGallup Refinery has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with API and ASME standards. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place at our facility.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nGallup Refinery maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nThe facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodologies used to carry out these analyses are What If, What If/Checklist (combined), an"

Any findings related to the hazard analyses are addressed in a timely manner. \n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within the covered processes, Gallup Refinery maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround. This information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nGallup Refinery has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed. \n\nMechanical Integrity\nGallup Refinery carries out highly documented inspections and maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined during these checks includes, among other things, pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps. Inspection and maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by these checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Gallup Refinery to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to de"

These reviews are conducted to confirm, prior to placing equipment into operation, that construction and equipment as well as operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for a safe startup. \n\nCompliance Audits\nGallup Refinery will conduct audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. These audits will be carried out at least every three years, and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits will be undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nGallup Refinery promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the circumstances leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions needed to prevent the incident from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of five years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nGallup Refinery truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities. Prior to selecting a contractor, an evaluation of the past safety performance of the contractor is carried out. Gallup Refinery has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and all processes around which the contractor"

The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced. In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nThe McKinley County LEPC is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) for this area. Gallup Refinery is a member of a mutual aid group consisting of emergency response groups from surrounding communities. In addition, onsite mutual aid training/orientation sessions are conducted periodically with various local emergency response groups. The New Mexico State Police is the primary agency with which coordination of emergency response efforts is conducted.\n\nONGOING CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nWestern resolves all findings from PHAs and incident investigations, some of which result in modifications to the process."
