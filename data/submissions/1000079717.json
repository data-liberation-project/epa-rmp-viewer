The new facility is to begin operating in July/August 2019. ELEMENT is updating the existing RMP for their operations.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\nELEMENT has an ongoing commitment to the health and safety of onsite employees and the surrounding community.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training for the proper operation and maintenance of plant equipment and preventative maintenance programs.\n\n\n\nELEMENT has emergency response policies in place that are addressed in the facility's Health and Safety Plan; Industrial Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan; Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure (SPCC) Plan; and Emergency Action Plan. Most of the listed Plans require a minimum of annual training in order to keep employees educated on emergency response procedures in place at the facility. All new employees are required to undergo training on emergency response procedures prior to initiating responsibilities onsite.\n\n\n\nELEMENT's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES:\n\nThe ELEMENT ethanol plant is located in Colwich, Sedgwick County, Kansas. The facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  The regulated substances under the RMP program are Anhydrous Ammonia and  a flammable mixture - natural gasoline (denaturant).\n\n\n\nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE SCENARIOS:\n\nWorst Case Scenarios:\n\n1.  Anhydrous Ammonia:  Anhydrous ammonia is stored as a gas liquefied by pressure in an aboveground steel tank. The worst-c"

RMP Comp was used to determine the worst-case distance to endpoint; the model results were 4.0 miles radius. Population data was obtained using Circular Area Profiling System (CAPS) which incorporates 2010 U.S. Census Data. Public receptor information (i.e. schools, hospitals) was obtained using Google Earth.  Tributaries to the Cowskin Creek, Cowskin Creek, Big Slough, Colwich Memorial Park Pond, and the Arkansas River are located within the worst-case distance to endpoint for ammonia.\n\n  \n\n2. Flammable Mixture (Denaturant): The flammable mixture stored onsite is natural gasoline, typically referred to as denaturant. Natural gasoline is used onsite to denature ethanol prior to shipment offsite. Denaturant is stored in two (2) aboveground steel tanks located in the facility tank farm. The tank is located in a diked containment structure that contains an impermeable liner with gravel overlay. A facility provided SDS was used to determine RMP applicability. The worst case scenario used is the release of the entire contents of one of the denaturant tanks, causing a vapor cloud explosion. RMP Comp was used to determine the worst-case distance to endpoint; the model results were 0.5-mile radius.  Population data was obtained using Circular Area Profiling System (CAPS) which incorporates 2010 U.S. Census Data. Public receptor information (i.e. schools, hospitals) was obtained using Google Earth. An un-named tributary to Cowskin Creek and Colwich Memorial Park Pond would be affected by an alternate release of denaturant.  \n\n\n\nAlternative Scenario:\n\n1.  Anhydrous Ammonia: The alternative scenario used for anhydrous ammonia is a release due to a rupture disk/relief valve failure from the ammonia piping system. This scenario is considered the most likely cause of an ammonia release onsite. The alternative duration is assumed to be 10 minutes with an atmospheric stability of D and a wind speed"

The emergency shutdown system installed at the facility has been considered in this scenario as active mitigation. RMP Comp was used to determine the alternative distance to endpoint; the model results were 0.4 miles. Population data was estimated by the facility's knowledge of the area. Public receptor information (i.e. schools, hospitals) was obtained using Google Earth. An un-named tributary to Cowskin Creek and Colwich Memorial Park Pond would be affected by an alternate release of anhydrous ammonia.  \n\n\n\n2.  Flammable Mixture (Denaturant): The alternative scenario used for the flammable mixture is the release of natural gasoline due to a tanker truck loadout spill, causing a vapor cloud fire. The endpoint used was an over pressurization of 1 PSI, a worst-case option. Denaturant deliveries at the facility typically occur during normal business hours with a facility staff member overseeing loadout operations - therefore a release at the loadout area could be ceased within minutes by manual overrides. The loadout area also has a catchment basin with underground piping to secondary containment of the tank farm. For this scenario, passive and active mitigation was not considered, as the mitigation strategies currently in place would not contain a vapor cloud fire. RMP Comp was used to determine the alternative distance to end point; the model results were 0.1 miles. Population data was obtained using knowledge of the surrounding area. Public receptor information (i.e. schools, hospitals) was obtained using Google Earth.  No environmental receptors are affected by an alternate release of denaturant.  \n\n\n\nThe ELEMENT facility qualifies as a Program 3 for anhydrous ammonia, the facility includes the flammable mixture as a Program 3 for RMP/PSM purposes for consistency throughout the facility. \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE"

Monthly visual inspections are performed and quarterly leak detection monitoring is performed and reports filed per KDHE requirements.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nThe facility is submitting this RMP prior to receiving the RMP chemicals onsite, therefore there have been no reportable accidents associated with RMP covered processes at the ELEMENT facility.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nELEMENT ethanol plant has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including a Health and Safety Plan and a SPCC Plan.  ELEMENT has evacuation and response procedures for fires, explosions, spills, etc. outlined in the facility Emergency Action Plan. The Plans listed as part of this Executive Summary have been prepared in accordance with the applicable regulations, as necessary.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nELEMENT provides safety training to its employees and contractors on an annual basis.
