The Safety Director is responsible for the management of the accidental release prevention and emergency action programs.\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency action programs is to prevent the occurrence , and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\nB.\tStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nThis company operates a"

      "SummaryText": "freezing and storage warehouse for the perishable food industry.  This facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing  capabilities.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in the system is in excess of 10,000 pounds.  The maximum inventory of the system is 40,000 lbs.  Since an ammonia release from the system could pose a risk of offsite public impact and the system is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's RM program.\n\tThe closed ammonia refrigeration system removes heat from the storage and blast freezers of the 2.0 million cubic foot facility.  The refrigeration system provides two-stage and single-stage operation with screw compressors for the -35! blast and -10! freezers.  The sub-zero temperatures are provided with low pressure ammonia suction and liquid lines via pumped recirculating accumulators.  The higher pressure portions of the system include the condenser, located on the roof, along with refrigerant vent lines where any leaks can dissipate to the air, joining ammonia produced by lightning where it can be consumed as it goes through a natural biodegrading process.  Normal safeties include: high pressure cut-outs, relief valves, and ventilating systems for the machine room.\nC.\tSummary of Worst-Case and Alternative  Release Scenarios\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario is determined to be a catastrophic release from V-3 Intercooler.  The V-3 Intercooler operates at 10!F. and approximately 24 psig.\nThe V-3 Intercooler receiver is 5 feet in diameter and 20.125 feet tall.  When 50% filled, the receiver capacity is approximately 8,100 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\nAssumed is that the release occurs through a circular hole located at the bottom of the Intercooler.  Using EPA-default parameter values, the full content of the intercooler is released within ten minutes through a 1.15-inch hole.  For this Worst Case Release Scenari"

The potential for a pipe failure is significant given the extensive ammonia piping system extending throughout the Facility.\nAssumed is the failure of a four-inch pipe connected to the main receiver.  The pipe is 100 feet long with a smooth interior.  The receiver serves as an infinite source of anhydrous ammonia at 77!F. and 131 pounds per square inch.  Using EPA-suggested meteorological parameters for alternative conditions the distance from release point to the toxic endpoint is 0.64 miles.\nThe Alternative Release Scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\nThe high pressure liquid lines are located in enclosed areas that could help to contain such a release;\nIndustry standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of these lines;\nAmmonia is not corrosive in this service.\nVessel design uses a factor of approximately 4 to 1 margin for safety.\nActive mitigation considered would be the Emergency Shutdown System which permits system to equalize to 50-60 psi.\nD.\tDescription of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThe prevention program (OSHA Process Safety Management CFR 1910.119) consists of the following elements:\nEmployee Participation\nProcess Safety Information\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOperating Procedures\nTraining\nContractors\n\nPre-startup Safety Review\nMechanical Integrity\nHot Work Permit\nManagement of Change\nIncident Investigation\nCompliance Audits\n\n\nE.\tFive"
