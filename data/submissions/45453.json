The plant primarily manufactures anhydrous ammonia and urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN) solutions.  As a nitrogen fertilizer-manufacturing complex, this facility is subject to the Environmental Protection Agencies Risk Management Program rules under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.\n\nThe Risk Management Program rules require that facilities handling threshold amounts of certain chemical substances submit Risk Management Plans for the prevention of accidental releases of those substances.  The plan requirements include hazard assessments defining possible offsite impacts of certain regulated substance release scenarios, a five-year accident history, description of the facility\u00bfs accidental release prevention program, and an emergency response program. \n\nThe following is the Executive Summary of the Risk Management Plan for the Coffeyville Nitrogen Plant.\n\nFacility Overview\n\nThe Coffeyville Nitrogen Plant is a nitrogen fertilizer-manufacturing complex producing anhydrous ammonia and urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN) solutions.  The complex produces for market approximately 670,000 tons of UAN and 145,000 tons of anhydrous ammonia annually for use as agricultural fertilizers.  The design of the facility, which started production in January 2001, incorporates state-of-art safety and environmental controls for the protection of the employees and the surrounding community.  \n\nThe facility consists of an air separation unit, a gasification unit, an ammonia synthesis unit, and an UAN unit.  The air separation unit, while located on the Coffeyville Nitrogen site, is independently owned and operated by BOC Gases.  The air separation unit makes high purity oxygen and nitrogen for use"

      "SummaryText": "in the gasification unit.  In addition, BOC markets these gases along with argon to off-site customers. \n\nThe gasification unit produces hydrogen gas using the GE Energy Hydrogen Generation Process.  The gasifier produces raw hydrogen and carbon oxides by the partial oxidation of petroleum coke with oxygen in the presence of water.  The petroleum coke is provided primarily by the neighboring Coffeyville Resources refinery and supplemented with coke from other locations.  The hydrogen is purified by shift conversion of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide, the removal of hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide, and pressure swing absorption of trace contaminants.  \n\nIn the ammonia synthesis unit the hydrogen from the gasification unit reacts with nitrogen from the air separation unit to make anhydrous ammonia.  The ammonia is either sold for direct fertilizer applications or upgraded for UAN solutions.  Ammonia along with by-product carbon dioxide from the gasification unit is used to produce liquid urea in the UAN plant.  Ammonia and air in the same plant are used to produce weak nitric acid solution that is subsequently neutralized with ammonia to produce ammonium nitrate.  The liquid urea and ammonium nitrate are mixed forming the urea-ammonium nitrate solution product. Ammonia and UAN solutions can be shipped to the farmers by both truck and railcar.  On-site storage tanks have been constructed to safely hold the ammonia and UAN products until the farmers are ready to apply the fertilizers.\n\nPollution Prevention Policy\n\nCoffeyville Resources Nitrogen Fertilizers is committed to protecting the environment and preserving our natural resources for future generations.  We are pursuing elimination or reduction of our use of toxic substances and minimizing our use of energy and the generation of all wastes to the extent technically and economically feasible.  We strive to prevent the generation of pollution at the source, but, where that cannot be achieved; we are committed t"

      "SummaryText": "o environmentally sound methods of recycling, treatment, and disposal.  By preventing pollution at the source, we strive to achieve cost savings, increase operational efficiencies, improve the quality of our products and services, maintain a safe and healthful workplace, and improve the environment.\n\nThe above goals were applied to the design and construction of the Coffeyville Resources Nitrogen Fertilizers Plant.  The gasification process substitutes high grade feedstock, natural gas, with a low-grade feedstock, petroleum coke.  Petroleum coke is the end product from the condensation process in oil cracking.  Refineries have difficulties finding a market for their coke due to its poor fuel characteristics.  A conventional natural gas based ammonia plant would consume 28,000 cubic feet for every ton of ammonia produced.  Coffeyville Nitrogen chose to utilize the GE Energy Hydrogen Generation Process using coke as a feedstock.  Substituting coke for natural gas conserves over 10 billion cubic feet of natural gas per year, which can be used for home heating, electrical power generation, or in the production of other materials.  Constructing the facility next to a refinery that produces a large volume of coke provides a reliable source of raw material, reduces the energy required to transport the coke, and allows for the potential return of energy or raw materials to the refinery.\n\nThe environmental design objective for this plant was to achieve significant emission reduction compared to the conventional nitrogen plant.  No hazardous solids are produced during normal operations.
