Facility personnel are trained in procedures and use of equipment appropriate to their role in response to small incipient accidental releases.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY \nThe plant personnel are continually developing new ways to improve the safety of the facility.  This is done through responsibility matrices and training which is a vital part of any safety program.  Training is conducted according to a systematic schedule.  All new and modified equipment is designed with appropriate safety controls and devices.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS \nDetails of the release scenarios are included with the backup documentation associated with this RMP plan. \n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM \nSpecific responsibilities are summarized in the backup documentation associated with this RMP plan."

A comprehensive training program ensures that employees are knowledgeable about the processes they are responsible to operate and control.  Operating procedures explain correct startup, operation and shutdown procedures for various equipment in the process.  The hot work program is in place to promote safety of jobs involving potential ignition sources.  The mechanical integrity program ensures that equipment is maintained inspected and tested for ongoing safety.  A contractor safety evaluation program is in place to ensure hire of contractors that will not compromise job or facility safety.    \n\nThe facility has a policy of investigating every catastrophic incident, including those which may have possibly resulted in a catastrophic release under slightly different circumstances, in order to prevent a similar accident from recurring.

The plants produce the following petroleum products and byproducts:\n\n1. Y grade mixture from natural gas (also known as natural gas liquids)\n2. Condensate\n3. Stabilized Condensate\n4. Residue Gas\n\nThe products contain methane, ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes, and heavier hydrocarbon components. The regulated flammable substances include these same components. This facility does not handle regulated toxic substances above their threshold quantities and there are no toxic release scenarios to consider.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \nThis facility is regulated by 29 CFR 1910.119 (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals - PSM), 1910.38 (Employee Emergency Plans), as well as other federal, state and local regulations which are in place to reduce the potential for the release of Highly Hazardous Chemicals. \n\nThis facility has implemented the PSM elements to facilitate accidental release prevention.
