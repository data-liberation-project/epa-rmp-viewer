The facility maintains a 12,000 pound chlorine system and a 8,000 pound sulfur dioxide system for the purpose of treating wastewater derived from the surrounding area. The facility stores greater than the 2,500 pound threshold for chlorine and the 5,000 pound threshold for sulfur dioxide, requiring the development and submittal of this Risk Management Plan (RMP) to the USEPA. For the purposes of risk management planning, this RMP was written in accordance with \" Program III \" requirements.\nThere have been no incidents involving either the chloring or the sulfur dioxide system in the last five years which presented any threat of personnel or property damages on or off the site.\nChlorine\nThe worst case scenario for this facility, as specified in the CAA is a release of approximately 2,000 pounds of chlorine within 10 minutes followed by vapor cloud dispersion. The radius of influence to the specified endpoint of 0.0087 mg/l is 0.90 based on modeling using RMP Comp.\nThe alternative scenario involves the release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine due to a cross threaded coupling after container replacement. The release, if unnoticed by the operator, would occur over approximately 60 minutes, followed by plume dispersion. Based upon Class C atmospheric conditions, the toxic vapor cloud is predicted to extend 0.40 miles (712 yards) based on the ALOHA modeling program.\nThe worst case scenario for this facility, as specified in the Rule, is a release of approximately 2,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide within 10 minutes followed by vapor cloud dispersion. The radius of influence to the specified endpoint of 0.0078 mg/l is 1.30 miles base on modeling using RMP Comp.\nThe alternative scenario involves the release of 2,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide due to a cross threaded coupling after container replacement.

There are no administrative controls or mitigation measures in use that could reduce the predicted effects, however, the chlorine system is contained within a building which serves to impede the rate of dispersion of the gas.\nEmergency notification will be made by telephone by the Jamestown Wastewater Plant by dialing 911.\nProcess Hazard Analysis of these systems is conducted once every five years by Jamestown Wastewater Plant Personnel in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of highly Hazardous Chemicals.
