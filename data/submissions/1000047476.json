              "Description": "Central Farm Service (CFS) retains two OUTSIDE contractors who utilizes their own unit for the production of ammoniated polyphosphate liquids.  CFS is not involved in the conversion production process.  This Program Description and information contained in this Program relates to contractor Mears Fertilizer, Inc. (hereinafter Contractor). Contractor has provided CFS with documentation to support a mechanical integrity program is in place along with written operating procedures, safe work procedures, emergency action plan, and a training program for the conversion process.  Additionally, CFS has their own Emergency Action Plan, Incident Response Plan and other safety procedures and policies in place, including those required by the EPA under this Program.  The involved contractor reports that the following safeties to the process are in place:  \n\nAn audible and visual alarm system, which will warn if the pump or cooling tower fan malfunctions.  Fisher N-550 Emergency Shut-off Valves are installed at discharge of source and at the ammonia pump, and pneumatically held open during use, and they are capable of remote closure.  The ammonia hose used between source and pump, as well as that used for bypass, is FMH-22 double-braided, corrugated 316L SS to avoid potential rupture between these critical connections.  A standard Fisher ammonia regulator is used at the pump, pressure controlled, to bypass any excess ammonia to the suction side of the pump.  A standard ammonia backcheck valve is used on the input line at the Mix Unit.  Pressure relief valves for the ammonia system are recertified annually by an outside vendor.  These added safeties have proven effective in avoiding potential releases as evidenced by the Contractor?s safety record.  \n\n",

CFS is NOT involved in the conversion production process.  This Program Prevention Description pertains to contractor, Blick's Phosphate Conversions LLC (Blick?s).  Blick?s owns and operates a mobile polyphosphate reaction processor that utilizes a pipe reactor (a.k.a. T-Reactor), which they bring on site to complete the conversion process for CFS.   The critical process safety parameters are as follows:  Pressure:  350 psig.  The 3? ammonia hoses are rated for a maximum working pressure of 350 psig with a burst pressure of 1,750 psig.  The valves and pumps on the system are rated for a maximum working pressure of 400 psig.  The Contractor monitors process pressures during the operation of the process and they are kept well below 350 psi.  Additionally, there is a safety relief valve on the non-contact ammonia/product heat exchanger that is set to discharge at 250 psig, and the ammonia pump has a bypass valve with a differential pressure (between suction and discharge) setting of 150 psig.  Thus, pressure should be relived to either atmosphere or the ammonia source tank if there is a sudden spike in system downstream of the ammonia transfer pump.  Additional accident prevention program details relative to ensuring water and acid supplies are correct along with other details of the covered process are carried with the T-Reactor and part of Blick?s comprehensive Emergency Response and Contingency Plan, their hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, etc. which documents are available at CFS.",

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Facility:\n\n\n\nManagement and employees of Central Farm Service, Clarks Grove, MN location (hereinafter CFS), are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the onsite contractor conducting the conversion, the local fire department, and other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the public and the environment.\n\n\n\n2. Facility Information:\n\n\n\nCFS periodically retains two OUTSIDE contractors who utilize a mobile unit for the production of ammoniated polyphosphate liquids.  CFS is neither involved in the conversion process, nor does CFS own the conversion equipment. The liquid fertilizer grade produced during the conversion process is 10-34-0.  Raw materials used in the conversion process include anhydrous ammonia, super phosphoric acid and water. The anhydrous ammonia used in the conversion process is brought onto the facility in a semi transport or semi-tanker. The anhydrous ammonia is on site temporarily only during the conversion process:  this facility has no permanent storage of anhydrous ammonia.  Rather, it is transferred from the semi-tanker to the contractor's process equipment where the conversion takes place immediately.  Therefore, this RMP is filed as a Predictive Filing and CFS is covered under a Program Level 2 RMP.  When the contractor's portable conversion equipment arrives at CFS to conduct the conversion, the CFS site RMP is meshed with the contractor's PSM to satisfy regulatory requirements during the conversion process. \n\n\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\n\n\nThe facility has implemented Minnesota Dept. of Agriculture Administrative Rules, and the Standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.11"

CFS employees are not involved with the conversion process-the contractor utilizes their own employees who they train to safely operate the involved equipment.   \n\nThis contractors have provided CFS with documentation to support a mechanical integrity program is in place along with written operating procedures, safe work procedures, emergency action plan, and a training program for the conversion process.  \n\n\n\n4. The Five-year Accident History:  \n\nOne accidental release of anhydrous ammonia occurred on December 15, 2014 during the conversion process by one of the outside contractors:  it involved the accidental opening of a hose valve by a contractor employee.  CFS was not involved with the conversion process and did not own the involved semi-tanker or the conversion equipment.  Neither CFS nor its employees caused or contributed to the release.  However, because the release occurred at the facility, the release is being identified as part of this RMP.  Investigation of the incident began immediately, which also included the Minnesota Department of Agriculture's involvement.  The required investigative report pursuant to 40 CFR 68.60 has also been completed.  \n\n\n\n5. The Emergency Response Program:\n\n\n\nCFS has:\n\na. A written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38. The plan includes a specific section on NH3 Releases and what to do in the event of a release. The EAP plan was last reviewed at training sessions held in September and October 2014.  The location reviewed their plan again since the 12/15/14 incident.  Additionally, there is a site Incident Response Plan (per Minnesota Department of Agricultural requirements) in place.   In the event of an accidental release during the conversion process, CFS employees understand they must only call 911; and follow all established evacuation and emergency procedures set forth in their EAP and IRP.  \n\n\n\nb.

Their portable or mobile mix units carry multiple operating documents to ensure safe operation of their reactor, as well as Emergency Action Plans and/or Field Emergency Procedure/Plans.  \n\n\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  CFS is continuing to work with the conversion companies to ensure all safety and compliance measures as required are taken prior to beginning the conversion process. \n\n"
