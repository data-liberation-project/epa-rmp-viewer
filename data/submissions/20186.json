As part of this commitment, the Mill has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Mill and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements:  Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at the Mill.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Mill.\n\nThe risk management program at the Mill consists of three elements:\n1. a hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases; and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances).\n2. a prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (cove                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "
