The Facility Policy.\n\nThe Board of Directors, Management, and Employees of Landmark Services Cooperative are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information.\n\n-The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\n-Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.\n\n-The maximum stored would be 210,000 pounds in our two-18,000 gallon storage tanks and one-12,000 gallon storage tank. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a semi tank trailer holding 40,000 pounds.\n\n3. The accidantal release prevention program.\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n4. The Five-year Accident History.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n-have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\n-to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n5. The emergency response program.\nThe facility has:\n\na. a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb. provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA)."
