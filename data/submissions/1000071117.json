It is Lineage Logistics policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  \r\nThe Program 3 at Lineage Logistics - Port of Stockton, is a facility run program with continuous support from Lineage Logistics - Compliance Department that includes; Process Safety Management (PSM) Compliance and Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) Compliance.   \r\n\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\r\n\r\nLineage Logistics - Port of Stockton is located at 2323 Port Road A, Stockton. California. The area immediately surrounding the facility is mostly urban with some industrial and residential areas.\r\nThe regulated substance handled at the facility is anhydrous ammonia.  The facility's primary activities revolve around large-scale public storage of food products.  All of the ammonia inventory is used as refrigerant.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nAs part of the implementation of the RMP Program, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by Lineage Logistics - Port of Stockton, which also serve to manage process safety issues associated with the use of anhydrous ammonia.  Furthermore, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  In reviewing the regulated substance at the facility, the covered process is the ammonia refrigeration system.  The regulated substance is over 10,000-lbs. federal threshold for the EPA -RMProgram and over the 500-lbs. state threshold for the CalARP Progr"
