The facility emergency response plans are coordinated with the fire departments (alternate fire departments include Biscoe and Troy) and the Montgomery LEPC.  The Star Volunteer Fire Department is aware of the system, available protection systems (site fire extinguishers, emergency shut-off devices) and Emergency Response Procedures at the facility.  The Star Transloading facility is a non-responding facility.\n\nThis facility is owned by ETM&T, however the transloading equipment is operated by Hilco, a contract operator.  \n\nThis facility had one reportable accidental release in the past 5 years involving a contractor that was operating the transloading equipment.  The release was approximately 1,000 gallons of butane.  No one offsite was injured or evacuated. \n\nIn an effort to improve and promote system safety, Energy TRasnfer Marketing & Terminals looks for and seeks employee input on process safety improvements.  Additionally, the Star Volunteer Fire Department is contacted regarding participation in site emergency response drills which involve potential releases.   The contract company that performs the transload operations at the facility is working to improve its training program, and will include more management oversight going forward. \n\nWith these objectives in mind, the Risk Management Plan has been developed to provide information regarding the management of the risks associated with the flammable substance storage process. Above all, ETM&T stresses its commitment to ensuring a safe working environment for employees, visitors and the community."

This Risk Management Program (RMP) covers the butane transfer systems only, including the associated piping and up to thirty (30)  storage tanks detached railcars (approximately 33,600 gallon railcars).\n\nTwo requirements of this section specifically apply to operations at the Facility:\n1. Purpose and General Duty Clause - The essence of the general duty clause is that an owner/operator that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has a fundamental obligation to ensure a safe operation and to have plans in place in the event of an accident to appropriately manage the situation.\nETM&T is committed to ensuring the safe operation of the Facility, as well as all of its other operations, to ensure a safe workplace for employees and a safe location for neighbors in the community. ETM&T has procedures in place to prevent accidents and is committed to emergency preparedness both for the Facility and community-wide and coordinates with the Washington Fire Department.\n\n2. Risk Management Plan - The primary function of the Facility is to act as a flammable liquid storage and distribution facility. Due to\nthe flammable effects associated with butane, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human\nexposure, to reduce the threat to employee health, and to minimize the threat and impact to nearby members of the community.\nThe Facility is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety and health.
