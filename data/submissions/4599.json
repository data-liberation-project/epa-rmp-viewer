Emergency situations can include fire, explosion, chemical release or spill, bomb threat, weather emergencies and other natural emergencies.  Due to the ongoing risks that are presented by weather emergencies like tornadoes, the plant has in place an emergency plan to protect both the plant operational integrity and the safety of its workers and neighbors from weather emergencies.  In regards to chemical releases, Cargill has developed a command structure and specific procedures that must be adhered to in the unlikely event of a chemical emergency.  These procedures define the criteria for identifying, classifying, and notifying the appropriate emergency response staff of potential emergency events. If a chemical release is detected on-site, the emergency response team is notified and the most appropriate mode of response is determined by the Incident Commander, with support from available emergency response (HAZ-MAT) teams and technical advisory staff.  Each Department in the facility must also follow a specific Spill Prevention Countermeasure and Control Plan in the event of a chemical release. \n\nPlant operations at the Eddyville facility can present various types of potential hazards and Cargill recognizes the need to have a well trained and prepared work force to safely and effectively deal with any emergency situation.

Program 3 related information for the Process, Ethanol, and Utilities departments is included in the Data Elements section of the Risk Management Plan.\n\n2.1 Process Department\n\nThe corn milling process at the Cargill Eddyville facility is designed to extract useable starch and sugars from corn kernels in order to produce various end-products. The first step in the corn milling process involves steeping the corn kernels in water tanks, into which vaporized SO2 is injected. The SO2 and water form a dilute solution of sulfurous acid that helps to soften the kernel, breakdown proteins and remove soluble constituents. The steeped corn then travels through degerminating mills and separation processes designed to remove the germ and separate out the starch.  The starch slurry is then rinsed in water into which additional vaporized SO2 is injected.  Approximately 80% of this starch slurry is utilized in the production of corn syrup, sugar and ethanol.  \n\nThe Process department is responsible for the storage and transfer of sulfur dioxide (SO2) that is utilized in the corn milling process.  The SO2 is stored in an exterior storage tank as a pure liquefied gas at ambient temperatures.  The maximum capacity of the tank is 25,400 gallons.  A passive interlock device prevents filling to greater than 21,590 gallons (approximately 265,000lbs). Access to the loading area is limited by chain link fence and secured by locks.  \n\n2.2 Ethanol Department\n\nThe Ethanol department is responsible for the storage and transfer of ammonia that is contained in the refrigeration system to produce carbon dioxide (CO2), a by-product of ethanol production. Access to this department is controlled.  All employees and visitors are required to sign in and out. Visitors must be accompanied by a department employee.  Approximately 13,000 lbs of anhydrous ammonia is contained in the refrigeration system.  The ammonia is stored in a tank located outside the refrigeration building and at any given t"

The modeling results indicated that the worst-case SO2 release would result in a distance to toxic endpoint of 12 miles.  The worst-case impact zone encompasses a resident population of approximately 19,000, based on the 1990 Federal Census, and estimated by applying EPA's Landview III program.  Public receptors were identified using 1:24,000 scale U.S.G.S maps, supplemented with comprehensive maps of the local Eddyville area (Rand McNally, 1990, and DeLorme Street Atlas USA, Version 5).   The potential worst-case hazard zone includes schools, hospitals, public recreation areas, and industrial/commercial areas. Several environmental receptors (defined as National or State parks, forests, officially designated wildlife sanctuaries, preserves, refuges, and federal wilderness areas) are also located within the worst-case impact zone.  The closest environmental receptor is the Monroe County Conservation Area.  \n\nCargill notes that it is impossible to release 265,000 lbs of SO2 in 10 minutes because the amount of heat energy required to so rapidly vaporize the liquid SO2 would not be available.  If the storage tank were to breach, liquid SO2 would spill to the ground in a boiling pool.  If a hole were to form in the vapor space of the storage tank, the flashing vapor in the tank would cause the tank to auto-refrigerate, thereby gradually reducing the release rate with time.  However, Cargill evaluated this 10-minute release to comply with the noted regulation.\n\n3.2 Alternative Releases of Toxic Substances\n\nAlternative releases are intended to represent release scenarios that have a greater likelihood of occurrence than a worst-case release.  Alternative releases do not necessarily represent the types of releases that the PSM hazards analysis and/or accident history indicate would be most frequent, but rather a release that is somewhat more likely than the worst-case release and that generally still has the po"

In accordance with the EPA's OCAG, a single alternative release scenario is reported for each regulated substance. \n\nCargill performed a thorough review of the Utilities, Process, and Ethanol departments, utilizing engineering plans, operational experience, and maintenance records, in order to determine alternative release scenarios that could potentially result in off-site impacts. Each scenario was evaluated and the scenarios most likely to occur and to result in off-site impacts were selected for modeling. In order to determine the most conservative off-site consequence estimates, Cargill has chosen to include in the Risk Management Plan the alternative release scenarios that resulted in the greatest toxic endpoint distance for each regulated substance.\n\nIn accordance with the RMP rule, alternative releases are modeled under typical (rather than worst-case) dispersion conditions.  The EPA OCAG default dispersion conditions are neutral atmosphere, with dispersion neither enhanced nor limited (D stability and 3 m/sec wind speed). A review of climatological data for Des Moines, IA, confirmed that these conditions are typical of the area and therefore are suitable for the evaluation of alternative releases. Unlike the worst-case release (for which an instantaneous spill or 10-minute ground-level gas release is assumed), alternative scenarios can account for the actual release configuration, and account for both active and passive mitigation.\n\nAlternative dispersion modeling was conducted using EPA's RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance (1999 Revised OCAG).  In order to report the most conservative distance to toxic endpoint estimates, only the modeling results based on 'rural' surface conditions are included in the Risk Management Plan.

The raw materials and process chemicals utilized by the plant are delivered via truck and rail from external sources.  Access to the site by vendors, employees and visitors is controlled by fencing and security checkpoints.  Several of the chemicals utilized in the corn milling process at the Eddyville facility are regulated under 40 CFR Part 68.  The Ethanol, Process, and Utilities departments each store and maintain chemicals that are present at or above threshold amounts for regulated substances. These departments contain the only processes at the facility that are subject to the above regulation, which addresses the potential off-site hazards of accidental releases.  The regulated substances include: sulfur dioxide (SO2), anhydrous ammonia (NH3), and chlorine (Cl2).\n\nThe EPA Risk Management Regulation identifies three levels of requirements for industrial processes.  Program 1 can be applied to any process which has not had a significant release of a regulated substance over the five year period prior to the June 1999 compliance date and for which the worst-case release does not affect public receptors (e.g., residences, parks and recreation areas, commercial/industrial facility, hospitals).  Program 2 applies to any process that is ineligible for Program 1 and is not subject to Program 3.  Program 3 applies to all processes, such as those present at the Cargill Corn Milling Division facility, that are subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Standard (PSM). The Cargill Accident Prevention Program elements are adopted directly from the compliance program for the PSM standard, consistent with the Level 3 RMP Program requirements for this Cargill facility under 40 CFR P"

The sections of the Risk Management Plan which discuss both worst-case, and alternative cases, are meant to provide the data necessary to develop and evaluate possible improvements in the overall safety programs of the Cargill RMP program. \n\n3.1 Worst-Case Release for Toxic Substances\n\nThe worst-case release scenario, as defined by 40 CFR Part 68, is a sudden release of the maximum amount of a stored regulated substance from a single vessel, regardless of whether several vessels are interconnected.  For toxic gases such as SO2, NH3, and Cl2 stored at ambient temperatures it is assumed that the release occurs over a 10-minute period.  The regulated substance with the most extensive zone of influence, defined as the distance to specified toxic endpoints, is considered the worst-case release for each facility. Only passive mitigation (e.g., dikes, enclosures) and administrative controls may be accounted for in the evaluation.\n\nEPA has established toxic endpoints for various chemicals based on the American Industrial Hygiene Association (ACGIH) Emergency Response Planning Guideline, Level 2 (ERPG-2), which protects individuals from health-threatening or escape-impairing injury.  The ERPG-2 is defined as:\n\nthe maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to 1 hr without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\n\nGiven that the worst-case is a 10-minute release duration with a 10-minute concentration averaging time, the actual hazard zone is typically overestimated by the ERPG-2. Within such a time period there are a number of emergency measures that can reduce or eliminate exposures to levels this high for an interval much shorter than an hour.\n\nBased on a review of the quantity of regulated toxic substances stored in vessels on-"

For comparison purposes, both the 'urban' and 'rural' modeling results have been included in the Risk Management Plan Executive Summary.\n\n3.2.1 Sulfur Dioxide\n\nThe alternative SO2 release scenario that would result in the greatest off-site impact involves a break in the SO2 unloading assembly at the delivery railcar. A break of this type would result in a hole in the unloading assembly of approximately 1.049 inches in diameter.  The pressurized release of SO2 through hole of this size would result in two-phase flow (vapor and liquid) as the pressurized SO2 flashed to the vapor state.  The modeling indicated that SO2 would be released at a rate of 1600 lbs/min.  It is conservatively assumed that the sulfur dioxide would then be dispersed as a heavy gas and the excess flow valve on the railcar would not engage.  Cargill has estimated that it would take an operator approximately 30 minutes to respond and shutdown the flow of SO2, resulting in a total release of 48,000 lbs.  This alternative SO2 release scenario is expected to be more representative of the maximum anticipated release at the facility than the worst-case.  \n\nThe 1999 Revised OCAG indicates that under 'rural' conditions, the distance to toxic endpoint would be 1.9 miles.  Under 'urban' conditions, the distance would be approximately 0.6 miles.  The hazard impact zone encompasses an estimated residential population of approximately 1000 persons, based on the 1990 Federal Census, and estimated in conjunction with EPA's Landview III database program.  Public receptors in the alternative impact zone include a school, public recreation areas, and industrial/commercial areas.  No environmental receptors would be affected.\n\n3.2.2 Anhydrous Ammonia \n\nThe alternative ammonia release scenario that would result in the greatest off-site impact involves a break in the re-charge"

The chlorine is delivered to the facility in cylinders that are housed in a ventilated cement block building.  Access to this building is controlled by department employees.  Each chlorine cylinder contains a maximum of 1,600 pounds of chlorine. Up to six cylinders can be connected at any given time and chlorine is fed to the system one set of two cylinders at a time.

In order to standardize and simplify the many factors that can potentially occur in an accidental release situation, some of these assumptions may not take into account the available preventive measures or mitigation methods that could diminish or even eliminate the implied risks that are suggested by worst-case analyses. For that reason, both the results for the standardized worst-cases defined by the EPA methods and a set of alternative cases which are believed by Cargill to more realistically represent situations that may possibly, but rarely,"

      "SummaryText": "site, it was estimated that sulfur dioxide would result in the greatest distance to toxic endpoint.  The toxic endpoint for SO2 is 0.0078 mg/L.  Since the resulting planning zone predicted for the worst-case SO2 toxic release potentially affects public receptors, regulated processes at the Cargill Corn Milling Division facility are subject to Program 3 requirements.  40 CFR Part 68 requires that the substance with the largest distance to toxic endpoint be reported in the Worst-Case Release section of the Risk Management Plan.   Therefore, only the SO2 release results are included in the Data Elements section.\n\nThe EPA's RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance (1999 Revised OCAG) lists a number of refined dispersion models that are available for off-site hazard assessment applications for risk management programs. Sulfur dioxide has a molecular weight that is substantially greater than the ambient air.  Therefore, concentrated plumes of this substance resulting from accidental releases often display heavy-gas behavior.  In such cases, near-field dispersion is dominated by gravitational slumping of the plume and entrainment of air at the plume-air interface.  The Dense Gas DISpersion (DEGADIS) Model (Version 2.1) was developed by the U.S. Coast Guard and the Gas Research Institute to model dense gas releases and its use has been approved by the U.S. EPA.  The model is used to predict the dispersion of dense gases from ground level releases over flat, level terrain.  For these reasons, DEGADIS was used to model the worst-case release scenario.\n\nThe 1999 Revised OCAG provides a basic approach to estimating endpoint distances based on an ambient temperature of 77 F.  However, the RMP rule requires that if dispersion techniques other than the OCAG are applied, the maximum daily temperature over the last three years be used.

      "SummaryText": "indicated a recorded high temperature over the last three years of 98 F. \n\nUnder Section 68.22 (e), the RMP rule identifies surface roughness as a parameter to be specified in the hazard assessment. The surface roughness affects the amount of dispersion that occurs within a released plume and influences the distance to toxic endpoint. The surface roughness used in determining the distance to toxic endpoint should be characteristic of the transport path of the plume from the release point to the endpoint distance.  'Urban' surface roughness indicates areas where there are many obstacles, such as industrial buildings or trees.  'Rural' indicates that there are no buildings in the immediate vicinity of a facility and that the terrain is generally flat and unobstructed. \n\nIn the immediate vicinity of the Cargill Corn Milling facility, the aerodynamic surface roughness is clearly 'urban' in nature, whereas at greater distances, the surface roughness is 'rural'.  In order to report the most conservative 'distance to toxic endpoint' estimates in the Risk Management Plan, Cargill has elected to model the release assuming a rural surface roughness.  A rural surface roughness value of 10 cm, which is consistent with the land use surrounding the facility, was utilized in the DEGADIS model.\n\nIn accordance with 40 CFR Part 68, the worst-case modeling is conducted assuming a very stable atmosphere with limited dispersion (F stability and 1.5 m/sec wind speed).  Analysis of three years of meteorological data from the National Weather Service at Des Moines, Iowa indicates that these dispersion conditions occur less than 5% of the time (or about 1.2 hours per day, on average).  The most predominant directions of transport are to the north and northwest. \n\n\n3.1.1 Worst-Case Release: Sulfur Dioxide\n\nThe 40 CFR, Part 68 prescribed worst-case scenario for the Eddyville facility consists of a 10-minute gaseous ground-level release of 265,000 lbs of stored SO2, dispersed under atmo"
