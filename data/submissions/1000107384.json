      "SummaryText": "McGinness Hills 3 (MGH3) is configured differently from MGH1 and MHG2 and utilizes the motive fluids i-pentane and n-butane.  In MGH3, Ormat Energy Converter (OEC) 31 utilizes i-pentane and OEC 32 uses n-butane.  This process became operational in October, 2018.  The energy production capacity of MGH3 was increased with the introduction of OEC 31A in May, 2021.  \nAll three processes are geothermal electric power generation facilities.  The processes utilize hot brine that is pumped from a geothermal reservoir.  The hot geothermal brine is used to drive an organic Rankine Cycle process.  The hot geothermal brine vaporizes the process motive fluid in shell and tube heat exchangers.  The hot, high pressure motive fluid exiting the heat exchangers drives a turbine/generator set to produce electricity.  The motive fluid exhausted from the turbine is condensed in air cooled condensers and returned to the shell and tube heat exchangers via feed pumps to form a closed-loop process.  The cooled geothermal brine exiting the process is returned to the geothermal reservoir through dedicated injection wells.  \nAt MGH1 and MGH2, the process consists of two, Integrated Two Level Unit (ITLU) Ormat Energy Converters (OEC) and one, level 3 air-cooled OEC.  The OEC levels are differentiated by the operating pressure of the heat exchangers and turbines.  Each OEC incorporates one double ended shaft generator driven by two 1800 RPM direct coupled special organic fluid turbines and associated auxiliary systems.  \nThe MGH3 process consists of one Integrated Four Level Unit (I4LU) Ormat Energy Converter.  There are three OECs (two level 1 OECs and a level 2&3 OEC) each of which incorporates one double ended shaft generator driven by two 1800 RPM direct coupled special organic fluid turbines and associated auxiliary systems.  \nMcGinness Hills is operated by Ormat's Eastern Nevada Operations Group (ENOP).

ENOP operates five eastern Nevada power generation facilities owned by Ormat.  \nAll the Eastern Nevada power plants operate continuously, 24 hours per day and 365 days per year (excluding scheduled maintenance downtime or plant upsets).  The McGinness Hills complex is staffed 24 hours per day and 365 days per year.  \nRegulated Substance Handled\nThe revised maximum intended inventory for MGH1 is 759,842lb of n-pentane, MGH2 is 873,347lb of n-pentane, and MGH3 is 1,105,886lb of i-pentane and 822,777lb of n-butane.  These revisions were required for increased volumes with the addition of OEC 31A and new assumptions within the calculations for MGH1, MGH2, and OEC 32 after operational optimization and maintenance activities.  \nIn addition to the motive fluid inventory present in the OECs, each plant has dedicated storage tanks for the on-site motive fluid.  The tanks provide evacuation capacity that is necessary to facilitate removal of motive fluid from an OEC for maintenance activities.  At MGH1, two tanks have a nominal capacity of 30,000 gallons each and one has a nominal capacity of 12,000 gallons.  MGH2 has two, 36,000 gallon capacity tanks.  MGH3 has two 60,000 gallon tanks dedicated to iso-pentane and three 60,000 gallon tanks dedicated to normal butane.  During normal operation, the tanks are essentially empty.  The registered quantities of motive fluid for each process include the quantity charged to each OEC plus a nominal amount of residual fluid in a storage tank.  \nWorst Case Scenario: Worst case scenario assessment has been conducted and the potential offsite consequence analysis (OCA) was undertaken.  However, in conformance with Office of Emergency Management guidance, the OCA for worst-case and/or alternative release scenario(s) has not been included in this Executive Summary.  \nAccident Prevention Program\nGiven the lack of proximity to offsite receptors and lack of accidents, McGinness Hills is registered as a program level"

Notwithstanding the program level, Ormat maintains a complete accident prevention program as specified for a program level 3 facility at all processes.  \nSafe Work Practices: Safe work practices have been developed and implemented to provide for the control of hazards during work activities such as lock out/tag-out, confined space entry, opening process equipment or piping, and control over entrance into a facility by maintenance, contractor, laboratory, or other support personnel.  These safe work practices apply to both employees and contractors.\nMaintenance Procedures: A Mechanical Integrity Program (MIP) has been initiated at the McGinness Hills Facility.  The MIP adopts a maintenance concept for periodic preventative and corrective maintenance of the OEC systems.  The preventative maintenance tasks include visual inspection, lubrication of rotating parts, system cleaning, replacing liquids and filters, and periodic tests to verify that the system is in proper operating condition.  Preventative maintenance tasks and procedures are scheduled to be undertaken over a series of maintenance intervals.  Alarm system maintenance is determined using a combination of regulatory requirements, manufacturer's recommendations, plant operating experience and best practices.  \nTraining: Initial training for personnel is given before an employee is allowed to either handle motive fluid, operate or work on the facility's process area or work on process equipment. Overview of the plant operations is conducted with Emergency Services Personnel including a tour of the site, gas and fire detection system operations, and familiarization with the motive fluid characteristics.\nEmployee refresher training is conducted on an annual basis, at a minimum, and when review of the chemicals or process reveals a need for additional training.
