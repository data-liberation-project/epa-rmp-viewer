The steam is used for enhanced oil recovery. Electrical power is consumed by Chevron with surplus power being sold to the local utility. An aqueous ammonia process was added to the existing Cogeneration Plant and was started up in 2nd quarter 2000. The ammonia reduces the amount of nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the flue gas, which is accomplished by injecting ammonia vapor in the flue gas just prior to exposure to a catalyst. The resultant chemical reaction reduces the NOx to harmless nitrogen and water. The aqueous ammonia used is a 20% or greater concentration. The maximum quantity of aqueous ammonia at the facility is above EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) threshold quantities, and above the California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP) threshold quantity.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION/RESPONSE POLICY\r\n\r\nThe Eastridge Cogeneration facility has a long-standing commitment to workers and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the processes. Corporate  policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, trained plant personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant.  CPP policy is adherence to all federal, state and local laws.  Chevron's Policy 530 Operational Excellence is the governing overarching policy for protecting the safe and health of people and the environment, and to condu"

In addition, the Operational Excellence Management System (OEMS) is how Chevron systematically manages workforce safety and health, process safety, reliability and integrity, environment, efficiency, security and stakeholder engagement issues.\r\n\r\nThe Eastridge Cogeneration facility encourages employee participation in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation include updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the plant accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nSAFETY INFORMATION\r\n\r\nThe Eastridge Cogeneration facility keeps a variety of technical documents utilized  to maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.\r\n\r\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). This information is supplemented by documents specifically addressing known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, the plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition). The covered process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). The plant also maintains numerous technical documents  providing information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. Th"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and verify adequate controls are in place to mitigate the hazards.\r\n\r\nThe Eastridge Cogeneration facility primarily uses the HAZOP (Hazard and Operability) methodology to identify and mitigate process hazards and risks.  The HAZOP methodology is recognized as a systematic and thorough hazard evaluation technique.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people with operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures as necessary.  \r\n\r\nThe HAZOP team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to HAZOP findings is based on risk ranking assigned by the HAZOP team. This ranking ensures the findings associated with highest risk are prioritized over findings with a lower risk ranking.  All approved mitigation options in response to HAZOP team findings are assigned to responsible personnel and tracked to completion.\r\n\r\nTo verify the process control functions still adhere to the design intent, the HAZOP is revalidated every five years.  \r\n\r\nOPERATING PROCED"

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and certified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by reviewing and revising as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process. Operating procedures contain upper and lower operating limits and consequence of deviation information.  Operating procedures are readily available. \r\n\r\n\r\nTRAINING\r\n\r\nTo complement the written operating procedures, the Eastridge Cogeneration facility has implemented a refresher training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New operators are evaluated to assess the level of initial training required and appropriate training is provided.  After successfully completing the initial training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to lean process specific duties and tasks.  Once a new operator demonstrates the ability to safety perform assigned duties and tasks, the operator may then work independently.  All operators periodically read and revalidate the operating procedures to verity the operating procedures are accurate.  Formal operating procedure refresher training is conducted at least every three years.  All operations, maintenance, and construction personnel receive training on plant health/safety hazards and plant emergency procedures before beginning work in the plant.  All training is documented including the means (oral or written tests/quizzes, skills demonstration, etc.) used to verify training is understood.  \r\n\r\nMAINTENANCE\r\n\r\nThe Eastridge Cogeneration facility has well-established practices and procedures i"
