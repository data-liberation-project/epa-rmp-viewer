Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Action Policies\n\nThe top priority of LBA/3771 Channel Dr is to provide a healthy and safe work environment for its facilities occupants and the surrounding community. In this effort, LBA/3771 Channel Dr has developed strict policies and procedures to reduce the risk of an accidental hazardous chemical release. The Process Safety Management (PSM) program acts as a gatekeeper of these policies and procedures.\n\n\n\nThe requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) PSM Standard CFR 1910.119 mirrors that of Risk Management Prevention Program 3 and therefore has been integrated. Of the 14 PSM elements, 13 focus on accidental release prevention and one on emergency planning and response. It is the commitment of management and employees to follow the established procedures and seek new ways for improvement.\n\n\n\n2.    Stationary Source and Regulated Substance \n\nLBA/3771 Channel Dr is a freezing and storage facility located in Yolo County, the city of West Sacramento, California. This facility has one refrigeration system using Anhydrous Ammonia (CAS #7664-41-7) as the refrigerant. The total ammonia inventory meet/exceed the Federal threshold quantity and exceeds the threshold quantity of the State regulations for accidental release prevention.\n\n\n\n3.    Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nEPA's Risk Management Prevention Program 3, 40 CFR Part 68(D) and OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard 29 CFR 1910.119 outline the facilities accidental release prevention program below. The facility has committed to completing audits and inspections as well as holding employee meetings to establish current procedures, ensure there is employee buy in for procedures and seek new opportunities for improvement to health and safety policies.\n\n\n\n?
