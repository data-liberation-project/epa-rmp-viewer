      "SummaryText": "a.   The Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policy\nVan Diest Supply Company's accidental release prevention policy is \na unified approach that integrates technology, procedure, and management practices, while complying with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations for our anhydrous ammonia storage.  If an accidental release were to occur, Van Diest Supply Company is prepared and trained to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and to the environment.\n\nb.   A Brief Description of the Facility and the Substances Handled\nVan Diest Supply Company is a distributor and dealer of agricultural chemicals, and a dealer of fertilizers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application on the field.  Two 30,000 gallon vessels are used to store the anhydrous ammonia, with the largest amount in either vessel at any time 130,000 pounds (based on 85% fill limit).  There may also be up to 60 nurse tanks on site at any time, with each nurse tank having a capacity of 6,200 pounds.\n\nc.   The Worst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios  \nFor ammonia, our worst case release, as directed by the EPA, is a release of the entire contents of one storage tank in 10 minutes (130,000 lbs).  The distance to toxic endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 3.40 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a failure in a 2 inch tank hose as the tank is being used, with the assumption that mitigation such as check valves would allow for only a 2 minute release.  The distance to toxic endpoint for this scenario is 0.60 miles (11,908 lbs released).\n\nd.   The Accidental Release Prevention Program\nVan Diest Supply Company implements the provisions of the Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Ammonia, K-61.1 published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Admini"

Five Year Accident History\nVan Diest Supply Company has never had an incident involving either propane or ammonia which caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, or evacuations. \n\nf.   Emergency Response Program\nVan Diest Supply Company has the following: a written emergency action plan (in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38); provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right to know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA); and a written emergency response program in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.  All of these have been coordinated with the Region V Emergency Planning Committee.\n\ng.   Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at Van Diest Supply Company.  Currently, there are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
