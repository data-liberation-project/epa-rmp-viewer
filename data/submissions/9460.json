      "SummaryText": "General Executive Summary Stainless Steel Pipe Pickling\nDavis Pipe Inc.\nBlountville, TN\n\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Davis Pipe Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  \nThis commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program \nthat covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee \ntraining associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate \ncontrols to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\nThe pickling process at Davis Pipe was constructed in 1989 to Resource Conservation and \nRecovery Act Design Standards for a Hazardous Waste Storage Area. The pickling area is \ncompletely secondarily contained to handle a total release of all the chemicals. A Hypalon liner \nwith collection system provides tertiary containment. A 57,000 cfm scrubber system removes the \nacid gas fumes from the process. \n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Fabrication of Stainless Steel Pipe and Tubing.  We \nhave 2 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Hydrogen \nfluoride/Hydrofluoric acid [Hydrofluoric acid] and Nitric acid.  The acids are mixed with water \nto make a 7% hydrofluoric and 10% nitric pickling liquor.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Hydrogen fluoride/Hydrofluoric acid [Hydrofluoric acid] at our \nfacility is 8235.01 lb. while Nitric acid is present at our facility in a maximum quantity of \n6589.30 lb.. The hydrofluoric exceeds the threshold quantity of 1000 pounds of greater than 50% \nconcentration, due to up to 10 drums of 70% onsite at a time for  makeup.  The hydrofluoric acid \ncould be ordered in less than 50% concentration and the plant not be regulated under 40 CFR 68. \nThis causes a greater risk to employees due to more frequent addition of acid.\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenari"

      "SummaryText": "o(s) and the Alternative Release \nScenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to \nlimit the distances for each reported scenario\nThis EPA program only regulates hydrofluoric acid above 50% and nitric acid above 80%. Over \n50% of the hydrofluoric acid onsite is in four pickling vats but it is at a concentration of 7%, \nwhich is exempt.\n\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables \nor Equations.  For alternative release scenario analyses we have employed.  The following \nparagraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios. \n\nPickling Stainless Steel Pipe at Davis Pipe qualifies as a program level 1 process.  In the worst \ncase scenario for this process 3622 lb. of Hydrogen fluoride/Hydrofluoric acid (conc 50% or \ngreater) [Hydrofluoric acid] is released.  The acid is stored in  a maximum of 10 drums. It is rare \nthat all ten drums are present an one time.  The drums are stored in a contained treatment \nbuilding with a 57,000 cfm scrubber. The scrubber keeps the building below ambient \ntemperature so a temperature of 800 F was used. The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 \ncm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over \n10 minutes.  The worst case scenario has all 10 drums being ruptured. This is nearly \nimpossible.   The passive mitigation provided by the secondary containment of the building has \nbeen taken into account to calculate the scenario.  The 57,000 cfm scrubber has not been taken \ninto account in the scenario. These mitigation systems have the effect of containing the spill to \nallow for neutralization.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum \ndistance of 0.19 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.016 mg/L.  This \ndistance is less than the distance to the nearest public receptor (0.32 miles by USGS Topographic \nMap)\n\nAn Alternate Scenario is not required for a Program 1 Facility."

This facility was designed and \nconstructed in accordance with Hazardous Waste Storage Area with Tertiary Containment.  The \nsystem also has a continuous 57,000 cfm scrubber to remove any acid gasses. The following \nsections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our \nstationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nDavis Pipe Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical \nhazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered process, Davis Pipe Inc. \nmaintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation \nsuch as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, \nemergency operations, and normal shutdown.  The information is regularly reviewed and is \nreadily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nDavis Pipe Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are \noperating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  \nRefresher training is provided at least every year and more frequently as needed. The most recent \ntraining was January 28, 1999\n\nMechanical Integrity\nDavis Pipe Inc. carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure \nproper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; storage \ntanks, piping systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified \npersonnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are \noffered specialized training as nee"

Any equipment deficiencies identified by the \nmaintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nDavis Pipe Inc. promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result \nin a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify \nthe situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from \nreoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nDavis Pipe Inc. truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team \neffort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident \nprevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to \nall information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including \ninformation resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction \nactivities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the \ncontractor is carried out.  Davis Pipe Inc. has a strict policy of informing the contractors of \nknown potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.
