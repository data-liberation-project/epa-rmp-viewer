It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and local regulations.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately notify the local Fire Department (a 911 call) and request a response to the emergency.  This call would also notify the FayetteCounty Sheriff's office.  A follow up call would be made to the office of the County LEPC.  A real emergency  would be unexpected and may be very different in nature from any training in the past.  However, any previous planning/training  will serve as guidelines to follow.\n\nThe primary emergency coordinator is Adam Keller.  His work and 24 hr. Emergency number is listed in the Registration Section of this document.  Additional contacts are listed below in order:\n\n     Adam Keller, Location Manager\n        Work: (563) 422-6281      24 hr.

The anhydrous ammonia plant is operated on a seasonal basis (Spring and Fall).\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\nThis facility complies with EPA, State, and local codes and regulations.  The anhydrous ammonia system is designed , installed, and maintained in accordance with ANSI Standards and State law.\n\nIn addition,"

Members of the local fire and law enforcement departments are encouraged to become familiar with our location and facilities, enabling them to more quickly assess and necessary response procedures.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nOur overall plan to minimize hazards to human health and to the environment that are associated with accidental releases of anhydorus ammonia.  Employees working with the anhydorus ammonia system make routine observations and inspections prior to and during transfer operations of the anhydrous ammonia from the storage tank to nurse tanks, enabling them to detect problems early before they can cause a hazardous situation.  Employees are trained to recognize areas of potential hazards and new hires are trained immediately and observed to determine their level of comprehension and understanding.  The company makes every effort to cooperate with local, state, and federal officials as they endeavor to assist us with our anhydrous ammonia operation.\n"
