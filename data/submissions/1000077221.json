Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nWe at the Manitowoc Public Utilities Water Treatment Plant are committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such release does occur, we are completely coordinated with emergency responders to provide trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass production of potable water.  Disinfection of water via chemical means is of utmost importance in the water production process.  To assist in the disinfection process, we have the following regulated substance present at our facility:\n\n\n\n    Substance:  Chlorine\n\n    Maximum Inventory:  10,000 pounds\n\n    Exceeds 40 CFR Part 68 Threshold:  Yes\n\n\n\n3.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under both 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA and the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of our prevention program that are in place at our facility.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe facility maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chlorine hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled "

The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of every five years, or more frequently if necessary.  Any findings related to each analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities related to the covered process, the facility maintains written operating procedures, and written emergency response.  \n\n\n\nOur Emergency Response Plan was coordinated with the LEPC on 3/26/2019.  We proposed to the LEPC that this coordination would be conducted annually.  \n\n\n\nStandard Operating Procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the process.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nThe facility has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees operating the process are competent in the operating procedures associated with the process.  New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided annually and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe facility carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper functions.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others:  storage containers, piping systems, relief and vent systems, alarms, and controls.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies"

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Reviews\n\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at the facility.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nThe facility conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP/PSM rules are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe facility promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  MPU has not had an RMP reportable event (incident) since the inception of the RMP/PSM rules.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe facility truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In additions, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation to both the PSM standard and RMP rule.  On March 26, 2019 employees from all dep"

During this training, a review of the RMP/PSM rules along with safety and emergency response was covered.  This training is conducted annually, and coordinated with the LEPC.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\nOn occasion, the facility hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  The facility has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.  MPU selects contractors after reviewing safety records.  MPU evaluates all contractors during and upon completion of work.\n\n\n\nMPU maintains a policy of escorting and observing contractors while working on chlorine processes.\n\n\n\n4.    Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe facility has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years.  Due to our stringent release policies, no accidental releases have occurred since the inception of the RMP/PSM rules, 1995.\n\n\n\n5.    Emergency Response Plan\n\n\n\nThe facility carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, and notification of local emergency response agencies and the public.\n\n\n\nThe chlorine process is included in the community emergency response plan.  The Manitowoc Fire Department is the first responder to any chlorine emergencies.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the chlorine storage room is monitored by alarm devices.  In the event of a leak, the system sets off both an audible and visual alarm within the filtration plant.\n\n\n\n6.
