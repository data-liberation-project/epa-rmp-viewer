      "SummaryText": "Superior Midstream, LLC, (SM) owns and operates a natural gas liquids recovery facility, the Belmon Gas Processing Plant, in Kay County, Oklahoma. The plant is designed to recover liquid products from natural gas via physical separation, dehydration, refrigeration, and expansion. Petroleum condensates and natural gas liquids are recovered from the inlet pipeline gas.  Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act applies to the Belmon plant because it handles and stores process flammables such as ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, and pentane in excess of threshold quantities.  SPC management is aware of potential hazards posed by processing and storing natural gas and natural gas liquids. Programs are established to prevent accidental releases and train personnel for emergency response in the event of a release.  The Belmon plant is a new facility and has no recordable accidents in the past five years.   \n\nSM has considered the impact of a worst case accident.  In this case, the worst case would be a complete release from the 30,000 gallon NGL storage tank, resulting in instantaneous formation of a vapor cloud which ignites and explodes. Using the EPA's RMP*Comp software version 1.07, the potential radius of impact, due to the explosion, was calculated to extend four-tenths (0.4) of a mile.  Global positioning system (GPS) was utilized to estimate public receptors within a 0.4 mile radius.  The worst case event would affect zero (0) nearby structures, and it was determined that the nearest public receptor is greater than 0.4 miles from the tank.  A consideration of the 0.4 mile radius is incorporated into our notification and emergency response planning.\n\nSM implements safety programs and procedures designed to prevent and mitigate catastrophic releases. Operation, maintenance, training, and inspection procedures are being implemented.  In addition, SM has coordinated with local emergency responders, including the Medford Fire Department and the Kay County Emergency Plannin"
