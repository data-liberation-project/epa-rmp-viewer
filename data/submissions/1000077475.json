      "SummaryText": "May 2019\n\nRisk Management Plan\n\nExecutive Summary\n\n\n\nThe Risk Management Program at the Arclin USA LLC, Springfield, Oregon facility, incorporates a\n\nRisk Management Plan that assimilates the following elements:\n\n\n\nHealth, Safety and Environmental Pledge\n\nArclin is committed to implementing and sustaining a world-class health, safety, and environmentally conscientious workplace culture, built upon the foundation of a well-trained and educated work force.  \n\n\n\nArclin is dedicated to achieving a zero incident workplace and continually reducing its impact on environmental and ecological receptors using management and science-based solutions. We strive at all times to ensure that health and safety of our employees and the community is our first priority. \n\n\n\nThis commitment begins with the top-down accountability and bottom-up communication stretching beyond the Arclin borders from our suppliers to our customers, and our communities. \n\n\n\nWe believe that every employee's responsibility is to perform their duties consistent with the belief that all accidents are preventable. \n\n\n\n\n\nFacility Information;\n\nThe primary activity at the Arclin USA Springfield site is the production of formaldehyde solutions for the production of formaldehyde-based thermosetting resins which are used in engineered wood adhesive applications, such as plywood and OSB. Formaldehyde is produced in a continuous process from methanol. The maximum quantity of formaldehyde stored in one vessel is 50,000 gallons at a concentration of 52% by weight. \n\n\n\nAqua ammonia is used in the resin production process. The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia stored in one vessel is 104,580 lbs at a concentration of 30% by weight. Resins are produced in batch operations and are shipped to customers by truck.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program;\n\nAll RMP covered processes at the Arclin Springfield site are in Program 3 and meet the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program. The existing OSHA P"

      "SummaryText": "SM required accidental release prevention program meets nearly all RMP requirements. Where the programs differ, the Arclin program elements have been modified to incorporate RMP requirements. An example would be that the compliance audit procedures required as part of Arclin's PSM program have been modified to include evaluations of the RMP implementation. Another example would be that Management of Change (MOC) procedures have been modified to incorporate reevaluation of the facility accident scenarios to determine whether the worst case and alternate case scenarios for releases are still consistent with the design and operation of the process being started.\n\n\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History;\n\nThe Arclin, Springfield site, has had no accidental releases of aqua ammonia or formaldehyde in the last five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility nor have there been any accidents which led to off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program;\n\nArclin has established a facility emergency response plan that meets the requirements of both the OSHA PSM program and the EPA RMP program. This response plan describes the procedures for coordinating with local emergency response agencies, provides documentation of proper first-aid and emergency medical treatment for accidental exposures, and outlines procedures for emergency response after a release. Local emergency response and medical treatment personnel have worked with Arclin to provide for the safe control and treatment of releases of formaldehyde and aqua ammonia.\n\n\n\nArclin employees receive training on emergency response procedures and emergency response equipment use. Emergency response procedures are reviewed periodically and are reevaluated as part of the management of change and pre-startup review requirements of the PSM and RMP programs.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety;\n\nPlant safety pe"

      "SummaryText": "rformance and capability relative to approved procedures, standards and practices is reviewed on an ongoing basis and is a primary factor considered in design and installation of all new and improved process equipment. The Arclin Springfield site has and continues to invest in improved technology and automated process control systems to provide enhanced process safety and production unit performance.\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of Changes;\n\nThere have been no significant plant changes over the past 5-years that would modify the worst case or alternate case release scenarios. No changes have been made that increases production capacity or operating temperatures or pressures that could reduce equipment reliability.\n\n"
