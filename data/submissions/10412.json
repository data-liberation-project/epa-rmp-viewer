      "SummaryText": "This Risk Management Plan is for the Beaver Dam Creek Gas Plant operated by Cabot Oil & Gas Corproation (Cabot).  This facility was sold to Cabot by Oryx Energy Company in January 1999.  The facility is located off of Hwy 16 (just before the intersection with Hwy 63) approximately 3 miles down a private lease road.  The only persons allowed to travel down this private road are the land owner (Dinkman & Associates), leasees Cabot Personnel, and members of the Hilltop and Mullins Hunting Clubs.  Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation maintains the lease road and restricts its usage by the general public.  The location of the facility was obtained using a hand-held Garmin 75 GPS unit.\n\n         The Beaver Dam Creek Facility produces crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids.  Natural gas and well fluids (oil & water) are separated using pressure separation vessels.  The gas is routed to a membrane unit where carbon dioxide is removed.  The gas is then compressed and routed to a cold seperator in which natural gas liquids (NGL) are produced.  This step is performed in order to reduce the natural gas heating value to meet pipeline specifications.  The NGL by-product is routed to a pressurized storage tank until transported for sales by a tank truck.  The natural gas is sold by pipeline and the oil and water are stored in on-site atmospheric storage tanks until hauled by tank truck.  The NGL at this facility is classified as a Propane-Butane mix that is predominately propane\n\n     The tank storing the NGL is equipped with a relief valve which vents to the atmosphere and automatically operates according to preset pressure specifications.  Manual shut-off valves are located at the cold separator effluent line and the inlet to the NGL storage tank.\n\n     The worst case release scenario was performed using EPA's RMP*Comp software.  It is company policy not to maintain more than one truck load of NGL in the tank at any one time.  One truck load is approximately 8800 gallons."

      "SummaryText": "Assuming liquid density is approximately 4.23 lb/gal (propane) the maximum amount of NGL at the facility is 37,195.84 lbs.  The estimated distance to a 1 psi overpressure in the event of a vapor cloud explosion of the entire inventory is 0.30 miles.  The area within a 0.30 mile radius of the facility is a privately owned, wooded, non-residential area.  The population within this area is zero.  This is based on information obtained from USGS map entitle Pine Grove, LA and operator knowledge of the area.  The nearest receptor would be a privately-owned hunting camp which is 0.32 miles south of the facility.\n\n     An alternative release scenario is not required for this facility,\n\n     The facility has not experienced an accidential release within the previous 5-years.\n\n     This facility is not required to develop an Emergency Response Plan however Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation has developed a plan for the Beaver Dam Creek Gas Plant which is coordinated with the St. Helena Parish LEPC.  The facility is also listed with the Greensburg Fire Department.  In general the emergency response plan, in the event of an accidental release, provides procedures for facility operators to locate the problem and close the necessary flow valves to and from the storage tank or to shut-in the entire facility.  Should a fire or explosion occur facility operators would contact the local fire department or other specially trained organizations and work with them to respond to the release.\n\n     As an additional safety measure Cabot plans to further restrict public acces to the facility by locking the \"no traspassing\" gate located mid-way down the lease road."
