Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n     At Nalco Chemical Company, we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a \n     safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency \n     response planning to help ensure the protection of the environment, the safety of our employees, and \n     the safety of the general public.  As founding members of the local Community Advisory Group, we \n     firmly believe in that we must consider community concerns when conducting our business.  This \n     document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have \n     designed and implemented to protect the public, including:\n\n     + A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n     + A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental \n        chemical releases\n     + An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n     + A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n     + An overview of our emergency response program\n     + An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases \n        from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n\n2.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n     Nalco Chemical Company is the largest provider of water treatment and process chemicals, services \n     and systems in the world.  Our facility produces these chemicals using a variety of raw materials and \n     process operations.  We use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to \n     cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\n     Toxic Chemicals\n     + Cyclohexylamine is blended with other chemicals to make corrosion inhibitors.\n     + Epichlorohy"

Key Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n     The following are brief summaries of the key offsite consequence analysis scenarios, including \n     information about the key administrative controls and minimization measures to limit the endpoint \n     distances for each scenario:\n\n     Worst-case Release Scenario:  Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n          Our worst-case release scenario involves the rupture of a full, 10,000 gallon rail car of \n     epichlorohydrin and the failure of all active minimization systems.  The spilled material forms a pool in the \n     natural depression near the tracks, and on a warm 970F day, the pool evaporates.  The wind is \n     assumed to be moving slowly through the area at 3.4 mph, which keeps the vapors from rapidly \n     dispersing.  The vapors will affect nearby industrial, commercial, and residential areas, if it is not \n     cleaned up.    \n          However, the area is equipped with two automatic, active minimization systems.  The first system is \n     a remote camera that will alert operators in the control room to a spill or other malfunction in the area.  \n     Switches in the control room can shut down equipment to mitigate releases.  The second system is an \n     area air-monitoring network of sensors that will directly alert the onsite emergency response team in \n     the event of a release.  Immediate action by plant personnel will minimize the impact on the environment \n     and community.  The onsite emergency response team will notify local business"
