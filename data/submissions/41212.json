      "SummaryText": "This Risk Management Plan covers the Pilgrim's Pride Corporation's Mt. Pleasant, Texas Water Reclamation facility.  The facility's chlorine injection system is a standard injection system using ton cylinders of chlorine.  The amount of chlorine stored on site is above the EPA threshold reporting quantity of 2500 pounds.  Because chlorine is listed by both the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a hazardous chemical, our accidental release prevention policy is designed to comply with the Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations of these two agencies.  These regulations are designed to prevent the accidental release of chlorine and minimize negative consequences in the event that a release should occur.\n\nAn offsite consequence analysis was performed for this site, including consideration of two chlorine release scenarios identified as \"worst case release\" and \"alternate release scenario\".  The worst case scenario, as defined by the EPA, states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the ? maximum quantity in the largest vessel ? is released as a gas over 10 minutes, due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative release scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario\".\n\nThe worst-case release scenario involves a failure of one of the ton cylinders full of chlorine.  The computer program, RMP*Comp, was used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint.  The toxic cloud formed by the chlorine would reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.  This scenario was performed using pre-defined conditions by the EPA, namely release of the entire amount as a gas in 10 minutes, use of the one-hour average ERPG-2 (Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2) as the toxic endpoint, and consideration of the population residing within a full circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance.

      "SummaryText": "ted meteorological conditions used for this scenario were Atmospheric Stability Class F, wind speed of 1.5 m/sec, highest daily maximum temperature (77? F), and average humidity (50%).  \n\nThe EPA set these conditions to facilitate the performance of the offsite consequence analysis; however, the assumptions used may be unrealistic because:\n\n1. Requirement to compare a 10-minute release to a one-hour average standard.\n\n2. Only the population within an elliptical plume extending downwind of the release point is potentially affected.  This plume area, or footprint, is approximately 6% of the area of the full circle.\n\n3. Worst case weather conditions are extremely uncommon.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the release of chlorine due to a leak at the cylinder valve.  The scenario, by definition, is \"more likely to occur\" than the worst case scenario and must reach an endpoint off site using the typical meteorological conditions of Atmospheric Stability Class D, wind speed of 3.0 m/s, average air temperature of 77?F and 50% average humidity.  The scenario we chose to evaluate does reach offsite endpoints and a public road.\n\nPilgrims Pride Corporation's accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n?Hands-on and classroom training \n?Preventative maintenance program\n?Operating procedures\n?Performance of a process hazard analysis of the entire system including equipment and piping\n?Design and implementation of an auditing and inspection program\n?Procedure for handling all changes to the system\n?Pre-Startup review procedures for significant system modifications\n?Up-to-date process safety information\n?Procedures for investigating release incidents or near-misses\n?Hot-work permits for work on or near the process\n?Line Break procedures\n\nThis program was developed with the participation of Pilgrims Pride Corporation Water Reclamation partners.

      "SummaryText": "prevention steps include availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) and respirators for the partners' use, and awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine.  We also give some of our partners HAZMAT training on an annual basis.\n\nIn accordance with the PSM and RMP regulations, the Company performs periodical audits and hazard reviews to enhance continued safe performance.  Several recommended actions to improve safety were identified during these audits and reviews and are tracked on a monthly basis for timely completion as required.\n\nThe Pilgrim's Pride Mt. Pleasant facility has an emergency response program.  This program includes an emergency response notification plan, Emergency response drills and drill evaluations are conducted annually; emergency operation and response procedures are also reviewed at that time.\n\nPilgrim's Pride Corporation is the second largest poultry producer in the United States; the third largest in chicken and the fifth largest in turkey, and the second largest chicken company in Mexico.  Pilgrims Pride Corporation employs more than 24,500 partners and operates processing and further processing plants, distribution center, hatcheries and feed mills in Texas, Arkansas, Arizona, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia and Mexico.  Products are sold to foodservice, retail and frozen entree customers.  The Company's primary distribution is through retailers and restaurants throughout the United States and in the Northern and Central regions of Mexico and to the foodservice industry nation-wide in both countries."
