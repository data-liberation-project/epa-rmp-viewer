This commitment to safe and environmentally sound operations is documented in the Team\n\nMember Handbook, and the mission statement, which are available to all employees.

Description of the Garden City, GA Facility\n\nThe Garden City, GA facility is located at 5565 Export Blvd. Garden City, GA 31408. The facility provides\n\ntransportation and public warehousing services for manufacturers, distributors and end users of prepackaged\n\nspecialty chemicals. Warehousing activities include shipping, receiving and storage of chemicals as\n\nspecified by customer requirements. The chemicals stored at the Garden City, GA Warehouse include\n\nchemicals containing toxic hazards. Ammonium Hydroxide (Ammonia anhydrous) is the only RMP regulated substance handled at the site.\n\n1.2.2. Description of the Warehousing and Storage Processes\n\nRinchem receives Ammonium Hydroxide (Ammonia anhydrous) by truck as shipped from the manufacturer or distributor. It is unloaded from the truck using a forklift and staged for inspection. After the material passes quality and safety inspection, it is placed into the hazard specific storage area until it is shipped to the end user. The storage location of each material is tracked in an electronic inventory management system.\n\nAfter an order is received, Rinchem ships the above listed chemical as ordered by the end us"

After the material passes inspection, it is\n\nloaded on to a truck for shipment using a forklift.\n\n1.3. Worst-Case Release Scenario\n\nWell-documented offsite consequence analyses are essential to adequate communication of potential\n\nhazards at the Rinchem Garden City, GA Warehouse. Rinchem conducted an offsite consequence analysis,\n\nusing the EPA's Areal Location of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA),RMPcomp in conjunction with the rules\n\nspecified in 40 CFR 68.25 to estimate the offsite consequence of a Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) from our\n\nwarehousing process. The WCS associated with toxic substances in the Garden City, GA warehouse is a\n\ncatastrophic failure of the single largest container resulting in a release of the total contents, 330 gallons of Ammonium Hydroxide (Ammonia anhydrous). The passive mitigation measures taken into account for this scenario is the limited quantity of chemical that can be released due to container and the handling of containers within the building.\n\n1.4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nRinchem management realizes that implementation of appropriate administrative and technological\n\nsafeguards ensure the safety of the workers and the continued safety of public receptors. Those\n\nrecommendations that are planned for implementation will be discussed in \"Planned Changes to Improve\n\nSafety\". The safeguards shown in Table A-1 include both administrative and technological safeguards that\n\nprevent, detect, or mitigate releases.\n\n1.5. The Five Year Accident History\n\nThere has never been a reportable accident involving Ammonium Hydroxide (Ammonia anhydrous) or any other chemical at the Rinchem Company Inc, Garden City, GA Warehouse.\n\n1.6. The Emergency Response Program\n\nOverall safety at the Rinchem Company, Inc, Garden City, GA Warehouse is governed not only by our ability to\n\nprevent accidental releases of Ammonium Hydro"

Rinchem has developed an emergency response program to minimize the effects of accidental releases of Ammonium Hydroxide (Ammonia anhydrous)  to employees (vapordispersion modeling demonstrates no impact public receptors). Rinchem management has opted to respond to releases of these chemicals by containing the spill when it can be safely done and using contracted services for spill cleanup.\n\nThe Garden City, GA Warehouse Emergency Response Program consists of:\n\nEmergency Action Plan and Hazardous Waste Contingency Plan\n\nChemical Exposure and Chemical Spill Cleanup Procedure\n\nEmergency Evacuation Plan\n\nThe Emergency Response Program outlines the instructions and required information in order to respond to\n\nfire, chemical spills, natural disasters and other emergencies that may arise.
