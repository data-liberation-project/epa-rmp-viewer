Hercules, Incorporated still, owns and operates the Kenedy Texas plant under the name Ashland Specialty Ingredients (ASI).  The guar manufacturing facility is located at One Mill Street, Kenedy, Karnes County, Texas.  The plant processes include bulk storage of guar splits, alteration by chemical addition, and grinding.  Propylene oxide is stored in a bulk storage tank, with tanker truck deliveries on approximately a bi-weekly schedule.  The Risk Management Plan has been developed in accordance with Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions under 40 CFR part 68.\r\n\r\nThe Kenedy Plant uses Propylene Oxide above the threshold and is subject to Program 3 requirements.  Propylene Oxide is a listed regulated substance used in the P80 process..  RMP regulations define a Program 3 process to be one that has the potential for off-site impacts from a release and is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program or is classified in one of nine Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes.\r\n\r\nThe Offsite Consequences Analysis\r\n\r\nThe population estimates are very conservative (the numbers are likely much higher than actually existed in the year 2010 - U.S. Census).  MARPLOT is used to calculate the population within the area plotted by ALOHA.  The 2010 Census data shows population for the City of Kenedy is 3296.  The 2014 RMP update uses the ALOHA program to calculate distance to the Toxic End Point for the worst case and alternative case scenarios.  The 2014 uses urban/forest to allow for the buildings located in the City of Kenedy located just to the north west of the plant.   \r\nThe Accidental Release and Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nASI is dedicated to providing a safe and healthful environment for employees, customers, and communities.  The ASI facility remains an OSHA VPP Star site.  This facility complies with all applicable federal, state, and loc"

The unloading hoses are not pressurized, other than to equalize pressure between the tank and the truck during the unloading process.  Hoses are checked for leaks prior to unloading by visual inspection and pressure testing.  Certified operators are trained to familiarize themselves with the emergency shut off system associated with the dedicated propylene oxide trucks which would stop a discharge should something occur.  \r\nUnloading procedures for the propylene oxide are in place to assure all emergency equipment is functional prior to unloading and that the pumps and systems are leak free.  Carriers have dedicated propylene oxide trailers that have manual shut off valves, excess flow valves, and other emergency shutoff devices that can be activated on the way out of the area to stop the flow.  \r\n\r\nAll operators are certified in the unloading operation and are required to stay within 25 feet of the truck while unloading is taking place.\r\n\r\nThe five-year Accident History\r\n\r\nOne minor accidental release occurred on October 9, 2011.  The gasket on the hand way slipped out of place on the PO weigh tank releasing approximately 15 pounds of propylene oxide.   There were no off-site impacts.  The flow of product was stopped, building was evacuated, and onsite emergency response team was contacted.  All action from root cause analysis have been completed.\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nASI communicates regularly with the community responders and plant employees participate in the Local Emergency Planning Committee.  In the event of an emergency involving the propylene oxide system, it is our policy to notify the Sheriff's Office through which emergency responders can be activated.  Preplanning has been completed.  Emergency drills are performed regularly.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nThis facility is in"

Detailed emergency plans are in place at the plant.  HAZMAT recertification is conducted annually and annual drills are held to involve the entire plant.  \r\n\r\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\r\n\r\nPropylene oxide is handled in the bulk chemical storage and unloading area.  Typically, propylene oxide is delivered to the plant biweekly in tanker trucks which carry approximately 44,000 pounds each.  The truck is parked in the unloading area using procedures that assure the chemical holding portion of the truck is within the protected area.  The protected area has a trench around the perimeter, which is intended to catch any releases of propylene oxide.  The trench drains to a concrete lined neutralization pit where it can be pumped to another container or otherwise controlled.\r\n\r\nThe truck is hooked up to the unloading system using dry disconnect, 2-inch, stainless steel wire wrapped, flex hoses.  Dry disconnect fittings prevent release of chemical as the hoses are connected and disconnected.  Propylene oxide is pumped from the truck to the holding tank through stainless steel pipe.  All vapor associated with the unloading procedure is vented back to the truck with no release to the atmosphere.  A pressure relieving system is in place to release pressure in unloading lines to a scrubber.   The tank sits within a concrete containment dike which is inspected annually.  Sensors are located within the unloading and storage areas that will activate automatic shutoff valves at the tank and shut down unloading and distribution pumps in case of leaks.  These sensors as well as other equipment are calibrated on a regular basis.\r\n\r\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe propylene oxide system complies with EPA's Accidental Release Preventio"
